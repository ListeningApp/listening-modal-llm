        "content": "hjzj | Then, the growing middle classes - in populous jurisdictions possessing large numbers of eighteen to twenty-four-year-olds and rising GDP but insufficient domestic provision, started sending their children overseas for fee-paying university education. From nineteen ninety onwards, Australia, Canada, the UK and the US in particular benefited to such an extent that international education was seen as an export sector in its own right. In Australia, it is the country's third-largest form of export and, in the State of Victoria, it is the largest.\nj79f | In turn, international rankings arrived to inform choice and add the overlay of a prestige market, spurring competition and investment in reputation. By and large over this period there has also been social consensus that research in universities should be publicly funded because, left on its own, the market will likely fail to supply the fundamental or pure research on which the development of technology relies and through which much wealth is generated.\n6tbv | So, the combination of human capital theory, equality of opportunity, the emergence of an export industry and the need for research combined to create a Golden Age of expansion and esteem.\nxb13 | That period is now drawing to a close as a new set of factors have come together.\ncxqi | Attainment rates of bachelor degrees in the young population are reaching fifty percent in some jurisdictions. One consequence is a degree's decreasing earnings premium; even a negative premium in some instances. In the UK, it is estimated that one-fifth of degrees are not worth the money in terms of future earnings; these students would have been financially better off if they had not gone to university. In a twenty twenty survey on attitudes to higher education conducted in eleven jurisdictions revealed that sixty-one percent of respondents said a degree is less valuable than ten years ago. In the UK, only forty-four percent thought that the benefits of going to university outweighed the expense, although the eleven-country average was fifty-six percent.\nqfmx | A perceived decreasing return on education is coinciding with rising tuition fees and spiraling student debt. In many jurisdictions, tuition fees have risen well above the rate of inflation. University administration has been relatively inefficient, driving up costs. There has been in some places a student amenities 'arms race' to provide the most-inviting campus experience. And the drive for international rankings, based largely on research performance and reputation, has made tuition fees an irresistible source of funds for research. As many university presidents know, if there is an insatiable appetite for funds on this planet, it is in research!\nrut3 | Student debt in the US tripled between two thousand one and two thousand sixteen and has begun to undermine the equality of opportunity argument. Poorer students cannot pay fees up front, nor can they get on in the world because they are repaying their tuition debt.\nm3cp | This takes us to a fundamental economic problem which confronts higher education. Along with some other personal services sectors, in particular healthcare and legal services. Usually known as Baumol Cost Disease, universities need to pay salaries to attract and retain sufficient talent, but they are running out of productivity gains under their current operating model. Many have reached the point where having more students in a class, reducing the number of small groups and limiting subject choice are meeting consumer resistance.\nmq4s | An OECD report in June twenty twenty showed that in thirteen selected countries and territories, expenditure per student doubled in higher education after allowing for inflation between nineteen ninety-five and twenty fifteen. This is total expenditure, irrespective of the mix between government and student funding. Some of it may be attributable to administrative bloat and amenities arms races. Some might also be due to more demanding or less academically ready students. But most of it is simply to pay salary costs.\n95el | The problem lies in the inability to scale up under the current, largely face-to-face, model of higher education and the organizational culture that surrounds it.\na0a5 | This is not, in theory, a problem if society is willing to pay for it all and productivity is rising in other parts of their economy to create the wealth. However, the gloss has come off universities and there is unwillingness by anyone to pay any more than they do now.\ngocl | The problem lies in the inability to scale up under the current, largely face-to-face, model of higher education and the organizational culture that surrounds it.\nob1z | The gloss has come off with employers. As economic change has sped up, industry has increasingly called for job-ready graduates rather than have to train them in-house; and the expectations of graduates by employers are being disappointed. Many employers say they are looking primarily for things that universities do not directly teach, such as social skills, emotional intelligence, teamwork, communication and time management.\nm4cb | The gloss has come off with governments. Aging populations and the politics of healthcare are a powerful competitor for public funds, and votes. Cuts in public funding for universities have been experienced in many jurisdictions, partly offset by rises in student fees which have compounded the graduate debt problem.\nm61y | And the gloss has come off amongst some of those who have ardently supported higher education as a force for good and value for money. If it is so good for equity, why is income and wealth inequality rising? If students are paying all this money, why do they mainly see adjunct teachers, and not tenured faculty members?\nu2ob | Parents want their children to go to university, but they can't afford a plumber because skills training and apprenticeships have been displaced by higher education expansion. Has post-secondary education become unbalanced between higher and vocational forms of it? In a possible sign of the times, the UK government in July twenty twenty said it was dropping the previous government's target of fifty percent of young people going to university.\n2gnm | The Baumol Cost Disease problem has been catching up with universities, but those who pay for them are less and less willing to pay more. Universities have been running out of road and we are going past the equilibrium point, where human aspiration and economic reality balance each other.\nemgw | But there are other, more-disruptive forces in play which suggest a bleaker future for traditional institutions that do not transform.\nxaqt | The digital revolution is bringing new entrant competitors, particularly in the form of more affordable online education. Depending on the region of the world, e-learning is expected to enjoy a compound annual growth rate of seven point five to ten point five percent between twenty eighteen and twenty twenty-four. Many traditional universities are organizationally unable, or culturally unwilling, to participate in this and some competitors are becoming stronger and stronger.\n5rcb | Disruption is under way\n524j | The ability to transform will be the critical one for all education institutions to cultivate, so they can shape and respond to a changing world of education.\nxd3m | The story of universities in the previous section required generalization. Some jurisdictions will continue to support higher education more than others. Some institutions in those jurisdictions will be more successful than others because of hard work, inheritance, location or good fortune.\n8qb6 | There are, however, some major drivers of global change affecting us all and from which no institution could be completely immune. The fourth industrial revolution, a fusion of exponential technologies where silicon and carbon meet, will prove to be as profound as the previous revolutions driven by steam, electricity and computing.\nwkbn | Each of the earlier revolutions was accompanied by changes in the mode of education and the institutions that provided it. The school classroom, the worker's institute, the civic, technological and research university, can all be matched with the economic and social needs of their times. There is no reason to expect that the new revolution will be different, but we are at the early stages of thinking about the corresponding changes needed in education. In the view of this report's author, the ability to transform will be the critical one for all education institutions to cultivate, so they can shape and respond to a changing world of education.",
