The final pair of statements was \"The experimenter that (a) we believe that people cannot feel happy and ent sal sad at the same time, or (b) we believe that people can feel happy and sad at the same time.\" We discarded the data from the two subjects who answered incorrectly, leaving nineteen subjects in the bipolarity hypothesis-bittersweet clip condition.\n893y | To ensure that the question of mixed emotions would be com- parably salient for subjects in the no-hypothesis-control clip con- dition, the experimenter told these subjects that a peripheral aim of the study involved mixed emotions. The experimenter also indi- cated, however, that we were indifferent about the results:\nfavz | Some evidence indicates that emotions can also affect language com- prehension, so we also need to keep track of how you're feeling during the film. We've also realized that the current study allows us to settle a debate that other psychologists have been having. Some researchers think that people can feel happy and sad at the same time; others think people cannot feel happy and sad at the same time. We really don't care one way or the other, but this study will allow us to find out.\n7szx | After the continuous ESG instructions, the experimenter said,\nhx9e | As I mentioned a moment ago, some researchers think people can feel happy and sad at the same time, but others think that people cannot. We don't care either way, so we'll let the data decide. So if you ever feel both happy and sad at the same time during the movie, then move into the interior of the grid, the portion that indicates that you're feeling both happy and sad to some degree.\nywn2 | These subjects then watched the control clip.\na63r | Results and discussion. To assess whether the two groups reported different amounts of mixed emotions, we computed the minimum of each subject's happiness and sadness ratings during each moment of the clip. A Mann-Whitney test on the MIN data revealed that subjects in the bipolarity hypothesis-bittersweet clip condition reported more intense mixed emotions M D N equals zero point one nine than those in the no-hypothesis-control clip condition M D N zero point zero six; U equals seventy-three point zero, Z equals two point six four, P S _ E S T equals point two zero, P equals point zero zero eight. Thus, subjects who watched the bittersweet clip reported more intense mixed emotions even though we explicitly told them that we thought people could not feel happy and sad at the same time. In addition\ndqvj | to providing additional evidence against the vacillation hypothesis, these results provide evidence against the notion that subjects in earlier studies reported mixed emotions only because they thought the researchers expected them to.\nr17u | Study Three: Lay Theories of Mixed Emotions\n3c47 | Study Two helped rule out the notion that prior evidence for mixed emotions is a result of subjects' beliefs about the experimenters' expectations, but no studies of mixed emotions have addressed the role of the expectations that subjects have before entering the laboratory. Most undergraduates think that people can feel happy and sad at the same time, but lay theories about emotion can be inaccurate. For instance, most people think that women are more emotional than men, but experience sampling studies reveals little evidence for gender differences in emotional experience. In the case of mixed emotions, people's lay theories may lead them to think they are experiencing simultaneously mixed emotions even when they are not. We investigated this possibility in Study Three by conducting another test of the vacillation hypothesis and including a group of subjects who did not hold the lay theory that happiness and sadness can co- occur.\ng345 | Method. Two weeks before data collection began, six hundred thirty-one introductory psychology students at Texas Tech University completed a mass survey. One questionnaire contained the question \"Do you think people can feel happy and sad at the same time?\" embedded among five similar questions (e.g., \"Do you think dreams can provide insight into your unconscious mind?\"). Subjects responded to each question by selecting \"yes,\" \"no,\" or \"I don't know.\" Subjects who thought people could experience mixed emotions were classified as endorsers N equals five hundred forty; eighty-six percent. Those who did not know N equals sixty-five; ten percent and who did not think so N equals twenty-six; four percent were classified as nonendorsers.\nsvhz | A subset of endorsers and nonendorsers N equals fifty-two; twenty-five women; forty-eight were invited to participate. Data from an additional endorser were removed because she did not know she could press both buttons.\noaen | The subject pool contained few nonendorsers, and we thought it unlikely that they would report mixed emotions after watching the control clip, so all nonendorsers N equals twenty-eight watched the bittersweet clip; all endorsers N equals twenty-four watched the control clip. As in Study Two, this intentional confound provided a stronger test of mixed emotions. The procedure was otherwise identical to that of Study One A, in which subjects completed the button press measures.\n5u67 | Results and discussion. As in Study One A, we quantified mixed emotions by measuring the total amount of time that subjects pressed both buttons after excluding those episodes that lasted less than one second. Though the median subject in both groups reported no mixed emotions, a Mann-Whitney test revealed that nonendorsers, all of whom watched the bittersweet clip, reported more mixed emotions M R a n k equals thirty point zero than endorsers, all of whom watched the control clip M R a n k equals twenty-two point six. U equals two hundred forty-one point five, Z equals one point nine eight, P S _ E S T equals point three six, P equals point zero four eight.\ndvms | These results indicate that even people who did not know whether (or did not think that) people can feel happy and sad at the same time reported more simultaneously mixed emotions while\nqrd3 | watching the bittersweet clip than people who watched the control clip. The results do not imply that lay theories have no effect on self-reported emotions, but they do make it difficult to attribute available evidence for mixed emotions to the belief that people can experience mixed emotions.\n```",
