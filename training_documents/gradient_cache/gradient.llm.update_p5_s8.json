        "content": "ie7i | where the Jacobian of F with respect to W evaluated at the point is, and the Jacobian of F with respect to X. The Jacobian of a vector function is a matrix containing the partial derivatives of all the outputs with respect to all the inputs. The first equation computes some terms of the gradient of EP, while the second equation generates a backward recurrence, as in the well-known backpropagation procedure for NN's. We can average the gradients over the training patterns to obtain the full gradient. It is interesting to note that in many instances there is no need to explicitly compute the Jacobian matrix. The above formula uses the product of the Jacobian with a vector of partial derivatives, and it is often easier to compute this product directly without computing the Jacobian beforehand. In analogy with ordinary multilayer\naksw | NN's, all but the last module are called hidden layers because their outputs are not observable from the outside. In more complex situations than the simple cascade of modules described above, the partial derivative notation becomes somewhat ambiguous and awkward. A completely rigorous derivation in more general cases can be done using Lagrange functions.\n0fsl | Traditional multilayer NN's are a special case of the above where the state information is represented with fixed-sized vectors, and where the modules are alternated layers of matrix multiplications (the weights) and component-wise sigmoid functions (the neurons). However, as stated earlier, the state information in complex recognition system is best represented by graphs with numerical information attached to the arcs. In this case, each module, called a GT, takes one or more graphs as input and produces a graph as output. Networks of such modules are called GTN's. Sections Four, Six, and Eight develop the concept of GTN's and show that gradient-based learning can be used to train all the parameters in all the modules so as to minimize a global loss function. It may seem paradoxical that gradients can be computed when the state information is represented by essentially discrete objects such as graphs, but that difficulty can be circumvented, as shown later.\n0m3g | Two. Convolutional Neural Networks for Isolated Character Recognition\n9sp0 | The ability of multilayer networks trained with gradient descent to learn complex, high-dimensional, nonlinear mappings from large collections of examples makes them obvious candidates for image recognition tasks. In the traditional model of pattern recognition, a hand-designed feature extractor gathers relevant information from the input and eliminates irrelevant variabilities. A trainable classifier then categorizes the resulting feature vectors into classes. In this scheme, standard, fully connected multilayer networks can be used as classifiers. A potentially more interesting scheme is to rely as much as possible on learning in the feature extractor itself. In the case of character recognition, a network could be fed with almost raw inputs (e.g., size-normalized images). While this can be done with an ordinary fully connected feedforward network with some success for tasks such as character recognition, there are problems.\nnbpk | First, typical images are large, often with several hundred variables (pixels). A fully connected first layer with, e.g., one hundred hidden units in the first layer would already contain several tens of thousands of weights. Such a large number of parameters increases the capacity of the system and therefore requires a larger training set. In addition, the memory requirement to store so many weights may rule out certain hardware implementations. But the main deficiency of unstructured nets for image or speech applications is that they have no built-in invariance with respect to translations or local distortions of the inputs. Before being sent to the fixed-size input layer of an NN, character images,\nxs3r | or other two-D or one-dimensional signals, must be approximately size normalized and centered in the input field. Unfortunately, no such preprocessing can be perfect: handwriting is often normalized at the word level, which can cause size, slant, and position variations for individual characters. This, combined with variability in writing style, will cause variations in the position of distinctive features in input objects. In principle, a fully connected network of sufficient size could learn to produce outputs that are invariant with respect to such variations. However, learning such a task would probably result in multiple units with similar weight patterns positioned at various locations in the input so as to detect distinctive features wherever they appear on the input. Learning these weight configurations requires a very large number of training instances to cover the space of possible variations. In convolutional networks, as described below, shift invariance is automatically obtained by forcing the replication of weight configurations across space.\nffuj | Secondly, a deficiency of fully connected architectures is that the topology of the input is entirely ignored. The input variables can be presented in any fixed order without affecting the outcome of the training. On the contrary, images have a strong two-D local structure: variables that are spatially or temporally nearby are highly correlated. Local correlations are the reasons for the well-known advantages of extracting and combining local features before recognizing spatial or temporal objects, because configurations of neighboring variables can be classified into a small number of categories (e.g., edges, corners, etc.). Convolutional networks force the extraction of local features by restricting the receptive fields of hidden units to be local.\nh7f6 | A. Convolutional Networks\nt74k | Convolutional networks combine three architectural ideas to ensure some degree of shift, scale, and distortion invariance: one, local receptive fields; two, shared weights (or weight replication); and three, spatial or temporal subsampling. A typical convolutional network for recognizing characters, dubbed LeNetFive, is shown in figure two. The input plane receives images of characters that are approximately size normalized and centered. Each unit in a layer receives inputs from a set of units located in a small neighborhood",
