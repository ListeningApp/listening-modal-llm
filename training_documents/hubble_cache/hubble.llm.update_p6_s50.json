The numerical results are summarized in Table one.\nccmb | Some key observations are as follows:\nma93 | (i) The constraints on the deceleration parameter Q clearly indicate that the astronomical observations of H of Z and SNe Ia predict the cosmic acceleration within the framework of power-law cosmology. Thus, power-law cosmological models are viable for describing the observed accelerating nature of the Universe.\nc6hh | (ii) We see that the estimates of the Hubble constant in power-law cosmology are in close agreement with independent investigations of H naught carried out in literature as discussed in Section one.\ny7ea | (iii) The derived best-fitting model fits well to the observational data points from H of Z and SNe Ia observations.\nnav4 | (iv) The primordial nucleosynthesis demands a decelerating expansion of the Universe with smaller values of the Hubble constant.\ngem8 | (v) The statefinder analysis shows that power-law cosmological models approach the standard Lambda C D M model in future with varying values of Q.\ne8nr | We see that the power-law cosmology turns out viable in the description of the acceleration of present-day Universe when subjected to recent observations of H of Z and SNe Ia. Also, the Hubble constant within the framework of power-law cosmology falls in the range of observations. However, the power-law cosmology fails to produce primordial nucleosynthesis with the values of Q and H naught estimated from observational data of H of Z and SNe Ia as discussed in Section six. Moreover, because of the constant value of deceleration parameter Q in power-law cosmology, it fails to provide time or redshift based transition of the Universe from deceleration to acceleration. Thus, one has to use different values of Q for the description of the Universe at different epochs. Finally, despite having several useful features, the power-law cosmology is not a complete package for cosmological purposes.",
