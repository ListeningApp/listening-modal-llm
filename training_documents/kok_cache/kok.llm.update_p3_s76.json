        "content": "4jmz | experimental data we quantitatively assess: whether the change of Gamma star divided by C sub c and the decrease of Phi sub two with increasing I sub abs could explain, in part, the Kok effect; if so, what the relative contribution of the two components is in determining the Kok effect; and what the maximum real inhibition of R sub d by light is. We demonstrate that our results help to identify common threads explaining seemingly contradictory findings among previous studies on\nb7cq | R sub d. Materials and Methods\n0b39 | Plant materials and measurements\nqecd | Plants of sunflower (Helianthus annuus, cv 'Sunspot') were grown in pots in a growth chamber (day: night temperature, twenty-five : twenty degrees Celsius; relative humidity, seventy percent; photon flux density, approximately five hundred micromole per meter squared per second at the soil level; photoperiod, sixteen hours, zero six hundred to twenty-two hundred hours) in Wageningen. Five seeds were sown and seedlings were thinned to one plant per seven-liter pot. Initial amounts of soil nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) were zero point sixty-two, zero point eighty-three, and one point zero four grams per pot, respectively. Nutrient solution was added two or three times per week based on the expected plant growth. Seeds were sown weekly for four weeks, creating four replications. Measurements were conducted on the eleventh or twelfth fully expanded leaf counting from the bottom, using one plant per replication.\n1o7p | An open gas exchange system (Li-Cor sixty-eight hundred; Li-Cor Incorporated, Lincoln, Nebraska, U S A) and an integrated fluorescence chamber head of six centimeters squared were used for three sets of measurements, in which various O sub two or CO sub two concentrations or various temperatures were used to create different amounts of photorespiration (Table one). The first set used five O sub two concentrations. Four cylinders containing different mixtures of O sub two and N sub two were used. Gas from the cylinder was supplied to the Li-Cor sixty-eight hundred where CO sub two was blended with O sub two. For the second set, five different ambient CO sub two (Ca)\ncp13 | concentrations in the leaf chamber were used (Table one). For the third set, four leaf temperatures were used (Table one). A flow rate of two hundred micromole per second was used, and leaf-to-air vapor pressure difference was maintained within zero point eight to one point six kilopascals, for all measurements.\nbgre | For a given O sub two, CO sub two or temperature, a photosynthetic response curve to incident irradiance A minus I sub inc was measured. Leaves were first acclimated under eighty micromole per meter squared per second until A reached a steady state, which took approximately forty-five minutes. Measurements were then undertaken using a sequence of eighty, seventy, sixty, fifty, forty, thirty, twenty-five, twenty, fifteen, ten, and five micromole per meter squared per second, with six minutes for each step. For measurements in each of the first two sets, O sub two or CO sub two concentrations were chosen randomly. Measurements of the temperature set were conducted after the O sub two and CO sub two sets to avoid possible after-effects of high temperature on leaves. For the same reason, the four temperatures were set up from low to high rather than randomly.\n57lp | After the measurements for A minus I sub inc curves, A minus C sub i curves were determined to provide extra data to estimate g sub m. Leaves were adapted to an I sub inc of one hundred micromole per meter squared per second at twenty-five degrees Celsius and twenty-one percent O sub two until A became stable, and curves were measured using a C sub a sequence of four hundred, two hundred, one hundred, seventy-five, fifty, four hundred, four hundred, five hundred fifty, eight hundred and fifteen hundred micromole per mole, with three minutes per step. Apparent A minus C sub i curves were also assessed with heat-killed leaves, which showed that CO sub two leakage was negligible during our measurement using the Li-Cor sixty-eight hundred.\nukth | For each step of either the A minus I sub inc or A minus C sub i curve, PSII photochemical operating efficiency Phi sub two was determined by Chl fluorescence as one minus F sub s divided by F sub m prime, where F sub s is the steady-state fluores- cence and F sub m prime is the maximum fluorescence as revealed using the single flash of approximately eighty-five hundred micromole per meter squared per second for a duration of one point zero seconds. We did not use the multiphase method to determine F sub m prime because all measurements were undertaken at low irradiances.",
