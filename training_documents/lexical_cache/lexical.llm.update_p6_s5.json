        "content": "zse6 | Over nearly fifty years, however, perceptual studies have elaborated but not fundamentally altered the early claims concerning the suprasegmental dimensions involved. Syllables are perceived to be stressed if they exhibit F zero excursion, whereby the timing of the F zero movement within the syllable can be crucial for determining stress perception, and some types of F zero movement may require more excursion than others. Greater syllable duration is likewise associated with perceived stress. These two factors are the most strongly related and the least controversial.\np2n3 | More controversial is the common finding that amplitude manipulations only weakly affect stress perception (despite psychoacoustic research showing that quite small changes in this dimension are indeed perceptible). Turk and Sawusch found listeners' perception of duration and amplitude variation to be non-orthogonal; importantly, they observed effects of irrelevant durational variation on judgments of loudness to be greater than effects of amplitude variation on judgments of relative length. This, they argued, provided a rationale for why prominence judgments should be based on duration, or on duration and amplitude together, but not on the latter alone.\nohh7 | Beckman proposed that a measure of total amplitude (across a syllable) could capture effects on stress judgments, but as pointed out by Sluijter, van Heuven, and Pacilly, such a measure is inevitably confounded with syllable duration. An indirect amplitude effect may however exist, in the factor which Sluijter and van Heuven termed spectral balance; stressed vowels have more energy in the higher frequency regions of the spectrum than unstressed vowels do. A linear discriminant analysis of their measurement data suggested that the most reliable correlate of the presence of stress was durational lengthening, with this spectral balance effect next in importance; overall amplitude had the usual weak impact on the analysis. A perceptual study of the spectral balance effect by Sluijter et al. showed that manipulations of this factor had a moderate effect when speech was presented to listeners over headphones, but a greatly increased effect when the speech was presented via loudspeakers! Sluijter et al. concluded that spectral balance directly reflects articulatory effort, in rehabil- itation of the claim that perceived loudness is the most reliable cue to stress.\nvbni | Two hundred seventy Anne Cutler\ndgcw | Campbell and Beckman, however, failed to replicate the acoustic effect in English; they found spectral differences as a function of focal accent, but not as a function of lexical stress in the absence of accentual variation; this would therefore rule out analogous perceptual effects in English. On this issue, the last word may not yet be spoken.\ngvwz | Eleven point two. Language-Specificity of Stress and Its Perceptual Consequences\nsk5m | Eleven point two point one. Stress in phonological systems\nqws8 | The empirical evidence summarized in Section eleven point one was taken exclusively from studies of West Germanic languages. The evidence is similar across languages because the stress systems of these closely related languages are, although not identical, quite similar. However, Germanic languages do not serve as a yardstick for languages across the world. First, stress characterizes the word-level phonology of only a subset of the world's languages. Second, there is considerable variation in word stress patterning even within stress languages, most obviously in the contrast between freely varying (as in the Germanic languages) and fixed-stress placement. Fixed-stress systems are considered in more detail below.\n877u | Little acoustic and perceptual evidence exists for non-Germanic free-stress languages. Measurements of segmentally matched stressed and unstressed syllables in Arabic by de Jong and Zawaydeh revealed duration and F zero correlates \"remarkably like\" the results reported for English. In Spanish, stress is perceived if cued by F zero and duration or by F zero and amplitude, but not by any one cue alone; syllable weight and lexical analogy also affect stress perception. Williams' experiments on synthesized Welsh minimal stress pairs found strong effects of duration on listeners' stress judgments, but inconsistent effects of F zero. In Thai (a tone language), stress is signaled effectively by duration alone. It should be noted that some forms of English can also show other patterning than that described in Section eleven point one. For instance, in Indian English and Welsh English F zero movement can be decoupled from stress; in each case this can induce stress misperceptions by speakers of other varieties of English, who may for instance be led by F zero peaks or movements on unstressed syllables to judge those syllables as stressed.\nrzhj | In general, stress realization (and its perceptual reflection) will be dependent on other features of a language's phonological system. As Potisuk et al. point out, F zero does not vary as a function of stress in Thai because of its preemption by the tone system. Shen also observed that prominence in Mandarin is signaled by means other than F zero. And just as tone preempts F zero, so quantity distinctions in the segmental system render durational variation less useful for other purposes such as signaling stress. Berinstein found that speakers of Mayan languages with fixed final stress could learn to use duration variation as a position-independent cue to stress judgment, producing similar performance to\nbfax | Lexical Stress two hundred seventy-one\nf2y8 | speakers of English, but only if their language did not have vowel quantity distinctions - i.e., only if their language had not already preempted durational variation as a cue to something other than stress.\no7qm | Eleven point two point two. Culminative vs. demarcative functions of stress\nd52l | Lexical stress variation has the word as its domain. In each word, only one syllable bears primary stress (although a few languages may not conform to this generalization; thus stress is sometimes termed culminative within the word.\nqlbb | The single primary stress constraint does not rule out further distinctions among syllables which do not bear primary stress. Phonological accounts of the metrical structure of stress languages can encompass fine-grained distinctions of prominence within utterances. Thus in English PRESident, primary\nnhsg | Two hundred seventy-two Anne Cutler\nhy0l | stress falls on the initial syllable, whereas it falls on the third syllable in presiDENtial. But the remaining three syllables of presiDENtial are not all unstressed; the first syllable is said to bear secondary stress. The vowel in the initial syllable is not reduced, whereas those in the second and final syllables are likely to be; however, the possibility of vowel reduction is not a prerequisite for a contrast between secondary and lesser stress (consider Spanish presidente, which exhibits the same relative salience across its four syllables as English presidential, although Spanish has no vowel reduction). It is an empirical issue whether distinguishing between syllables with primary versus secondary stress (for example, in presi- from English president versus presidential) is perceptually necessary; this will be considered further in section eleven point three below.",
