        "content": "68xu | It is difficult, for me, to look out at \"emerging practice\" when \"current practice\" remains nebulous. As an educator, I see students of all ages who are unfamiliar with OT and its role. If OT practice in \"emerging practice\" helps identify the role of OT for all involved parties, let the research begin!\nhd35 | Equally important was the deliberation about the greater risk to the profession from the development of emerging practice. One participant questioned, \"Are we making a big mistake professionally as we decide to move away from the medical model towards a more social work/social justice model-what will we gain or lose? Immediately and for the long term.\"\n2zpk | Rewards and Challenges of Emerging Practice\nepu7 | All one hundred seventy-four participants were asked to identify the rewards and challenges of emerging practice; one hundred sixty-three, or ninety-three point seven percent, valid responses were received. Responses to the question were organized into themes that were inclusive of all comments provided by the participants. Participants identified multiple rewards and benefits to emerging practice. The narrative analysis resulted in the following themes: (a) rewards for the profession, (b) rewards for clients, and (c) rewards for individual practitioners as shown in Table Three.\n7od1 | The rewards of emerging practice for the profession and its clients were many; however, the theme of individual rewards for the occupational therapy practitioner yielded the greatest number of responses. Engagement in emerging practice offered distinct benefits to the therapist,\n0bqy | both tangible and intangible. Financial benefits stem primarily from working outside the third-party reimbursement system that tightly regulates the provision of services. One respondent identified a reward as \"getting paid for more than just actual 'face time' with clients.\" Other financial gains were related to career opportunities resulting from the development of emerging practices. Nonmonetary rewards stemmed from facilitating student growth and development in emerging practice roles and collaboration with community members. One respondent described this further:\nb780 | Nineteen respondents identified those in emerging practice as pioneers, trailblazers, or innovators who follow their passion to create new cutting-edge practice niches for the profession. Respondents elaborated by describing the elements for success in these endeavors to include persuasiveness, leadership, and innovation.\nccmb | The themes associated with the challenges of emerging practice presented a number of facets. By far, the most frequently identified concerns and barriers associated with emerging practice were funding and reimbursement for services. If third-party payers reimburse for services in emerging practice settings, reimbursement rates are often lower than for services provided within medical facilities. Additionally, obtaining reimbursement was perceived to be an \"uphill battle\" with greater justification and skillful documentation often required from therapists for their services. Developing and implementing effective marketing programs was a strategy identified to obtain payment for services.\nma93 | The challenge associated with identifying and protecting the profession's appropriate domain and scope of practice included the concern from other health professionals that the services provided by the occupational therapists were similar or duplicative to their own. Respondents related this concern, in part, to a general lack of understanding about the value of occupational therapy services, thereby requiring continuous efforts to educate other professionals, families, and community members. The concern for the occupational therapy domain of practice also related to an incompatibility with professional regulatory and licensure issues. One example of this perceived incompatibility was the struggle with maintaining the continuing education requirements for state practice acts as well as gaining the specific knowledge and skills required for emerging practice. Additionally, the definitions of occupational therapy services delineated in practice acts may be too narrow in focus thereby creating potential ethical and legal implications. One practitioner described these challenges as:\nc6hh | Other OTs \"don't get it\" and when OT regulatory agencies don't recognize the practice as \"real\" OT, there are problems with maintaining licensure. In my practice, rehabilitation counselor and disability case manager, maintaining my OT license is required for maintaining the other certification required for my current practice. Since most of the continuing education relevant to my practice is not accepted for my state's OT licensure renewal, although most of the OT-specific continuing education I take is recognized by my other certifications-they are a lot more open-minded, I need to spend a lot of money and take\ny7ea | time off for continuing education that has no practical application value for me.\nnav4 | In addressing the role of occupational therapy educational programs and student participation, participants articulated the concern for academic preparation, student supervision, and ongoing mentoring at emerging practice settings where occupational therapists are not available on a full-time basis. A final challenge for the profession is to conduct and disseminate research on emerging practice that provides evidence of its efficacy in a timely manner.\ngem8 | Much as reimbursement for services was perceived as a barrier to emerging practice for the profession, financial concerns of the individual therapist contributed to the challenges of emerging practice. In particular, the salary and benefits offered in emerging settings, particularly community organizations with limited funding, often cannot match those of positions held by occupational therapists in health care settings. A number of identified challenges related to the effort and perseverance to develop new practices. A respondent cautioned, \"It usually takes a long time to 'find' your 'niche' and to develop your role to a point where you feel you are making a difference.\" The final broad theme of challenge to the individual practitioner was one of professional isolation. The drawbacks to being an innovator and practicing autonomously can include a lack of professional support networks, role models, and mentors.\ne8nr | Survey Respondents in Emerging Practice\nk78w | Fifty-seven respondents identified themselves as providing occupational therapy or occupational therapy-related services in an emerging practice setting or role. The services provided and populations served were very diverse and often specialized in nature. Numerous reported services including low vision, driver evaluation and training, ergonomic evaluation and consultation, and health promotion and lifestyle redesign services are often identified as emerging practice in the profession's literature. Other reported services included assistive technology services, home evaluation and modification, caregiver education, psychosocial, and pediatric services. The populations receiving services from the respondents in emerging roles or settings were individuals of all ages as well as specialized populations including children with chronic disabilities, prospective international adoptive children, students of all ages, at-risk youth, pregnant teens and teen mothers, well elderly, older adults in subsidized or public housing, and low income or at-risk elderly. Table Four presents the number of years respondents\ng9du | Table Four. Respondents in Emerging Practice: Years Worked at Emerging Practice Setting and Factors Contributing to the Development of Knowledge and Skills for Emerging Practice\nf682 | worked at the emerging practice setting, and the factors respondents identified as contributing to the development of their knowledge and skills for emerging practice.\nli1k | Discussion\npbea | The survey results represent findings of occupational therapists from diverse backgrounds, professional roles, and experiences. As a pilot study, the results cannot be generalized to represent the perspective of all occupational therapists. However, two broad areas of discussion are relevant. First, the respondents held wide-ranging views about the nature and scope of emerging practice and its current and future role within the profession. Without a common definition of emerging practice, the descriptions of emerging practice, as well as the practice settings and services identified by the survey respondents, were wide ranging. Many of the settings and roles reflect those identified within the professional literature and by A O T A's Centennial Vision twenty oh three. The most common descriptor of emerging practice was nontraditional, and this term held multiple meanings for the respondents. Community-based settings and services were identified as offering the opportunity to provide services that are occupation-based, holistic, and congruent with the philosophical roots and values of the profession. However, these and other descriptions of emerging practice confirmed therapists perceived emerging opportunities for services very\nccpt | broadly, and the differentiation between emerging or established occupational therapy practices was not always evident.",
