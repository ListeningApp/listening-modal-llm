You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

06yq | Microdosing with psychedelics to self-medicate for ADHD symptoms in adults: A naturalistic study

2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

hkxq | Emotional Expectations
9gst | Q: Why docs a Sufi group go on, sometimes for years, reading books, meeting and apparently not getting anything done, without any measurement of its progress, and without a sense of how things are going?
094q | A: Such a group has to 'wear out' emotional expectations. It also has to provide circumstances in which the irrelevant and customary associations, characteristics brought in from other systems may be displayed and observed, so that everyone can see what is central and what is not. If the members of the group are not seeing these things, it is not a Sufic group at all. Much of its visible work is that of a 'preparatory group'. This does not mean that it might not be extremely important: for where else are you going to obtain this opportunity of living through and observing your reactions and those of others, outside of social groupings where the lessons are either obscured or twisted to provide super- ficial, tribal-type, conclusions?
nlyd | If you refer again to the published narratives which illustrate the coming-together of people, the effect of interchanges to show up unworthy or irrelevant behaviour or the uselessness of facile inter- pretation, you will find the material against which you can check the behaviour of people in such a group, if you are in one.
k5jo | The main characteristic displayed by the questioner is that of a person who wants something ('progress', or 'a sense of how things are going') without carrying on an active observation and digesting of experience happening in and to the group. In traditional termin- ology familiar to people of all cultures (used in this instance not as a reproach but as a technique) we have here too much greed ahead of capacity, too much dissatisfaction due to greed and false premises, too much laziness which gives rise to a person being a potential victim of an exploiter who might appear and promise automatic progress without effort or right alignment.
r3vp | Anyone who seeks to escape from his inherited culture's moral
nuc1 | demands need not think that they may have no function as exer- cises. He has to re-learn the other possible functions in traditional principles, and he can do this through more study of narrative and illustrative materials and in participation in very preliminary group work, through more of such activity, not less.
2vej | Finally, individual and sub-group progress is not always visible to all participants on demand.
zj7x | OBSESSED WITH THE WORLD
5dcq | Contrast this approach with that of the mechanical religionists, who merely cultivate obsession. Fariduddin Attar gives a tale of the great woman Sufi Rabia, when she was ill. A certain scholar came to see her and, as he sat beside her bed, he repeated again and again arguments about the evils of the world.
1hqm | But Rabia could see through this and told him that he obviously loved the world very much. People speak again and again of things which they love, whether they do so in pleasant or unpleasant terms. To be attached to something, favourably or otherwise, is the basic condition. If you had no truck with the world,' Rabia reminded the man, "you would say nothing about it, favourable or otherwise.'

ajz6 | Jumping to Conclusions
bsoa | ASSUMPTIONS can stand between the student and what he might learn, if these preconceptions are not correct or if they are not functional.
mmo2 | The assumptions that spiritual paths should take this or that form, should be followed by this or that type of person, should belong to certain kinds of recognisable institution, etc., these ideas not only block learning - they often transform it into a search for the expected diversion, and therefore, in reality if not in appear- ance, towards becoming a part of the entertainment industry.
j69r | To connect with people at the outside edge, so to speak, Eastern sages have grown beards and worn turbans; to point up the jumping-to-conclusions syndrome, others have behaved like luna- tics; to alert those who are most teachable, yet others have not compromised with expectation to any real extent. And frauds and adventurers, to exploit the only-too-obvious assumptions, have never been slow to accord with them-to tell people what they want to hear.
2ugw | If you cannot question your assumptions, you must stand up to be counted among the people of whom some may be right: but who include a large number of people, conditioned to bigotry, who must be wrong.
a6jg | Perhaps worth thinking about is the illustrative test which was recently applied to over two hundred people who had been attracted to a certain spiritual teaching. They were given a number of statements and literary extracts and asked which of them were genuine and which not. Over eighty-five per cent of these people got the answers wrong: they identified the spurious documents and statements as genuine.
91u8 | This indicated at least two things: (1) that these people, for the most part, had not been attracted to the teaching through any ability to discern its legitimacy; and (2) that since most of them had rejected the real materials, the likelihood was that they would eventually reject the teaching materials and procedures of the
51g2 | 271
ekj5 | genuine school, since they displayed an overwhelming appreciation of the spurious as 'authentic'.
0heu | One of the commonest assumptions among people who only imagine what a real teaching might be, is connected with 'initia- tion'.
yh7j | All over the world you will find people willing and anxious to initiate others into spiritual schools.
3ql4 | But, as the procedure is still preserved among the Sufis, initia- tion - the pledge of fealty to a teacher, only takes place 'several years after his admission to the Order of Dervishes'. This is because, until the student knows enough, and until he has learnt something, he cannot truly commit himself to the deep studies. To get him to engage himself to follow a path while he is still not capable of it is a real mark of ignorance or imposture.
9rtl | THE CHRISTIAN IN MECCA
wjx6 | On the other hand, someone may be ready to learn and to under- stand when he is regarded by externalist tests as being quite un- suitable. The great Shibli one day made this very clear, in a story which contains several interesting features.
t62c | Shibli announced one day, in Baghdad, that he wanted a thousand dirhams, for shoes for the poor, for the Pilgrimage to Mecca. A certain Christian offered the money, providing that he would be allowed to accompany the caravan.
50qr | Shibli told him that only Moslems could make the journey. So the Christian offered to come as a pack-animal: from whom no affirmation of faith was required. So they set off, with the Christian in harness. At each stage he cleared the ground for the pilgrims.
2mku | When they arrived at the Great Mosque, Shibli told the Chris- tian that he was not permitted to enter the precincts of the Kaaba. The Christian prayed that he might be allowed to enter. Then a voice was heard, inviting the Christian in ...
apbe | Jumping to conclusions is one of the greatest barriers to learn- ing, though not to actions which make people imagine that they have verified something or made discoveries.
2wh5 | HOW TO INCREASE SPEED
tjrm | Mulla Nasrudin went one day to a shipyard. Seeing a fire, which be had not expected to be associated with the sea, he asked a work- man what it was for.
w9xo | 'We make tar' said the other man, 'and cover the cracks in the underside of the boat. That makes the vessel go faster.'
utyz | The Mulla went straight home and made a bonfire. Then he tied up his donkey and melted some tar in a pan. As soon as he brought the smoking tar near the animal, it broke loose and ran like the wind.
tquj | 'It works all right' said Mulla Nasrudin.
oepx | 273
qt5u | The Rosary and the Robe
a2kn | Q: What is the origin of the belief that the 'holy man' is, for example, constantly practising austerities, should be dressed in rags, avoids contamination, and so on?
84li | A: This is the easiest of all questions to answer. You could probably have seen that yourself if you had phrased it differently. For the benefit of those who cannot answer it:
oh1c | The origin is in the observation of the initial austerities, etc., visibly practised by the devout. Because they have no information as to the purpose, stage of development or nature of procedure of such an individual, outward observers imagine that this must auto- matically represent the essential and invariable behaviour of the 'illuminate' (and his random spectators who are in a mimetic mood).
apax | It is as if an unthinking person were to see the arm-waving of a railway signalman in training and extrapolate from that the belief that
zc7j | *All railwaymen must at all times, or to become experts, wave their arms;
96pn | and
txea | *If the man at this level does this, the top man must do it, and perhaps if he does, twice as auspiciously.
8oh3 | Malobservation, facile assumptions, mechanical reproduction of activities based on incomplete data, in any area of human activity or learning spells failure, not success. If you doubt this, test it. Plenty of organisations bear these marks.
m27u | So, in order to correct basic mistakes we must be able to con- ceive that there might be mistakes. When this is done, further mistakes and useless procedures may be avoided.
s0b6 | In place of becoming a consumer of emotional stimuli, while concurrently imagining that one is experiencing spirituality, the student must be prepared to attempt those things which are pre-
ihlu | 274
r3zr | scribed for him. Both practice and test in the Sufi way are real ones. Those which centre upon appearance and fads are false ones. One such test, for those who have developed a taste for absurd- ities, is to adopt and maintain a normal life.
j6ku | GOD WAS DEAD
zt0d | Among the Sufis there is a story, related by Attar, of a dervish who applied to enter a monastery wearing black. When he was asked-by Ibn Khafif, who died about 1,000 years ago-why he was in mourning, he answered that his 'God was dead'. The people there expelled him forty times before they absorbed the fact that his 'god' - that which he had worshipped - had been bis secondary self, the conditioned personality.
ej0q | Husain ibn Mansur, asked by someone 'Who is a Sufi?' answered: 'The one whose Essence is single'.
dg44 | 275
lhtj | Random Exercises
ns07 | Q: Some groups of Sufis and others carry out frequent and regular exercises, 'dances', and all sorts of activities in which everyone takes part. Why do you say that one should not do the things which have brought others into high spiritual states?
q8bx | A: First, please note that there are always plenty of people who carry out automatic processes, and they are always glad to get others to join them. If you know of any, and you want to join them, you will be likely to do so. If you do, you can make your own test of whether this is the best way of going about things. In other words, why are you here if you can get these things else- where?
lftq | Secondly, assuming that you are here because you want first to compare what we say with what other people say, I can only repeat that what suits one person at one time does not inevitably suit another.
hyaf | LANGUAGE OF BIRDS
9etn | There is a story which preserves this by analogy. A worthy man once prayed that he might know the language of the birds. One day when he was sitting quietly under a certain tree with a birds' nest in it, he realised that he could follow the meaning of their chirruping. One bird was telling another that the king's son was ill, and that human beings were so stupid that nobody knew that by giving him lemon-water he would be saved. The man immedi- ately went to the royal Court, where he found that the young prince was indeed ill, and his life was despaired of. He prescribed lemon-water, and the prince recovered. The king ordered that the 'doctor' be rewarded with as much gold as he wanted.
2bic | Now this worthy man had a friend who was very unworthy indeed, and he confided to him the way in which he had become rich. So the unworthy man prayed that he might be able to
jras | 276
dwvf | understand the language of the birds, as he wanted to become rich like his friend. The faculty developed in him. Sitting under a tree, he heard the birds talking. They said: "Under this tree is sitting an unworthy man, who wants our secrets. We shall let him have one of them. It is that at this very moment a ravenous tiger, whom we have called from the jungle to eat him up, is advancing upon him.'
ic87 | As he stood up to run, the unworthy man was seized by the tiger and devoured.
bxpw | Why should one not do the things which have brought others into high spiritual states, the questioner asks. If one were a machine, and if all people and situations were alike, if people were pieces of wood to be shaped: of course one should neglect all the manifold attendant circumstances and apply exercises randomly ...
4g09 | This question implies that everything is always the same. Reflec- tion might well have told our questioner otherwise, if he had but turned the question around, so as to use his own thinking capa- cities. By turning the matter over in one's mind, the question might become:
txr8 | 'Under what circumstances would it be true that random exercises should not be carried out, or mechanical imitation should be shunned?'
rsup | One very good reason not to 'steal' exercises and apply them randomly (which means without insight and knowledge) is that this can have the same sort of effect, in its own sphere, as other, more familiar, forms of 'theft.' Sometimes this - as in the example I am now going to give you - carries its own penalty.
hk1c | Here is the parallel, and, humorous though it may be from one point of view (you should laugh at it and look for the additional dimension of instruction) it is a good equivalence of what can happen to people who adopt metaphysical things and then wonder what has happened to them: or why nothing has happened:
na8b | WHAT HE STOLE
a4wk | A newspaper [The London Daily Telegraph, 27 October 1976, p. 17, column 4] reports that a housebreaker stole a local coun- cillor's cheque book and identification pass and used them in shops.
bi02 | 277
yc23 | His intention was to get money and goods. What did he get?
ki0m | His defence lawyer explained in Court. In every single one of the nine shops which he visited, identifying himself as the coun- cillor, he was assailed by complaints about the public services. 'At one stage, to get out of a shop, he even left his telephone number for a lady shop assistant to contact him about the transfer of a house.'
6wrx | He was found guilty of forgery and housebreaking: but the disparity between his expectation and the reality was due to the fact that he made assumptions about what would be likely to happen if he did certain things: and his ignorance was his undoing.
u4q7 | If people know about the effects of these exercises, they do not need to ask such questions as we have here. If they do not, it cannot be explained to them better than through an allegory such as this, taken from real life.
jd7m | I like the headline to the account. It is: 'The thief who stole another man's burden.'
sknv | IF IN DOUBT, HAVE THEM OUT
usuw | Random exercises are more likely than not to have the effect which taking Mulla Nasrudin's advice would have had, in this example of his wisdom:
d4hr | 'Nasrudin, you are a man of experience,' said a philosopher; 'Have you heard of a cure for aching eyes? I read a lot, and mine are giving me trouble.'
