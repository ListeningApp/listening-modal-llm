        "content": "m1hx | c) Factors Controlling Sertoli Cell Function\n9psh | i) Follicle-Stimulating Hormone: The Sertoli cell has the receptors for follicle-stimulating hormone secreted by the pituitary gland, and this hormone stimulates the release of inhibin, alpha and beta subunits, by the Sertoli cell that feeds back to inhibit gonadotropin-releasing hormone release and follicle-stimulating hormone release, and activin, an alpha-alpha or beta-beta homodimer of the inhibin subunits that stimulates the release of follicle-stimulating hormone.\naiqv | ii) Testosterone: Androgens are absolutely required for normal spermatogenesis, and the androgen receptors are located in the Sertoli cells. There are no receptors in the developing germ cells, and all actions of androgen are on the Sertoli cells.\n4klz | Growth Factors and Cytokines, Small Peptides and RNAs provide the local controls of Sertoli cell function and spermatogenesis.\nxz5d | d) Functions of the Sertoli Cell:\nerwx | i) Supportive, protective and nourishing for the developing germ cells: The cell acts as a supporting matrix for the developing germ cells without having a permanent attachment to the germ cells. Sertoli cells also provide the germ cells with nutrients and may act as a \"bridge\" to bring substances from the capillaries to the germ cells. The hormones follicle-stimulating hormone and testosterone act directly on the Sertoli cells working through their cognate receptors to alter Sertoli cell function and impact the process of spermatogenesis.\nie7i | ii) Phagocytosis of residual bodies of excess cell portions during spermiogenesis: Sertoli cells are capable of ingesting degenerating germ cells and residual bodies. The phagocytic activity becomes more pronounced following germinal epithelium damage and massive degeneration of the germ cells.\naksw | iii) Spermiation: The release of the mature spermatids into the lumen of the tubule.\n0fsl | iv) The number of Sertoli cells ultimately determines the spermatogenic potential of the testis in a normal man: Sertoli cell proliferation during the pre-pubertal phase is influenced by follicle-stimulating hormone and activin as well as thyroxin.\n0m3g | v) The blood-testis barrier, like the blood-brain barrier, serves to separate the testes from the normal circulation of blood and other body fluids throughout the body. Proteins, which are abundant in blood plasma and testicular lymph, are present in very low concentrations in the tubule fluid, but only proteins secreted by the Sertoli cell enter the lumen of the tubule. Specialized junctional complexes, tight junctions, formed by neighboring Sertoli cells create an effective blood-testis barrier, which accounts for the differences in\n9sp0 | chemical composition of the tubule fluid and the blood plasma or lymph. This barrier protects the sperm from the immune system and ensures that the fluid balance within the seminiferous tubule is conducive to sperm development. These complexes between Sertoli cells divide the epithelium into two compartments:\nnbpk | (One) Basal compartment between the Sertoli junctions and the basal lamina containing the spermatogonia.\nxs3r | (Two) Adluminal compartment above the Sertoli cell junctions containing the more advanced germ cells. The movement of leptotene spermatocytes from the basal to the adluminal compartment involves the blood-testis barrier. The formation of the blood-testis barrier might be required to establish an appropriate environment for the completion of meiosis.\nffuj | vi) Secretion of proteins and ions into the lumen: Tubule Fluid - The seminiferous tubules contain fluid which has a different composition from that of blood plasma or lymph. Sertoli cells probably are responsible for the secretion of this fluid. Its function is to transport spermatozoa to the epididymis and provide substrates for sperm survival.\nh7f6 | (One) Inhibin - Sertoli cells produce this protein hormone, which specifically inhibits the release of follicle-stimulating hormone from the pituitary. Severe damage to the germinal epithelium results in decreased production of inhibin and subsequent increases in follicle-stimulating hormone secretion. The human male produces primarily inhibin B.\nt74k | (Two) Secretion of m端llerian-inhibiting substance, also called anti-m端llerian hormone. M端llerian-inhibiting substance inhibits the growth and causes regression of the m端llerian ducts during fetal development and, thus, plays an important role during sexual differentiation.\nqdn7 | Local factors: There is evidence for strong local control via growth factors and their receptors of spermatogenesis.\ndib4 | One) The Leydig Cell and Testicular Steroidogenesis\nyvqj | Leydig Cells: The Leydig cells are clusters of cells that occur in the interstitial tissue between the seminiferous tubules. These cells comprise only about five percent of the total testicular volume. The Leydig cell synthesizes androgens from cholesterol. Androgens secreted from the Leydig cell regulate the development and function of the male reproductive tract and secondary sexual characteristics as well as promote spermatogenesis. The major androgen secreted is testosterone. Its synthesis and release is stimulated by pituitary luteinizing hormone. Leydig cells can synthesize cholesterol from acetate or take up cholesterol from lipoproteins for steroidogenesis. The rate limiting step for steroid biosynthesis is the mobilization of cholesterol from the intracellular stores to the inner mitochondrial membrane where it is converted to the first steroid formed, pregnenolone. Although several proteins have been implicated in this process of cholesterol transport to the mitochondria, acute steroidogenic regulatory protein plays a major role in regulated steroid production. A second protein, translocator protein,\nvz2f | or T S P O, has been implicated as a possible regulator as well. From pregnenolone, the Leydig cell produces testosterone via metabolism through the forty-four steroidogenic pathway shown in\nwyu0 | Figure ten a and b. Testosterone is reduced in peripheral tissue by the enzyme five alpha reductase to dihydrotestosterone.\ns8xw | In addition to androgens, the testis also synthesizes estradiol via conversion of testosterone by the enzyme aromatase and secretes significant amounts of estrogens. Estrogens may act intratesticularly to regulate testosterone production. This action may be mediated through estrogen receptors, which have been localized in Leydig cells.\nafv1 | a) Characteristics and Location: The Leydig cells are located between the tubules in the interstitial space close to the blood vessels and lymphatics. The cells are characterized by:\nfwf1 | (One) Lipid droplets.\n3wck | (Two) Mitochondria with tubular cristae.\njq2u | (Three) A smooth endoplasmic reticulum.\n9zf9 | (Four) These cells express the receptors for luteinizing hormone, which stimulates steroidogenesis through a cyclic AMP-mediated signal transduction pathway.",
