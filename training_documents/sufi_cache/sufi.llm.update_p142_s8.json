        "content": "pb8r | In February nineteen seventy-five, a fine ginger tom-cat named Orlando was nominated in the Surrey University elections for President of the Students' Union. That the cat was a bona fide student seems evident by the fact that it has a Bachelor of Science. No doubt it will go on to a higher degree. This news story could very well, in traditional times, have been originated by a Sufi, as a comment on study and the times ...\nvy5b | Potentiality and Function\ne3zw | Q: What is the value of spiritual exercises?\nwehf | A: Here is a story for you:\n9l8b | THE CHESS GAME\nkqol | A certain countryman was being taught the game of chess. He was rather confused because the piece known as a castle was sometimes referred to as an elephant, sometimes as a castle, sometimes as a rook, and so on.\non3i | Finally he got the hang of the names, and the game started.\n14cj | Within a very few moves his teacher took one of his castles. Picking it up in fury, the countryman ground it under his foot, saying: 'Yes, you have enough names and wide-ranging moves, but in action we can see you are good for nothing!'\ncwbo | What is the value of anything?\nva5y | The value of spiritual exercises is to be of value to whom they can. The human interest should be to provide the right basis for the exercise, not to seek the exercise itself. The exercise is there and the need is there. What of the state of the individual?\nildm | Saadi, in the Rose Garden, says:\n71iy | The Sanctuary is in front and the thief is behind: If you go, you win, if you sleep, you die.\n8cet | If you perform spiritual exercises while still not able to distinguish them from emotional activities, you will only be adding to your emotional life. This is why they are always prescribed in authentic schools, unlike the circus system of making everyone do them in imitative cults.\n1e8j | Perhaps one of the best ways of remembering this is to liken it to the story of the fat man who was eating an enormous meal. Someone said to him: 'Aren't you on a diet?' He said: 'Yes, but\nul5t | I have had my diet for today. This is my dinner.'\nwg9e | Conditioning can be so all-enveloping that it takes over systems which were originally flexible and specific, generalising them out of all recognition, though unfortunately not out of popularity.\nz32c | This has given rise to a rather wan joke, which nevertheless has a certain minatory quality:\np8qk | DO YOU KNOW WHAT I AM?\nupr1 | A wandering dervish sat down beside a tousled figure at the roadside, who began to say:\nb743 | 'I can't pray, I can't understand Sufi classics, I don't like esoteric exercises ... '\n2qu4 | 'Then give it all up' advised the dervish.\njarx | 'But how can I? I am a famous \"Sufi teacher\" in these parts ... '\n61f7 | Conditioning and Education\n4epv | Q: You seem to say that people are trained by many ordinary institutions in a manner which people call brainwashing or conditioning. But if psychologists have discovered that this is the way man is trained, what can be done about it, and what is wrong with it?\n5gbl | A: There is no doubt that people are conditioned, and that what they call their opinions and beliefs are frequently not their own but implanted by other people and institutions. Among others, the Sufi Al-Ghazzali pointed this out almost a thousand years ago.\ntx0b | But the assumption that all human education, training and development must be done by these methods is as unnecessary as to imagine, say, that because a tomato can be force-ripened that there is no other way for a tomato to ripen.\n48sj | Conditioning is necessary, but it will function only for certain purposes.\n6r2v | Other purposes need other approaches. The Anwar-i-Suhaili says:\n76oj | The world is a hill and our actions are a shout; The echo of the shout comes back to us. Even though the wall throws a long shadow, The shadow itself still runs back to the wall.\nd0t7 | Sufi learning comes through nutrition, as it were, in the sense that Tustari answered the question 'What is food?' He said: ' \"Food\" is the contemplation of the Living One.'\nvpvf | The community of those who have self-realisation is regarded, by Ibn Arabi and others, as 'organic', except that this organisation is far more subtle and effective than that which gave us the analogy in the first place.\n950w | The secondary self stands in the way of learning, and it will be conditioned unless it is 'polished'- another technical term, likening it to a mirror on which dust has settled, again emphasised by Ibn Arabi (in his Fusus) as well as by the classical and contemporary exponents of Sufism.\nules | The Search for an Honest Man\n7a63 | THERE always comes a time when instruction-materials which were originally employed to direct the attention of certain people towards a certain aim are adopted as 'gospel', or else simplified out of all usefulness and shallowly interpreted.\nn6to | A possible example of the latter is the current idea of the meaning of Diogenes' looking with a lamp, in broad daylight, for an honest man.\nvgjt | People think that he did this to indicate how rare were honest men. In fact, this procedure can be seen as a perfectly obvious example of someone directing attention to the whole question: not only to the rarity of honest men, but to the problem as to whether, how and where they might be found. The ambiguity of interpretation appears only when the student does not give both interpretative explanations equal value.\naziu | Diogenes, who died in three two three B.C., is known as the founder of the school called the Cynics. Their purpose was to teach that attachment to 'things of the world' was slavery. Today's cynics are, ironically, attached to, slaves of, cynicism.\nisxw | Again, honesty as an aim must have an archetype beyond the actual dishonesty of humankind. Saadi gives this prayer:\ns62k | Do to me what is worthy of Thee\nktvf | Not that which is worthy of me.\nvn96 | The action of teachings differs greatly from their description. Teachings must therefore always remain fresh and flexible, unless we are to deal in terms of the 'secret herb' which I mentioned at Geneva.\nmafq | Honesty is, of course, not easy: because real honesty is exercised without difficulty when it is the manifestation of an inner reality, not when it is a duty or difficulty. But certain principles can be used to illustrate the activity of an honest man or woman.\nfqji | TALE OF HATIM\nfixp | When Hatim al-Asamm, of Balkh (now in Afghanistan) went to Baghdad, people surrounded him, saying:\niv7c | 'You are a non-Arab of halting speech, yet you silence everyone.'\n0sv5 | He answered: 'Three things enable me to overcome my opponent. I am happy when he is right, and I am sad when he is wrong, and I try not to behave foolishly towards him.'\n7se4 | Ibn Hanbal asked Hatim what things would save humanity from the world. He said:\ng0id | 'There are four things. Accept the ignorance of others and spare them yours; spare for them from your substance, and do not expect any of theirs.'\n3crv | The posture of honesty is not the same as its reality, as everyone knows. But how many people can tell whether they are honest or behaving as if they were honest?\nbcku | A certain tale has been coined to give this important subject expression. In order to illustrate, it has been put into the mouth of two lunatics; which should not really make any of us feel that its equivalence could not occur among us marvellously normal people:\n5fba | First lunatic religionist: 'God spoke to me!'\n9gtm | Second ditto: 'I did no such thing!'\ng0fq | How can one method be as good as another?",
