        "content": "6d4s | The Counselor's Values and the Therapeutic Process\nmqah | As alluded to in the previous section, the importance of self-exploration for counselors carries over to the values and beliefs we hold. My experience in teaching and supervising students of counseling shows me how crucial it is that students be aware of their values, of where and how they acquired them, and of how their values can influence their interventions with clients.\nxxr8 | The Role of Values in Counseling\nrl4j | Our values are core beliefs that influence how we act, both in our personal and our professional lives. Personal values influence how we view counseling and the manner in which we interact with clients, including the way we conduct client assessments, our views of the goals of counseling, the interventions we choose, the\nvz32 | THE COUNSELOR: PERSON AND PROFESSIONAL\nncb0 | topics we select for discussion in a counseling session, how we evaluate progress, and how we interpret clients' life situations.\n8mp0 | Although total objectivity cannot be achieved, we can strive to avoid being encapsulated by our own worldview. We need to guard against the tendency to use our power to influence clients to accept our values; persuading clients to accept or adopt our value system is not a legitimate outcome of counseling. From my perspective, the counselor's role is to create a climate in which clients can examine their thoughts, feelings, and actions and to empower them to arrive at their own solutions to problems they face. The counseling task is to assist individuals in finding answers that are most congruent with their own values. It is not beneficial to provide advice or to give clients your answers to their questions about life.\nxjyk | You may not agree with certain of your clients' values, but you need to respect their right to hold divergent values from yours. This is especially true when counseling clients who have a different cultural background and perhaps do not share your own core cultural values. Your role is to provide a safe and inviting environment in which clients can explore the congruence between their values and their behavior. If clients acknowledge that what they are doing is not getting them what they want, it is appropriate to assist them in developing new ways of thinking and behaving to help them move closer to their goals. This is done with full respect for their right to decide which values they will use as a framework for living. Individuals seeking counseling need to clarify their own values and goals, make informed decisions, choose a course of action, and assume responsibility and accountability for the decisions they make.\nmt0f | Managing your personal values so that they do not contaminate the counseling process is referred to as \"bracketing.\" Counselors are expected to set aside their personal beliefs and values when working with a wide range of clients. Your core values may differ in many ways from the core values of your clients, and they will bring you a host of problems framed by their own worldview. Some clients may have felt rejected by others or suffered from discrimination, and they should not be exposed to further discrimination by counselors who refuse to render services to them because of differing values.\nawab | Counselors must have the ability to work with a range of clients with diverse worldviews and values. Counselors may impose their values either directly or indirectly. Value imposition refers to counselors directly attempting to define a client's values, attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors. It is unethical for counselors to impose their values in the therapeutic relationship. The American Counseling Association's Code of Ethics is explicit regarding this matter:\nixcc | Personal Values. Counselors are aware of-and avoid imposing-their own values, attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors. Counselors respect the diversity of clients, trainees, and research participants and seek training in areas in which they are at risk of imposing their values onto clients, especially when the counselor's values are inconsistent with the client's goals or are discriminatory in nature.\n8p6h | Value exploration is at the heart of why many counselor education programs encourage or require personal therapy for counselors in training. Your personal therapy sessions provide an opportunity for you to examine your beliefs and values and to explore your motivations for wanting to share your belief system.\npmgl | CHAPTER TWO\n90no | Clients are in a vulnerable position and require understanding and support from a counselor rather than judgment. It can be burdensome for clients to be saddled with your disclosure of not being able to get beyond value differences. Clients may interpret this as a personal rejection and suffer harm as a result. Counseling is about working with clients within the framework of their value system. If you experience difficulties over conflicting personal values with clients, the ethical course of action is to seek supervision and learn ways to effectively manage these differences. The counseling process is not about your personal values; it is about the values and needs of your clients. Your task is to help clients explore and clarify their beliefs and apply their values to solving their problems.\njt0y | The Role of Values in Developing Therapeutic Goals\nqb7o | Who should establish the goals of counseling? Almost all theories are in agreement that it is largely the client's responsibility to decide upon goals, collaborating with the therapist as therapy proceeds. Counselors have general goals, which are reflected in their behavior during the therapy session, in their observations of the client's behavior, and in the interventions they make. The general goals of counselors must be congruent with the personal goals of the client.\noae5 | Setting goals is inextricably related to values. The client and the counselor need to explore what they hope to obtain from the counseling relationship, whether they can work with each other, and whether their goals are compatible. Even more important, it is essential that the counselor be able to understand, respect, and work within the framework of the client's world rather than forcing the client to fit into the therapist's scheme of values.\ns0fl | In my view, therapy ought to begin with an exploration of the client's expectations and goals. Clients initially tend to have vague ideas of what they expect from therapy. They may be seeking solutions to problems, they may want to stop hurting, they may want to change others so they can live with less anxiety, or they may seek to be different so that some significant persons in their lives will be more accepting of them. In some cases clients have no goals; they are in the therapist's office simply because they were sent for counseling by their parents, probation officer, or teacher.\n43ia | So where can a counselor begin? The initial interview can be used most productively to focus on the client's goals or lack of them. The therapist may begin by asking any of these questions: \"What do you expect from counseling? Why are you here? What do you want? What do you hope to leave with? How is what you are currently doing working for you? What aspects of yourself or your life situation would you most like to change?\"\n3g2y | When a person seeks a counseling relationship with you, it is important to cooperatively discover what this person is expecting from the relationship. If you try to figure out in advance how to proceed with a client, you may be depriving the client of the opportunity to become an active partner in her or his own therapy. Why is this person coming in for counseling? It is the client's place to decide on the goals of therapy. It is important to keep this focus in mind so that the client's agenda is addressed rather than an agenda of your own.\ngc7v | THE COUNSELOR: PERSON AND PROFESSIONAL\nwqfv | Becoming an Effective Multicultural Counselor",
