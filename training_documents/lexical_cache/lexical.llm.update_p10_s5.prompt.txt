You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

d0ik | Another consideration is that although fixed stress is sometimes located at a word boundary, this is not always so (as in Polish, where stress is on the penul- timate syllable). Given that the process of spoken-word recognition involves con- tinuous exploitation of incoming acoustic information (see Frauenfelder & Floccia, 1998, for a review), fixed stress other than at a word edge will involve additional processing complexity. A third consideration is that fixed stress may affect all words irrespective of word class, or may be sensitive to grammatical factors.
0x0s | 274 Anne Cutler
4exe | This last consideration motivated investigations by Dupoux and Peperkamp (2002; Peperkamp & Dupoux, 2002), who aim ultimately to explain the acquisi- tion of word prosody by infants. Dupoux and Peperkamp suggest that overall listener sensitivity to stress cues in adulthood will depend on the function of stress in their native language; in general, languages without lexically contrastive stress will not require that listeners develop sensitivity to stress information in speech. However, such non-contrastive languages differ in how accessible the rules for prosodic prominence are to an infant. In some languages (e.g., Finnish, French), prominence is unaffected by grammatical factors; infants should be able to learn early that stress plays no useful contrastive role and can be ignored. In other languages (e.g., Hungarian, Polish), prominence rules affect lexical words and grammatical (function) words differently; this pattern should be harder to learn, with the result that some sensitivity to stress contrasts may develop. Initial studies by Dupoux et al. (1997) and Dupoux, Peperkamp, and Sebastián-Gallés (2001) showed that speakers of French have great difficulty processing stress contrasts in nonsense materials, e.g., deciding whether a token bopeLO should be matched with an earlier token of bopeLO or boPElo. The same contrasts are easy for speakers of Spanish, which does distinguish words via stress. Dupoux and Peperkamp then tested Finnish speakers, whose performance indeed resembled that of French speakers, and speakers of Hungarian and Polish, whose perform- ance fell between the French/Finnish and the Spanish levels.
0myz | 11.2.5 Fixed stress and segmentation
xh3i | Dupoux and Peperkamp's (2002) work suggests that fixed-stress languages cannot be treated as a unitary class. With regard to lexical segmentation, the available evidence on fixed-stress languages still falls far short of that on free-stress lan- guages. In Indonesian (with phrase-final accent) listeners do not show evidence of using stress placement for segmentation (van Zanten & van Heuven, 1998). However, some studies on French and on Finnish (fixed initial stress) have pro- vided evidence consistent with use of demarcation cues by listeners. In French, the accent-bearing right boundary of a rhythmic group is always also the right boundary of a word; Dahan (1996) found that listeners detect target syllables located at a rhythmic group boundary more rapidly than the same syllables elsewhere in an utterance. In Finnish, a word-spotting study by Suomi, McQueen, and Cutler (1997) showed that vowel harmony (which is a word-level phenom- enon) can be used by listeners in segmentation; indirect evidence on stress process- ing can be deduced from their control experiment, in which excised embedded words from the word-spotting materials were recognized no less rapidly if taken from a preceding context (e.g., palo from kupalo) than from a following context (e.g., palo from paloku). Although the former type could be considered not to have been uttered with canonical stress, no deleterious effects of this on word recogni- tion were observed. Vroomen, Tuomainen, and De Gelder (1998) replicated the Suomi et al. finding but showed that even stronger than vowel harmony was the effect on segmentation exercised by clearly marked word-initial stress. In a further experiment, Vroomen et al. showed that Finnish listeners were sensitive to vowel harmony and to stress (operationalized as higher FO) in learning the "words" of
syiw | an artificial language, while Dutch listeners were sensitive only to the stress cue and French listeners were sensitive to neither cue.
kg3t | These results are difficult to account for in the light of Dupoux and Peperkamp's (2002) finding that stress contrasts were overlooked by both French and Finnish listeners. However, it should be noted that the type of segmentation task used by Dahan (1996) does not directly tap word processing. Further, Vroomen et al. (1998) do not report how stress was realized in their word-spotting materials, but it is possible that as in their artificial language study, a clear F0 correlate was avail- able. As Finnish has fixed initial stress, the initial syllable is the designated location for the realization of intonational prominence, but in the absence of such higher- level effects, Finnish stressed syllables are in fact not distinct in F0 from unstressed syllables (Suomi, Toivanen, & Ylitalo, 2003). The principal acoustic correlate of Finnish word stress is segmental lengthening within a word's initial two morae, even when the second mora is also the second syllable (Suomi & Ylitalo, 2004). The confound observed by Dogil (1999) in Jassem's (1962) work may thus also apply to Vroomen et al.'s study: listeners may have been able to use information relevant not to the lexical but to the intonational structure of the utterance (see Vaissière, this volume, for evidence on intonation perception).
lvae | 11.2.6 The contrastive potential of stress
o9sc | The putative contrastive function of stress must be considered in the light of the undeniable rarity of minimal word pairs which differ in stress alone (such as, for example, trusty and trustee in English). Free-stress languages make remarkably little use of the contrastive possibilities which stress in principle offers them. But there are other ways in which stress may be useful in word recognition. Statistical analyses by Altmann and Carter (1989) established that the amount of informa- tion conveyed by phonetic segments in English is highest for vowels in stressed syllables. Further, stressed syllables are acoustically reliable: they are more read- ily identified than unstressed syllables when excised from a context (Lieberman, 1963), and speech distortions are more likely to be detected in stressed than in unstressed syllables (Bond & Garnes, 1980; Browman, 1978; Cole & Jakimik, 1980; Cole, Jakimik, & Cooper, 1978). In gated presentation of spontaneously spoken - but not of read - sentences, stressed syllables are recognized earlier than unstressed syllables (McAllister, 1991). Also in spontaneous speech, word-initial target pho- nemes are detected more rapidly on lexically stressed than unstressed syllables (Mehta & Cutler, 1988). Note that acoustic differences between stressed and unstressed syllables are relatively large in spontaneous speech. With laboratory- read materials, however, such differences do not always arise; Mattys and Samuel (2000) found that phoneme detection was in general faster in words with initial stress, irrespective of whether the target phoneme occurred in the stressed syllable or elsewhere in the word.
121u | Models of spoken-word recognition agree that continuous evaluation of speech input results in simultaneous activation of multiple candidate word forms which at any moment are supported by the input; eventual recognition proceeds on the basis of further input information but also via a process of competition between the activated words (Frauenfelder & Floccia, 1998). Within this presumably universal
