You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

9m8s | Mathematical Crystal Chemistry
893y | Efficient heuristics have predicted many functional materials such as high-temperature supercon- ducting hydrides, while inorganic structural chemistry explains why and how the crystal structures are stabilized. Here we develop the paired mathematical programming formalism for searching and systematizing the structural prototypes of crystals. The first is the minimization of the volume of the unit cell under the constraints of only the minimum and maximum distances between pairs of atoms. We show the capabilities of linear relaxations of inequality constraints to optimize structures by the steepest-descent method, which is computationally very efficient. The second is the discrete optimization to assign five kinds of geometrical constraints including chemical bonds for pairs of atoms. Under the constraints, the two object functions, formulated as mathematical programming, are alternately optimized to realize the given coordination numbers of atoms. This approach suc- cessfully generates a wide variety of crystal structures of oxides such as spinel, pyrochlore-o, and K2 NiF4 structures.
favz | Discovering advanced materials enables technological innovation in many areas such as batteries, photovoltaics, and catalysis. Since electronic structure depends on the spatial arrangements of atoms, predictions of unknown crystal structures have a major impact on the discovery of better materials. However, computational structure searching is still difficult despite the progress of com- putational power, since structure prediction is a large- scale nonconvex minimization problem of the total en- ergy, which has a large number of local minima, concern- ing the atomic arrangement and crystal lattice.
7szx | Finding the global minimum essentially involves visit- ing every local minimum, but some heuristic approaches with more or less intelligent ways such as evolution- ally algorithms [1-4] and particle swarm-intelligence ap- proach [5-7] have predicted novel materials including bi- nary hydrides that have been experimentally synthesized as high-temperature superconductors under high pres- sure [8-14]. The drawbacks of these methods are that there are no guarantees that the most stable structure are found, and similarly, they can miss synthesizable unique structures. Furthermore, they cannot explain why and how the predicted structures are stabilized. This is also true of the deep learning approach [15-18] and the ran- dom structure searching methods [19, 20], while the latter may lead to peculiar structures without a priori knowl- edge.
hx9e | The integer programming approach has been devel- oped to deterministically find the lowest energy struc- ture with guarantees [21]. The global optimum of in- teger programming can be found deterministically by brute force with branch-and-cut algorithms that are ca- pable of rapidly eliminating large parts of the optimiza-
ywn2 | tion domain from consideration. To apply this universal method, all the atoms are placed at discrete positions within a fixed cubic unit cell, and the total energy is rep- resented by the sum of two-body classical interaction po- tentials [21]. This approach has successfully found com- plex crystals such as garnet structure, but the fixed unit cells and approximated total energies may limit its ap- plicability. Instead of using approximated total energies, geometrical approaches may be effective to search crystal structures, for example, Yokoyama et al. have developed the dual periodic graph approach to generate structures composed of space-filling polyhedra [22].
a63r | Important structural principles for ionic crystals have been summarized by Pauling in the five rules [23-25]. George et al. have shown the limited predictive power of the Pauling rules since a few oxides simultaneously sat- isfy them [26], but the rules offer the basic concepts for inorganic structural chemistry. For example, the crys- tal structures of oxides, chalcogenides, and mixed anion compounds are linked polyhedra with explicit chemical bonds, especially between anions and cations [24, 25]. Anions such as oxygen prefer to constitute the Barrow packings, which are the densest packings of spheres [27], and small cations are placed in the tetrahedral and oc- tahedral sites, while large cations typically have a co- ordination number greater than 6, and in some cases, constitutes the Barrow packings with anions [24, 25]. Small and large cations generally behave as hard and soft spheres, respectively. Highly polar bonds do not fa- vor edge-sharing polyhedra and especially face-sharing polyhedra because of the increased electrostatic repul- sion between central atoms [24, 25].
dqvj | The structure of amorphous semiconductors is well rep- resented by continuous random network models which require a condition that each atom should satisfy fully its bonding needs [28-31]. Two atoms interact only if they are explicitly bonded, and the total energy is given
r17u | by the Keating potential [31, 32]. The network is repro- duced periodically by bond transpositions accepted with the Metropolis acceptance probability, conserving four coordination. This approach can generate structurally and electronically good structures comparable with ex- periments from random initial structures.
3c47 | In this study, we propose a paired mathematical pro- gramming approach that finds candidate structures of crystals satisfying a series of empirical rules. The first is the minimization problem of the volume of the unit cell within the constraints of minimum and maximum distances between pairs of atoms. The constraints repre- sent linked polyhedra and simultaneously the packings of anionic spheres regardless of the kinds of chemical bonds. We approximate the inequality constraints as the linear potentials for the structural relaxation. The second is the maximization problem of the number of chemical bonds. The five kinds of geometrical constraints, which impose restrictions on the distances between every pair of atoms, are assigned by the network of chemical bonds. The two optimization problems are alternately solved to find a proper structure where every cation satisfies its bond- ing needs; the transpositions of geometrical constraints transform random initial structures into linked polyhedra as the sillium approach for amorphous silicons [28-31]. We define a feasible solution as a structure satisfying all the constraints in the two optimization problems and all the bonding needs of atoms, and the other cases are de- noted as infeasible solution. An optimal solution in this study is defined to be the feasible solution whose volume of the unit cell is minimized. The paired mathematical programming we propose is an efficient method which tries to find the optimal solution for a model system with a given composition.
g345 | Let us start our discussion by introducing the first ob- ject function in the paired mathematical programming formalism. The geometrical constraints are composed of the minimum and maximum distances between pairs of atoms. Suppose xi is the cartesian coordinate of atom i, and rijT is the distances between atoms i and jT given by
svhz | (1) where the atom jT corresponds to the atom j with the translational vector T of the crystal lattice. The object function is the volume § of the unit cell. The mathemat- ical programming is given by
oaen | CijT = x; +T- xil,

dvms | subject to xijT ≥ d.min) dijT ,
qrd3 | (2) XijT ≤ dijT (max)
rxrg | where dijT 7(min) and d(max) lijT are the minimum and maximum distances between atoms i and jT, respectively. This model finds structural candidates of crystals without cal- culating the total energies.
tf43 | To solve the problem, the equality and inequality con- straints are relaxed as follows: The constraint of mini- mum distance between atoms i and jT:
fcco | KijT ≥ dyjm,
8uji | is relaxed to the hard-spherical potential Umin (xijT) de- fined to be
