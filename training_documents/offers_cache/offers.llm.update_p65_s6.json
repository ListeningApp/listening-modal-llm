        "content": "6s1a | Then I realized people pay for certainty. They value certainty. I call this \"the perceived likelihood of achievement.\" In other words, \"How likely do I believe it is that I will achieve the result I am looking for if I make this purchase?\"\nxwwb | For example, how much would you pay to be a plastic surgeon's ten thousandth patient versus their first?\notfh | If you're a normal, sane person, a lot more. I mean heck, you might even ask them to pay you if you are their first patient ever.\n6dzi | So you can see even from this simple example that while the service you are receiving is technically the same, the only thing that changes is your perceived likelihood of getting what you want.\nnk46 | Both surgeons take the same amount of time to do the surgery (if anything, the guy who has done it ten thousand times would likely get it done faster and still charge more). The more-experienced surgeon has a track record of achieving a result, which incentivizes their desirability.\nsbg4 | People value this perceived likelihood of achievement. Increasing a prospect's conviction that your offer will \"actually\" work for them, will make your offer that much more valuable even though the work remains the same on your end. So to increase value with all offers, we must communicate perceived likelihood of achievement through our messaging, proof, what we choose to include or exclude in our offer, and our guarantees.\n0vsm | Number three Time Delay (Goal = Decrease)\nrrsc | Time delay is the time between a client buying and receiving the promised benefit. The shorter the distance between when they purchase and they receive value/the outcome, the more valuable your services or product is.\nxjfg | There are two elements to this driver of value: Long-term outcome and short-term experience. Many times, there are short-term experiences that occur while en route to the long-term outcomes. They happen \"along the way\" and provide value.\niw9o | It's good to understand both. The thing people buy is the long-term value, also known as their \"dream outcome.\" But the thing that makes them stay long enough to get it is the short-term experience. These are little milestones a prospect sees along the way that shows them they are on the right path. We try and tie as many of these as possible into any service we offer. We want clients to have a big emotional win early (as close as possible to their purchase). This gives them the emotional buy-in and the momentum to \"see it through\" to their ultimate goal.\nenxg | For example, it takes a while to add an extra two hundred thirty-nine thousand dollars per year to a gym. But that's what they're buying. So, once they have purchased, we need to create emotional wins fast. One way we do this is to get their ads live and get them to close their first two thousand dollar sale within their first seven days. By doing this, their decision to work with us is reinforced, and they immediately trust us more. This makes them more likely to follow the rest of our systems and get to their ultimate destination.\nvmnz | Let me give you another example. If I sell someone a bikini body, their time delay to realize that outcome may be twelve months\n82g8 | or even longer. Along the way, though, as they change their bodies, they may experience higher sex drive, more energy, and an increased community of friends.\nl3g2 | They aren't initially buying those things, but those things may become short-term benefits that keep them in the game long enough to achieve their ultimate outcome. They buy the dream, but they stay for the benefits they discover along the way. The faster and more clearly you can demonstrate those benefits, the more valuable your service will be. For a weight loss customer, we would get them to meet someone else so they immediately had some social benefits from the program, and we usually gave them a more aggressive diet in the beginning. Why? Because we wanted them to have a big, fast emotional win, so we could get them to commit to the long term. This is also backed by science. People who experience a victory early on are more likely to continue with something than those who do not.\n5ah7 | That being said, having to wait twelve to twenty-four months to get what you want is a long time when you can do liposuction and be done in an afternoon. This shows just one of the reasons people pay twenty-five thousand dollars for liposuction with a tummy tuck, while people will barely pay one hundred dollars per month to join a bootcamp.\ncq8x | But that's not the only reason, is it?\ndxup | That leads me to the last driver of value - effort and sacrifice.\n0xhz | Number four Effort and Sacrifice (Goal = Decrease)\nthwq | This is what it \"costs\" people in ancillary costs, also known as \"other costs accrued along the way.\" These can be both tangible and intangible.\nnmx1 | Using the fitness versus liposuction example, let's look at the difference in effort and sacrifice:\nng95 | Fall asleep\nldw4 | Five to ten hours per week of time lost\ngynb | Wake up thin, guaranteed\nyp2i | Stop eating the foods you love\ngm15 | Be sore for two to four weeks\nuwgf | Constant hunger\nai15 | Physical soreness\nheo3 | Feelings of embarrassment at not knowing how to exercise\nu2cj | Risk of injury\naq9q | Actual nausea working out\ndc5c | Meal prepping\n9diq | New groceries/more expensive\nc10k | New clothing (can be a benefit for some folks)\nf8yn | Fear of gaining it back after all this effort (impermanence)\nahrs | Et cetera ...\nk7hf | Massive difference, right?\nwl64 | In fact, in looking at the marketing of plastic surgeons, these are the exact pain points they hit on when they say things like: \"Tired of wasting countless hours in the gym...tired of trying diets that just don't work?\"\nqrks | This is why when you sell fitness, you have to spend an hour arm-wrestling a client to give over one-tenth to one-hundredth of the amount of money they pay for surgery. There's just not a lot of perceived value because the perceived likelihood of achievement, the time delay to achievement, and the effort and sacrifice are so high.\nm9te | So even though the outcome is the same, the value of the vehicles are dramatically different, hence the difference in price.\nqpsk | Decreasing the effort and sacrifice, or at least the perceived effort and sacrifice, can massively boost the appeal of your offer.\nsx3l | In an ideal world, a prospect would want to simply \"say yes\" and have their dream outcome happen with no more effort on their behalf.\nzm2g | This is why \"done for you services\" are almost always more expensive than \"do-it-yourself\" because the person doesn't have all the effort and sacrifice. There is also a component of \"perceived likelihood of achievement\" difference as well. People believe that if an expert does it, then they will be more likely to achieve the outcome than if they try on their own.\nui7p | My hope is that you now have a foundational understanding of the components of value and how the interplay between each\nubys | of the components creates or detracts from the value someone might be willing to pay.\nhphn | Putting It All Together\nves3 | As I said earlier, these elements of value don't happen in a vacuum. They happen together, in combination. So let's look at a few examples that utilize all four components of value at once.\nh4py | In an effort to quantify the value, I'll rate them on a binary scale of zero or one. One being value achieved. Zero being missing. Then I will add all four together to give you a relative value rating of a type of service. Our goal as marketers and business owners is to increase the value of the dream outcome and its perceived likelihood of achievement, while decreasing the time delay of achievement and the effort and sacrifice one has to put in to get there.\np612 | To start I will do a side by side comparison of two \"vehicles\" with identical Dream outcomes: Meditation and Xanax. Both offer the buyer relaxation, decreased anxiety, and feelings of well-being. I will demonstrate how the other three variables dramatically shift the value of delivering that dream outcome and ultimately, the price.\n2ll3 | Example : Dream Outcome: \"Relaxation,\" \"Decreased Anxiety,\" \"Feelings of well-being\" Meditation versus Xanax\nroki | Value Measure\nxzvf | Meditation\nvw6g | Dream Outcome\n5ltn | \"Relaxation\"\nvqad | \"Decreased Anxiety\"",
