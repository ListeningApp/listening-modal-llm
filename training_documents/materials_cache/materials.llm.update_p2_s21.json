The values of parameters such as a, ky, kj, and P are discussed in Supplementary Information. One may consider that structures are never relaxed due to the discontinuity in the first derivative of the potential. However, the structure converges to an optimal solution by gradually reducing the maximum Axmax and Aamax, even though there is the discontinuity. The effectiveness of linear relaxations of inequality constraints has already been shown in the previous studies on the densest sphere packings as iterative-balance method. The method enables the structures to reach a local optima precisely enough to calculate packing fractions. The inequality constraints are widely approximated by the logarithmic barrier functions, but the advantage of the linear potentials consists of the two folds: One is that the computational cost is the lowest and the other is that the potentials can impose hard penalties only when the constraints are not satisfied.\n3pn1 | Next we turn our discussion to the second objective function in the paired mathematical programming formalism. The problem is how to determine the values of dair minimum and maximum. In the following discussion, we focus on the crystal structures of oxides. We introduce the five kinds of geometrical constraints as listed in Table one and illustrated in Fig. one. The minimum and maximum distances are determined as\nwjuz | max p : s (p minimum)\n3yxv | minimum\nd8zj | SiiT ijT\nywxn | ʹijT\nuxhs | maximum ijT equals maximum p SijT\ned6e | p maximum\n6qqm | \nonum | p\n3iir | where Siir belongs to zero or one is a switch variable selecting one of\n7a0a | the geometrical constraints, and p runs chemical bond , non-bonding constraint, anionic constraint, cationic constraint, and polyhedral constraint. The geometrical constraints for every pair of atoms are assigned depending on the network of CBs. CBs or NBCs are formed between every pair of an anion and a cation. ACs are formed between every pair of anions. Besides, if two coordination polyhedra around cations share some bridging anions, PC is formed between the two cations. Finally, CCs are formed between remained pairs of cations. To assist making coordination polyhedra, NBCs spatially separate the anion and cation when CB is not formed between them. ACs impose the hard-spherical constraint for every pair of anions; oxygen ions often constitute the Barrow-packings if the cationic radii are small. CCs are necessary to spatially separate two cations enough to avoid the condensation of cations, while a minimum distance of PC is smaller than that of CC to share a common edge or face as\no1qp | r(M) D(shared) plus D(shared)\njrik | otherwise N equals one,\nxv78 | PC minimum\nsdks | 'ijT\ny8fb | where D(shared) is the minimum distance from the cation i to the shared common edge or face as detailed in Supplementary Information.\n521q | Since any cation i has the desirable coordination number N for CBs, the feasible linked-polyhedra must satisfy the conditions of\nyogo | switch (N minus n equals zero,\n2285 | \nys0g | where n n is the coordination number, which is counted by the number of CBs for atom i, and switch is a switch function for the atom i given by\n7zvp | \nww6u | zero if the atom i is anion.\nhpi6 | Most of random initial structures are infeasible solutions, and the analytic optimization methods such as the steepest-descent method cannot escape from the infeasible solution to a feasible solution. Therefore, we periodically update the values of d(min) and d(max) depending on the network of CBs that are also renewed periodically. The network is determined from the maximization problem of the number of CBs given by\n4uhb | switch E plus\nepyi | maximize\ny51p | CB less than or equal to N\nx95m | subject to\nyfum | ni\nppx4 | less than or equal to N\nqf11 | nijT CB\n8oqt | \n6zah | SiijT TijT less than or equal to two d maximum\n4v5o | switch CB Siir JijT less than or equal to min\nha9e | CijąT",
