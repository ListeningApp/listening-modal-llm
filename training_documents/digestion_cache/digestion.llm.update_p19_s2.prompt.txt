You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

ez9s | Protease activity, in the tubules of the digestive gland and some parts of the intestine, is low at the start of digestion but builds up towards the end. These enzymes have an optimum pH of 5.5, as with lysosomal enzymes; this is associated with intracellular digestion. Given their location on the apical zones of microvilli, these enzymes appear to be membrane-bound (Boucaud-Camou et al., 1985).
mqot | Data from Lebesnerais (1985). Lysosomal proteases (cathepsins) are also known as dipeptidyl peptidases (DPPs); they are classified according to letter or number (Agarwal, 1990). Most of the cathepsins become activated at the low pH found in lysosomes. Thus, the activity of this family lies almost entirely within these organelles.
oc99 | Similar distributions of enzymes within the digestive tract of other bivalve species have been identified: grooved carpet shell (Ruditapes decussatus) (Henry, 1987); blue mussel (Mytilus edulis) (Janssen, 1981) and king scallop (Pecten maximus) (Henry et al., 1993; Henry et al., 1991). The movement of food through the digestive tract of the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas and the sites of enzyme action and uptake of nutrients is shown in Fig. 19.
gipz | Experiments performed on C. gigas have shown that when the animal is starved or has been out of the water for a long period, all of the cavities are empty (Boucaud-Camou et al., 1985; Lebesnerais, 1985). Whole algae have been observed in the stomach, the main ducts of the digestive gland, the intestine and the rectum. Without being subjected to enzyme action, this material begins to be expelled through the anus, surrounded by mucus. The duration of this stage is strongly influenced by temperature: 6 h at 10℃ and 3 h at 20℃. The animal continuously compensates for this loss by taking in new food. From the beginning of their entry into the ducts of the digestive gland (1-2h), the nutrient particles are exposed to enzymes, although living cells (algae) have been observed for around 6 h after food has reached the stomach and 8-16 h in the intestine.

9bz4 | Due to the pronounced endocytotic nature of the digestive caeca, this gland is a major site for the uptake of metal and organic contaminants. A wide range of enzymes that degrade organic contaminants has been detected in the digestive gland of numerous bivalves (Livingstone et al., 2000; Livingstone & Pipe, 1992). Metallothioneins, antioxidant enzymes and oxyradical scavengers, such as glutathione have also been found in these glands (Lowe & Pipe, 1994; Moore, 1991).
yfv2 | In molluscs, proteins are taken up by pinocytosis by the acinar epithelium of the digestive ceca/diverticula, following which they are hydrolyzed to amino acids. Experiments on marine bivalves have provided evidence of significant uptake of amino acids via the gills (this is discussed in more detail in a later lecture).
pujl | 4. Energy storage
3rqe | A significant proportion of the energy coming from food is used to cover the metabolic requirements, particularly those associated with reproduction. The reserves are stored either in tissues which are specific to this function or in tissues which have a different physiological function (muscle, digestive gland, haemocytes). In addition to its role in the digestion of food, the digestive gland serves as a site for the storage of metabolic reserves and the control of the distribution of assimilated energy utilised during gametogenesis and during periods of physiological stress (Thompson et al., 1974).
nsi3 | In the blue mussel (Mytilus edulis) storage tissues are present in the mantle and in the visceral mass and are made up of two types of cell in juxtaposition: adipogranulous cells (ADG); vesiculous cells with glycogen (vesicular connective tissue (VCT) (Houtteville, 1974; Labet, 1959; Pipe, 1987). The ADG cells (6-20 um) are spherical and occupy the spaces between the VCT. Glycogen is very abundant and accumulates in a voluminous vacuole.
nil3 | The flat oyster (Ostrea edulis) possesses only vesiculous cells with glycogen. The vesicular connective tissue forms a bed which may be highly developed, adhering to the mantle by the external surface and enveloping the visceral mass (gonad and digestive gland).
68a1 | A correlation between the activity of the reserve tissue and that of the gonad was established several years ago in the blue mussel (Mytilus edulis). Gabbott et al. (1976) showed that glycogen disappeared progressively during the maturation of the gonad; at the same time both the volume and number of cells of the reserve tissue regressed (Peek et al., 1989) (Fig. 20).
seik | Studies of the ultrastructure and the cytochemistry revealed the existence of a complex processes of autophagy (a catabolic mechanism that involves degradation of unnecessary or dysfunctional cellular components by intracellular lysosomes) which destroy the ADG (Houtteville, 1974; Pipe, 1987). Metabolites are thus released and

hkft | these products of lysis become distributed around the tubules of the gonad and are absorbed by the young oocytes by pinocytosis. Most of the ADGs are destroyed. The VTCs also lose their glycogen through the action of lysosomes (cellular organelles that contain acid hydrolase enzymes that break down waste materials); this may also entail a total lysis of cells. The activity of glycogen phosphorylase is intense.
jai3 | Regeneration of reserve tissue begins at the end of the annual period of reproduction (Houtteville, 1974) and is brought about by haemocytes which accumulate between the gonad tubules and then form a loose mesh tissue. The synthesis begins from spring onwards and lasts to the autumn in mussels in northern latitudes, which corresponds both to the annual cessation of spawning and the period when food is most abundant. There is a significant increase in somatic growth following the drop due to the emission of gametes; this appears as a marked increase in the rate of linear growth.
p57i | The reproductive strategy of oysters is different from that of mussels. There is no relationship between the glycogen reserves and gonad maturation (Gabbott, 1976; Walne, 1970). In the European oyster (Ostrea edulis) gametogenesis and the accumulation of glycogen take place at the same time. The increase in the availability of food in spring meets the energy requirements of the oyster and the increase in temperature at this time accelerates gametogenesis. An identical pattern occurs in the Atlantic oyster (Crassostrea virginica) and the Pacific oyster (C. gigas). In all species, the highest level of glycogen occurs before the resumption of sexual activity, the period where growth in oysters is particularly fast. Glycogen levels drop dramatically after the emission of gametes in summer in species where fecundity is high, but this drop is less marked in the flat oyster ( Ostrea edulis) which has a lower fecundity.
