You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

pxbq | Experiences of Pulmonary Rehabilitation in People Living with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease and Frailty A Qualitative Interview Study
jfsr | Abstract
u15r | Rationale: People living with both chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and frailty have high potential to benefit from pulmonary rehabilitation but face challenges completing programs. However, research to understand ways to optimize participation in this group is lacking.
lq35 | Objectives: To explore the experiences, needs, and preferences of people with COPD and frailty referred for outpatient pulmonary rehabilitation.
3g9w | Methods: Semistructured interviews with people with COPD and physical frailty, purposively sampled by age, living status, level of frailty, and completion of pulmonary rehabilitation. Thematic analysis with a critical realist perspective was used, involving relevant stakeholders with clinical, academic, and lived experience for interpretive rigor.
d09o | Results: Nineteen people with COPD and frailty were interviewed, with a median age of 78 years (range, 58-88). Nine did not complete their pulmonary rehabilitation program. Four themes were identified: striving to adapt to multidimensional loss, tensions of balancing support with independence, pulmonary rehabilitation as a challenge worth facing, and overcoming unpredictable disruptions to participation. Participants described constantly adapting to their changing health and resulting multidimensional losses
ylhz | (e.g., functional abilities, relationships, confidence). This involved traversing between independence and seeking support, set against a mismatch between their needs and what support is available. People with COPD and frailty can be highly motivated to participate in pulmonary rehabilitation, despite the physical and mental demands it entails, and report a range of benefits. Yet in the context of changeable health, they must often overcome multiple unpredictable disruptions to completing rehabilitation programs. Participant determination and flexibility of services can facilitate ongoing attendance, but for some, these unpredictable disruptions erode their motivation to attend.
a3td | Conclusions: People with COPD and frailty experience accumulating, multidimensional loss. This group are motivated to complete pulmonary rehabilitation but often require additional support and flexibility owing to fluctuating and unpredictable health. Person-centered approaches should be considered to minimize disruptive health events and support pulmonary rehabilitation participation and completion. Service adaptations could allow more flexibility to meet the changing needs of this group and enable communication around how pulmonary rehabilitation might align with their priorities.
ex5k | Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) affects multiple body systems and has been described as reflecting an "accelerated aging" (1). COPD frequently occurs in the context of multimorbidity: more than 60% of people with COPD live with two or more additional health conditions (2). Related to this, people with COPD have twice the odds of living with frailty than people of a similar age without COPD (3).
9d4o | Frailty is a multidimensional syndrome characterized by decreased reserve and diminished resistance to stressors (4). Physical dimensions of frailty are characterized by diminished strength and endurance and reduced physiological function (5). Recognition of frailty offers advantages over measures of disease severity, particularly in the context of multimorbidity, in that it incorporates a more holistic understanding of a person's health and limitations (6). Pooled prevalence estimates suggest that 19% of people with COPD are living with frailty, whereas a further 56% are prefrail (3). People with COPD and frailty are at increased risk of mortality (7, 8) and readmission after hospitalization for an exacerbation of their disease (9). In comparison with their nonfrail counterparts, people with COPD and frailty experience poorer physical function and health status (10) as well as increased anxiety and depression symptoms (11) and are less likely to receive disease-modifying interventions (12).
cjq2 | Participating in exercise improves outcomes for people with COPD (13, 14) or frailty (15, 16) and is recommended by clinical guidelines for each condition (17, 18). For people with both COPD and frailty, pulmonary rehabilitation is associated with improvements in frailty status (11, 19), breathlessness, exercise performance, physical activity levels, and health status (11, 20). However, people with COPD and frailty are less likely to start, and complete, pulmonary rehabilitation (11).
5esx | People with COPD report multiple challenges to participation in exercise-based interventions, including lack of perceived benefit, concurrent burden of comorbid conditions, conflicts with other priorities,
m5ka | difficulties with mobility and travel, fear of worsening symptoms, low energy and motivation, and exacerbations of their COPD (21-23). Similar barriers are noted by people living with frailty, including conflicting commitments (e.g., hobbies, caring responsibilities), physical limitations (e.g., pain, fatigue), and challenges around access and travel (24, 25). Although some view exercise positively (24), others report disengaging owing to perceiving frailty as inevitable in older age, and feeling disempowered or depersonalized in their interactions with services (26).
byu8 | Understanding (non-)participation and identifying optimal ways of supporting people with COPD and frailty is a priority for improving outcomes for this population (27). People with both COPD and frailty have high potential to gain from, but also a high likelihood of facing challenges to completing, pulmonary rehabilitation (11). Yet, research with people with COPD and frailty to understand their specific needs and challenges is lacking, and optimal models of exercise for this group are not well understood. We aimed to explore the experiences, needs and preferences of people living with both COPD and frailty referred for pulmonary rehabilitation, to optimize service delivery for this group. Our objectives were to: 1) understand the experiences and preferences of people living with COPD and frailty; 2) identify current support and areas of unmet need; and 3) explore motivation for, and barriers to, continued participation in pulmonary rehabilitation.
76b0 | Methods
zxz6 | Design
xnth | We conducted a qualitative interview study within a critical realist paradigm (28). This means participants' responses were deemed to reflect a reality that can be understood through empirical means. Yet, we also acknowledge the influence of social and cultural structures in understanding this reality. We drew on theories around successful aging (29), self-regulation (30), and stress and
vafm | coping (31) to develop a comprehensive topic guide and inform data interpretation. For example, successful aging theory (29) aided exploration of how people adapt, reprioritize, and compensate in response to losses in function in older age; the common-sense model of self-regulation (30) provided a framework for understanding interactions with services and broader health behaviors, and the transactional model of emotions and coping (31) supported our understanding of how coping arises from perceptions of stressors and available resources. Although we drew on specific theories with the intention of developing a richer explanation of reality, we were cognizant that they could be challenged by new data (28).
2zmw | Setting and Recruitment
bf9k | We recruited participants from two London hospitals providing outpatient pulmonary rehabilitation. Clinical staff identified potential participants during their initial assessments for pulmonary rehabilitation. A researcher then periodically followed up with those interested in participating, so that they could be potentially sampled when they stopped or completed their pulmonary rehabilitation.
otkr | Participants and Sampling People referred for pulmonary
ibgs | rehabilitation with a physician diagnosis of COPD, who at initial assessment were identified as physically frail using the Short Physical Performance Battery (32) (SPPB; score of ≤9), were invited to participate. The SPPB scores performance across three tests: standing balance, habitual gait speed, and ability to stand. Total scores range from 0 (low function) to 12 (high function). Thresholds of ≤9 and ≤7 have been suggested to indicate prefrailty and frailty, respectively (33). Patients' informal caregivers also participated if patients preferred. People under the age of 18 years, unable to speak English, or without capacity to provide informed consent were excluded.
colo | We purposively sampled participants by age (> or ≤80 yr), living status (alone or with others), level of physical frailty (SPPB scores of > or ≤7), and completion of
d6r4 | pulmonary rehabilitation (did or did not complete). Within the group who did not complete pulmonary rehabilitation, we attempted to sample those who were and were not admitted to hospital.
