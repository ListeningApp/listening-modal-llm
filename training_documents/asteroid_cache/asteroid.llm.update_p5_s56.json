        "content": "7fqw | Stannern also contains several fluorine-rich apatite and merrillite grains in igneous lithic clasts and in the granulitic recrystallized matrix. Apatite grains in the granulitic areas appear as an intergrowth with ilmenite, plagioclase, and silica-rich mesostasis. Numerous fractures intersect both the granulitic areas and the surrounding igneous clasts. The apatite and merrillite grains in the igneous clasts are anhedral and highly fractured and are adjacent to equilibrated pyroxene, plagioclase, and isolated ilmenite. The six apatite grains and one merrillite grain yielded isochron age of three thousand nine hundred seventy-five plus or minus one hundred ten million years (mean square weighted deviation equals zero point two seven) and a lead two hundred seven to lead two hundred six isochron age of four thousand one hundred thirty-four plus or minus forty-seven million years (mean square weighted deviation equals five point three). The high mean square weighted deviation value indicates that the uranium-lead system in the Stannern phosphates has been disturbed. The model two zero seven lead star over two zero six lead star ages vary from approximately four thousand two hundred seventy million years to four thousand eighty million years. Their weighted mean value is four thousand one hundred forty-three point zero plus or minus twelve point five million years, except for the oldest outlier Stn-five; four thousand two hundred two.\nrhaz | Four point two. U-Pb chronology of phosphates in the unbrecciated achondrites\nwak1 | In Agoult, euhedral to rounded grains of fluorine-rich apatite with sizes of ten to one hundred micrometer were observed homogeneously throughout the studied section. Their uranium-lead age can be determined more precisely compared to those of the other brecciated eucrites. The seven grains with ten spot analyses yielded a two hundred thirty-eight uranium to two hundred six lead isochron",
