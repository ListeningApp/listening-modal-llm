You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

pk06 | We identified 1234 different sources that published papers on SES. The top 20 journals each published between 0.63% and 7.73% of all publications, accounting for 28.05% of publications in total (Fig. 3a). There were significant differences in the median number of publications between the five most prominent journals <LATEX>\left( x ^ { 2 } = \right.</LATEX> 32.1302, <LATEX>\mathrm { D F } = 4 ,</LATEX> <LATEX>\mathrm { p } < 0 . 0 0 0 1 ,</LATEX> with Ecology and Society having significantly more publications (compared to Ambio, <LATEX>\mathrm { p } < 0 . 0 0 0 1 ,</LATEX> Ecological Economics, <LATEX>p = 0 . 0 1 9 ,</LATEX> Global Environmental Change, <LATEX>p = 0 0 1 ,</LATEX> Journal of Environmental Management, <LATEX>\left. \mathrm { p } < 0 . 0 0 0 1 \right) .</LATEX> There were no significant differences between other journals (Fig. 3b). Ambio and Global Environmental Change published proportionally more papers in the SES field prior to 2000, while Ecology and Society has become increasingly dominant as the main journal publishing SES research since 2000 (Fig. 3c).

When normalizing institutional paper count by the number of higher education institutions in the country, Kenya, Denmark, and New Zealand were also included as hotspot countries. The lead authors of institutions publishing SES research was most frequently associated with Stockholm University (199 studies), Arizona State University (179 studies), Wageningen University (97 studies), James Cook University (79 Studies), and the University of Queensland (71 studies; Table 2).
hntf | Whereas institutions conducting SES research were clustered in the Global North, the SES being investigated were distributed more broadly across the globe (Fig. 4c, d). Studied SES were most frequently reported to be located in the United States (422), China (226), Australia (169), India (167), Canada (142), Brazil (134), and Mexico (100). A one-way ANOVA revealed significant differences between regions <LATEX>\left( F = 5 . 0 6 8 , \right.</LATEX> <LATEX>\mathrm { P } < 0 . 0 0 1 ,</LATEX> <LATEX>\mathrm { d f } = 1 4</LATEX> Fig. 5), but a posthoc Tukey test revealed that significant differences were mostly between island regions and mainland areas, and that most mainland areas were not significantly different from each other, on average. Even when accounting for size, the Caribbean Islands were understudied compared to most regions.

We subsequently searched all abstracts and key words of the full dataset of articles (4479 studies) for the identified key words. Searching the full dataset, and combining some key terms (see Appendix 2), changed the prominence of key terms slightly. In the final analysis, the top 20 terms differed significantly <LATEX>\left( x ^ { 2 } = 5 3 2 6 . 3 7 7 \right. ,</LATEX> <LATEX>d f = 2 5 ,</LATEX> <LATEX>\mathrm { p } < 0 . 0 0 0 1</LATEX> in the frequency with which they were used in the literature. The terms that were most frequently encountered in author key words were (variations of) "policy" (30.8% of publications), "trade" (23.8%), "conservation"(22.3%), "adaptation" (22.3%), "land use change" (21.9%), "water" (20.2%), "forest loss" (19.9%), "sustainability" (18.8%) and "urban" (18.8%) and "governance and institutions" (17.5%; Fig 6b, Appendix 2).

nv42 | Table 4 shows how well each method category scores in terms of its ability to account for each characteristic of complexity, zero ("0") being "usually not well" and "x" being "usually well," along with a justification for each scoring decision. We judged "futures analysis," "comparative case study analysis," "behavioral analysis," "decision analysis," "games," "systems scoping," "participatory modeling and planning," "state-and-transition analysis," "historical profiling and reconstruction," "discourse analysis," and "facilitated dialogues" to be method categories that usually address all six features of CAS (mean score = 1). Method categories "optimization analysis," "impact analysis," "quantitative pattern recognition," and "statistical analysis" were reasoned to address features of complexity least well. The features of complexity that were best addressed were "constituted relationally," followed by "contextual" and "dynamic," "adaptive," "complex causality" and "radically open."

xek3 | Our study provides insights on trends in the SES research field in terms of the terminology used, journals being published in, the type of research, where it is being done and by whom, topics being investigated, and the methods being used. Although a number of reviews (Brandt et al. 2013, Droste et al. 2018, Herrero-Jáuregui et al. 2018, Partelow 2018, Colding and Barthel 2019) exploring

Here we discuss five broad conclusions from these results, and their implications for advancing SES research.
