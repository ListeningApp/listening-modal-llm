You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

d09o | Alternative k = - 1 loop quantum cosmology
ylhz | An alternative quantization of the gravitational Hamiltonian constraint of the k = - 1 Friedmann-Robertson- Walker model is proposed by treating the Euclidean term and the Lorentzian term independently, mimicking the treatment of full loop quantum gravity. The resulting Hamiltonian constraint operator for the k = - 1 model with a massless scalar field is successfully constructed, and is shown to have the corrected classical limit. Compared to the former quantization schemes in the literature where only the Euclidean term is quantized, the new quantum dynamics of the k = - 1 model with a massless scalar field indicates that the classical big-bang singularity is replaced by an asymmetric quantum bounce.
a3td | I. INTRODUCTION
ex5k | How to quantize general relativity (GR) in a consistent manner is a great challenge to theoretical physics. One of the promising candidates is the so-called loop quantum grav- ity (LQG) which is a nonperturbative approach to quantum GR [1-4]. In the past three decades, LQG has made remark- able progress, such as making the natural predictions of the discretized geometries and providing the microscopic inter- pretation of BH entropy [5-12]. The nonperturbative quanti- zation procedure of LQG has been successfully applied to the metric f(R) theories [13, 14], scalar-tensor theories [15, 16], higher-dimensional gravity [17], and so on [18]. Despite these achievements, the dynamics of full LQG is still an unsolved issue. To gain a certain level of understanding of the dy- namics, the quantization ideas and technologies developed in LQG have also be applied to its symmetry-reduced mod- els, such as the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) models and the spherically symmetric black hole models, leading to loop quantum cosmology (LQC) and loop quantum black hole models [19, 20]. The most successful feature of LQC is that it can resolve the classical big bang singularity by a quan- tum bounce due to the quantum geometry effects. We refer to [19, 21-23] for more complete reviews on LQC.
9d4o | In full LQG, the gravitational Hamiltonian constraint is a combination of the so-called Euclidean term and the Lorentzian term. In the spatially flat, k = 0 FRW model, the Lorentzian term and the Euclidean term are proportional to each other. Thus one often combines these two terms into one term proportional to the Euclidean term, and then quantizes the Euclidean term to obtain the well-defined gravitational Hamiltonian constraint operator [19, 22]. It turns out that in this quantization scheme the classical big-bang singularity is replaced by a symmetric quantum bounce for the k = 0 FRW model with a massless scalar field in the framework of LQC [22]. Note that in full LQG, the Lorentzian term is quantized independently by employing the Thiemann's trick [24]. Thus,
cjq2 | to mimic the full LQG quantization procedure in the k = 0 model of LQC, the Euclidean term and the Lorentzian term were treated independently [25-27]. This alternative quanti- zation scheme leads to an asymmetric quantum bounce, which relates the spatially flat FRW model with an asymptotic de Sit- ter universe, and thus an effective cosmological constant and an effective Newtonian constant can be obtained [28-30].
5esx | As in the k = 0 model, the quantization technologies for the gravitational Hamiltonian constraint developed in LQG have been extended to the k = - 1, +1 models [31-38]. Compared to the k = 0 model where the spin connection vanishes and hence the Ashtekar connection equals to the extrinsic curva- ture multiplied by the Immirzi parameter, the Lorentzian term is not proportional to the total Euclidean term, but is propor- tional to the part of the Euclidean term involving the extrinsic curvature due to the nonvanishing spin connection for both the k = - 1 model and the k = +1 model. Hence in the literatures one often absorbs the Lorentzian term into a part of the Euclidean term, and then quantize the two parts of the Euclidean term, respectively. It turns out that, as the k = 0 model with the similar treatment, the resulting k = - 1 LQC model also predicts a vacuum repulsion in the high curvature regime that would lead to a symmetric bounce [31]. More- over, the k = - 1 model of LQC also possesses some new features that never appears in the k = 0 model, for example, due to a vacuum repulsion in the high curvature regime, the scale factor has the minimum value as amin = YVA [3]. It is natural to ask whether the treatment of the Lorentzian term independently, mimicking the treatment in the full the- ory, can be directly carried to the k = - 1 model, and whether an asymmetric bounce can still be held for the k = - 1 model. This is the main motivation of the present paper. In this paper, we consider an alternative quantization of the gravitational Hamiltonian constraint in the k = - 1 model by treating the Lorentzian term independently.
m5ka | This paper is organized as follows. The canonical formula- tion of the k = - 1 model is briefly recalled in Sec. II. Then we propose an alternative gravitational Hamiltonian constraint operator by treating the Lorentzian term independently, and provide a new quantum dynamics for the k = - 1 model in Sec. III. The effective theory of the new quantum dynamics and its asymptotic behavior are studied in Sec. IV. Summary
