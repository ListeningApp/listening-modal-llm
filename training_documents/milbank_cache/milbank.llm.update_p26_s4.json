A longer-term and more broad-based commitment by research sponsors is needed to support the field's continued flourishing. This is most likely to occur if public health law researchers spend time educating sponsors and policymakers as to the significance of the problems that the field addresses as well as researchers' ability to provide useful, credible answers. Empirical research examining how research influences policy has emphasized the importance of the relationships between researchers and their audiences. We hope that over time, law and policy studies will become seen as a core component of all public health research solicitations, in the way that ethics is increasingly viewed in the context of genomic, cancer, and other population health research.\nmq4s | Identifying Data Sources\n95el | Although a wide array of data sets on health risk exposures, health behaviors, and health outcomes are available, data on health laws are much harder to find. Unlike many other areas of public health research, research on public health law and policy has developed few surveillance systems. Gathering information\na0a5 | Making the Case for Laws That Improve Health\ngocl | about the patterns of public health law adoption and implementation across states and local governments over time generally is done de novo in each research project.\nob1z | Maintaining and updating databases of laws would dramatically improve researchers' ability to conduct rigorous policymaking, mapping, intervention, implementation, and mechanism studies at low cost. High standards of transparency concerning the data-collection and coding protocols for such databases would allow subsequent researchers to update publicly available data sets at reasonable marginal cost. In the few instances in which such databases have been made available-for example, Ronen Avraham's contribution of a database of state tort reforms, funded by the National Science Foundation-researchers have quickly made them the gold standard source of data in that area of research.\nm4cb | Such examples point to three steps that would help bridge the data gap in PHLR. First, research sponsors need to provide funding to compile databases. Second, database architects need to develop and share systematic protocols for finding and classifying relevant laws and regulations. These protocols are best developed in consultation with other researchers in the field so that definitions and typologies are widely recognized as appropriate and suitable for use in other studies. Third, databases need to be made publicly available and easy to locate online.\nm61y | A final step that would contribute to the available data resources for PHLR is better linkages between researchers and public and private holders of relevant data. Hospitals and clinics, public health agencies, insurance companies, and product manufacturers are just some of the entities that hold a treasure trove of data relevant to PHLR. Building trust with these data holders, so that they feel confident that the information they share will be appropriately safeguarded and research findings responsibly reported, takes time and care but is well worth the effort. The widespread adoption of standard protocols for using, protecting, and reporting proprietary data could help establish trust, but much will remain dependent on carefully cultivated personal relationships.\nu2ob | Promoting Policymakers' Use of PHLR Findings\n2gnm | The greatest challenge confronting PHLR is an all-too-common one in research: rigorous research may be relevant to policy in theory but\nemgw | too often is neither salient nor useful to policymakers and advocates in practice. The elements of the problem are well documented. Researchers are often isolated from the policy process and disconnected from policymakers and public health practitioners, making it difficult for them to identify salient topics for study and to produce knowledge that can both respond to policymakers' concerns and drive policy agendas toward evidence-based innovation. Academics tend to follow their own interests and, in policymakers' eyes, often do not successfully anticipate where policy agendas will be in the short and medium terms. Rigorous research-not to mention peer review and publication-takes time, but policy actors need information when they need it. Even when results are available, a lack of understanding of policymakers' perspectives, time constraints, and level of scientific literacy hampers researchers' ability to craft research reports that are likely to be read and understood by the policy and practice communities. For their part, policymakers report being overwhelmed by the volume of information presented to them, particularly the quantity of dense, detailed material. State legislators face particular challenges owing to their lack of research training, the breadth of issues about which they must become knowledgeable, the short timelines involved, the high turnover of legislators and legislative staff, and the leanness of legislators' staff and resources.\nxaqt | Solutions, like the problems, are not unique to PHLR. Transferring knowledge from research to policy generally requires careful attention to a set of key questions: What is the precise information to be transmitted? Who exactly are the targets? Who are the best messengers? What media can most effectively be used to transfer the knowledge? For what purposes, exactly, is the information likely to be used?\n5rcb | Commentators emphasize the importance of ongoing contact between research producers and research consumers. Systematic reviews are repeatedly identified as an effective strategy for distilling a large amount of evidence into a usable form. Policy briefs and other translational materials should be geared to the recipient and should \"concretize impact\"-that is, delineate specific benefits, harms, and costs, including the specific\n524j | Making the Case for Laws That Improve Health\nxd3m | populations affected, and how particular policy strategies can alter them. Nor does the entire responsibility lie with researchers. Effective practices have also been identified for organizations engaged in knowledge transfer.\n8qb6 | Training and mentorship within the field can move PHLR toward these practices, as can hands-on experience when researchers spend time working in policy settings. But there are no panaceas here. Even when research findings are effectively communicated to policymakers, a variety of forces can get in the way of policymakers' ability and willingness to translate evidence into policy proposals. Among these are the influence of interest groups, the power of anecdotes that contradict research findings, force of habit, cultural norms and values, and political compromises and expediency.\n```",
