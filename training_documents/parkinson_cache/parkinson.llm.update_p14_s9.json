        "content": "yfum | ATPase cation transporting thirteen A two, another lysosomal protein which localizes on its membrane with unknown function, has been implicated in Parkinson's disease. Autosomal recessive, early-onset parkinsonism due to ATP thirteen A two mutations were first noted in Kufor-Rakeb Syndrome, followed by recent studies in other forms of parkinsonism. Fibroblasts from these patients showed impaired lysosomal acidification and proteostasis, leading to inefficiency in substrate degradation and autophagosome clearance. These observations were replicated in ATP thirteen A two knockdown dopaminergic cell lines, where its restoration re-established lysosomal homeostasis and ameliorated cell death. Downregulation of ATP thirteen A two was also seen in nigral neurons of sporadic Parkinson's disease patients, along with traces in Lewy bodies. A loss-of-function ATP thirteen A two mutant mouse model revealed age-related lysosomal dysfunction, protein aggregation, and gliosis leading to motor abnormalities. Interestingly, the levels of total and oligomeric alpha-synuclein were normal, despite ubiquitinated protein aggregation, cathepsin-D dysfunction, and autophagy defects. These observations suggest that ATP thirteen A two mutations may lead to Parkinson's disease through an alpha-synuclein independent mechanism.\nppx4 | Seven. E-L system; a key target of key Parkinson's disease-associated proteins?\nqf11 | Seven point one. alpha-synuclein:\n8oqt | Misfolded alpha-synuclein can trigger Parkinson's disease pathogenesis in the presynaptic terminals of nigrostriatal neurons. This may as well be one of the earliest pathogenic events in Parkinson's disease, where alpha-synuclein aggregates target synaptic vesicle endocytosis, synaptic vesicle trafficking, and autophagy components of the E-L system to initiate or exacerbate dopaminergic neuronal dysfunction.\n6zah | Alpha-synuclein and other family members function in presynaptic terminals, where they modulate synaptic vesicle distribution and neurotransmission. The biophysical properties of synucleins reveal their ability to sense and modify membrane curvature. These functions suggest that synucleins regulate synaptic vesicle exocytosis and endocytosis. Studies in knockout mice in fact show that synucleins normally function post synaptic vesicle exocytosis, in fusion pore expansion and/or control the kinetics of synaptic vesicle endocytosis by facilitating membrane curvature. Alpha-synuclein also appears to control synaptic vesicle availability for release by regulating synaptic vesicle clustering.\n4v5o | On a pathological level, several studies show that overexpression of alpha-synuclein inhibits neurotransmission. The locus of this consistent effect is not clear. Studies have shown that elevated alpha-synuclein levels and oligomeric alpha-synuclein inhibit synaptic vesicle exocytosis in a SNARE-dependent manner or affecting synaptic vesicle clustering. On the other hand, considerable evidence suggests that aggregated alpha-synuclein primarily impacts synaptic vesicle endocytosis, which is of relevance to E-L system genes linked to Parkinson's disease. In lamprey giant synapses, injection of aggregated alpha-synuclein is identified to inhibit clathrin uncoating as evidenced by the accumulation of clathrin-coated vesicles when synaptic vesicle recycling was evoked by high-frequency stimulation. A recent study also suggests that extra synuclein might sequester Hsc seventy thus affecting clathrin uncoating, subsequently causing synaptic vesicle recycling defects. Similar observation was made in mammalian Calyx of Held synapse, where acute elevation of monomeric and mutant alpha-synuclein levels decreased synaptic vesicle endocytosis with frequency-dependent effect on synaptic vesicle exocytosis. This was also seen upon transgenic expression of alpha-synuclein. Overexpression of mutant alpha-synuclein also affects dopamine transporter trafficking on the presynaptic membrane, leading to dopamine dyshomeostasis. The observations that overexpression and deletion of synucleins have similar effects on synaptic vesicle exo- and endocytosis suggest that synaptic vesicle cycling is exquisitely sensitive to alpha-synuclein levels. Further understanding of the precise mechanisms for interactions of alpha-synuclein and synaptic E-L system proteins involved in Parkinson's disease will provide crucial insights on early causal pathogenic events in Parkinson's disease.\nha9e | At the soma, aggregated alpha-synuclein mainly targets E-L system trafficking, especially the retromer pathway. Recent studies propose that aggregated alpha-synuclein disrupts the retromer complex by interacting through VPS twenty-six or VPS twenty-nine, and thus preventing the recruitment of\nxrnt | Seven point two. LRRK two:\nc8ra | adaptors like Snx three and SNX-BAR dimers. Deficiency of VPS thirty-five in dopaminergic neurons impairs endosome-to-Golgi retrieval of receptors like Lamp two a, accelerating its lysosomal degradation. Lamp two a is a critical receptor for chaperone-mediated autophagy of misfolded alpha-synuclein, so its deficiency leads to a vicious cycle of alpha-synuclein accumulation, which might be the case in patients with VPS thirty-five mutations. Overexpression of alpha-synuclein also directly compromises macroautophagy through inhibition of Rab one a. It is also pertinent to note that aggregated alpha-synuclein in the soma is a key target of treatment strategies in development through induction of macroautophagy.",
