        "content": "y7ea | Conclusions\nnav4 | MS is a disease of immune-mediated inflammation that attacks myelinated axons in the central nervous system, causing different degrees of damage. Lidwina of Schiedam recorded the first MS case. After that, Augustus d'Este spent years writing about how his MS symptoms progressed. Currently, its prevalence and incidents are on the rise across the world. Low levels of vitamin D in the blood, genetics, smoking, and infection have been linked to the development of MS. MS patients may be recognized at an earlier and earlier stage of the condition as diagnostic techniques and criteria advance. Furthermore, as a consequence of advances in our knowledge of the pathophysiology and course of MS, extraordinary progress has been made in its treatment. Introducing extremely effective medications has resulted in near-total control of recurring diseases and localized brain inflammation. However, effective progression treatment remains unfulfilled, as existing drugs provide limited protection against the neurodegenerative aspects of MS. MS is often treated with disease-modifying medications such as fingolimod, siponimod, interferon beta, rituximab, natalizumab, and dimethyl fumarate. These medications are effective but have some side effects. Although studies imply that the long-term course of the disease has improved dramatically with the therapy age, more clinical and real-world evaluations are required to obtain evidence of these medications' long-term effectiveness and safety.\ngem8 | Additional Information\ne8nr | Disclosures\nk78w | Conflicts of interest: In compliance with the ICMJE uniform disclosure form, all authors declare the following: Payment/services info: All authors have declared that no financial support was received from any organization for the submitted work.
