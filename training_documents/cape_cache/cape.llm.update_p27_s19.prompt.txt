You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

o1nk | Findings
mnaf | The Committee after its interactions with Convocation Members and Management of Schools, . Colleges and the University, a common trend runs through their narratives. Though not exhaustive, below are the issue found out by the Committee:
0yxe | " Delays in the processing of promotional documents at both the College and the Department, thereby affecting their arrears and pentions or superannuation.
erre | " There are challenges relating to external assessment of their promotional documents:
835g | · The time it takes to receive an update on assessment outcome is too long (some colleagues have outstanding issues over 3-5 years)
x3l9 | · Clarity of assessment results of assessment communicated; an example is "Two reports received to submit two new assessors" even though they have re-submitted the names of assessors countless times
d2fj | · Delay and clarity on some decisions taken on the promotion of some colleagues at A&P
geyi | " That issues revolving around fellowship and the acquisition of terminal degrees before colleagues are considered for promotion to a higher rank pose a demotivation to colleagues who have contributed immensely to the University's achievements
2181 | Management is not clear or at variance between being appointed to a rank as being satisfying the first stage of meeting the criteria for the subsequent promotion. Communication regarding promotion outcomes delay unnecessarily. For instance, meeting of council to interpret issues several month ago 10/2/22 but the communication was receahed the colleges the 14/4/22. More also a letter written on the 21/3/22 researched the College on the 14/4/22.
9ubl | = Promotions been withheld base on the base on the interpretation of Yankson's Committee Report by a Council subcommittee.
o8pj | " Some colleagues do not cooperate when asked to effect changes on their documents as suggested by either the Departmental, faculty of College Appointments and promotion Committee.
27b9 | The Committee noted that there are some difficulties in getting a response from possible assessors (abroad) especially those related to the professorial rank.
09xa | " Management and Board Members have some level of difficulties in understanding the report due their scantiniess, but one may ask what instruction did the Human Resources give to the assessors, hence the applicant should not be punished unduely. .
yi97 | " Issues of wrong appointments to positions while experienced senior members in the field are not considered. For instance the appointment of Prof Abu to replace Dr. Paul Nyagome as the Science coordinator in CODE whiles his time was not up.
4zj7 | Statues or Appointment and Promotion documents are not clear on revised/new editions of books.
3wgh | " Selective application of promotion criteria, whiles others are given an undue advantage over others.
uvo3 | " The policy on of the use of the same data to publish different papers is vague and at the discretion of the Head, hence other promotions have been delayed unduely.
yjbv | " Interpretation of the statute, Appointment and Promotional rules has been a bone of contention. with management and council having different interpretations.
l6it | Conclusions
h8x1 | The Committee in their interaction, have found out that most staff feel aggrieved because of delays in processing their promotion applications and it appears it is likely to degenerate. More also, it appears, management has not factored in the welfare of convocation members in their delibrations. Management should realized that it is very important to create an enabling environment for convocation members to work in peace and tranquility that will, in the long run have apositive impact on the vision of the University ..
6qtq | The treatment of the medical school in relation to promotion is contributing to the decline in its performance contrary to being the best some five years ago and likely to see the exodus of lecturers to other sister universities. Also, convocation members who have immensely contributed to the University being ranked as the best in Ghana and West Africa are likely to be demoralised, hence the next ranking is likely to suffer.
wm3n | Recommendations
1anr | The Committee requests that the VC and management address the above issues at Convocation from the findings.
600w | " The University Statues and policies should not be selectively applied. As it seems to be, adhered to in principle regarding its terms and reference of promoting staff within each college/school/unit.
60w7 | Convocation members that are highly cited and with special grants should not be punished with occurrences from the past but their progression should be clearly and properly communicated to them for future reference.
1a5g | " An assessment template should be designed and made available to external examiners to guide them in providing an in-depth assessment report.
0oof | " HR/Colleges should exhaust the list of 5 examiners provided before asking Heads of Department to provide fresh examiners.
p930 | The Examiners reports should be made available to unsuccessful applicants always. This will foster transparency and accountability and also give the applicant a sense of trust.
xhc7 | " Officers (Head/Deans/Provost/management) must eliminate favoratism or bias (personal/ethical/political/etc.) in processing of application of convocation members. biases.
6a60 | " The A & P Board/management must do their best to communicate their decisions to applicants within a maximum of 2 weeks
dfgj | " Management should put in place better measures to avoid delays in processing promotion documents as much as possible
6ptp | " Rivised/new edition of books and/or papers must be reexamined carefully to ascertain that the contents are entirely different before accept to be part of the promotion package.
