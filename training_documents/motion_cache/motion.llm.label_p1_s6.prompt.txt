  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,

82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

v6sk | Relative Motion Dynamics in the Restricted Three-Body Problem
1wj6 | Giovanni Franzini* and Mario Innocenti+ University of Pisa, 56122 Pisa, Italy DOI: 10.2514/1.A34390
936l | This paper discusses the derivation and simplification of equation sets for the relative motion dynamics characterization in the restricted three-body problem. As opposed to previous models proposed in the literature, the relative motion is studied in a frame local to the target spacecraft, the local-vertical local-horizon frame, and spacecraft state is expressed with respect to the primary about which they are orbiting. The exact description of the relative dynamics is derived, as well as simplified equation sets based on both the elliptic and the circular restricted three-body problems. The accuracy of the simplified sets is analyzed by means of extensive numerical simulations on a realistic rendezvous scenario with a target on lunar orbit.
06yq | Nomenclature
dpv6 | I. Introduction
8r5j | T HE study of the spacecraft relative dynamics is one of the most trending topics in the space research field. As a matter of fact, the characterization of the relative motion is a critical step in the design and the analysis of all the space missions requiring the coordination of two or more spacecraft. Notable examples are rendezvous and docking missions and formation flying, which have drawn the interest of the space community for decades. Worth of mention are also future missions such as in-orbit servicing, debris mitigation, and assembly of large orbital structures, which are increasing the interest in the subject.
2taz | Relative motion in the two-body problem and, in particular, in near-Earth orbits has been studied extensively. The first and most remarkable models were proposed during the 1960s: the Clohessy- Wiltshire equations [1] and the Tschauner-Hempel equations [2]. For years, these sets of equations have been the model of reference for the analysis and the design of relative guidance, navigation, and control systems [3], because they provide linear models for the study of relative motion in circular and elliptic orbits. However, the two sets are based on the following main assumptions: the spacecraft relative

r5il | separation is significantly small compared with the distance from the primary body center of mass, and no orbital perturbations act on them. These assumptions limit the use of the two equation sets in applications such as formation flying, which generally requires to maintain formations over long mission times, while satisfying high- accuracy requirements in order to meet the mission objectives [4]. In such cases orbital perturbation must be taken into account in order to predict the long-term motion, and the linearization error may be non- negligible if long baselines are considered. Therefore, a wide variety of models have been proposed in the literature to overcome these limitations [5].
5gui | The attention received by the study of relative motion in three- body scenarios is not comparable to the two-body case. Depending on the three-body system considered, when the spacecraft fly near the biggest primary, the influence of the second primary is generally modeled as an orbital perturbation (third-body perturbation), as in [6-8]. However, several missions under study are targeting celestial bodies where the third-body influence must be explicitly taken into account in the relative dynamics. Two examples are Phobos Sample Return mission [9] and the Human Lunar Exploration Precursor Program (HLEPP) [10,11]. With reference to the former, the orbital dynamics around Phobos is particularly complex, because the small mass-ratio and length-scale of the Mars-Phobos system result in a sphere of influence of the Martian moon, which is very close to its surface. Hence, the two-body problem is an inaccurate approxi- mation of the spacecraft's dynamics in the vicinity of Phobos [12]. In the HLEPP an habitable station, the Deep Space Gateway (DSG), will fly a near-rectilinear halo orbit (NRHO). Again, two-body- based equation sets cannot be used in this context, because non- Keplerian orbits typical of three-body systems are considered, and models based on the two-body problem generally exploit the characteristic of the Keplerian orbits. Therefore, ad hoc models for relative motion description in the three-body problem must be identified.
82qc | The approach generally adopted in the literature is based on the numerical computation of the difference between the equations that regulate the motion of the two spacecraft. More specifically, the circular restricted three-body problem (CR3BP) is used to model the single spacecraft dynamics, and then the difference is used to numerically describe the relative motion. Examples of this kind of approach applied to formation-flying and rendezvous missions can be found in [13-15]. This type of description has two main limi- tations. First the use of CR3BP equations is inaccurate for some three-body systems, as, for instance, in the Earth-Moon and in the Mars-Phobos cases, where the system eccentricity has a non- negligible influence; see [16] and [12], respectively. Hence, the elliptic restricted three-body problem (ER3BP) must be considered. Second, these sets are developed in a frame rotating with the primaries, generally referred to as the synodic or pulsating reference frame, and centered on one of them, or on their common center of mass, or even in a libration point. Historically, relative motion, especially in rendezvous missions, is studied in a frame local to the target or leader spacecraft, such as the local-vertical local-horizon

t8vv | (LVLH) frame. This choice eases the integration of measurements acquired by spacecraft relative positioning sensors. In addition, the use of a local frame allows to better understand and to characterize the chaser or follower dynamics as seen from the target/leader. This is particularly important in rendezvous and docking missions, in order to analyze and to assess the safety of the maneuvers performed by an incoming chaser spacecraft [3]. Some studies try to solve these limitations. For instance, local frames are considered in [17-19], but only for the analysis and the visualization of the results, not for derivation of the equations of relative motion. The general restricted three-body problem setup is considered in [20], but spacecraft position and velocity is considered with respect to the Sun- Earth L2 libration point, and the relative motion is expressed in the synodic frame.
qvnu | In this paper we propose a characterization of the relative dynamics in a restricted three-body context as seen in a frame local to a target. In particular, we consider a pair of spacecraft, in the following referred to as chaser and target, flying in the vicinity of the smallest primary, in a region where the third-body effect must be explicitly considered into the relative dynamics. Spacecraft position and velocity vectors are expressed with respect to the smallest primary center of mass. Considering, for instance, the Earth-Moon system, this feature is particularly useful in the case one of the spacecraft loses the line of sight with the ground stations on Earth, because measurements are taken with respect to the Moon. In addition, target orbits in restricted three-body scenarios are generally expressed with respect to the smallest primary. The LVLH frame centered on the target is used as a local frame. As opposed to [17-19], the LVLH frame is defined with reference to the smallest primary, in analogy with the frame definition used for rendezvous in Earth orbits, because vehicles incoming from its surface are expected to approach the target. A general set of equations of relative motion in the restricted three-body problem is derived. Conversely to the aforementioned references, the derivation is performed directly in the LVLH frame, making the resulting equation set particularly appealing for rendezvous and docking operations. The only assumption made is the spacecraft having negligible masses with respect to the primaries. Thus, the equations have general validity, and are not restricted to the elliptic or circular three-body problem. Then, the ER3BP and the CR3BP are considered, in order to derive simplified equation sets. A linearization of the sets is also performed in order to provide linear models useful for preliminary relative guidance, navi- gation, and control system design. The accuracy of the equation sets is analyzed by means of extensive Monte Carlo simulations. The HLEPP is used as a reference mission scenario, and an Earth-Moon NRHO is considered for the target. Linear two-body-based equation sets were also considered in the analysis, and their accuracy compared against the three-body based sets. Given the chosen reference mission, and in order to ease the general readability, in the paper we will refer to the Earth-Moon system. Nevertheless, application of the proposed equation to other three-body systems is straightforward, because the simplifications considered in the paper are not based on any peculiar characteristic of the lunar orbit or of the Earth-Moon system.

xrd1 | The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II a brief review of the ER3BP and of the CR3BP is provided, and the spacecraft equations of motion with respect to the Moon are derived. Section III discusses the derivation of equations of relative motion for the exact description of the relative dynamics of a chaser spacecraft with respect to a target in the restricted three-body problem context. Possible simplifications of the relative dynamics are discussed in Sec. IV, where four equation sets are derived. The accuracy of the sets is analyzed in Sec. V. Conclusions are drawn in Sec. VI.

7toz | Consider the three-body system composed by the Earth and the Moon primary bodies and a spacecraft i, with masses Me, Mm, and mi, respectively. Their positions with respect to an inertial frame I is denoted with Re, Rm, and Ri, respectively.
j346 | Each body exerts its gravitational influence on the others, resulting in the following equations of motion for the three bodies:

Relative positions norms are indicated with rei, "mi, and rem. The notation [R]z denotes the acceleration of the body as seen from the inertial frame.

xmgs | We now assume that the mass of the spacecraft i is negligible with respect to the primaries masses (i.e., m; < Me and m; < Mm); that is, we consider the restricted three-body problem. Under this assumption the orbital motion of the two primaries is not affected by the spacecraft, and Eqs. (1) and (2) simplify to:

m047 | where He = GMe and um = GMm are the primaries' gravitational parameters.
gy8c | Assume now that the primaries revolve around their common barycenter in elliptic orbits (elliptic restricted three-body problem). The motion of the two primaries can then be obtained from the solution of the classical two-body problem.
y4mj | The equations of motion for the spacecraft i are generally written in a frame that rotates with the primaries. A Moon or synodic reference frame M: {Rm; Îm, jm, km} is introduced, with origin in the Moon center of mass, and unit vectors defined as follows:
vpgq | Îm =_ Tem, Îm=Km XÎm, Km = Amle , hmle
ousl | where hmle = rem X [ emlz is the specific angular momentum of the Moon with respect to the Earth, and hm/e = |hm/e ||; see Fig. 1. The Earth-Moon system, and consequently the frame M, rotates with respect to the inertial frame I with angular velocity @m/i =@m/ikm.
m4ju | The acceleration of the spacecraft i in the frame M is given by:
