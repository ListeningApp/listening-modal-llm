        "content": "75y3 | Can United States Healthcare Become Environmentally Sustainable? Towards Green Healthcare Reform\ns2g2 | In twenty-fourteen, the United States health care industry\nq1q2 | produced an estimated four hundred eighty million metric tons of carbon dioxide; nearly eight percent of the country's total emissions. Carbon dioxide emissions contribute to climate change, climate-change related health hazards, and international suffering. At the same time, caring for those affected by climate change health hazards produces more carbon emissions. This cyclical response to climate change health hazards is self-defeating. The importance of sustainability in health care - as a business reliant on fossil fuels for transportation, lighting and energy, streams of resources, and operational functioning - is slowly being accepted in both the US and abroad. Yet, current efforts to green health care are incomplete since they focus on health care structures. The treatments provided in the course of the therapeutic relationship is the essence of health care - not the buildings that contain the practice. Notably, hospital care and physician clinical service sectors contribute the most CO2 within the US medical industry, with structures equipment and pharmaceuticals at third and fourth, respectively.\ncb7r | In recognition of the need for comprehensive green health care reform, this article will first postulate reasons for a lack of environmental sustainability in US health care. Many of these reasons are on the national level where the physician-patient relationship remains a less frequently discussed pathway towards green health care reform. As such, this article will, second, identify current green health care initiatives in the United States in which patients and physicians participate. In many cases, other health care professionals participate in green initiatives, but this article will focus on physicians or doctors in order to narrow the scope of inquiry. Third, the rationale for participation in green initiatives will be explained. Fourth, the article will propose that, based on the environmental values of patients and physicians, health care insurance plans, which may be private or governmentally-run, and health care insurance companies can be petitioned for green health care reform. Health care insurance plans and health care insurance companies are largely absent from participation in sustainability initiatives; hence they must be involved to close the loop of sustainable health care delivery.\n68xu | I. Lack of Sustainability in US Health Care\nhd35 | Reducing the carbon impact of global health care has been written about, lobbied for, and, in some cases,\n2zpk | implemented. This reifies both the support for sustainable health care and the possibility for enacting it. However, health care in the United States is not environmentally sustainable for several reasons. First, there is not national consensus on the importance of sustainability in domestic policy. Historically, US citizens and companies have fallen on both pro-environment and anti-environment sides of, for instance, permitting fracking in Michigan, building the Alaska oil pipeline, passing the Environmental Protection Act, and supporting the Endangered Species Act. More recent opportunities for the United States to join with other international political leaders in the fight against climate change have been disappointing. With the US withdrawing from the Paris Climate Agreement in twenty nineteen, and obstinately refusing to move towards clean and sustainable energy, actions which may move the US towards sustainability do not enjoy national consensus which would lead to a green overhaul of every sector - health care included.\nepu7 | Second, and similarly, the priority of health care in the United States varies widely. While health care reform is consistently named as a top voting issue, the push and pull over the Affordable Care Act, with lingering attempts to \"repeal and replace,\" highlight the conflicting views of US citizens towards health care for all. As private or employer-sponsored health insurance has been the norm in the United States, and with a strong dislike of the \"Welfare state,\" US citizens tend to reject measures which would put individual taxes towards national health care. Given these fragmentations, a functionally coherent health care system has been impossible in the United States, let alone an infrastructure of sustainable health care. If the nation cannot move towards environmentally sound health care policies, then health care systems would need to reform themselves.\n7od1 | Yet, third, many health care and hospital systems fail to initiate or maintain sustainability initiatives. Complex individual and group factors ranging from diffusion of responsibility, to paralysis about the enormity of the environmental problem, to the \"bystander effect\" - whereby an individual believes that someone else will address the situation - stymie environmental action and derail attempts at greening health systems. While there are a variety of sustainability initiatives which hospitals in the United States may participate in, including collaboration with organizations such as Practice GreenHealth, Health Care Without Harm, or the now-retired Healthier Hospitals Initiative, to implementation of sustainability measures in individual facilities - such as recycling - these are voluntary and do not address health care delivery. Current sustainability models that focus on\n0bqy | the structural aspects of health care are limited in their efficacy as they can only \"green\" buildings or medical infrastructures and rarely examine the carbon of the practice of medicine itself. This is equivalent to making an automobile plant solar-powered, but continuing to manufacture cars that run on fossil fuels.\nb780 | Fourth, the environmental movement has failed to offer health care an effective paradigm for sustainability. The mantra \"reduce, reuse, recycle\" is insensible to medical consumers and health care providers in their day-to-day work, which relies on quick-use disposable instruments. Health care is not a highly visible carbon polluter, even though it has significant carbon emissions. An image of a destroyed rainforest has gravitas; a dead fur seal invokes pity. Less persuasive is the environmental destruction associated with the polypharmacy of an elderly woman or a young man in a long-term care facility. Similarly, environmental activists have focused on issues with a clearly identifiable aggressor and victim, such as hunters of the endangered grey wolves or nuclear power plants dumping toxic waste in urban areas. But, unlike other environmental transgressions, every person is culpable for the carbon emissions of health care. This is a matter of degree, not kind. Although there is not equitable use of - or access to - health care in the US, facilities stand ready to use, emitting carbon and contributing to the national health care carbon footprint. Individuals protect themselves from the scrutiny of environmental ethics by normalizing high-carbon health care use. Unlike private transportation, for instance, which can be exchanged for more sustainable options, alternatives to resource intensive medical treatments are not highly visible. Of course, all health care is optional, many medical procedures have limited clinical benefit, or are futile which means carbon is wasted without meeting health goals. Moreover, preventative care, such as avoiding alcohol and tobacco, eating within guidelines, and getting enough exercise reduces illness and therefore saves health care carbon which is incurred from treating preventable diseases and conditions.\nccmb | Finally, the invocation of biomedical ethics to support sustainable health care is met with resistance under the erroneous belief that health care ought not be accountable for resource use, since unlimited medical treatments are an inviolable right. Public discussions about health care prioritization often devolve into panic over allocation and triage. Both anger and fear emerge when ICUs, elective surgeries, life-extending treatments, and experimental therapies are discussed for cost containment. This quickly turns to rhetoric about death panels. Many of the themes which mark the resistance to conversations about\nma93 | health care resource allocation redouble when sustainability is invoked. To posit carbon containment as a rationale for health care delivery reduction is a steep fight indeed.",
