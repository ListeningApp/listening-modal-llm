Increasingly, law faculties are experiencing a \"PhD-ification\", bringing aboard junior scholars dually trained in law and economics, political science, or another social science discipline. These scholars are well positioned to move from empirical legal studies\nolce | generally to PHLR specifically. Even more promising is the trend toward pursuing PHLR in multidisciplinary teams. Research partnerships between practitioners and scholars represent the future of the best research in this field, and interdisciplinary collaborations of scholars will become the \"standard of care\" very soon. Team-based approaches preclude the need for traditional legal scholars and practitioners to climb the steep learning curve necessary to conduct highly rigorous quantitative and qualitative investigations. At a minimum, however, these scholars and practitioners should receive enough training in empirical methods to become informed consumers of empirical studies and active participants in team decisions about study design.\nerx1 | Another challenge relating to methodological rigor-one that cuts across fields of social science research-is how to adequately control for confounding variables in observational studies. This is particularly difficult in intervention studies that exploit cross-sectional variation in state laws, because states differ in so many other ways, many of which are not captured in data. Such studies are usually retrospective, relying on extant data rather than employing prospective designs that collect data on all important variables. Statistical techniques such as fixed-effects models and difference-in-difference models provide a means of minimizing this problem in repeated cross-section studies, although analysts need to carefully consider whether such designs are appropriate given the nature of their data. Prospective studies and studies involving original data collection are even stronger responses to this problem but are expensive, time-consuming, and not feasible for studying some public health law questions.\nb3bt | Yet another methodological challenge for the field is interpreting empirical findings. Empirical legal scholars have lamented the limited development of approaches to dealing with the problem of induction. The field of epidemiology has developed and refined tools for evaluating when it is appropriate to draw causal inferences from statistical associations, but the same cannot be said for empirical legal studies. The temptation to infer causality from association, or even to infer association from observing a small, nonsystematic sample of actors or jurisdictions, has been problematic in PHLR. Here, PHLR can and should draw on epidemiology: Sir Austin Bradford Hill's classic work on indicators of causality in environment exposures and disease, for instance, is useful in a broad swath\n0w8m | of observational work. Addressing the question, \"What aspects of that association should we especially consider before deciding that the most likely interpretation of it is causation?\" Bradford Hill listed strength, consistency, specificity, temporality, \"biological gradient\" (a dose-response relationship), biological plausibility, coherence with known facts, availability of experimental evidence, and availability of analogous phenomena.\nvcu3 | As the factors inhibiting greater rigor are gradually overcome, PHLR will move from its current state, in which simple descriptive studies, nonsystematic qualitative work, and overly simplistic regression modeling are common, to a greater use of more sophisticated study designs. This process will be guided by the application of methodological standards developed in related fields of research. For example, the Society for Prevention Research has established criteria for judging whether laws and policies aimed at disease prevention are efficacious, effective, and ready for dissemination. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force has developed a rating system for the strength of evidence for preventive health measures provided by different types of study designs, ranging from case reports to randomized controlled trials. The Campbell and Cochrane Collaborations are highly informative examples of how work in PHLR can be systematically evaluated and, through this evaluation, spurred to higher levels of rigor. The process will also be driven by the increasing extent to which PHLR scholars view themselves as a professional community engaged in stimulating, collaborating in, and critiquing one another's work. Ultimately, a clear professional identity for the field will emerge, and at its core will be a commitment to the disciplined application of the scientific method and the most sophisticated methodological approaches to study public health law questions.\nhjzj | Ensuring Adequate Research Funding\nj79f | Collecting, analyzing, and communicating research data all cost money. Although the problem of securing research funding is not unique to PHLR, it poses special problems in this field because many public health law researchers work in soft-money environments, and extramural funding for PHLR is sparse. The recent commitment of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation to building PHLR represents a milestone in the field's evolution. First through its overall public health law\n6tbv | portfolio (which has also included support for policy-related initiatives like the Substance Abuse Policy Research Program, Healthy Eating Research, Active Living Research, and PHSSR) and now through its program in Public Health Law Research, RWJF has supported PHLR at an unprecedented level. Previously, researchers relied on small programs such as the National Science Foundation's Law and Social Science program and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's short-lived Public Health Law for research opportunities, or they tried to shoehorn legal research projects into health research solicitations, for example, the NIH's and the CDC's requests for proposals on drug addiction or injury prevention. While these attempts have often been successful, they have limited the researchers' ability to address the core areas of inquiry of PHLR, and they have precluded ready identification of studies that constitute the PHLR literature across a wide array of health topics. The RWJF initiative thus will pay for research and also build the field of PHLR by stimulating new investigators to enter the field, bringing researchers together, signaling what constitutes rigor in the field, and gathering together PHLR studies across diverse topics and methods.\nxb13 | The question of sustainability does arise, however. A longer-term and more broad-based commitment by research sponsors is needed to support the field's continued flourishing. This is most likely to occur if public health law researchers spend time educating sponsors and policymakers as to the significance of the problems that the field addresses as well as researchers' ability to provide useful, credible answers. Empirical research examining how research influences policy has emphasized the importance of the relationships between researchers and their audiences. We hope that over time, law and policy studies will become seen as a core component of all public health research solicitations, in the way that ethics is increasingly viewed in the context of genomic, cancer, and other population health research.\ncxqi | Identifying Data Sources\nqfmx | Although a wide array of data sets on health risk exposures, health behaviors, and health outcomes are available, data on health laws are much harder to find. Unlike many other areas of public health research, research on public health law and policy has developed few surveillance systems. Gathering information\nrut3 | about the patterns of public health law adoption and implementation across states and local governments over time generally is done de novo in each research project.\n```",
