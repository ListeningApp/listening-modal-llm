The reaction scheme also requires that compounds Q and Q' be discrete species because if this were not the case, the isotope effect in the decay rate of compound Q would remain correlated with the product isotope effect. Moreover, according to the scheme, compound Q decay should occur in at least three exponential phases. However, only one phase is observed, suggesting either that all species except compound Q are colorless at four hundred thirty nanometers (like the final species, diferric MMOH) and/or that compound Q' reacts with methane much faster than does compound Q. In either case, compound Q' would necessarily be distinguishable from compound Q.\n5vqw | The structures of the intermediate compounds Q, R, and the proposed intermediate Q' are not known. However, studies of high-valent model compounds, as well as spectroscopic and crystallographic studies of the diferric hydroxylase, are consistent with a di-mu-oxo (or hydroxo) diiron cluster for compound Q. One scenario that could provide a structural basis for the scheme shown in Figure five is illustrated in Figure six. In this case, the initial hydrogen abstraction by compound Q leads to the formation of a terminal hydroxo moiety, compound R, which, following the reabstraction reaction (compound Q'), does not rapidly reform the second oxo bridge. The resulting terminal oxenoid species would be expected to be at least as reactive as the dibridged structure, but might have significantly different spectroscopic properties as required by the data.\nmeyw | Although the hydrogen-atom reabstraction process is unexpected and has not been proposed for any other hydrocarbon-oxidizing system to our knowledge, the isotope effects determined from compound Q decay and the product ratio were both measured by straightforward techniques, suggesting that some process of this type does, in fact, occur. It is possible that the formation of a methyl radical presents a unique case in that it is expected to be significantly more reactive than other hydrocarbon radicals in the active site of MMO due to either the higher bond dissociation energy of the methane C-H bond or the potentially greater access of the methyl radical to the active site diiron cluster. The apparent occurrence of an isotope effect in two discrete steps means that MMO substrates other than methane may exhibit different isotope effects in either or both steps. Thus, the compound Q decay isotope effect might be larger or smaller than the product isotope effect for specific substrates.\n2e62 | Secondary Isotope Effects. Both the rate constant of compound Q decay and the kinetic isotope effect monitored by product formation show essentially linear changes with a change in deuterium content of the methane. However, the implications of these changes are different. In the case of compound Q decay, the linear plot suggests that the primary isotope is large and the secondary isotope effect is small. This is an important observation because an apparent kinetic isotope effect of approximately one hundred would be observed for a system with a more typical primary isotope effect and an exceptionally large secondary\n75y3 | effect. However, if this were the case, the plot shown in Figure three would be distinctly nonlinear. A simulation of the expected plot with a primary isotope effect of sixty and a secondary effect of one point two (apparent kinetic isotope effect equals one hundred, Figure three) is still slightly outside of the uncertainty in the data, suggesting that a maximum secondary isotope effect of approximately one point one would be allowed. In the case of the kinetic isotope effect monitored by product formation, there is a substantial decrease in the kinetic isotope effect as the deuterium content decreases. If the primary and secondary isotope effects were constant, then each of the isotopic homologs would give the same observed intra-molecular isotope effect (given by the primary to secondary effect ratio); thus, the observed decrease is unexpected. A similar trend was noted for zirconium activation of methane C-H bonds by Wolczanski and co-workers, who attributed the change to relatively large secondary isotope effects that differed for each isotopic homolog. In considering these two sets of data together, it appears that the secondary isotope effects have little or no effect on the compound Q decay rate, but a complex and much more significant effect on the observed product kinetic isotope effect. This supports a scheme, such as that shown in Figure five, in which the observed effects derive from different reactions.\ns2g2 | Mechanistic Significance. A deuterium isotope effect ranging from four to twenty is observed for both the product yield from methane single turnover by diferrous MMOH and the Vmax to KM value determined from multiple turnover by the reconstituted system. Significantly, little isotope effect is observed in the Vmax value for steady state turnover. These observations are generally in accord with the proposed mechanism for MMOH. Transient kinetic experiments show the following: all of the steps in the cycle leading to compound Q are effectively irreversible; compound Q forms before methane reacts productively with the enzyme; methane appears to react with compound Q without prior complex formation; and once methane reacts with compound Q, the product stays bound in the active site to be released slowly in the rate-limiting step. Under these constraints for either a sequential or nonsequential mechanism, Vmax is approximately equal to k six multiplied by the total enzyme concentration and KM of methane is approximately equal to k six divided by k four. The product release step would not be expected to be isotope sensitive, and thus the observation of almost no isotope effect on Vmax is consistent with the mechanism shown in Figure one. Similarly, the mechanism predicts the observed large isotope effect on KM because the step in which the C-H bond-breaking chemistry occurs (k four) appears in the expression for this kinetic constant.\nq1q2 | Various mechanistic studies of MMO have provided information about the nature of the substrate intermediate during the oxygen insertion step of the catalytic cycle. Unfortunately, these studies do not support the same conclusion. A study using ultrafast radical clock substrates showed that, for the M. capsulatus MMO, no radical trapping occurred on a time scale for rearrangement of ten to the negative eleven seconds, suggesting that no substrate radical is formed and obviating the need for a discrete C-H bond-breaking step. In contrast, we have shown that for the M. trichosporium MMO, partial inversion of configuration of chiral ethane occurs, strongly\ncb7r | suggesting that a substrate intermediate free to rotate in the active site, most reasonably a substrate radical, is generated. The studies described here show that the methane oxygen insertion reaction occurs with inter- and intramolecular deuterium isotope effects that are greater than four and, perhaps, as large as one hundred for the C-H bond-breaking step itself. These effects seem inconsistent with any model that does not propose a C-H bond-breaking step to form a discrete substrate intermediate prior to oxygen addition.",
