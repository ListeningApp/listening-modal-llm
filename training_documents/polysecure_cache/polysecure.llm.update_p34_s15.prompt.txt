You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

hone | . When a person has low avoidance but high anxiety, their attachment style is preoccupied.
sngr | . Dismissive attachment happens when a person's anxiety is low, but their avoidance is high.
ojot | When someone is high in both anxiety and avoidance, they have a fearful- avoidant style.
rg5s | These dimensions also influence each other. For example, both the secure and preoccupied styles are low in attachment avoidance, but their differences in attach- ment anxiety will alter the way a person expresses their attachment. Someone lower in attachment anxiety will approach a partner from a more secure stance, moving
yppk | towards them with a sense of openness, flexibility and interdependence, whereas someone who is higher in anxiety is more likely to seek proximity to their partner in order to grasp at or control them, be overly dependent on them, or simply to alle- viate their own fears and anxiety.
et9b | On the flip side, the internal experience of being higher in attachment avoid- ance will be very different based on where someone is positioned on the attach- ment anxiety dimension. Someone who is high in avoidant behaviors but low in at- tachment anxiety might experience minimal internal conflict when there is in- creased distance from a partner-this person may not even recognize their own high avoidance. Someone who is equally high in avoidance but higher in anxiety can feel an enormous amount of internal conflict and distress. Their avoidance does not necessarily feel like a safe refuge for them, but can feel more like a freeze response. This person feels two things at once: desire for proximity to a partner but fear of what that closeness might bring.
1svs | I also think that the ways someone might experience being low in attachment anxiety will vary greatly depending on where they lie in the attachment avoidance dimension. For example, both the secure and dismissive styles would be consid- ered as being low in attachment anxiety, but I don't think they are felt in the same way. Someone who is more secure and lower in attachment avoidance probably ex- periences little anxiety, whereas for someone who is more dismissive and higher in attachment avoidance, low anxiety is probably related to the repressing or evading of anxious feelings rather than not having them.
izqt | Both personally and professionally I have experienced this four-quadrant model as more both more precise and more useful than simply talking about the four at- tachment styles as stand-alone concepts. When I present attachment in this way to workshop participants and clients, they express being able to better place them- selves within these dimensions. We are then able to have much more nuanced and empowering conversations about approach/avoidance behaviors and low or high anxiety. With this model, people seem better able to reflect on how and why these dimensions play out (often differently) in their relationships. Clients often describe
vub1 | feeling less "pathologized" by this approach.
zfhy | Speaking for myself, before learning about these dimensions, I was often con- fused about exactly where I fit within the three insecure styles. From going through the Adult Attachment Interview (an interview and scoring system developed to as- sess adult attachment) with my own therapist, I knew I had earned secure attach- ment, but there were still times when my insecure strategies arose, especially when under relational stress. I could place some of my behaviors in the dismissive style (I was self-reliant to a fault) but not all of them (I'm extremely empathic, comfort- able with intimacy and emotionally focused). I could definitely relate to several of the ways the preoccupied style internally experiences things, but externally I was not presenting as the anxious preoccupied type at all. Some of my childhood ex- periences undoubtedly fall into the disorganized camp, but the initial descriptions of the fearful-avoidant style that I encountered were encumbered with much more volatility, toxicity and dysfunction than I had experienced in my adult life and rela- tionships.
p9bw | When I came across Mikulincer and Shaver's two-dimensional description of attachment I could immediately place myself as sometimes being high in anxiety and high in avoidance (fearful avoidance). Under certain circumstances, | expe- rience internal anxiety, feel mentally preoccupied with relational dynamics and have emotional flare-ups in response to the slightest signal that a partner is withdrawing or low in their ability to be present and attuned. But externally, I was more likely to withdraw, play it cool and take the self-reliant route. My reaction could go unno- ticed or be seen as me pulling in and withdrawing, but internally I was thrashing around, getting emotional whiplash from the "one foot on the gas and one foot on the brake" experience. The two-dimensional model offered more accuracy in under- standing my own attachment style and helped me to identify the directions I still needed to focus on in my own healing.
2l8i | I've found that many of my clients also describe relating to this style. They too are not presenting in the more extreme ways that the fearful-avoidant style is typi- cally depicted, where mental illness, violence, abuse and/or forms of self-abuse are
locx | at play, but nonetheless they are functioning from this style and still need support in the unresolved trauma and pains that it surfaces from. These less extreme or overt expressions of fearful-avoidance can easily go undetected by professionals, leaving people confused about how to understand and identify their own attach- ment experiences. For any psychological model, there will always be people who do not neatly fit into what the theory or diagnostic criteria state, and when a typol- ogy is too rigid it can easily leave people to fall through the cracks. It is important that we recognize the significance of these different attachment categories and ac- knowledge that they are shining a beneficial light on specific patterns that arise for people. But we also need to hold these categorical descriptions with some flexi- bility. Different attachment patterns can exist on a spectrum, such as in this case with fearful-avoidant showing up in mild, moderate or more extreme expressions.
z2dl | FROM DYSFUNCTION TO DESIRE
vtxq | Another way to conceive of the attachment dimensions is not through their "dys- functions," but through their strengths and desires. Defining the attachment styles through the dimensions of attachment avoidance and attachment anxiety can easily paint a bleak picture of dysfunction and leave people focusing on what's "wrong" with them. Based on this two-dimensional model, even a secure attachment, which is revered as the desired goal, is just being framed as how low in attachment anx- iety and attachment avoidance it is, instead of being presented in its fullness with all the positive strengths and capacities that this attachment style embodies.
571b | Let's take a person with a dismissive style as an example and look at how nega- tive framing works. Because they're high on the avoidance axis and low on the anx- iety axis, someone with a dismissive style is likely to use distancing and deacti- vating strategies when faced with relationship challenges. On the other end of the spectrum, someone in the preoccupied style sits low on the avoidance axis and high on the anxiety axis. Their strategies look more like hyperactivation and pur- suing their partner in moments of relationship pain.
fg6a | But we don't need to only use this negative framing of how these attachment- based emotional tendencies often play out. If instead of looking at how people with
