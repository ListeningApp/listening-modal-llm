You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

They may focus on "law on the books"-for example, examining the effect of states' passage of graduated drivers license statutes on rates of injury-causing crashes (Foss, Feaganes, and Rodgman 2001)-or on legal practices, such as the effect of issuing re- straining orders against perpetrators of domestic violence on future vic- timization (Harrell and Smith 1996). Intervention studies can be used to evaluate interventional health law but also to investigate the health effects of public health's legal infrastructure and the unplanned impact of what we have called incidental public health law. Intervention studies lie at the heart of PHLR, as they most directly address the core question of the field: What are the best legal tools to use to promote health?
afbe | Intervention studies can draw from an extensive methodological tool kit (table 1). The strongest designs are experimental or quasi- experimental designs with careful controls. Differences in how and when laws are implemented from jurisdiction to jurisdiction provide oppor- tunities for quasi-experimental studies, although sophisticated methods may be required to account for other ways in which jurisdictions may dif- fer from one another. Useful study designs and analytical methods for this purpose can be borrowed from the fields of econometrics and epidemiol- ogy (Ludwig and Cook 2000). Real-world, randomized experiments are extremely rare but have been employed to study judicial-branch reforms such as specialized courts (Gottfredson, Najaka, and Kearley 2003). Ex- perimental studies can also be carried out using simulations, such as tabletop exercises (Dausey, Buehler, and Lurie 2007; Hupert, Mushlin, and Callahan 2002; Lurie et al. 2004).
78r8 | We already have a substantial evidence base investigating the ef- fectiveness of interventional public health law, ranging from single studies through literature reviews to meta-analyses and systematic re- views conducted by entities like the Campbell Collaboration (Campbell Collaboration 2009) and the U.S. Task Force on Community Preventive Services (Community Guide 2009). We also have a rich, if less well orga- nized, research literature on incidental public health law. For example, researchers have studied the unintended consequences of HIV reporting laws on attitudes toward testing, time of testing, and willingness to be tested (Hecht et al. 2000; Tesoriero et al. 2008). Research on the health effects of infrastructural health law has been more limited.
320g | Consistent with ecological models in public health, intervention stud- ies may investigate how laws influence health by changing environments. For example, zoning rules, clean indoor air laws, and laws regulating the
tp8g | condition of rental properties can directly shape residents' exposures to noise, environmental toxins, and stress, as well as their activity patterns, social connections, collective efficacy, and many other factors that appear to influence population health outcomes (Browning and Cagney 2002; Maantay 2002; Schilling and Linton 2005). Occupational health and safety laws affect workers' exposure to hazardous conditions on the job. Product regulations protect consumers from a range of hazards arising from the use of products, from herbal supplements to firearms (Larsen and Berry 2003; Robson 2007; Vernick and Teret 2000).
gxfd | Interventional research focuses not only on how the law changes phys- ical environments, but also on how it may change the social environment in ways that affect health or health behaviors. Law may shape people's health knowledge and attitudes, the way they perceive the risks and ben- efits of different choices, the frames through which they view particular choices, and the social norms against which their health decisions are set. PHLR can measure any or all of these dependent variables, as well as changes in health behaviors. There are many examples: research on the effects of indoor smoking prohibitions on social expectations about exposure to secondhand smoke in public (Kagan and Skolnick 1993); the effect of laws requiring disclosure of calorie information on restaurant menus on consumers' awareness of calorie content and attitudes toward the role of calorie information in food purchasing decisions (Bassett et al. 2008); and the effect of punitive laws concerning substance abuse dur- ing pregnancy on the prenatal care-seeking behavior of pregnant women (Poland et al. 1993), to name a few.
s2v1 | Finally, intervention research can illuminate policy choices under con- ditions of uncertainty. When problems or policy responses are new, there will naturally be little or no intervention research directly on point. Pol- icymaking can still be informed by evidence about analogous policies or by an understanding of how law typically works to influence envi- ronments and behaviors, although all analogies are, of course, imperfect proxies for the situation at hand. An example is the area of legal re- strictions on cell phone use by drivers. Although public health research recently has provided good evidence of the injury risk associated with this behavior, evidence of the effectiveness of different legal and policy approaches to the problem is not yet available. Until it is, lawmakers seeking to respond to what is clearly a significant health risk might be guided by the lessons learned about the design and enforcement of laws requiring seatbelt and helmet use and prohibiting driving under the
jkp9 | influence of alcohol. Health impact assessment has also emerged as a useful way to use mixed methods to inform policy decisions with re- liable data on possible effects, intended and unintended (Collins and Koplan 2009; Lee et al. 2007; Mindell et al. 2004). Finally, Monte Carlo simulations, widely used in the field of decision science but rarely used in PHLR (Studdert et al. 2007), offer an intriguing method for accounting for uncertainty about multiple parameters of importance to evaluating the likely effect of law.
z8tt | Mechanism Studies
9g22 | To advance the field, we need not only more evidence of law's health effects but also a greater understanding of how law has the effects it has. This is important for many reasons. Evidence of mechanisms strength- ens specific causal claims. Understanding how a particular intervention influences environments and behavior facilitates the identification of further interventions, or of alternatives to eliminate superfluous require- ments or unintended side effects and strengthen the mechanisms that are working. The better we understand how law works, the better we can use it, replicate its successes across jurisdictions, and extend its approach to other kinds of health risks. Informed by theories of health behavior, PHLR can develop and test models to explain how public health law effectuates change in health behaviors and ultimately health outcomes.
41fx | At the most basic level, laws encourage healthy, safe, and socially beneficial behaviors and discourage unhealthy, dangerous, and socially deleterious ones by shaping incentives (rewards) and deterrents (punish- ments). Though the theory may be simple, the process is not. Regulators have myriad levers and tactics that they can use to influence behavior directly or by manipulating the environment, and each choice in a reg- ulatory system can and should be studied for its effectiveness, in both absolute terms and relative to less burdensome alternatives. Among the mechanisms are taxation and subsidies, changes in the information en- vironment, changes in the built environment, and signals sent by tort litigation (Gostin, Thompson, and Grad 2007).
7um8 | With respect to laws imposing outright prohibitions on particular behaviors, many of the key research questions relate to mechanisms of implementation and enforcement: What penalties are applied to viola- tors of legal rules? What processes are used to detect violators? With what
