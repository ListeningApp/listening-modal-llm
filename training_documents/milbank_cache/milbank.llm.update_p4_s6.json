        "content": "90k5 | When we refer to \"research,\" we intend a particular meaning: the use of systematic methods within an explicit theoretical framework to collect and analyze data. PHLR seeks methodological rigor in all phases of research, from the careful articulation and operationalization of theory through thoughtful and innovative study design to analysis, interpretation, and dissemination.\n9m8s | Making the Case for Laws That Improve Health\n893y | PHLR includes both qualitative and quantitative studies using experimental, quasi-experimental, observational, or participatory designs. It ranges from health impact assessments gathering limited data on legal effects in order to inform policymaking in real time, to complex experiments and quasi experiments studying the effects of law on health over extended periods of time. Formal decision analyses, simulations, econometric analyses, laboratory and social experiments, survey, interview, and focus-group studies, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses are included, as is legal research to systematically and reproducibly collect, classify, and quantify laws and judicial decisions for analytic purposes.\nfavz | Theory and methods may be drawn from a variety of disciplines in the social sciences, including epidemiology, biostatistics, law, sociology, history, political science, economics, anthropology, and psychology. From the natural sciences, PHLR imports the scientific method, approaching research questions with a hypothesis to be tested rather than a position to be defended; gathering data for the purpose of proving or disproving the hypothesis (or disproving a null hypothesis); and reaching conclusions based on a careful and restrained analysis and interpretation of all relevant data.\n7szx | As we define it, public health law research is thus distinguishable from public health law scholarship. \"Scholarship\" embraces a range of nonempirical but no less valid and useful work on public health law, ranging from work grounded in philosophy or ethics, to doctrinal exegesis, to the crafting of model laws, and to legal analysis arguing how the law ought to be applied in various situations. What we call PHLR does not exhaust all forms of knowledge gathering or analysis concerning public health law. Indeed, public health law scholarship includes many outstanding and influential works that have shaped the field of public health law but do not fall within our definition of PHLR.\nhx9e | \"Law\" and \"Public Health\"\nywn2 | A key challenge in defining PHLR arises from the potential breadth of the definitions of \"law\" and \"public health\". In linking the two in PHLR, we take a broad sociological stance, encompassing not simply written laws on one side and morbidity and mortality\na63r | on the other, but the whole range of institutions, practices, and beliefs through which laws influence health and the determinants of health. This is particularly important given that the timelines for law to influence health may be long and data on key outcome variables scarce; it may be important to examine the effects of law on mediating factors such as health behaviors. From the perspective of whether it is properly classified as PHLR, the key aspect of such a study is that it examines the relationship between a law variable and a public health variable.\ndqvj | Social epidemiology, the branch of epidemiology aimed at understanding social determinants of health, provides a theoretical framework into which PHLR can readily fit. Most things human beings do, and most characteristics of our environments, have some impact on the level and distribution of health in a population. Whether styled as health inequities or health disparities, differences in health among identifiable subpopulations have become a major concern in health and policy. Health law scholars, too, increasingly recognize the need to examine individual interests and choices through the lens of population health, recognizing that \"the choices individuals exercise and the health risks they face are determined, to a large degree, by the environments they experience and the populations they comprise\". PHLR, however, does not encompass the full scope of social epidemiology. That is, we confine our definition of PHLR to the study of law and regulatory practices and not the full spectrum of contributing factors.\nr17u | Another distinctive aspect of PHLR's conception of \"law\" is that it is not confined to \"law on the books\": constitutions, statutes, judicial opinions, and so on. The mainstream of empirical legal research over the past thirty years has acknowledged the salience of law as it is implemented in practice and experienced by those it targets. Studies of legality or legal consciousness, behavioral law and economics research, scholarship on compliance theory, scholarship on deterrence theory and tort law, and regulation and governance studies all explore this theme. PHLR is necessarily interested in the psychosocial mechanisms through which compliance is achieved, the range of regulatory techniques that may be deployed, and how law \"operates through social life as persons and groups deliberately interpret\n3c47 | Making the Case for Laws That Improve Health\ng345 | and invoke law's language, authority and procedures to organize their lives and manage their relationships\". Law is fundamentally a social practice embedded in institutions and implemented by agents. It is part of, not distinct from, the social environment whose influence on health is the focus of social epidemiology.\nsvhz | PHLR also properly encompasses both laws that were intended to affect population health and laws that have unintended health effects. What has been referred to as \"interventional public health law\" is law or legal practices that are intended to influence health outcomes or mediators directly. Likewise, \"infrastructural public health law\" establishes the powers, duties, and institutions of public health. But much of the law that influences population health was not adopted for that purpose and may on its face seem to have no connection to health at all. For example, criminal laws aimed at controlling illicit drug use may increase the risk of users acquiring HIV. Research that investigates the relationship of law and legal practices to population health falls within PHLR when it investigates health effects or otherwise deploys an explicit population health framework, whether or not the law on its face is oriented toward health. We label this important category of PHLR \"incidental public health law.\"\noaen | Finally, PHLR is distinguishable from other kinds of public health research in that it evaluates not merely the effectiveness of a public health intervention but also the effectiveness of law as the tool used to implement or facilitate the intervention. For example, research on whether abstinence-only education reduces teenage pregnancy is not PHLR merely because abstinence-only education happens to be required by law. PHLR does, however, encompass research on how abstinence-only education rules are implemented and whether the existence of state-level, abstinence-only legal mandates is associated with differences in states' reproductive health outcomes.\n5u67 | Health Services Research and Public Health Systems and Services Research",
