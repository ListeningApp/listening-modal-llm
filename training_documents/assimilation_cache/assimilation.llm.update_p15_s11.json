Consider a physical process in which real-valued state variables X sub i comma i equals one comma two comma and so on, are generated according to the rule X sub i plus one equals F of X sub i, where F is a given real-valued function. The states are observed according to the data model Y sub i equals X sub i plus epsilon sub i, where the epsilon sub i are independent random variables with an N zero comma sigma squared-distribution.\n8sye | (i) Assume that observations Y one, Y two, and so on, up to Y sub N are available and that you want to estimate X one. Describe in general terms how a cost function should be set up whose minimum is expected to give an estimate for X one.\nr04h | Sigma circ equals Q plus M of open parenthesis Sigma circ minus Sigma circ H transpose of open parenthesis H Sigma circ H transpose plus R close parenthesis inverse H Sigma circ close parenthesis M transpose,\norpr | Chapter twenty. Data Assimilation\nk36m | (ii) Consider the special case F of open parenthesis X close parenthesis equals four X open parenthesis one minus X close parenthesis. Begin with the case N equals three, sigma equals zero point one, X one equals zero point two. Construct this cost function for several realizations of the Y sub i and plot it, using a computer. Is the minimum of the cost function where you expect it to be?\nwnuz | (iii) Repeat part (ii) with a larger sigma, for example sigma equals zero point five. Repeat with the previous sigma and a larger N, for example N equals six. Describe your observations. Does it help to have more observations available?\nsy14 | The cost function may have multiple local minima, which can lead to serious numerical difficulties.\nghss | Two. Consider the process model equation twenty point one together with the data model equation twenty point two.
