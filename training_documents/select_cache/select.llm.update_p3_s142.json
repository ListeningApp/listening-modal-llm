        "content": "ibgs | Although the selectivity of forming allenyl imidamides is good, the formation of alkyne isomer could not be suppressed in many cases. At this juncture, we surmised that trapping the ketenimine intermediate with alcohols may have different product distributions. Indeed, under identical conditions except for the replacement of I-P-R-two-N-H (one point two equivalent) with MeOH (ten equivalent) and E-t-three-N (two equivalent), the reaction of one, three-diynes selectively provided two, three-dienyl imidates without a vestige of the alkyne isomer. The lower stoichiometry of methanol\ncolo | led to the lower efficiency of the reaction. Alkyl and alkenyl diynes, which provided a mixture of allenyl and alkynyl imidamides previously, selectively generated allenyl imidates (three-a-e, three-c-e, and three-d-e) in moderate to good yield (entries one to three, respectively). Even though one, three-diyne one-g containing a free secondary alcohol led to decomposition (entry four), the corresponding benzyl- and tert-butyldimethylsilyl-protected provided two, three-dienyl imidates (three-h-e, three-h-e prime, and three-h-e double prime, respectively) in good yield (entries five to seven, respectively). Similarly, one, three-diyne with benzyl-protected secondary alcohol one-i delivered two, three-dienyl imidate three-i-e in seventy-two percent yield.\nd6r4 | Subsequently, we observed that under standard conditions, one, three-diynes four containing an acetoxy or benzoyloxy substituent at the propargylic position provided mono-, di-, and trisubstituted three-cumulenes. For example, one, three-diynes four-a to four-c afforded trisubstituted cumulenes five-a to five-c, respectively, in seventy-six to eighty percent yields (entries one to three, respectively). One, three-diynes substituted with a cycloalkyl moiety afforded the corresponding cumulenes five-d to five-f in good yields (entries four to six, respectively). Unexpectedly, while the acetate derivative of tertiary alcohol was afforded, the corresponding primary and secondary acetates provide a mixture of the expected three-cumulenes and the corresponding acetoxy allene derivatives. However, upon replacement of the acetate with para-nitrobenzoate (four-g to four-i), only cumulenes five-g to five-i were obtained (entries seven to nine, respectively). We believe this is the consequence of the better leaving group capacity of a benzoate compared to that of an acetate. Three-cumulenes make up a special class of polyene organic compounds whose synthetic utilities have been little explored. Thus, the current mild protocol to allow the preparation of three-cumulenes containing various\n9mrz | substituent patterns from readily available building blocks is of highly synthetically useful.\npk06 | We envision that with a suitably tethered nucleophile, the conversion of one, three-diynes to the corresponding conjugated allenyl imidamide and imidates would promote an intramolecular Michael-type addition. Under\n7wn9 | standard conditions, homopropargyl alcohol-containing one, three-diynes six-a and six-b were smoothly converted to tetrahydrofuran-ylidene imidates seven-a and seven-b in forty-eight and eighty-seven percent yields, respectively (entries one and two, respectively). The corresponding homopropargyl sulfonamide six-c led to one-tosylpyrrolidinylidene imidamide seven-c in seventy-two percent yield (entry three); however, the formation of a six-membered ring seven-d from six-d failed (entry four). One, three-diynes six-e and six-f substituted with a phenyl group containing an ortho-hydroxyl or N-H-two participated in the cascade reaction to generate benzofuranyl imidamide seven-e in seventy percent yield and indolyl imidamide seven-f in sixty-four percent yield (entries five and six, respectively).\nwcd0 | Although expected, migration of the triple bond from three-alkynyl or two, three-dienyl isomers to the corresponding two-alkynyl\ncaos | isomer eight was not observed under the conditions regardless of the reaction time. However, because of the thermodynamic preference for two-alkynyl isomers, we surmised that the isomerization of two or three to eight would happen if a base stronger than secondary amines is used. Indeed, treating a\nqrvy | mixture of two and three with D-B-U (zero point one equivalent) rapidly induced isomerization to provide two-alkynyl imidamides eight-a to eight-d. On the contrary, phenyl- and silyl-substituted three-alkynyl imidamides two and three did not isomerize to the corresponding two-alkynyl isomers eight-e and eight-f, respectively.\npn9j | In conclusion, we have developed efficient protocols to generate discrete isomers of two-alkynyl, three-alkynyl, two, three-dienyl, and two, three, four-trienyl imidamides and imidates from copper-catalyzed reactions of one, three-diynes and tosylazide. The selectivity between three-alkynyl and two, three-dienyl imidamides could be controlled by a heteroatom substituent at the propargylic position of the one, three-diynes and employing different trapping reagents such as amines and alcohols. Three-cumulene derivatives were also generated by employing one, three-diynes that contain an acetoxy or benzoyloxy substituent at the propargylic position. While trapping of the putative azacumulene intermediates with amines provided either three-alkynyl or two, three-dienyl imidamides depending on the structure of the trapping amines, trapping with methanol selectively generated two, three-dienyl imidates. It was found that both three-alkynyl and two, three-dienyl imidamides could be isomerized to selectively generate the corresponding two-alkynyl isomers under equilibrating conditions with a stronger base such as D-B-U. Intramolecular trapping of the putative azacumulene intermediates provided five-membered heterocyclic products if the one, three-diyne substrates contained a homopropargylic hydroxyl or amino substituent. A unique feature of these unprecedented reactions is that under mild reaction conditions, terminal one, three-diynes could be selectively converted to different unsaturated carboxylic acid derivatives with good selectivity.\n1pmc | ASSOCIATED CONTENT\n5z6q | Supporting Information\nyeoh | Experimental procedures and spectroscopic data for all new compounds.\nb8hf | Corresponding Author\nhntf | Notes\n99fo | The authors declare no competing financial interest.\ny5r7 | REFERENCES",
