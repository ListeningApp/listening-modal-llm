        "content": "magd | TSS can be divided into two classes according to its distribution: single TSS (sharp promoter) and multiple TSSs (broad promoter), both being important for gene expression. It was reported that the shapes of TSS distribution correlated with the category of genes, such as housekeeping genes and cell-type-specific genes, both exhibiting different transcriptional burst patterns. On the other hand, some experimental results indicated that feedback can regulate transcriptional initiation. A question naturally arose: how do the shapes of TSS distribution affect transcription burst kinetics in the presence of feedback regulation?\ntb74 | To address this question, we used the R package CAGEr to read CAGE data of FANTOM five MEF cell and classified the promoters into 'broad' and 'sharp' ones according to the median, fifteen base pairs, of the widths of all sampled promoters as depicted in Figure five A. Similarly, the influence of the TSS distribution on variability and burst kinetics was subject to Simpson's paradox in the case of with and without distinguishing feedback regulations.\n8l69 | We showed that the impacts of different TSS distributions on the mean expression level did not exhibit apparent differences in three cases of feedback regulation and all genes. This property can avoid possible errors in evaluating the expression variability. Consistent with the observations in previous experimental studies, sharp promoters resulted in a significantly higher expression variability than broad promoters, independent of feedback forms. The expression variability declined with increasing the width, less than fifteen base pairs, of 'sharp' promoters but was almost unchanged with increasing the width of 'broad' promoters. No-\n1jyv | tably, the curve of expression variability versus promoter width for the positive-feedback genes was always above that for the genes with negative feedback or non-feedback.\nolce | Next, we investigated whether different TSS distributions affected burst frequencies and burst sizes differently. Although genes with 'sharp' promoters led to a higher expression variability than those with 'broad' promoters for arbitrary feedback forms, burst frequencies and sizes regulated by TSS distributions can exhibit significant discrepancy only in the absence of feedback. Broad promoters led to higher burst frequencies and smaller burst sizes than sharp promoters, in agreement with the experimental observation that broad promoters tended to occur in the case of low RNA polymerase two pause, whereas sharp promoters tended to occur in the case of high RNA polymerase two pause. These results implied that on the genome-wide scale, feedback regulations significantly weakened the impacts of TSS distributions on transcriptional burst kinetics.\nerx1 | E-P interactions mainly modulate burst frequencies only in the presence of positive feedbacks",
