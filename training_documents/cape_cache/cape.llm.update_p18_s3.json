        "content": "3s61 | i. If the progression was reckoned from Assistant Lecturer rank, it means Dr. Kyei has progressed from that rank (Assistant Lecturer) to Associate Professor in approximately five years instead of the minimum of eight, taking into consideration his accelerated promotion to the rank of Associate Professor.\ns3rm | ii. If the progression is reckoned from Lecturer, Prof. Kyei did not meet the minimum requirement of four years to warrant the promotion to the rank of Senior Lecturer.\npqxb | iii. Prof. Kyei's upgrade to the rank of Lecturer predated the award of his PhD certificate.\n08qc | Notwithstanding, convocation requests answers to the following questions:\nhdj2 | i. Did Prof. Kyei benefit from the accelerated promotion twice?\na57g | ii. How many papers did he submit for his application for the promotion to the rank of Senior Lecturer?\ng8m3 | iii. What is the required number of papers for promotion from the rank of Lecturer to Senior Lecturer?\na9av | iv. Did the Appointments and Promotions Board and Council take the pain to scrutinize the document or was it a deliberate attempt to favour the applicants?\n73l3 | v. Can it be concluded that the Directorate of Human Resource failed in discharge of its duty? Convocation needs answers.\nornm | B. Undue Delays, Abuse of Process and Unfair Treatment in Relation to Promotion of Some Senior Members\nu2z1 | One. Dr. Kofi Adeladza Amegah\natmh | a) Dr. Amegah applied for accelerated promotion to the rank of Associate Professor on sixth of July twenty twenty.\n7hgg | b) The then Dean of the School of Allied Health Sciences, Prof. Emmanuel Abu, constituted a Special Appointments and Promotions Committee to consider his application. On twenty-first July twenty twenty, this Special A&P Committee wrote to Dr. Amegah to inform him that his application could not be approved because his career profile rendered him ineligible to apply. Dr. Amegah contested this decision and asked the Dean to forward his application to the College which he duly obliged.\nxwsv | c) The Appointments and Promotions Committee of the College of Health and Allied Sciences returned Dr. Amegah's application document to him with a letter dated twenty-fourth September twenty twenty indicating that he had not served the required number of years to be eligible for accelerated promotion to that rank. The Committee's decision was reached after the then Acting Provost, Prof. Emmanuel Abu, had written to DHR for interpretation on Dr. Amegah's previous application.\n756b | d) Dr. Amegah, not satisfied with the decision, petitioned the Chairman of A&P on thirteenth January, twenty twenty-one but did not receive any feedback from the Vice-Chancellor. Later on second December, twenty twenty-one (almost twelve months after the petition), the applicant sent a reminder to the Chairman of the Appointments and Promotions Board requesting to know the outcome of his petition.\n6bx7 | e) While awaiting the petition's outcome, the applicant was due for regular promotion on first August twenty twenty-one and applied on twelfth August twenty twenty-one.\nspl6 | f) However, the applicant was invited by two members of the Appointment and Promotions Board, Prof. J. N. Buah and Prof. Francis E. Amuquandoh, to advise him to withdraw the petition to pave the way for his regular application to be assessed. According to them, it was the wish of the Vice-Chancellor.\n7wzm | g) Whilst the applicant was considering this advice by the two members of A&P Board, he was copied in a letter dated sixth December, twenty twenty-one written by the Provost of CoHAS to the Director of Human Resource withdrawing his regular application with the reason being that he is not prepared to let sleeping dogs lie with his petition.\ne9xj | h) On ninth December twenty twenty-one, DHR, wrote to the Provost returning Dr. Amegah's regular application document to the College. The applicant received the letter after the Christmas break even though the letter was dated ninth December twenty twenty-one.\n9vl6 | i) Dr. Amegah withdrew the petition on twelfth January twenty twenty-two on the advice of Professors Buah and Amanquandoh as directed by the Vice-Chancellor.\nc2fd | j) On twenty-seventh January twenty twenty-two, the Vice-Chancellor responded to Dr. Amegah's letter withdrawing the petition, indicating that a decision had already been taken on the application before his withdrawal letter was received. However, no such decision had been communicated to Dr. Amegah.\njzvp | k) On the same twenty-seventh January twenty twenty-two, the Vice-Chancellor communicated the Appointments and Promotions Board's decision on his petition submitted on thirteenth January, twenty twenty-one as follows:\nf71y | i. The application from Assistant Lecturer to Senior Lecturer was not due for regular promotion since you assumed duty as Assistant Lecturer on twelfth June, two thousand twelve, and applied for promotion on thirteenth March, two thousand seventeen.\n31e1 | ii. You were on full-time studies for two years and three months. This implies that you did two years and nine months as actual years of service out of six years needed for regular promotion from Assistant Lecturer to Senior Lecturer.\n40ry | iii. Since you served for two years, nine months, your promotion to the rank of Senior Lecturer could not have been a regular mode but accelerated mode.\nd1j2 | iv. The Board did not withdraw the promotion or give post-dated promotion since that would have meant change in effective date of promotion which will imply a refund of all salaries paid to you before the effective date of promotion to Senior Lecturer.\nwstc | b. Prior to receipt of the letter dated twenty-seventh January twenty twenty-two, Dr. Amegah had been invited into a meeting with his Dean and Head of Department to have a discussion on his returned application. At the meeting, he was advised by the Dean to reapply without any letter to that effect from the A&P Board.\nba1e | Convocation, therefore, requests answers to the following question concerning Dr. Amegah's promotion:\nen95 | i. How different is Dr. Amegah's accelerated promotion case from that of Prof. Kyei?\nl3do | ii. Is there anywhere in any minutes of A&P that Dr. Amegah had accessed accelerated promotion before this time?\nu9bo | iii. Why did it take the Appointments and Promotions Board twelve months to respond to the petition seeking clarification of the status of the previous promotions (whether regular or accelerated)?\n7avo | iv. Does the Provost of the College have the right to order the withdrawal of Dr.\nuzo6 | Amegah's regular application on the flimsy grounds that he was not prepared to let sleeping dogs lie with his petition?\n89b4 | v. Did the Provost consult members of the College A&P Committee before writing to withdraw Dr. Amegah's application?\n5f7e | vi. Based on the Provost's reason given for withdrawing his petition, is Dr. Amegah not being punished for holding onto a petition he believes in and for which the A&P board has a statutory responsibility to determine?\nh83u | vii. What caused the over one-month lag between the date DHR letter was written and when Dr. Amegah received his copy? Was it a matter of someone in authority asking DHR to backdate the letter returning of his documents?\nkjoa | viii. Was it an A&P Board decision to return Dr. Amegah's regular promotion documents to him?\nwb1c | C. Wrongful and Capricious Interpretation and Illegal Application of a Committee's Recommendation to Override the University's Statutes and Promotion Criteria\nak13 | i. In two thousand sixteen, some persons were appointed to the ranks of Lecturer and Senior Lecturers at the fledgling School of Medical Sciences in accordance with the two thousand twelve Statutes of the University. Some of the persons appointed as Lecturers were later upgraded to the rank of Senior Lecturer.\ns7el | ii. In their appointment letters, no special criteria other than the promotion criteria would be applied to their next promotion. It was thus understood that promotion from the rank of Senior Lecturer to Associate Professor would require submission of seven papers, while promotion from Lecturer to Senior Lecturer would require submission of five refereed papers for assessment as was the normal requirements.",
