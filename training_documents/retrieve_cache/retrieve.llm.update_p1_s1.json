        "content": "e8nr | Developing Versatile Leadership\nk78w | Leadership consists of opposing strengths, and most leaders have a natural tendency to overdevelop one at the expense of its counterpart. The resulting imbalance diminishes their effectiveness. But leaders who work to guard against such lopsidedness can increase their versatility and their impact.\ng9du | Modern conceptions of leadership suffer from a serious limitation. Although it is generally acknowledged that effective leaders must possess a number of sometimes seemingly contradictory qualities and skill sets, the idea that a strength taken to an extreme can be a weakness does not seem to have registered fully in the practice of management. The notion that inadequate performance results from underdoing any of the requisite skills - delegating, giving direction, communicating, cooperating with peers and so forth - is well established and reflected in most formal systems designed to assess managers for selection or development. However, the idea that performance problems can just as easily spring from taking a given behavior to an extreme has received far less attention.\nf682 | Perhaps the focus on overdoing hasn't been as sharp because its problematic aspects are not immediately obvious - after all, leaders often must go to extremes to meet tough challenges. It is difficult to draw the line, however, between making the serious effort required to get things done and going too far. A problem commonly seen in recently promoted senior executives, for example, is their difficulty in adjusting their skill sets to the requirements of their higher-level jobs. What had, in their previous positions, been a seemingly inoffensive, even useful, tendency to get heavily involved in\nli1k | operational detail can become a big liability in their new roles, resulting in the misallocation of time and attention away from strategic considerations or getting in the way of direct reports' ability to do their jobs. Still, even in executive positions there are situations that require the individual to get deeply involved. For senior managers, then, effectiveness hinges on the ability to appropriately gear their leadership qualities and skills to the circumstances at hand.\npbea | The lack of balance in leadership, which is linked to the idea of overdoing and is well known to individual managers, has also\nccpt | About the Research\n0fpw | The research reported here proceeded in two stages. The first stage was action research: We conducted comprehensive assessments of the leadership of individual senior managers by interviewing scores of coworkers, past and present, and administering a battery of psychological tests. We analyzed the data rigorously and interpreted it with each executive. Patterns gradually emerged - forcefulness taken to an extreme, enabling leadership as the complement of forceful leadership, the tendency for executives to be lopsided one way or the other and so on. Robert Kaplan then developed a three sixty-degree survey to measure versatility, or lack thereof, on forceful and enabling leadership. Later a second major duality - strategic and operational leadership - emerged from our ongoing action research, and we added it to the survey. Above all, the survey needed a way to capture overdoing, which is integral to imbalance. The current version of that scale is:\ndqn8 | In the research we have done to date, using three samples of U.S. executives and evolving generations of the three sixty-degree survey, now called the Leadership Versatility Index, this duality-based way of assessing versatility has proved reliable and valid. The current pairs of survey items that measure versatility on each of the two dualities have good internal reliability, in the point nineties for versatility on the forceful/enabling duality and in the low point eighties for versatility on the strategic/operational duality. In addition, ratings from superiors, peers and direct reports converge to a high degree. Indices of inter-rater reliability and inter-rater agreement easily exceed the minimum standard of point seventy and generally reach the upper point eighties within each rating group.\nlhkq | We tested our hypothesis that versatility is central to effectiveness by correlating scores on a versatility index with ratings of overall effectiveness. The measure of effectiveness is a single item rated by coworkers on a ten-point scale, where ten is outstanding and five is adequate, and our analyses indicate that this measure is reasonably reliable and valid. To arrive at an index of versatility we use the Pythagorean theorem to reduce the scores on opposing sides to a single number for each of the two dualities, forceful-enabling and strategic-operational.\n82ju | In each of the three studies we have done - two on only forceful-enabling leadership and one on both dualities - there has been a sizable correlation between the versatility index and overall effectiveness, on average in the upper point fifties. This was true for ratings of all coworkers taken together and for each group (superiors, peers and direct reports) taken separately. The correlations were\ny2qo | not fully registered in the practice of management. When presented with two opposing approaches, people in general have a tendency to polarize, placing a high value on the approach in which they have greater faith and competence while overlooking or demeaning the value of the other. Despite their obvious intelligence, executives are no different. They may be too task-oriented and not sufficiently people-oriented, too tough and not responsive enough to people's needs, too big-picture-oriented with not enough emphasis on planning and follow-through. One strategically gifted individual, for example, called the practical\n1piq | also significant when versatility and effectiveness were each rated by different groups. Furthermore, in the study of both dualities, the correlation between versatility and effectiveness was about point sixty in each case, and they each made their own contribution to predicting effectiveness, together explaining over half of the variability. In other words, versatility in terms of these two dualities accounted for the majority of what it meant to be an effective executive.\n7fqw | process of implementing plans \"operational gruel.\" A senior manager who made a career of turning around troubled operations spoke of strategy meetings as \"spending fluff time.\" A naturally powerful leader expressed severe misgivings about \"get-along/go-along\" types. Another was too attached to the idea of being \"nice\" to his people and harbored resentment toward managers who lead with obvious personal power.\nrhaz | We have commonly seen imbalances like these when assessing executives in our consulting work on leadership. To address the imbalances, we have found it helpful to define leadership skills and qualities in terms of paired approaches that may look like opposites but together constitute a balanced whole. This view leads to the notion of leadership effectiveness as the ability to draw freely from two opposing sides as appropriate for a given situation, unencumbered by prejudice against or bias for either - in other words, the ability to be versatile. It became clear to us in our work that there are two overarching balances to be struck in that regard: the balance between forceful leadership and enabling leadership (the first to emerge and the one we have studied the most) and the balance between strategic leadership and operational leadership. That is not to say that no other major distinctions apply - that between general-management skills and technical/functional expertise, for instance - but the two highlighted here far exceed any others in importance.\nwak1 | Consulting the literature and relying on our firsthand exposure to executive leaders, we define forceful leadership on the basis of a leader's own intellect and energy - taking charge, taking stands, having leadership presence, being decisive, setting challenging expectations for people, holding them accountable, making tough calls, asking probing questions and so on. We define enabling leadership as creating conditions for other people to be forces in their own right - empowering them, being receptive to where others stand on issues, being responsive to the needs of others, being understanding when others don't deliver, sharing the limelight and so on.",
