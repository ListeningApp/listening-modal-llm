He stated that, in such a situation, change was the proper domain of the legislation 'enacted after full inquiry and informed assessment of international as well as domestic considerations of a kind which the Court is not equipped to make of its own initiative.' Despite these cautious words, one is left with the impression that, if the policy considerations before Deane J had been considered more compelling, the judge would have had little hesitation in overruling the pre-existing authorities. As such, the comments of Deane J represent a clear recognition of the proper and legitimate creative role of the courts - especially of the nation's highest court.\ncox8 | THE HIGH COURT 'CREATES' LAW\nppqi | That the High Court of Australia has substantially abandoned strict adherence to past authority and the notion of judicial restraint is evidenced not just in Mabo. It can be seen in a number of recent decisions which exemplify that court's new-found creativity.\noxou | In Trident General Insurance Co. Ltd v McNeice Bros Pty Ltd, the High Court by majority held that a person, not a party to an insurance contract, was entitled to enforce the indemnity against the party's liability to pay damages as the result of a successful claim in negligence against the party. While the ramifications of the decision remain to be explored, the decision may have dispensed with the doctrine of privity of contract. It\n495n | In Defence of Mabo\nawri | may have done so by court decision and this despite many calls for legislative reform which earlier fell upon deaf ears in Parliament.\nbl28 | Similarly, in Mckinney v The Queen, the High Court, by majority, laid down a 'rule of practice for the future' to be applied in the context of confessions made by a person in police custody. The 'rule' was that, wherever police evidence of a confessional statement allegedly made by an accused while in police custody was disputed at trial, and its making was not reliably corroborated, the judge should warn the jury of the danger of convicting on the basis of that evidence alone. Law reform bodies had for years cried out for legislative reform in this area (as Brennan J noted in a powerful dissent). The court-mandated requirement would have implications for police practice and resources. Yet the High Court would wait no longer for legislation based on law reform reports. It acted resolutely itself to defend the justice of proceedings in Australian courts.\nd5bz | In R v L, the High Court unanimously rejected the notion that, by reason of marriage, there was an irrevocable consent to sexual intercourse on the part of a spouse. This legal fiction had survived for two centuries. It was peremptorily terminated.\nap5o | In Australian Capital Television Pty Ltd v The Commonwealth (No. two) the High Court, by majority, held invalid key provisions of the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Act nineteen ninety-one upon the ground that they involved a severe impairment of freedoms previously enjoyed by Australian citizens to discuss public and political affairs and to criticise federal institutions. An implied guarantee of freedom of speech with respect to public and political discussion was found to be inherent to a constitutional democracy such as Australia. This was despite the fact that previous suggestions that the Australian Constitution required freedom of speech and other communication had been strongly rejected.\n7zvf | In David Securities Pty Ltd and Others v Commonwealth Bank of Australia, the majority held that a rule, well settled for nearly two hundred years, precluding the recovery of money paid under mistake of law should no longer be regarded as part of the law of Australia.\nmov9 | In Dietrich v The Queen, the majority held that, in the absence of exceptional circumstances, a judge should, on application, adjourn, postpone or stay a criminal trial where an indigent accused person, charged with a serious offence is, through no fault of their own, unable to obtain legal representation. If such an application were refused and the resulting trial were unfair, the conviction might be quashed upon the ground of miscarriage of justice. This decision was in marked contrast to the earlier decision of the High Court in McInnis v The Queen. The dissent of Murphy J in that case was approved, and followed, in the Dietrich case.\nw1w1 | These examples clearly demonstrate the High Court's marked tendency towards judicial activism and creativity. Against such a pro-active and reformatory approach, it ought not have come as any real surprise to the astute observer of the judiciary in Australia that the High Court in Mabo would adopt the course which it did. No doubt the Mabo decision is creative. No doubt it sits upon the fine line which separates a truly legislative act from the exercise of true judicial function. However, it is certainly consistent with the recent approach of the High Court to many difficult problems where injustices have long endured and been completely ignored by the legislature despite repeated calls for urgent reform.\nh8gv | A system based upon the common law, of its nature, requires a creative judiciary. If the judges of the common law did not so act, the law would fail to adapt and change to modern society. In the past, strict legalism usually served society well. Nowadays, a mature common law system requires that strict legalism be tempered by judicial consideration of both principle and policy in stating what the law is. Strict and complete legalism, giving effect to simple views concerning the separation of powers doctrine, has become entirely inappropriate to a modern common law system. This is especially the case where the system operates under a written constitution designed to endure indefinitely. The recent increase in apparent creativity on the part of the courts in Australia may be the more noticeable only because of their earlier abstinence long maintained. That abstinence may have created a log jam of injustice which only now the High Court and other Australian courts are striving to clear.\nkwkp | Where inquiry is focused upon the creative nature of the judiciary, except in very clear cases, the debate often turns to emotive, rather than substantive, questions. Mabo is a very clear example of this. The essential complaint is not about the legal veracity of the Mabo decision. Pace Mr Connolly, few would argue that six of the seven Justices of the High Court\nyj0m | In Defence of Mabo\newfp | simply got the law wrong. The essential complaint, as I understand it, is that the court ought not have done what it did in this case. Yet Mabo, reduced to fundamentals, says only that: (a) our system of real property law accommodates native title; (b) native title may be extinguished; (c) it may be extinguished in a number of ways by either the Crown or by the indigenous people themselves; and (d) where it has been extinguished there may (or may not) be a right to compensation.\n```",
