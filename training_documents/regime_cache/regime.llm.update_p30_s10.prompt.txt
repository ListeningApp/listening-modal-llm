You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

p450 | Approximation of the full response <LATEX>r _ { \alpha } \left( \eta \right) .</LATEX> In this work, we compute the full re- sponse in order to quantify how much, and how quickly the response deviates from the linear regime. In actual applications, one typically does not compute the full response curve, in particular when using Monte Carlo simulations. The quantity of interest, namely the transport coefficient, comes from the linear response, which can be obtained from computing a single point (or typically two to ensure linearity), so computing the full response curve is not of interest.
rsvo | The full response curve can be computed by solving the Fokker-Planck equa- tion (3.3), which we recall for convenience

For the discretization of the PDEs (4.1), (4.2) and (4.3), we use a finite-difference scheme. Periodic boundary conditions are used in the spatial variable since we always consider <LATEX>q \in \mathbb{T} ^ { d }</LATEX> for both overdamped Lanvegin and Langevin dynamics, with <LATEX>d = 1</LATEX> or <LATEX>d = 2 .</LATEX> For overdamped Langevin dynamics, we use a centered finite-difference scheme. For the one-dimensional Langevin dynamics, the momentum

We ensured that our truncated value of the momentum Pmax = 6 is large enough so that it does not affect the numerical results. A centered scheme is also used for Langevin dynamics, except for the transport term -p M-1q in the Fokker-Planck equation (2.17), where an upwind scheme is used (refer to Appendix B for the precise expressions of the aforementioned numerical schemes). All computations were performed with the Julia language.

09z2 | We consider the observable
13fv | (4.5) R(q) = (a cos(2Tq) + bsin(2Tq)) eBV(q),
v5pj | where a, b E R. We choose this observable for two reasons. First, by construction, it has average zero with respect to the Gibbs probability measure, with density propor- tional to e-BV. Second, we can tune the coefficients a and b to control the magnitude of the individual orders of response. This allows us to choose a and b such that the first and second-order responses are normalized, i.e. P1 = P2 = 1, which makes it easier to compare the quality of each synthetic forcing.
trab | Due to the symmetries of the potential energy function (4.4), we can directly compute the values of a and b such that p1 = P2 = 1. More precisely, it can be shown that f1 and f2 are respectively odd and even on [-1/2, 1/2] so that b controls the magnitude of P1 and a controls the magnitude of 02. The value of b such that p1 = 1 is easily computed using (2.34) to be

t25w | The spatial domain T = [0, 1) is discretized into m = 2000 points, with uniform step size h = 1/m. The simulations were performed with inverse temperature ß = 1 and mass M = 1, which is also the setting for the results in two dimensions obtained in Section 4.3. Moreover, we consider the forcing F = 1, as this is the only nongradient forcing in dimension one on the torus.
x62u | We present the full response curves and the associated linear response for each of the three synthetic forcings discussed in Section 3.2.2. Figures 3a, 3b and 3c correspond to the Feynman-Kac forcing (3.9), modified fluctuation-dissipation (3.8) and divergence-free vector field (3.5), respectively. Note that in dimension one, (3.5) reduces to a single option, namely
aoc8 | Èextra = ev d. da'

m04v | which is the one used here. For each of the plots, we show the linear response, the full response curve <LATEX>r _ { 0 } \left( \eta \right)</LATEX> for <LATEX>\alpha = 0 ,</LATEX> the response curve for <LATEX>r _ { \alpha ^ { \star } } \left( \eta \right)</LATEX> for <LATEX>\alpha ^ { \star }</LATEX> computed using (3.13), and response curves for some additional values of <LATEX>\alpha \in \mathbb{R}</LATEX> for illustrative purposes. In some cases, in particular when the response curve associated with <LATEX>\alpha ^ { \star }</LATEX> sees marginal improvement in extending the linear regime, we also compute the curve for <LATEX>\alpha _ { \star } \left( \varepsilon \right) ,</LATEX> where we choose <LATEX>\varepsilon = 0 . 0 5 .</LATEX> Lastly, Figure 3d includes all synthetic forcings. Note that the maximal value of the forcing is much larger for Figure 3d, where we compare the best choices for the magnitude of each synthetic forcing; this is also the setting for the illustrations presented in Sections 4.3 and 4.4.
