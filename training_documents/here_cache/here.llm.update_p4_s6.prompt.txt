You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

75y3 | . You probably wouldn't know that [I] am Chinese. I have one of the strangest names in the world, but at least if someone asked, "Where's Sterling?" nobody would say, "Sterling who?" (Sterling Tan)
s2g2 | What lessons should the school be teaching, I wondered, about the his- torical depth and intricacy of the great divide that these students continue to live out? How might it help them understand the histories carried in these innocent acts of self-identification? It was not that the question of identity
q1q2 | was missing from the school curriculum. Students have long had lessons on who is and who is not a member of this imagined community known as Canada.4 These lessons do their share to make each student, in effect, "a pré- cis of all the past," as Antonio Gramsci framed it: "For each individual is the synthesis not only of existing relations, but the history of these relations" (1971, P. 353). A strong source of light that the schools can throw on "the his- tory of these relations," I argue, is found in reviewing imperialism's educa- tional project.
cb7r | One student in Kathy's class framed her identity in terms of ethnicity- "My ethnic background is Chinese but I was born in Vancouver and have lived here all my life" (Karen Yu)-yet there is still the strength of the con- trast, established by her use of "but," of her Chinese background and her life in Vancouver.5 The Kiplingesque division between East and West remains firmly a part of this city's vision of itself as the gateway to the Asian Pacific, a city in which half of the students speak English as their second language. Al- though the city is often given to celebrating its multiculturalism, the news- paper boxes a few blocks from Kathy Chin's school are occasionally defaced with "Chinks go home," and stickers placed on telephone poles in a local sub- urb at one point read, "Save a Young Mind, Stop Multiculturalism." The city's leading newspaper has run headlines on the order of "Immigrants Form Pool for Disease, Doctors Say" and "Cost of Providing ESL [English as a Sec- ond Language] Classes Is Eating Up the Education Dollar." Clearly, the graf- fiti would be a lot easier to deal with-as messages of misguided hate and ig- norance-if they did not appear to be underwritten at times by the city's newspapers and doctors.6
68xu | Of course, there were also students in Kathy's class who did not appear to have to face such issues:
hd35 | I am 15 (turning 16 on April 7) with blonde hair and blue eyes. I'm pretty short. I was captain of the cheerleading squad for a football team. (Susan Harris)
2zpk | Hello, my name is James Statley. I live in Vancouver, British Columbia. I like sports a lot. I hate school. (Jim Statley)
epu7 | My name is Robert Campbell, and I am a Libra. (Robert Campbell)
7od1 | It would seem that the play of race and ethnicity in identity is not necessar- ily everyone's affair, and this, too, signifies a gap in the students' education. All students need to understand the historical legacy of these self-identifica- tions. They need to see how it is that white is a color that need not name it- self. No one makes this more apparent than the antiracist educator Peggy MacIntosh when she speaks of the "invisible weightless knapsack" of white privilege, out of which she pulls some twenty-six instances, including, "I can be sure that my children will be given curricular materials that testify to the existence of their race," and, "I am never asked to speak for all the people of my racial group" (1990, p. 35). MacIntosh's last point strikes home all the more as this speaking-for-my-race is what I've done on behalf of Kathy Chin and her classmates, just as they have used this racial/ethnic identification out of a sense of history for which I am holding education accountable in this book.
0bqy | The real issue is obviously not how Kathy and her classmates chose to identify themselves. My concern is with whether the schools can do more to help the young understand the educational formation of worldly divisions that carry with them a profound sense of who belongs where. The postimpe- rial migration of people around the world today poses profound challenges to what we once knew and assumed of the world. Just as the changes involve Kathy Chin, I would argue, so also they include, and must become a part of the education of, her classmate Robert Campbell. He also needs to under- stand how the community he lives in is changing as part of a history that has long involved the sort of dislocations that first brought the Scots to Canada even as they displaced the people who had lived here for thousands of years before that. Imperialism does not tell the whole of students' stories, but it does figure in what they will learn of the world.
b780 | The Canadian literary critic Northrop Frye, whose work I focus on in chapter 9, wisely commented that that great identity question "Where is
ccmb | here?" was less perplexing than "Who am I?" (1971a, p. 220). The geoidentity question "Where is here?"-which in Matthew Arnold's "Stanzas from the Grande Chartreuse" takes the form "And what am I, that I am here?" (1895, I. 66)-does have a way of linking our various histories as indigenes, colonials, immigrants, expatriates, tourists, citizens, refugees, and displaced persons. It is easy to see that many of the disputes that threaten the future of Canada, as well as those that concern broader questions of national identity, are about the nature of "here."
ma93 | What Imperialism?
c6hh | The Columbus quincentenary, celebrated a few year ago, was staged as a great marketing opportunity for blockbuster art shows and epic movies, yet for many the event amounted to what performance artist Guillermo Gómez- Peña called "a dance on the wound of history."7 It was also a grim reminder of how students in the West have long been asked to honor the inflicting of that wound. We might take the familiar classroom mnemonic "In fourteen hundred and ninety-two / Columbus sailed the ocean blue" as proof of how Columbus has long been at the heart of what it means to be schooled. A new account, if not a new rhyme, of imperialism's misadventures, which has been long overdue in the schools, has begun to be written for the classroom, as I will point out presently. What also needs to be reviewed is imperialism's record of learned achievements, which was to shape our modern sensibility.
y7ea | Such accounts need to begin with the often-taught pursuits of the Por- tuguese along the coast of Africa, Columbus in the Caribbean, the Spanish in America, Cabot and Raleigh across the Atlantic and their countrymen in India, the Dutch in Southeast Asia, and later the Germans in Africa and the Americans in the Pacific. They need to include imperialism's influence through Europe's age of exploration and the Renaissance, the founding of colonies and the Enlightenment, the opening of the Pacific and the rise of Romanticism, the Victorian age and the scramble for Africa. They need to confront a trade in human beings that forced 12 million people from sub- Saharan Africa on a deadly journey into slavery in the Western Hemisphere. They need to address the devastation of indigenous populations through mil- itary campaigns, economic exploitation, and the spread of epidemics. They also need to consider the encyclopedic project of mapping and naming all
