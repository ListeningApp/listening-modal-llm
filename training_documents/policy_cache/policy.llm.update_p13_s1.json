        "content": "8p6h | versatile. We were told over and over again that one cannot make too big a mistake there even when you would not do things in a certain way. Yet somehow, when you were accustomed with the previous, like, there was only one way of doing things because the old system did not proceed if you did not tick a box.\npmgl | The street-level workers emphasized that the differences between the I S' operational logics created a need to unlearn old and to learn new practices and ways of working. For them, it was difficult to give up on the previously learnt practices and therefore the implementation of the new I S was difficult; the street-level workers knew how to use the previous system but not how to operate with the new, more up-to-date and nuanced I S.\n90no | It was like 'this is impossible, this system, it's impossible to learn how to use it and only if we could still use the previous system, and this we did not need to do in the old system ... ' We felt that the menus were difficult and where is everything, and we kind of got stuck to these little details like ... 'what is this, I cannot get pass this because I don't know what to click or, where do I find this and that, or how do I start to get accustomed with the view which has these different options', like this kind of basic stuff.\njt0y | In addition, the new I S was based on different terminology than the previously used information system. Even after the implementation, the street-level workers had noticed that the terminology and commands used in the previous I S were still used, guiding the practices of their everyday work. They stated that this was one source of frustration and confusion; people were still using the outdated terminology to make sense of and to help others in their everyday work.\nqb7o | Attitudes, beliefs and lack of support\noae5 | Prior to the implementation, negative atmosphere among the street-level workers affected their attitudes and beliefs towards the implementation process and the new I S. The street-level workers admitted that this negative atmosphere towards the new I S caused difficulties for both learning and development of the system. Partially, the negative interpretations about the new I S were created and strengthened by the news media, impacting the street-level workers' motivation and willingness to use and to further develop the I S.\ns0fl | And perhaps, I feel that the negative views about Apotti is due to news media also, like what I have seen is that the news, which might not have anything to do with Apotti, but the headlines scream Apotti and something [laughs] negative after it, it is quite funny for me because I have used the system since the implementation and it troubles me that this ready-made negative atmosphere does not help, I mean that the employees have these negative attitude beforehand towards the system. It's a shame.\n43ia | The street-level workers were worried about how the new I S would change their work and its practices. All in all, the uncertainty experienced about the new I S as well as worries that would their own skills be sufficient affect the street-level workers attitudes towards new I S. The uncertainty about one's capabilities as a learner, fear of mistakes as well as lack of courage and skills sustained the negative attitudes towards the implementation. The street-level workers' impression was that a successful implementation of the new I S required technical skills, curiosity towards the new and unknown as well as courage to try-and-possibly-fail when using the I S in practice. Curiosity and courage were needed mostly because the street-level workers felt that the operational logic of the new I S was profoundly different to the ones they had previously used, and at the implementation phase the street-level workers' focus was heavily on questioning the operational logic of the I S. In addition, they did not feel that they had possibilities to influence this operational logic, which made it difficult to accept the change causing frustration. Using and testing the new I S in practice, thus, required skills and courage to try, and those street-level workers who felt that they lacked the skills needed, were hesitating to use the I S and feared that they would make mistakes: \"I noticed that people are extremely cautious with Apotti, there are all kinds of arrows and stuff, yet people are afraid to open or click those, people are super cautious to utilize all that you could do with it\n3g2y | The street-level worker's own positive attitude towards new technology and learning was seen as a crucial aspect of a successful implementation process. They relied extensively on the individual's capabilities, attitude and willingness in learning to use the new I S and technology in general. Indeed, the implementation was not difficult for all street-level workers, and those who were both interested in technology and had a positive attitude towards learning were more positive towards the implementation: \"And somehow, this colleague said that it is not a big deal for her, it's like\ngc7v | starting a new job where you have a new system that you need to learn, it was not that big of a deal to many.\" In addition, street-level workers' attitude towards the new I S, its implementation and their own capability to learn were more positive when they had already had previous experiences of successful implementation processes or had previously learnt to use different information systems.\nwqfv | When the new I S had been in use for a while - approximately one and a half years by the time of the interviews - the street-level workers had noticed a change in attitudes and beliefs towards the I S: \" I think that people only noticed Apotti's positive aspects after using it for some time, when I was in the middle of the chaos in the beginning, the talk was really negative and people got stuck to the negativity.\" When they had incrementally learnt to use the new I S in practice, the attitudes were more positive, and the I S had become a common tool for their everyday work. Changes in the attitudes from criticism towards acceptance had clearly benefitted the implementation process. However, this change in attitudes took time.\nj30a | Although leaning extensively towards the individual workers' attitudes and their capabilities to learn, the street-level workers talked only little about the role of their managers. This absence of managerial impact for the implementation process is something worth reflecting; was the lack of support from the managers on how to use the I S in practice influencing the street-level workers' ability to successfully implement the new I S?\n7bdk | And it was just bypassed [by the managers] like, 'don't use it, then as long as you do something'. Or that you don't need to use it. Or just try ... this was the conversation. And of course, if you give your employees the possibility that they can do something difficult if they want to, then obviously they won't do that and will use the easier way, Perhaps in some units the managers have stated more clearly that this is how we do things, everyone does like this, and there are no other options. And when people start doing it, that is when you learn, and it becomes a routine.\nfim0 | Importantly, the street-level workers lacked understanding about the I S' usage for statistical and reporting purposes, and they felt that it was the managers' responsibility to ensure that these requirements were sufficiently met. Thus, managerial support and vision about how to implement the new technology in practice was lacking and called after.\nojro | Implementation happened individually\nl6t9 | The implementation was done during the street-level workers' everyday work with the clients. Due to their busy schedules, learning to use the new I S along with the everyday work felt difficult. The street-level workers felt that there was no time for them to focus on really understanding how the I S operates. Instead of fully understanding the operational logic, the time restrictions limited the use of the I S only to the crucial features necessary for everyday work practices.",
