You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

ko3c | There is another factor to consider with regard to the results with probe 1. The discussion of steric effects on the rate constant for ring opening of substrate-derived radical ignored the fact that two enantiomers of this substrate were allowed to react with the chiral enzyme. If sterics-enforced stereoelectronic effects were operative, it is unlikely that both enantiomeric radicals derived from the enantiomers of the probe would suffer similar ring- opening rate retardations. The formation of aryl hydroxylated product in amounts comparable to the amount of alcohol la produced complicates the analysis, however. As indicated above, it is likely that the two different products are derived from the two different enantiomers of the probe substrate. Further studies with enantiomerically pure probes are planned to resolve this question.
xek3 | Aside from steric factors within the active site, other consid- erations to explain the lack of rearranged substrate with M. capsulatus (Bath) must be addressed. For example, one cannot rule out that the hydroxylation reaction may proceed through two different mechanisms from a common intermediate. One pathway, D or E, could involve a substrate radical, thus accounting for the rearranged products observed with MMO from <LATEX>M .</LATEX> trichosporium OB3b. An alternative pathway could involve mechanism A, <LATEX>B ,</LATEX> C, or <LATEX>F .</LATEX> The specific pathway chosen would then depend on the energetics of the substrate. It is possible, however, that the fre- quency with which each pathway is followed may differ between the two organisms. Alternatively, MMO from M. capsulatus (Bath) and M. trichosporium OB3b may exhibit different hy- droxylation mechanisms, which would explain the presence of ring-opened products for the latter.
bbpr | We now return to the intramolecular deuterium isotope effect of 5.1 observed for the hydroxylation of deuterated 1. Although an isotope effect of this magnitude is generally associated with processes that involve a relatively linear transition state,75 such as would occur for oxygen rebound, mechanisms containing in- tramolecular cyclic transition states cannot be excluded. In fact, dimethyldioxirane, a reagent believed to oxidize hydrocarbons via an insertion process,76 oxidized cyclododecane-do and <LATEX>- d _ { 2 4 }</LATEX> with an isotope effect of 5.77 Thus our observed value of 5.1 would be consistent with pathways A, <LATEX>B ,</LATEX> <LATEX>\mathrm { C } \left( 1 \right) ,</LATEX> and <LATEX>F ,</LATEX> all of which involve transition states for C-H bond cleavage that resemble the diox- irane oxygen insertion process and avoid the formation of <LATEX>a</LATEX> substrate radical or carbocation in the catalytic cycle.75 The

bqfb | In summary, the failure of substrate probes 1 and 2 to form rearranged alcohol products upon hydroxylation with the M. capsulatus (Bath) MMO is best interpreted in terms of a mechanism that does not involve the formation of a radical or carbocation, namely, A, B, C(1), or F. It is unlikely that the enzyme active site induces a stereoelectronic barrier to ring opening. The fact that the same amount (85%) of the probe, both converted and unconverted, can be recovered from the enzymatic reaction mixture under hydroxylation conditions or in control reactions omitting NADH indicates that ring-opened substrate radical has not formed and been lost in the extraction procedure. In addition, these probes do not lead to inactivation of the enzyme over the time course of the reactions, indicating that ring-opened product has not formed and reacted with the enzyme. The kinetic isotope results are consistent with a concerted pathway for C-H bond insertion for the key hydroxylation step.
wwdt | Comparisons with Related Work. The MMO mechanism is almost always drawn in analogy to that of cytochrome P-450.8,15,16 In particular, a catalytic cycle involving an iron oxo intermediate (Scheme III) that abstracts H' from the alkane (mechanism D, Scheme IV) has been proposed by several authors. The ability of high concentrations of hydrogen peroxide to effect a shunt pathway for the M. trichosporium OB3b MMO has been cited as evidence for heterolytic cleavage of the O-O bond,16 although it is noteworthy that, unlike the situation for cytochrome P-450, other oxo-transfer reagents could not be substituted for H2O2. Hydrogen peroxide does not operate at comparable levels in the M. capsulatus (Bath) system.59 Various authors have invoked radical intermediates for the hydroxylation reaction. For example, exo,exo,exo,exo-2,3,5,6-d4-norbornane epimerizes upon hy- droxylation by M. trichosporium OB3b MMO,15 a result that has its parallels in cytochrome P-450 chemistry.79 The extent of epimerization with MMO, however, was significantly less, being 2% following hydrogen atom abstraction from the endo position compared to 18% with cytochrome P-450, and 5% after abstraction at the exo position compared to 14% with cytochrome P-450. Similarly, allylic rearrangements occurred in 20% of the MMO hydroxylation products from 3,3,6,6-d4-cyclohexene compared to 33% with cytochrome P-450.15.80 Mechanistic studies of MMO from M. trichosporium OB3b with the free radical probe 1,1- dimethylcyclopropane and with (S)- and (R)-[1-2H,1-3H]ethane were also consistent with radical formation, but cationic inter- mediates could not be ruled out.14,45 It has also been claimed that radical intermediates can be trapped during methane hydroxylation by the MMO of M. capsulatus (Bath).24 In addition, the mechanism for olefin epoxidation by MMO from M. trichospo- rium OB3b differs from that believed to occur with cytochrome P-450.15 With cytochrome P-450, the 1-trans proton of propylene exchanges with solvent protons during turnover,81 leading to the hypothesis that the epoxidation mechanism involves oxametallo- cycles and iron carbene intermediates. In the reaction of propylene with MMO, however, no such exchange occurred.15
mn1r | In view of these and the present results, it would appear that no single unifying mechanism can account for all of the data. Instead, it seems likely to us that more than one mechanism might

meyw | be operative, depending upon factors such as the steric demands of the substrate at the active site of the hydroxylase, the organism from which the MMO is isolated, and even the temperature at which the hydroxylation is carried out. There are differences in the coupling proteins obtained from the M. capsulatus (Bath) and M. trichosporium OB3b organisms,82,83 which could alter the properties of the system. Moreover, it should be recalled that the M. capsulatus (Bath) methanotroph was isolated from thermal waters and has its optimal monooxygenase activity at 45 ℃, whereas the MMO from M. trichosporium OB3b is typically assayed at ambient temperature (23 ℃). Further studies, in- volving additional mechanistic probes and the application of other methodologies, are currently in progress to provide further insight into these issues.
2e62 | Conclusions. The major findings of this investigation may be summarized as follows:
75y3 | 1. The absence of ring-opened products in the hydroxylation of probes 1 and 2 suggests that the mechanism for MMO from M. capsulatus (Bath) may not involve radicals or carbocations, at least for these substrates.
s2g2 | 2. Isotope-effect studies with deuterated probe 1 indicate that the hydroxylation step is not rate-determining in the overall MMO mechanism but that substantial C-H bond activation is involved in this step.
q1q2 | 3. The observation that equimolar quantities of phenol and alcohol are produced in the hydroxylations of racemic mixtures of 1 and its trideuterated analogue implies that chiral discrimi- nation in the enzyme active site can dictate the regiospecificity of the reaction.
cb7r | 4. A semiquantitative Marcus theory analysis was used to evaluate how the ring-opening rate constant of phenyl-substituted cyclopropanes can be tuned by changing the dihedral angle be- tween the phenyl and cyclopropyl rings.
68xu | 5. Several detailed proposals have been set forth for two discrete arcs of the MMO catalytic cycle (Scheme II), the activation of the reduced, diiron(II) form by dioxygen (Scheme III), and the subsequent hydroxylation step (Scheme IV). These considerations should serve as a valuable reference point for the interpretation of mechanistic results from diiron oxo and related monooxygenases as well as their model compounds.
hd35 | 6. Analysis of the present and literature results for the hy- droxylation of hydrocarbons by MMO suggests that multiple mechanisms may be operative.
