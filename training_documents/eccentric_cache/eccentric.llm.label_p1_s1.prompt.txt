o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

1pjs | A Review of Research on Steel Eccentrically Braced Frames Sina Kazemzadeh Azad, Cem Topkaya*
o2kr | Abstract: This paper reviews the research conducted on steel eccentrically braced frames (EBFs). Both component level and system level responses for such braced frames are treated and discussed. For the component level response, a thorough review of the investigations on links, which are the primary sources of energy dissipation in EBFs, has been presented. The results of experimental and numerical studies on strength, rotation capacity, and overstrength of links are discussed. Furthermore, studies on the effects of axial force, the presence of a concrete slab, the loading history, compactness, link detailing, and the lateral bracing on link behavior are summarized. Relevant available research on link-to-column connections is revisited. Different approaches for the numerical modeling of links are also given. For the system level response, characteristics of EBF systems are discussed in light of the capacity design approach. Findings of numerical studies on the seismic performance of EBFs are discussed to provide insight into suitable response factors utilized in the design of these systems. Additionally, special topics and emerging applications of EBFs, such as replaceable links, are provided. The impact of research findings on the design of EBF systems is demonstrated considering the AISC Seismic Provisions for Structural Steel Buildings. Finally, future research needs for improvement of EBF design and application are identified and presented.

936l | 1. Introduction
06yq | The main idea in the design of an eccentrically braced frame (EBF) is to integrate the advantages of both moment resisting frame (MRF) and concentrically braced frame (CBF) lateral load resisting
dpv6 | systems into a single structural system. The EBF system originated from Japan in 1970s [1, 2] with the aim of achieving a structure with high elastic stiffness as well as high energy dissipation during severe earthquakes.
8r5j | There are several configurations for an EBF system, some of which are depicted in Figure 1 along with their expected plastic mechanisms. Larger architectural openings can be used with EBF systems when compared to CBFs. The short segment of the frame generally designated by the length e (Figure 1) is called the link. In EBF systems, yielding is concentrated only at link segments and all other members of the frame are proportioned to remain essentially elastic. Therefore, during severe earthquakes, links can be considered as structural fuses which will dissipate the seismic input energy through stable and controlled plastic deformations.
2taz | A comprehensive review is provided in this paper on the behavior and design of eccentrically braced frames. The review includes research conducted on links, as they comprise the most critical elements of an EBF. In addition, the research on EBF system response is elaborated. Areas of future research needs are also identified. The comparison of design provisions as presented in various design specifications is out of the scope of this work; however, the AISC Seismic Provisions for Structural Steel Buildings [3] are mentioned to illustrate relationships between research findings and design rules.
o3ya | 2. Characteristics of Links
r5il | 2.1. Yield Behavior, Shear Capacity and Overstrength
5gui | The length of a link segment (e) is one of the key parameters that controls the stiffness, strength, ductility, and behavior of an EBF system. The link length ratio, p = e/(Mp/Vp), where Mp and Vp are the plastic moment and plastic shear capacities of the link, provides a convenient measure for the yield behavior. The free-body diagram of an isolated link is shown in Figure 2. Based on equilibrium, considering equal end moments at the ultimate state, no moment-shear interaction, and an elastic- perfectly plastic material, the theoretical dividing link length ratio between shear dominated and flexure dominated behavior is ptheor = 2.0. In short (or shear) links, shear yielding of the web is found
82qc | to be predominant (Figure 3a). On the other hand, in long (or moment) links, flexural yielding controls the link behavior (Figure 3c). An intermediate link, however, would experience a combination of both shear and flexural yielding (Figure 3b).
ls7d | There are substantial differences between the behavior of short and long links. Although longer links provide more architectural freedom for openings, early experimental studies by Roeder and Popov [4, 5] and Hjelmstad and Popov [6, 7] showed that the performance of short links is considerably better than that of long links under severe cyclic loadings in terms of strength and ductility. Over the years Popov and his colleagues [6, 8-10] suggested different practical limiting lengths for shear dominated behavior, finally arriving at the limit of <LATEX>\rho < 1 . 6 ,</LATEX> which is still in use in many design specifications including AISC 341-10 [3].
tzt3 | The first comprehensive study on the behavior of intermediate and long links <LATEX>\left( \rho > 1 . 6 \right)</LATEX> was conducted by Engelhardt and Popov [11] in 1989. A total of 14 tests were conducted on 12 two-third scale subassemblage specimens with <LATEX>\rho</LATEX> ranging from 1.45 to 4.25. Based on the experimental results it was concluded that a gradual transition from the shear-dominant behavior to the flexure-dominant behavior occurs as <LATEX>\rho</LATEX> is increased from 1.6 up to 3. Despite this, in most of the previous and current specifications (e.g. [3, 12]), links with length ratios of <LATEX>1 . 6 < p < 2 . 6</LATEX> are classified as intermediate links while links with <LATEX>p > 2 . 6</LATEX> are generally referred to as long links. It is important to note that the presence of high axial force in a link may change this categorization, as discussed in Section 2.3. Engelhardt and Popov [11] also reported that moment-shear interaction has a notable effect on the behavior of intermediate links, while short and long links are generally unaffected.
t8vv | Terms such as very short and very long links are also used in the literature. Although there are no explicit definitions, links with <LATEX>p > 3 \sim 3 . 5</LATEX> are sometimes referred to as very long links [11, 13] while links with <LATEX>\mathrm { \rho } < 1</LATEX> as very short links [14]. In 2012, finite element (FE) analyses conducted by Daneshmand and Hashemi [13] demonstrated that the behavior of very long links can differ notably from that of long links in terms of failure mode and ductility, and thus, dividing the long link range in design codes into two or more sub-regions was suggested. Furthermore, recent studies (e.g. [14]) have proved that there are also other remarkable differences between the characteristics of very short links and short links, which will be discussed later.
qvnu | The nominal shear capacity (Vn) of a link can be defined as follows [3]:
kggw | V2 = Min [Vp, 2M p/e]
xrd1 | (1)
5746 | where the plastic capacities (i.e. Vp and Mp) are calculated based on the nominal yield stress, Fy. For links with length ratios less than 2.0 the first term will govern; however, for longer links the second term is dominant. In order to meet the objectives of the capacity design approach, it is necessary to estimate the maximum shear force that can develop in a link during an intense loading, i.e. Vmax- Consequently, other structural members shall be designed to remain essentially elastic and resist the loads developed by the fully yielded and strain hardened link. Any underestimation of the maximum link force may lead to unfavorable failures in other members. To have a reliable estimate of Vmax the link overstrength concept is generally utilized as follows:
7toz | Vmax =92(R,V2) =QV (2)
j346 | where Ry is the ratio of expected to nominal yield stress, considered for each steel grade based on statistical data, Ve is the expected (or actual) shear capacity of the link, and Q is the overstrength factor due to strain hardening. Early experimental studies by Popov and his colleagues [4, 6, 11, 15, 16] suggested the value of Q = 1.5 for design purposes, which is still (implicitly) in use in most seismic design specifications (e.g. [3, 17]). The link overstrengths observed in the previous experimental studies on horizontal I-shaped links [6, 11, 14, 15, 18-39] are presented in Figure 4. The traditional line of Q2 = 1.5 is also depicted in this figure. It should be mentioned that the value of Ve for every data point is calculated using the measured properties reported in the original reference. Only cyclic test results for links with Fy > 200 MPa are included in the figure. A summary of the experiments conducted between 1983 and 2002 on EBF links is also presented by Richards [40] in his dissertation. Most of the links tested by Popov and his colleagues [6, 9, 11, 15, 19] were constructed from A36 steel, while links with higher strength steels such as A709 and A992 were tested later by other researchers such as McDaniel [24], Okazaki and his colleagues [31, 33], Mansour et al. [41], and Dusicka et al. [36]. Shear links constructed from low-yield-strength steels were also tested more recently by Dusicka et al. [36] and Ji et al. [14].
v8uq | As can be seen in Figure 4, the value of <LATEX>\Omega = 1 . 5</LATEX> seems like a reasonable upper-bound for links with <LATEX>\rho > 1 .</LATEX> However, this overstrength value overestimates <LATEX>V _ { m a x }</LATEX> for some intermediate links <LATEX>\left( 1 . 6 < \rho < \right.</LATEX> 2.6) and drastically underestimates <LATEX>V _ { m a x }</LATEX> for very short links <LATEX>\left( \rho < 1 \right) .</LATEX> There are several reasons for these discrepancies, which can be summarized as follows.
x972 | Using a constant value of 1.5 for the overstrength factor neglects the effect of moment-shear (M- V) interaction. However, the study by Engelhardt and Popov [11] proved that this interaction can be important for intermediate links where <LATEX>\Omega</LATEX> values lower than 1.5 were observed (Figure 4).
cwrw | The nominal shear capacity of short links is generally calculated based on the web area, neglecting the contribution of the flanges [3]. However, as mentioned by McDaniel et al. [24], in short links with relatively thick flanges, there is a significant shear force carried by the flanges. Manheim and Popov [8] and Richards [40] have proposed methods for determining the link plastic shear capacity considering the flange effect. Through nonlinear FE analysis of isolated links, Richards [40] demonstrated that the overstrength factor of 1.5 is a reasonable limit even for very short links, provided that the flange effect is included in determining <LATEX>V _ { P } .</LATEX> However, the same conclusion was not reached when previous test results on short and very short built-up links [21, 22, 24, 42] were examined. The calculated overstrengths for these links decreased slightly by including the flange effect in determining <LATEX>V _ { I }</LATEX> however, they were still significantly higher than 1.5 for most cases. Richards [40] attributed this discrepancy to the presence of other factors, beside the flange effect, in experimental studies. In 2007, Okazaki and Engelhardt [31] reported the test results for a total of 37 links constructed from ASTM A992 steel. Although not very short, some of the specimens had very high ratios of flange to web area <LATEX>\left( A _ { f } / A _ { w } \right) .</LATEX> These specimens however did not exhibit overstrengths substantially higher than 1.5. On the contrary, other recent results by <LATEX>\mathrm { J i }</LATEX> et al. [14] indicated that very short links with even lower flange to web area ratios could achieve remarkably high overstrengths, in some cases even over 2.0. A further numerical investigation by Ji et al. [14] revealed that for the tested specimens the shear contribution of flanges could be as much as <LATEX>0 . 2 V _ { P } .</LATEX> However, it was concluded that other factors in addition to the flange effect are influential in causing the observed high overstrengths. Thus, it can be deduced that the numerical and experimental studies are inconclusive about the contribution of flanges to the link overstrength.
4i0e | If axial restraints are present at the link ends, tension can develop during shearing, due to nonlinear geometric effects, especially at high rotation angles [40]. In 2012, this crucial issue was investigated by Della Corte et al. [43] using detailed FE analyses considering both geometric and material nonlinearities. Based on the numerical results it was concluded that the presence of axial restraints can significantly increase the overstrength (up to 15% increase was reported in some models) especially for short links. In a more recent study, Ji et al. [14] also mentioned that restraining axial deformations of very short links by adjacent members can create non-negligible axial forces in these links and affect their behavior significantly.
h2l3 | Another possible cause for the very high overstrengths observed in some tests is the excessive cyclic hardening of steel due to very large plastic strains. This idea was introduced recently by Ji et al. [14] on the basis of an experiment conducted by Kasai et al. [44] on stocky short steel panels in which hardening continued to very large shear angles. Based on this observation, Ji et al. [14] proposed that the very high overstrengths reported for very short links are related to their high rotation capacities. These links experience large plastic rotations (substantially higher than 0.08 rad) and consequently their webs are subjected to excessive shear strains which may lead to excessive cyclic hardening. A refined FE analysis by Ji et al. [14] on very short links revealed that for a link plastic rotation of the order of 0.15 rad the cyclic hardening effect can increase the shear strength by about 70%.
dfzb | The combined effect of the above-mentioned factors should be considered for each link in order to have a reasonable estimate of its overstrength. Nonetheless, reasons behind some of the unusually high overstrengths reported in the literature still remain unclear. For instance, Dusicka et al. [36] observed overstrengths of about 5.0 in their experiments on very short links constructed from low-yield-strength steel (Fy = 100 MPa) without web stiffeners. Such cases require further investigation.
