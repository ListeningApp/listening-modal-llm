You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

06yq | Microdosing with psychedelics to self-medicate for ADHD symptoms in adults: A naturalistic study
dpv6 | ARTICLE INFO
8r5j | ABSTRACT
2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

wzno | ii. The terms of reference for the Special Committee were not explicitly stated in the report submitted.
xagm | iii. The Special Committee was to investigate concerns from some Members of Convocation regarding promotions.
iwn5 | iv. The Board of Convocation communicated to Members of Convocation to send any concerns regarding the subject matter to the Chairman of the Special Committee, Prof. Benjamin Kofi Nyarko.
uooz | v. There is no evidence of any written or verbal complaints from Members of Convocation to the Committee.
pxbq | vi. The report submitted by the Special Committee to the Board of Convocation has no cover letter and there is no evidence that members of the Special Committee signed the report.
jfsr | vii. The findings of the Special Committee include appointments to positions in the University which is outside the main issue the Special Committee was tasked to investigate.
u15r | viii. The report submitted by the Special Committee was four pages but the petition, which was sent to Management was 14 pages.
lq35 | ix. There are differences in the content of the report submitted by the Special Committee to the Board of Convocation and the petition sent to Management of the University by the Board of convocation. For instance, the report has ten recommendations (pages 3 and 4) but the petition has no recommendation.
3g9w | X. The petition contains matters that are not mentioned in the report. For instance, the report has no case studies on Prof. Samuel Kyei and Prof Emmanuel Kwesi Abu but the petition has about four pages (page 3 to 6) on the promotions of the two Professors.
d09o | xi. The Board of Convocation sent copies of the petition to the Pro Vice-Chancellor, the Registrar, Convocation representatives on Council, Former Vice-Chancellors,

cjq2 | 6.0 OPINION OF THE AD-HOC COMMITTEE
5esx | The opinion of the Ad-hoc Committee on the constitution of the Special Committee, the report submitted by the Special Committee and the petition sent to Management of the University based on the findings are as follows:
m5ka | i. The constitution of the Special Committee is unconventional because it should have been done by Convocation. Conventionally, members who serve on Committees of Convocation are nominated and seconded by Members of Convocation.
byu8 | ii. The appointment of the Chairman of Convocation to chair the Special Committee constituted by the Board of Convocation is problematic since the Special Committee was expected to submit its report to him.
76b0 | iii. The composition of the Special Committee is unconventional because all the members of the Special Committee are members of the Board of Convocation.
zxz6 | iv. The report submitted to the Board of Convocation by the Special Committee without explicit terms of reference is unacceptable.
xnth | V. The report submitted by the Special Committee, which was not signed by the members, is an anomaly because it raises questions about the authenticity of the report.
vafm | vi. A procedural error was committed because the report submitted by the Special Committee to the Board of Convocation should have been brought to the attention of Convocation as per Statute 39.11(b).
2zmw | vii. The basis for the petition sent to Management of the University is questionable because it is not premised on the report submitted by the Special Committee.
bf9k | viii. The disparities in the content of the report submitted by the Special Committee and the petition sent to Management of the University by the Board of Convocation is unacceptable.
otkr | ix. The rules of natural justice are breached because Members of Convocation who are cited in the petition were not given a hearing.
ibgs | X. The Ad-hoc Committee is of the view that, it is inappropriate to send copies of the petition meant for Management of the University to former Vice-Chancellors and Pro Vice-Chancellors because they are not part of Management.
colo | The members of the Ad-hoc Committee are grateful for the opportunity to be of service to Convocation.
d6r4 | 9.0 APPRECIATION
9mrz | 1
pk06 | iv. The Board of Convocation should adopt engagement with Management and other stakeholders as a first option in resolving issues rather than petitions. Petitions may, however, be considered as a last option.
7wn9 | iii. Convocation may properly constitute a committee on the floor of Convocation with specific terms of reference to consider any issue(s) it deems necessary.
wcd0 | ii. The Board of Convocation should render an unqualified apology to Prof. Emmanuel Kwesi Abu and Prof. Samuel Kyei as well as Convocation.
caos | i. The Board of Convocation should officially write to withdraw the petition from Management of the University and all who were served with copies.

nv42 | Dear Sir,
xags | PETITION FROM CONVOCATION ON MATTERS OF INTEREST TO MEMBERS OF CONVOCATION AND THE UNIVERSITY
jc47 | On behalf of Convocation, I submit the petition attached hereto on matters that have been brought to the attention of the Board of Convocation from members of Convocation. The issues have the potential to threaten the harmony, morale and integrity of the university system and therefore deserve urgent attention.
ko3c | The following are the major issues in the petition:
xek3 | (a) Wrongful withdrawal of the promotion of a senior member whereas other unmeritorious promotions have been allowed to stay;
bbpr | (b) Undue delay, seeming abuse of process and unfairness in the promotion of some senior members of the University;
5zyf | (c) Breach and selective application of the criteria for appointment and promotion of some senior members;
9own | (d) Unilateral appointment to positions that do not exist and without recourse to the Statutes and practices/convention in the University;
bqfb | (e) Unfair and wrongful interpretation and application of a committee's recommendation to override the Criteria for Appointments and Promotions of Senior Members;
wwdt | (f) Unexplained delays in the promotion of Clinicians at the School of Medical Sciences.
mn1r | Please find the details in the attached petition. It is our expectation that the petition would be given the attention and urgency it deserves to restore calm and defuse the simmering tension in the University.
5vqw | We should be grateful to receive responses from the University Management within fourteen days to inform our next line of action.

7od1 | CONVOCATION OF UNIVERSITY OF CAPE COAST
0bqy | PETITION FROM THE BOARD OF CONVOCATION ON APPOINTMENTS, PROMOTIONS AND RELATED ISSUES
b780 | INTRODUCTION
ccmb | This petition is anchored on the powers conferred on Convocation of the University of Cape Coast by statute. 39.2 (a and b) of the University of Cape Coast Statutes, 2016.
ma93 | It is the outcome of the work of a four-member special committee constituted by the Board of Convocation to investigate and seek clarifications from University Management on individual petitions on promotion and related matters received by the Board.
c6hh | The impetus to form the Committee came from a groundswell of complaints regarding promotions, appointments and interpretation of the University's policies. The following are some of the complaints:
y7ea | a) Promotion of some faculty members delays unduly. The undue delays have created serious tension in the University and disaffection among many colleagues.
nav4 | b) Faculty members of the School of Medical Sciences of the College of Health and Allied Sciences seem to be suffering from promotion-related issues. Most of them, especially Clinicians, are demotivated to work beyond their core mandate. They are not putting in their maximum effort to continue to enhance teaching and especially research, and also perform their affiliate duties at the teaching hospitals as it used to be.
gem8 | c) Promotion of scholars who have contributed to the University's THE ranking and grooming of the Medical School to be number one in Ghana are, on the contrary, treated with disdain, particularly with regard to consideration of their promotion documents.
e8nr | d) The established norm on appointment based on seniority and experience has not been adhered to recently.
k78w | e) The criteria for appointments and promotions has been observed to be applied selectively.
g9du | f) Misinterpretation of Statutes and policies by Management and Boards has become a commonplace in the University.
f682 | g) There are communication lapses in promotion/appointment decisions
li1k | APPROACH USED BY THE COMMITTEE
pbea | The Special Committee consulted some key stakeholders in the University, including some members of Convocation and also relied on documents received from colleagues. Some of the stakeholders consulted included the Provost of the College of Health and Allied Sciences as well as the Dean, Vice-Dean and Faculty Officer of the School of Medical Sciences.
ccpt | Documents consulted by the Committee included the University of Cape Coast Statutes (the current Statutes and its predecessors, i.e. 2012, 2003); Report of the Prof. Yankson's Committee on Grievances of UTAG UCC and other documents.
0fpw | ISSUES RAISED DURING THE INTERACTIONS
dqn8 | It was admitted that some individuals and Departments are the cause of delay in processing of promotion documents. The Faculty Members of the School of Medical Sciences, however, raised the following concerns regarding delays in processing of their promotion documents:
cop0 | 1. The time it takes to receive updates on assessment outcomes is too long; in some instances it has taken three to five years.
lhkq | 2. There are ambiguities in communication to applicants regarding assessment results. An example of such communication is; "Two reports received to submit two new assessors", even when the names of assessors have been re-submitted countless times.
82ju | 3. There are unexplained delays and lack of clarity on some decisions taken on the promotion of some colleagues at the Appointments and Promotions Board.
y2qo | 4. The requirement for acquisition of terminal degrees before some colleagues are considered for promotion to a higher rank is unfair and a demotivation to Clinicians in the School, particularly those with Fellowship qualifications who have contributed immensely to the University's achievements.
