        "content": "gsah | Three hundred thirty-five. After validating our approach, we next analyzed the effect of AD on neuroproteasome\nt5nl | localization, measured by the relative quantity of twenty S proteasome subunits in our quantitative\nl5s6 | mass spectrometry dataset. First, in comparing AD samples to cognitively normal controls, we\nyjnd | find a striking reduction in nearly every twenty S proteasome subunit in the plasma membrane\nc7v3 | fraction from BA seven tissue. We next sought to determine whether ApoE\niute | genotype influenced neuroproteasome localization in human tissue. Given the significant effect\n377g | of AD on neuroproteasome localization, we constrained the analysis only to the effect of ApoE \n342 genotype on neuroproteasome localization by comparing the ApoE four/four AD cohort against the\nv79r | ApoE three/three AD cohort. We observe a clear trend of reduced twenty S proteasome subunits in the\n555y | membrane fraction in the ApoE four genotype compared to ApoE three genotype in the BA seven vulnerable \n345 brain region.\n7yeh | To validate our proteomics data, we monitored surface localization of neuroproteasomes by\nhfsl | immunoblot analysis. We controlled for sample loading by normalizing against Kv one point two, a protein\nkmer | whose expression has been reproducibly demonstrated as unchanged in the AD brain.\n5s1o | While this strategy is required for loading controls by immunoblot, these loading controls line up\n9mly | with the normalization strategy for mass spectrometry based on the total amount of TMT signal\nznoh | from each sample. First, we validate our proteomics data and find a twofold reduction of\nwjsb | neuroproteasome surface expression in AD patients compared to controls in the BA seven region.\nr5ov | Moreover, we find a statistically significant reduction in neuroproteasome localization from ApoE four/four tissue compared to ApoE three/three unaffected tissue. In contrast, we do not observe \n356 changes in total expression of the twenty S proteasome from the cytosolic fraction, suggesting that the\ngajg | \n3j8z | ApoE-isoform dependent changes we observe are specific to neuroproteasome localization and\n4dol | not a change in cytosolic proteasome levels. We find changes in Lrp one concordant with that\nh72f | observed with neuroproteasomes. However, given the strong effect of AD pathology\nv3n3 | on the global proteome (as well as on neuroproteasome localization), we next used the BA four\nt03d | tissue to understand how ApoE isoforms could influence neuroproteasome localization with mild\n2q4e | AD pathology.\nktxm | In BA four tissue, unlike BA seven, we find comparable surface localization of neuroproteasomes\ny7mc | between patients with and without AD. However, once stratified by ApoE genotype, we find that ApoE four/four patients have a nearly fifty percent reduction in surface localization of\nnafx | \nje6f | neuroproteasome compared with ApoE three/three patients. Both of these conclusions are\nms51 | supported by analysis of proteasome subunits from unbiased proteomics datasets from BA four\nv9sh | tissue. Consistent with these observations, using LLVY degradation experiments to\nrnor | measure the catalytic activity of the proteasome, we found a significant reduction in\n3tz7 | neuroproteasome activity in AD samples compared to unaffected controls and no change in\ne02w | cytosolic proteasome activity. This demonstrates that ApoE four can influence\n0ldf | neuroproteasome localization in areas with mild AD pathology. Taken together, we make two\n4rgq | conclusions based on these data: one, that neuroproteasome localization is reduced in brain regions\nsrag | \nvm1l | which have increased susceptibility to AD pathology and two, that ApoE four reduces\n2ulk | neuroproteasome localization compared to ApoE three.\noc27 | Quantitative proteomics reveals that selective inhibition of neuroproteasomes induces \n379 accumulation of sarkosyl-insoluble Tau.\nxv2d | \n0yfu | What is the consequence of ApoE four-dependent reduction in neuroproteasome function, or more broadly, any reduction in neuroproteasome function? The most straightforward way to address this question is to leverage neuroproteasome-specific inhibitors. We previously accomplished \n2icd | \nln4r | neuroproteasome-specific inhibition using Biotin-Epoxomicin: an analog of the covalent and\n1iz9 | highly selective proteasome inhibitor Epoxomicin with an N-terminal Biotin moiety. This small modification renders Biotin-Epoxomicin cell-impermeable for up to an hour and does not change\no5cc | \nb430 | the selectivity or potency of Epoxomicin. While time-limited, this approach found\n5k15 | that generally, neuroproteasome substrates are co- or peri-translationally degraded and that flux \n389 through the neuroproteasome depends on neuronal activity. However, the previous version\nv24x | of Biotin-Epoxomicin was not a usable tool to assess broad physiological functions of\n26hh | neuroproteasomes because the timescale was far too short and could not be used in vivo.\nw533 | \nfj70 | Based on principles of drug design, we considered that introducing a longer PEG linker between \n394 the N-terminus of Epoxomicin and biotin would decrease the permeability of biotin-epoxomicin and allow us to reveal long-term consequences of neuroproteasome inhibition. We chose\n04yk | \n5l8x | Epoxomicin because it leverages the unique chemistry of the catalytic threonines of the\nh425 | proteasome - the alpha-amino group of the threonine opens the epoxide of Epoxomicin which forms \n398 the final covalent morpholino adduct. The catalytic residues of Serine and Cysteine proteases do\nxfce | not have alpha-amino groups, which is the principle that renders Epoxomicin completely specific\ntrvq | both against its target and relative to other proteasome inhibitors. These advantages explain why\nztx4 | dozens of analogs of Epoxomicin have been made to the N-terminus without altering the\nd4i8 | specificity of the drug against the proteasome: no off-target effects of Epoxomicin or its analogs\nqp9u | have been found in the two decades since its discovery. We synthesized click-\nb6jo | able analogs of Epoxomicin (Azide-Epoxomicin) that would allow us to append a broad range of \n405 linkers. We then conjugated Biotin-PEG twenty-four-Alkyne to Epoxomicin, producing Biotin-\n406 PEG twenty-four-Epoxomicin, or iBEp. We observe efficient conjugation by HPLC analysis.\nf9x6 | All molecules were HPLC-purified as single peaks and confirmed by LC/MS \n408 analysis.\nw558 | \n18y0 | We next tested the potency and selectivity of iBEp relative to Epoxomicin. Epoxomicin\n779a | covalently and irreversibly binds the catalytic beta subunits of the proteasome - therefore, the biotin\nv8xg | moiety on iBEp serves as a tracer to detect whether proteasomes are inhibited by monitoring \n413 biotin signal on an SDS-PAGE gel. We detect covalent biotinylation of only three\nfmso | proteins from iBEp-treated neurons, corresponding to the three catalytic subunits of the\nndxn | proteasome. Therefore, we demonstrate that the iBEp linker does not modify the high \n416 specificity of iBEp compared to Epoxomicin alone. This is supported by previous data that\nsb9k | modification of the non-reactive end of Epoxomicin has been shown not to change the selectivity",
