        "content": "xrnt | Positive predictive values and negative predictive values of the four tooth-level endpoints ranged between twelve point eight percent (probing pocket depth less than six millimeters) and fifteen point one percent ('stable periodontitis') and\nc8ra | between twenty-nine point three percent ('probing pocket depth less than six millimeters') and eighty-eight point two percent ('stable periodontitis'), respectively. The total number of teeth lost per patient per year of supportive periodontal care was zero point zero eight (all studies: average of nine point eight eight supportive periodontal care years) and zero point zero six (conventional anti-plaque therapy studies: average of twelve point seven five supportive periodontal care years). Heterogeneity in the tooth-level studies and analyses varied from unimportant to considerably higher compared to the subject-level findings but did not affect the direction of effects (i.e., lack of periodontal stability led to tooth loss) and only affected the precision with which the summary effect was calculated.\np1l0 | Three point two. Risk of bias assessment\n1i8b | Supplemental Material S ten reports the risk of bias assessments for randomized controlled trials, cohort and cross-sectional studies. Risk of bias for cohort studies ranged\n5sfj | from five to six stars, with the item 'comparability' always scored as zero. Randomized controlled trials showed low risk of bias or some concerns due to missing data in follow-up studies.\nvk4h | Four. Discussion\nnsm3 | This systematic review confirms that very few periodontitis cases achieve the proposed endpoints following steps one, two, and three of periodontal therapy. In studies following conventional anti-plaque therapy, nine point four three percent of subjects achieved 'stable periodontitis' and twenty-seven point six percent achieved the desirable 'endpoints of therapy'. Our data showed that fifty-four point two percent of subjects achieved 'controlled periodontitis', coinciding with a multi-centre study where approximately fifty percent of the population was within the limits of 'controlled periodontitis'. The prevalence\njdfw | of achieving and sustaining these endpoints is likely to be reduced further with increased time of supportive periodontal care and reduced operator experience. Therefore, the reality of successfully achieving or sustaining these endpoints in general dental practice is likely to be limited further.\nuc9r | An average of eleven point three six teeth per patient were considered 'diseased' after anti-plaque therapy. This result needs to be interpreted in light of the proven efficacy of steps one and two of periodontal therapy, which show an overall proportion of seventy-four percent of 'pocket closure' (probing pocket depth less than or equal to four millimeters and an absence of bleeding on probing), bearing in mind that the efficiency of non-surgical periodontal therapy is reduced in areas of difficult access, such as furcations or deep pockets.\nl0ap | Analyzing long-term outcomes showed that twenty-nine point zero five percent of 'unstable' subjects, as per World Workshop on the Classification of Periodontal and Peri-Implant Diseases and Conditions two thousand seventeen and following conventional anti-plaque therapy, experienced tooth loss during a mean observation period of twelve point seven five years. Yet, only eight point four nine percent of teeth responsible for an 'unstable' diagnosis were extracted. The lack of a statistically significant association of tooth loss at the subject level (relative risk equals one point three six; P equals zero point two zero seven two) within this data supports that an 'unstable' periodontitis subject does not increase the risk for periodontitis-related tooth loss among subjects strongly compliant with supportive periodontal care. Consideration of this endpoint may be important when planning treatment at the tooth level, for example, utilizing a 'stable' abutment tooth where our data highlight a relative risk equals ten point two seven for tooth loss if the tooth is 'unstable'.\nx815 | Although approximately one third (thirty-four point three four percent) of the subjects not meeting the 'endpoints of therapy' lost teeth during supportive periodontal care after conventional anti-plaque therapy, similarly, statistical significance was reached only at the tooth level (relative risk equals fourteen point eight six; P equals zero point zero one five one). This may be due to bleeding on probing, a variable of these composite endpoints, which has been found to be a useful predictor of periodontal progression and subsequent tooth loss only at the tooth level. Yet, the effect of smoking on masking the predictive ability of bleeding on probing cannot be excluded. Less than twenty percent of subjects within this dataset were current smokers.\nepbj | 'Controlled periodontitis' was the most frequently achieved endpoint (fifty-two point four two percent) among studies following conventional anti-plaque therapy. At the subject level, it has a relative risk of two point seven eight (P equals zero point zero zero six eight) of tooth loss during supportive periodontal care when not achieved, which is similar to the findings reported elsewhere. Unlike other subject-level endpoints, this endpoint considers multiple residual sites, which is relevant, as subject- and tooth-level factors can affect the treatment response, particularly in relation to specific tooth types. All endpoints showed low positive predictive values and high negative predictive values at the subject level, supporting existing literature.\nnmn2 | The number of teeth lost per subject per year of supportive periodontal care varied between zero point zero six and zero point zero eight, corroborating that a small number of teeth are lost in a small proportion of the population. Optimal adherence to long-term supportive periodontal care has been shown to\ng3tm | effectively reduce the progression of periodontitis and tooth loss, particularly in private practice and university-based hospitals. This is supported by our data at the subject and tooth level, respectively, where the highest incidence of tooth loss was reported in studies where less than ten percent of subjects adhered to the recommended supportive periodontal care regime and where supportive periodontal care regimes were executed by the subjects' general dental practices. With maxillary molar teeth being the most frequently lost teeth within supportive periodontal care, this raises the question whether endpoints should be individualized to the tooth type, as their complex anatomy may affect 'pocket closure'.",
