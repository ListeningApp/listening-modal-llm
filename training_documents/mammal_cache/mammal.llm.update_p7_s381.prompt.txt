You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

(D) Forest plots of the top modules associated with mortality risk in the Framingham Heart Study Offspring Cohort (FHS), and Women's Health Initiative (WHI) study totaling 4651 individuals (1095, 24% death). n denotes the number of deaths per total number of individuals in each study. We report the meta-analysis P value in the title of the forest plot. (E) Module that correlates significantly <LATEX>\left( P < 1 \times 1 0 ^ { - 3 0 0 } \right)</LATEX> with relative age (defined as ratio of age/maximum life span) across mammalian species using a multivariate regression model. Covariates were tissue, sex, and species differences. Each dot corresponds to a eutherian tissue sample <LATEX>\left( n = 1 4 , 5 4 2 \right) .</LATEX> Dots are colored by taxonomic order as in Fig. 1. (F) Volcano plot of the rmCorr of all purple module genes in GTEx data (for additional analysis, see fig. S11).
s0fl | The multivariate model analysis included sex, tissue type, and relative age as covariates to reveal additional modules that relate to life span in different tissues. The regression analysis found two modules with opposing correlations with maximum life span: the green module (life span <LATEX>r = 0 . 4 2 ,</LATEX> average weight <LATEX>r = 0 . 3 8 ,</LATEX> <LATEX>P <</LATEX> <LATEX>\left. 1 0 ^ { - 3 0 0 } \right)</LATEX> and the greenyellow module (life span <LATEX>r = - \quad 0 . 4 4 ,</LATEX> average weight <LATEX>r = - \quad 0 . 3 5 ,</LATEX> <LATEX>P < 1 0 ^ { - 3 0 0 }</LATEX> fig. S13J). The CpGs of the Lifespan Weight Rodentia (greenyellow) are located near genes that play a role in development <LATEX>\left( P = 5 \times 1 0 ^ { - 1 3 } \right.</LATEX> table S4) and in RNA metabolism
43ia | <LATEX>\left( P = 6 \times 1 0 ^ { - 1 2 } \right.</LATEX> Age-related consensus module in mammals
3g2y | The purple module (denoted subsequently as RelativeAge+ module) exhibited the strongest positive correlation with relative age (relative age <LATEX>r = 0 . 3 5 ,</LATEX> <LATEX>P < 1 0 ^ { - 3 0 0 }</LATEX> Fig. 3E and fig. S13).
gc7v | To remove the confounding effects of spe- cies and/or tissue type, we also constructed seven consensus networks (denoted cNet3, ... , cNet9; for a description, see the supplemen- tary materials). The RelativeAge+ module was preserved in three different consensus networks (cNet3, cNet4, and cNet6; Fig. 2A), suggesting conservation in different species and tissues (scatter plot in fig. S11H). The purple Relative- Age+ module is positively enriched for CpGs in regulatory regions (e.g., promoters and 5' un- translated regions) and depleted in intron re- gions (fig. S15). Functional enrichment of this module highlighted embryonic stem cell reg- ulation, axonal fasciculation, angiogenesis, and diabetes-related pathways (table S3). The CpGs in this module are adjacent to Polycomb re- pressor complex 2 (PRC2, EED) targets, which are marked by H3K27me3 (table S3).
wqfv | Ingenuity pathway analysis implicated POU5F1 (alias OCT4), SHH, ASCL1, SOX2, and NEUROG2 proteins as putative upstream regulators of the RelativeAge+ module. We used Genotype- Tissue Expression project (GTEx) data to deter- mine whether the mRNA levels of any of these upstream regulators are altered with age in sev- eral human tissues. <LATEX>O C T 4</LATEX> [repeated-measures correlation <LATEX>\left( r m C o r r \right) = 0 . 0 7 ,</LATEX> <LATEX>P = 2 \times 1 0 ^ { - 1 } ,</LATEX> which is among the four known Yamanaka factors for cellular dedifferentiation, showed a positive increase with age in several, but not all, human tissues (fig. S11F). Nine other genes (e.g., HOXD10, <LATEX>r m C o r r = 0 . 1 6 ,</LATEX> <LATEX>P = 4 \times 1 0 ^ { - 5 0 }</LATEX> SRXN1, rmCorr = - 0.14, <LATEX>P = 4 \times 1 0 ^ { - 5 2 }</LATEX> from the RelativeAge+ module also had a nominally sig- nificant rmCorr <LATEX>\left( P < 0 . 0 0 5 \right)</LATEX> in GTEx data (Fig. 3F and fig. S11G), although opposite aging pat- terns could be found in select tissues. These observations highlight the relevance of genes in the RelativeAge+ module to stem cell bio- logy and aging in human tissues.
j30a | Interventional studies in mice
7bdk | We related our methylation modules to in- terventions that are known to modulate the
fim0 | life span of mice (Fig. 4, A to C). This in- cluded growth hormone receptor knockout (i.e., dwarf mice) (37) and caloric restriction (38), which extended life, and a high-fat diet, which elicited the opposite effect <LATEX>\left( 1 2 \right) . S i x \quad m o d -</LATEX> ules, including the purple module (RelativeAge+) showed a significant decrease <LATEX>\left( P < 0 . 0 5 \right)</LATEX> of the module eigengene in dwarf mice and after caloric restriction and, conversely, a modest increase after a high-fat diet. Although the magenta, black, midnightblue, tan, and green- yellow modules have connections to the max- imum life span in mammals, they did not present a clear relationship with interven- tions that modify murine life span (growth hormone receptor knockout, caloric restric- tion, and high-fat diet). This suggests a mu- tual exclusivity between the modules related to the maximum mammalian life span and those affected by interventions modulating the murine life span.
