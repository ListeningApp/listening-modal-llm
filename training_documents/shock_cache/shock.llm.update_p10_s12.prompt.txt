You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

tb74 | The role of invasive hemodynamic assessment with a pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) is not clearly defined in CS. Although several randomized trials have assessed the use of the PAC in shock, it is important to note that these studies did not explicitly include patients with CS, nor did they assess the use of PAC-derived data to guide a treatment algorithm relating to the use of vasoactive agents or MCS.69 Nonetheless, the use of invasively derived measures of filling pressures and cardiac per- formance are of increasing clinical interest in the setting of CS. From a left ventricular perspective, in AMI-CS the cardiac power output (defined as [(MAP-right atrial pressure) x CO]/451) is a well-defined prognostic marker for short-term outcomes, including mortality.22,70,71 Furthermore, in a population with AMI-CS, there is evi- dence suggesting that the cardiac power output can be used to assess the adequacy of hemodynamic support measures, with a cardiac power output >0.8 Watts as- sociated with improved outcomes.69,70,72 With respect to the right ventricle, there are several parameters includ- ing pulmonary artery pulsatility index (defined as pul- monary artery pulse pressure/right atrial pressure), right atrial pressure, and right ventricle stroke work index (de- fined as stroke volume index x [mean pulmonary artery pressures-mean right atrial pressure]), which have been shown to be predictive of in-hospital mortality in AMI-CS and decompensated heart failure.73,74 In view of the pau- city of randomized data supporting the use of PAC in CS, there is a considerable need for additional evidence to guide the use of PAC in this setting. At present, soci- etal guidelines have insufficient evidence to recommend the routine use of PAC in this setting; however, upcom- ing trials including the ongoing PACCS trial (Pulmonary Artery Catheter in Cardiogenic Shock, NCT05485376) will greatly assist with addressing this knowledge gap.
8l69 | Biochemical Assessment of Perfusion
1jyv | Regular biochemical assessment can provide a "win- dow" into the current perfusion status of the patient, in addition to classical clinical signs that may include mentation, skin quality, and urine output. In addition to direct measures of end-organ function and injury, for example dynamic changes in serum creatinine when assessing for renal injury, serum lactate pro- vides an important global measure of tissue perfusion.
olce | Absolute lactate levels have been shown to be a pow- erful prognostic biomarker in multiple shock states.66 However, temporal changes in lactate levels may be more meaningful, owing to the highly dynamic na- ture of these measurements. In a cohort of the IABP- SHOCK II (Intraaortic Balloon Pump in Cardiogenic Shock II) study, absolute lactate level and clearance at 8 hours was an independent predictor of mortality.75,76 Furthermore, in the CAPITAL DOREMI study, the time taken for lactate normalization was the most powerful predictor of 30-day mortality.56 Serial measurements of biomarkers, in addition to routine clinical examination, can therefore provide clinicians with ongoing feedback about the effectiveness of the initial pharmacologic

vcu3 | Addressing a Lack of Randomized Data to Guide the Appropriate First-Line Therapy in CS
hjzj | The challenges of performing high-quality randomized controlled trials in patients with CS have been well described.77 Furthermore, the external validity and
j79f | generalizability of the available trial data are a consid- erable issue as the majority of studies have exclusively recruited patients once they have undergone their initial prehospital and invasive cardiology management and are receiving supportive care within ICU at the time of randomization. Nonetheless, 2 seminal ICU trials are currently ongoing. First, the CAPITAL DOREMI-II trial (NCT05267886) is recruiting patients with CS and as- signing them to receive either milrinone, dobutamine, or placebo. This study will provide a crucial insight into the role of inodilators in the initial management of CS. Second, LevoHeartShock (NCT04020263) is a French prospective, double-blind, multicenter randomized controlled trialof patients with CS already treated with noradrenaline or dobutamine and assigned to receive the addition of either levosimendan or placebo. This study will help inform clinicians about the utility of ino- dilator therapy, compared with traditional catechola- mine agents.
6tbv | Although these ICU-based trials are likely to be in- structive, given the high rates of prehospital treated CS, randomizing patients at first medical contact with emer- gency medical services may enhance the applicability of any findings to a variety of clinical settings.14,78 As cate- cholamines are frequently used as a first-line therapy in CS, a trial assessing the efficacy and safety of this drug class should be considered as an area of priority. Our group is currently seeking to address this clinical ques- tion through the PANDA trial (Paramedic Randomized Trial of Noradrenaline Versus Adrenaline in the Initial Management of Patients with Cardiogenic Shock, ACTRN12621000805875). This study will randomize pa- tients with CS in the prehospital setting to receive either epinephrine or norepinephrine and will be sufficiently powered to detect a difference in 28-day mortality and therefore guide first-line catecholamine therapy.
xb13 | Comparing Mechanical Circulatory Support With Medical Therapy, an Urgent Need for Randomized Data
cxqi | MCS use in CS has increased dramatically over the past 15years, despite the cost, associated risk of major complications, and limited evidence to sup- port its use.79 The rationale for the use of these de- vices is predicated on their ability to restore systemic perfusion, reduce cardiac filling pressures, limit myo- cardial oxygen consumption, and reduce vasoactive agent requirements. The Impella (Abiomed, Danvers) catheter-based micro-axial flow pump and venoarte- rial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation have been readily adopted to provide hemodynamic support and incorporated into a range of CS treatment algo- rithms.9,72,79 This practice has occurred despite very limited randomized data supporting the safety and ef- ficacy of these treatments, in addition to determining
