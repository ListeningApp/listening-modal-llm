        "content": "7szx | The key variables in deciding which is most likely are captured in the neighboring diagram, where the vertical axis deals with motivation considerations (is it about performance improvement, better alignment or dealing with disruption?) and the horizontal axis deals with readiness for change. Optimizers will be focusing mainly on performance improvement and be ready for only limited change. Transformers will have greater strategic ambition and be more focused on disruption.\nhx9e | The future of higher education in a disruptive world\nywn2 | Whether transformers or optimizers, the four building blocks are the same:\na63r | One. Strategy\ndqvj | In relation to strategy, much depends on a view of the future, in one's own context. Building on earlier comments in this report, a plausible view of the future may have the following features:\nr17u | Fueled by the dislocation of workers due to automation and new ways of working, demand will be high for upskilling, reskilling and retraining. Some estimate that almost all growth in formal hours of learning within static populations will be with adult learners who are older than the typical graduate.\n3c47 | Some universities may move towards a subscription model, whereby for a regular payment, people will have access to a range of programs, thus potentially retaining the loyalty of their students across their lifespan.\ng345 | Competing at scale\nsvhz | One of the extraordinary developments in today's economy has been the rise of the platform business. Seven of the ten largest organizations in the world can be described in this way. The institution that can provide on-demand learning, at scale and personalized to the needs and wishes of the student, is the organization which can build resilience into its future.\n5u67 | We may now see new forms of business model which draw on the entertainment industry, whereby some universities relay and quality assure content and assessment that is actually provided by others, as well as offering their own programs.\ndvms | Lifestyle integration\nqrd3 | Although not necessarily reducing in absolute numbers, the cohort of young people seeking the immersive, rite-of-passage, full-time, on-campus, bachelor education will reduce as a proportion of the whole student body. More students will be working part-time, undertaking family responsibilities and wanting to integrate learning into their lives rather than interrupt their lives for an immersive experience.\nrxrg | The future of higher education in a disruptive world\ntf43 | Two. Capabilities\nfcco | In twenty eighteen, KPMG International commissioned Forrester Consulting to conduct a study on customer-centric strategy decisions across seventeen industries. This research identified that organizations that make a moderate or significant investment in all eight of the following capabilities are two point one times as likely to deliver customer experiences that exceed expectations, successfully execute on one or more customer-centric objectives, and achieve return on investment on one or more metrics.\n8uji | Eight critical capabilities of connected enterprises\ndf3e | One. Insight-driven strategies and actions: The ability to harness data, advanced analytics and actionable insights with a real-time understanding of the customer and the business to shape integrated business decisions.\n53eu | Two. Innovative products and services: The ability to develop compelling customer value propositions on price, products and services to engage the most-attractive customers and drive profitable growth.\na5u1 | Three. Experience centricity by design:\nry7u | The ability to design seamless, intentional experiences for customers, employees and partners to support customer value propositions and deliver business objectives.\n5mda | Four. Seamless interactions and commerce: The ability to interact and transact with customers and prospects across marketing, sales and services, and achieve measurable results.\ni4li | KPMG International also commissioned Forrester Consulting to survey universities in six jurisdictions for their self-reported investment in these capabilities and, because student centricity seems to be the key to thriving and surviving, we sought a particular focus on investment in customer-centric and related strategies.\nr8sm | An online survey was completed in early twenty twenty, before the pandemic broke, by four hundred ten institutional leaders in higher education in the US, Canada, the UK, Germany, Australia and India. Participants were at departmental chair level or above, and fourteen percent were either C-level executives or presidents (and the equivalent).\ncuin | The future of higher education in a disruptive world\nn1i7 | Responsive operations and supply chain: The ability to operate the business with efficiency and agility to fulfill the customer promise in a consistent and profitable way.\n0r5m | Six. Aligned and empowered workforce: The ability to build a customer-centric organization and culture that inspires people to deliver on the customer promise and drive up business performance.\nne2o | Seven. Digitally enabled technology architecture:\nsqxn | The ability to create intelligent and agile services, technologies and platforms, enabling the customer agenda with solutions that are secure, scalable and cost-effective.\n6pmo | Eight. Integrated partner and alliance ecosystem: The ability to engage, integrate and manage third parties to increase speed-to-market, reduce costs, mitigate risk and close capability gaps to deliver on the customer promise.\n195r | A reasonable mix of institutional types and sizes participated, with forty-nine percent saying they were predominantly face-to-face, twenty-two percent online and twenty-nine percent blended. About half (forty-nine percent) were teaching and research, thirty-five percent were teaching only and fifteen percent were research intensive. Slightly more institutions were private (fifty-four percent) than public (forty-six percent), but sixty-three percent were non-profit.\nkqmi | Eight out of ten reported that they were putting customer centricity front and center. Twenty-five percent of surveyed higher education decision makers counted their customer-centric strategy among their institutions' top priorities and fifty-one percent said they were making it a high priority. While institutions across surveyed jurisdictions were placing a similar priority on developing their customer-centric strategies, institutions in India (eighty-four percent) were more likely than institutions in other places to be placing a high or top priority on this effort, while those from Australia (sixty-eight percent) were least likely to be placing this level of priority.\ng8rd | Traditional organizational drivers are taking a back seat to more student-focused objectives. Customer-centric strategies are driven largely by objectives centering around the student, rather than by more traditional institutional drivers, such as an increase in grant or donation funding and cost cutting. Improving the student experience (forty-two percent), improving student trust in the organization (thirty-six percent), and gaining in-depth student insights (thirty-five percent) topped the list. These top drivers were largely consistent across all measured jurisdictions.\nnns9 | The majority of institutions considered their customer-centric capabilities average at best. Over half of higher-education institutions rated their customer-centric capabilities as less mature (fourteen percent) or about average (forty-two percent), compared with similar higher-education institutions. Institutions in India (fifty percent) were somewhat more likely to rate their capabilities as more mature compared with their counterparts in Canada (forty-four percent), the US (forty-three percent), the UK (forty-two percent), Australia (thirty-six percent), and Germany (thirty-two percent).\n9uwy | Few are going above and beyond in delivering on the student experience. Just four out of ten institutions reported that the experience they provide students consistently (nine percent) or even occasionally (twenty-eight percent) exceeded student expectations. Institutions in the UK, Germany and Australia lagged behind the other jurisdictions in the study, with just twenty-nine, twenty-eight and twenty-four percent, respectively, indicating that student experience exceeded expectations.\nsrly | Nearly eight out of ten higher education institutions are making customer centricity a top or high priority\ndl6i | The future of higher education in a disruptive world\n89ub | Many institutions have some distance to go in matching leading customer experience practices in other sectors.\ndhle | The survey revealed that security, technology and people or process hurdles stand between institutions and the successful execution of customer-centric strategies. While higher-education institutions face numerous obstacles to success, their lack of qualified staff was listed as the number one barrier to the successful execution of customer-centric strategies, cited by thirty-three percent of respondents.\n2nib | Barrier number two, cited by twenty-nine percent of institutions, was students who \"arrive lacking key academic and or personal skills.\" It is, to put it mildly, unorthodox for a provider which actually selects its own customers then to say that some of them are the problem in executing a customer-centric strategy.",
