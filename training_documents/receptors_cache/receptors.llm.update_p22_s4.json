Indeed, the functional roles of GPCRs in inflammation, cell trafficking, and the\n94h3 | diversity of ligands they bind, establish GPCRs as major regulators of the tumor-immune microenvironment.\n9jx1 | Chemokine receptors were initially discovered in the context of immune cell migration, where expression of chemokines in different tissues and/or in response to infection and tissue injury act to direct and recruit a diverse range of innate and adaptive immune cells. This process can be hijacked by cancer cells that express chemokines such as CCL seventeen, CCL twenty-two and others, to attract immunosuppressive immune cells including T-regulatory cells (Tregs), which specifically express the respective receptor CCR four, to promote a tumor permissive environment and dampen immune recognition. This can create a potent feed-forward control system where immune suppressive cells, such as myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), which are recruited by a host of chemokines such as CXCL eight, CXCL one, and CCL two, can further inhibit T cell activation and migration to the tumor. Together, these processes can polarize macrophages, to the M two, or tumor associated macrophage (TAM) phenotype, further dampening the tumor- immune microenvironment.\nc3lz | In tandem, the infiltration of cytotoxic immune cells providing an anti-tumor response is also dependent on a repertoire of chemokines and chemokine receptors. The infiltration of CD eight positive T cells and natural killer (NK) cells has been shown to have high prognostic value and it is mainly guided by CXCR three, which binds the CXCL nine and CXCL ten ligands in the tumor microenvironment. Additionally, conventional dendritic cells (cDCs), namely, Batf three positive cDC ones, have been shown to be the main DC subtype responsible for taking up dead tumor cells and cross-prime T cells, and their function largely depends on trafficking to the tumor by XCR one. The exclusivity of XCR one expression on cDC ones may make it an ideal target for boosting the dendritic cell antigen presentation response.\n8bwk | Many by-products of tumor cell metabolism are ligands that bind GPCRs, suggesting that they may also dictate the success of cancer immunotherapies. More specifically, studies have shown that lipid compounds, nucleosides (adenosine), and prostaglandins, some of the main products of ATP breakdown and inflammation, bind GPCRs to suppress cytotoxic function of immune cells. As our understanding of normal and aberrant GPCR signalling deepens, assessing levels of bioactive GPCR ligands, in addition to chemokine and chemokine receptor expression could also help guide clinical strategies. For example, increased CXCL nine, CXCL ten and CXCL eleven are associated with improved survival, and are part of an interferon-induced gene expression\nez9s | profile that has been used as a clinical-grade assay to predict favourable responses to PD one blockade.\nmqot | Tumor-immune interactions are increasingly becoming the target of therapeutic agents intended to break the cross-talk that enables cancer progression. Currently, there are several therapeutics targeting chemokine receptors such CXCR four, CCR two and CCR four, and the adenosine-binding A two A R receptor (ADORA two A) being explored for the treatment of cancer. For example, mogamulizumab, an FDA-approved monoclonal antibody targeting CCR four is being used for the treatment of lymphomas as monotherapy and is being tested in combination with other treatments. Targeting GPCRs for their immunomodulatory functions in cancer present an exciting and promising field that has the potential to revolutionize how cancer is treated in the future.\noc99 | GPCRs and Tumor Promoting Inflammation\ngipz | Chronic inflammation has been consistently linked to cancer. In particular, prostaglandins (PG) and specifically prostaglandin E two (PGE two) are key mediators of inflammation, generated by cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes from arachidonic acid. Binding of PGE two to their cognate GPCRs, EP one through four (PTGER one through four), induces inflammatory responses tightly linking GPCR-driven signalling to inflammation that is well established to contribute to tumor development and progression. COX two mediated production of PGs, in particular PGE two has been found to promote tumorigenesis in a broad range of cancer types, with a prominent role in gastrointestinal cancers. In the context of colorectal cancer, increased expression of PGE two has been found to drive polyp formation, proliferation and cell motility. This has been suggested in part, to be due to PGE two-driven activation of beta-catenin, which may synergize with APC inactivation commonly found in colon cancer. COX two and PGE two driven expression of pro-angiogenic chemokines can further enhance the tumor growth and progression. Chronic inflammation, via COX two overexpression, can also lead to immune suppression and promote tumor growth.\nb4wj | Overexpression of COX two itself has been shown to be sufficient to induce tumorigenesis and invasiveness in various models. Conversely, there is strong epidemiological data linking decreased mortality for colorectal carcinoma patients taking NSAIDs, which are inhibitors of both COX one and COX two. Aligned with this, COX inhibitors are being explored in multiple human clinical trials for cancer prevention and as an adjuvant therapy, and have shown promising results in colorectal cancer and other cancer types.\n5xlt | GPCRs and Cancer Metastasis\n9bz4 | Migration and metastasis of cancer cells are highly coordinated processes that are tightly regulated by numerous signalling and transcriptional events. Signalling through G protein- coupled chemokine receptors is central to many of these processes and consequently, has been widely implicated in driving several aspects of cancer metastasis. Upon binding of their chemokine ligands, chemokine receptors (CXCRs) can stimulate interaction, migration and trafficking of both immune and cancer cells within and between tissues in the body. Both chemokines and bioactive lipids can also induce the secretion of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) by tumor and immune cells to facilitate tumor cell extravasation.\n```",
