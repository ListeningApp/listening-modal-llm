        "content": "j79f | Various mycobacterial species infections are common in SLE and may disseminate leading to serious and lethal disease. The prevalence of Mycobacteria tuberculosis ranges from five percent to thirty percent depending on the specific geographic region which is higher in SLE subjects than the general population. Clinical presentations of mycobacteria may mimic lupus clinical syndrome, with features that involve severe extrapulmonary disease, extensive pulmonary syndromes, and high relapse rates. Non-tuberculosis mycobacterial infections cause skin and soft tissue infections with skin nodules and skin abscesses. Higher cumulative doses of glucocorticoids and renal disease are associated with increased risk of mycobacterial species in SLE.\n6tbv | Viral Infections\nxb13 | Herpes zoster represents the most common viral infection in SLE patients, followed by cytomegalovirus and human papillomavirus. Other viruses with high frequency in SLE include parvovirus B nineteen, hepatitis B and C, influenza, and SARS-COV-two.\ncxqi | Herpes zoster infections occur at the age of thirty to forty years in SLE with higher prevalence in the Asian population than in the US population. Risk factors include increasing age, lymphopenia, major organ disease, multimorbidities, glomerulonephritis, high dose glucocorticoids and non-glucocorticoid therapy such as mycophenolate mofetil and cyclophosphamide. Herpes zoster infection and reactivation occurring even during a low disease activity state is associated with serious morbidity, inferior quality of life and death. The use of high-dose glucocorticoids is associated with bacterial superinfection.\nqfmx | Cytomegalovirus infection in SLE may present as gastrointestinal bleed, colitis, hepatitis, retinitis, or encephalitis, with a high incidence of pneumonitis. High dose of glucocorticoids, cyclophosphamide, plasma exchange, pancytopenia and concurrent infections have been associated with serious cytomegalovirus clinical syndrome. High cytomegalovirus viral loads are associated with the development of cytomegalovirus infection in patients with SLE.\nrut3 | The rate of cervical human papillomavirus infections is higher in SLE patients than in the general population, with an increased risk for high grade squamous intraepithelial lesions. This may be due to delayed clearance of infections or greater reactivation of latent infections, in addition to higher rates of human papillomavirus coinfection. The association between immunosuppressive medications and risk of human papillomavirus infection needs additional evaluation.\nm3cp | A higher proportion of hepatitis C infection is frequent in patients with SLE compared to healthy controls. However, there appears to be a lower risk of hepatitis B infection in patients with SLE (possible protective role of overexpressed cytokines in these patients). Nonetheless, the risk of reactivation of hepatitis B virus is higher in SLE patients receiving a daily steroid dose of more than ten milligrams per day and patients over the age of forty. Rituximab, to treat SLE, is associated with a higher risk of reactivation of hepatitis B and patients should be screened prior to therapy.\nmq4s | Parvovirus B nineteen and SLE share certain similarities in terms of presentation, including fevers, malaise, lymphadenopathy, anemia, and rash. This viral infection is also able to induce the production of autoantibodies specific to SLE, like anti-double stranded DNA and soluble nuclear antigens. It has been proposed that parvovirus B nineteen can induce pathogenic autoimmunity through a variety of mechanisms, including molecular mimicry. However, it is difficult to estimate the prevalence of this parvovirus infection in SLE patients as immune therapy inhibits immunoglobulin em M and em G seroconversion.\n95el | The COVID-nineteen Global Rheumatology Alliance and OpenSAFELY databases provide data that suggest that patients with SLE are at a higher risk of severe disease, hospitalization and death from COVID-nineteen compared to the general population. The risk is highest in patients on prednisone dose greater than ten milligrams per day, and those on rituximab, as compared to those patients maintained on belimumab, hydroxychloroquine, azathioprine, methotrexate, or mycophenolate mofetil.\na0a5 | Opportunistic Infections\ngocl | Opportunistic infections like Listeria monocytogenes, Nocardia species, Aspergillus fumigatus, and others may present as neurologic syndromes that mimic neuropsychiatric lupus and behave more aggressively to cause severe disease leading to death. Cryptococcus neoformans presents in SLE as meningitis, meningoencephalitis, lung nodules and pneumonia or bronchiolitis driven by long term use of glucocorticoids and cytotoxic drugs and is associated with higher mortality rates.\nob1z | Candida albicans is a usual form of candidemia in SLE and usually involves the gastrointestinal and genitourinary system and may become invasive at times.\nm4cb | Why are Lupus Patients at Substantial Risk for Infections? Aberrant Immune Functions in SLE\nm61y | The aberrant immune response in SLE, low serum complement levels, functional asplenia, and abnormal host response of neutrophils and macrophages to pathogens have contributed to the rise in infectious rates in SLE. The impaired inflammatory response with decreased chemotaxis, membrane recognition and attachment to microorganisms, phagocytosis, oxidative metabolism could also predispose to infection.\nu2ob | Lymphopenia and neutropenia are common hematologic manifestations in SLE and can have poor clinical outcomes with predisposition to infection given decreased T-cell activity and dysfunctional macrophages and monocyte systems. Prior studies have shown that a decrease in phagocytic function and the impaired handling of immune complexes due to the presence of autoantibodies against Fc gamma receptors which belong to the tumor necrosis factor alpha superfamily contribute to the risk of infections.\n2gnm | Complement dysfunction is frequent in SLE, reflected by inherited complement deficiency, and hypocomplementemia during SLE disease activity. SLE patients with complement dysfunctions show an increase in risk to capsulated organisms such as Streptococcal pneumonia, Neisseria meningitis and Neisseria gonorrhea. Hypogammaglobulinemia encountered in SLE contributes to an increased risk of recurrent and severe bacterial infections, although polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia is common in SLE. Whether immunoglobulin replacement therapy decreases the risk of infection in those patients requires further investigation.\nemgw | In addition, the risk of infection in SLE is higher in the presence of comorbidities and when using glucocorticoids, immunosuppressive and immune modulatory therapy. The incidence of kidney involvement, diabetes, and higher lupus damage index scores were dramatically higher in SLE patients with an infection compared to SLE patients without an infection. In fact, the use of aggressive immunosuppressive therapy is a serious risk factor for the development of infections in SLE.\nxaqt | Impact of Immune Therapy and Risk of Infections\n5rcb | The use of immunosuppressive therapy will induce difficulty in mounting an immune response to viral and bacterial infections in SLE, including the exposure to immunosuppressive agents including high-dose glucocorticoids, alkylating agents such as cyclophosphamide, in addition to mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine, cyclosporine, and hydroxychloroquine.",
