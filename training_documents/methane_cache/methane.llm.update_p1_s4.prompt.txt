You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

s0fl | Enzymatic Oxidation of Methane
43ia | ABSTRACT: Methane monooxygenases (MMOs) are en- zymes that catalyze the oxidation of methane to methanol in CHA methanotrophic bacteria. As potential targets for new gas-to- . liquid methane bioconversion processes, MMOs have attracted intense attention in recent years. There are two distinct types of MMO, a soluble, cytoplasmic MMO (sMMO) and a membrane-bound, particulate MMO (pMMO). Both oxidize CH OH methane at metal centers within a complex, multisubunit scaffold, but the structures, active sites, and chemical mechanisms are completely different. This Current Topic review article focuses on the overall architectures, active site structures, substrate reactivities, protein-protein interactions, and chemical mechanisms of both MMOs, with an emphasis on fundamental aspects. In addition, recent advances, including new details of interactions between the sMMO components, characterization of sMMO intermediates, and progress toward understanding the pMMO metal centers are highlighted. The work summarized here provides a guide for those interested in exploiting MMOs for biotechnological applications.
3g2y | A erobic methane oxidation in nature is carried out by methanotrophic bacteria, organisms that can use methane as their sole source of carbon and energy. Despite the extremely strong C-H bond in methane (AH298 = 105 kcal/mol)," these bacteria are capable of oxidizing methane to methanol under ambient conditions using metalloenzymes called methane monooxygenases (MMOs). Understanding the biochemistry of MMOs is critical to their applications in bioremediation2 and to the development of biological processes for conversion of natural gas to liquid fuels and chemicals.3 Moreover, detailed characterization of MMO active sites may lead to new biomimetic catalysts.4 A range of alkane-oxidizing enzymes exist in the environment, but only the two types of MMO, soluble MMO (sMMO) and particulate MMO (pMMO), as well as the close pMMO homologue ammonia monooxygenase (AMO),' can oxidize methane. Although sMMO and pMMO perform the same chemical reaction, their structures, cofactor requirements, and mechanisms are completely different.
gc7v | sMMO requires three protein components for activity: a hydroxylase (MMOH, 251 kDa), a reductase (MMOR, 38.5 kDa), and a regulatory protein (MMOB, 15.9 kDa).7 MMOH is responsible for methane oxidation and is composed of a, , and y subunits encoded by the mmoX, mmoY, and mmoZ genes, respectively. MMOB and MMOR are encoded by the mmoB and mmoC genes. The pMMO hydroxylase consists of the pmoB, pmoA, and pmoC subunits, encoded by the pmoCAB operon (Figure 1). No regulatory protein has been identified for pMMO, and the identity of its native reductase remains unclear." Most methanotrophs express only pMMO. A few species express only sMMO, and a subset contains genes for both pMMO and sMMO.10 In this subset, sMMO expression occurs when copper levels in the growth medium are below 1 HM, and pMMO expression is predominant at copper levels

j30a | above 5 uM.11-13 This "copper switch" parallels the metal cofactor requirements of the MMOs: sMMO has a catalytic diiron center,14 and pMMO utilizes a copper active site." The mechanism of the copper switch is still unknown, but recent work suggests that the copper-chelating natural product methanobactin, genes encoded by the methanobactin operon, and mmoD, a gene product of unknown function encoded by the sMMO operon, could play a role. 15,16 A transcriptional activator, mmoR, and a GroEL-like chaperone protein, mmoG (Figure 1), are required for sMMO expression.17,18
7bdk | Studies of both MMOs over the past quarter century have provided much insight into their structure and function. This Current Topic summarizes work addressing the architecture, active sites, substrate reactivities, protein-protein interactions, and chemical mechanisms of both systems, with emphasis on fundamental aspects that must be considered if MMOs are to be exploited in new gas-to-liquid methane bioconversion processes. In addition, recent advances that have not been reviewed previously are highlighted. A more comprehensive review is available elsewhere.19
