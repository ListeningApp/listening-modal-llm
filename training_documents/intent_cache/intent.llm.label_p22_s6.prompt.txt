You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

7zvp | Collectively, the actions you take toward self- preparation and self-management in the face of inter- personally difficult clients helps ensure that the ways in which you choose to interact with these clients will be optimally therapeutic. This decreases the likelihood that you will unwittingly act out your own negative feelings toward a difficult client. For example, a therapist once shared that she felt less guilty about precipitously chang- ing an appointment with a client in order to meet an out-of-town friend for lunch because the client tended to behave in demanding ways and had recently ques- tioned her approach. Changing an appointment with a client for a nonurgent matter is not a disciplined way of managing one's feelings toward a client. Moreover, changing the appointment with an already-difficult client may lead to increased tension in the relationship. Another example is the extent to which one may make special efforts on behalf of a client. It is generally easier to make these extra efforts for clients whom one likes and sees as investing a great deal in the therapy. How- ever, depriving the difficult client or the client who is not invested in therapy of one's extra effort is not justified ethically.
ww6u | Table 3.4 contains additional examples of difficult in- terpersonal behaviors that clients commonly exhibit, typ- ical emotional reactions a therapist might have to such behavior, and undisciplined versus disciplined ways in which therapists can behave in response.
hpi6 | In addition, Exercise 3.1 in the Activities section of this chapter provides a blank copy of this table so that you can furnish your own examples of difficult interpersonal situa- tions, note your own reactions, and judge for yourself what would be a disciplined versus an undisciplined response.
4uhb | Another important aspect of interpersonal self-discipline is that therapists avoid viewing the relation- ship as a potential source of self-esteem or as a barometer by which to measure their own interpersonal competence. Regardless of whether a relationship is successful or un- successful, the extent to which a therapist can truly con- trol what occurs during a clinical interaction is limited. Therapists must keep their successes and failures in per- spective and work to manage their needs to feel connected with, approved of, or celebrated by clients. Investing too much of one's own interests in having a relationship with a client can result in deep feelings of disappointment when a positive connection does not occur. Importantly, more intuitive clients may detect subtle hints toward the thera- pist's need for connection or approval and may withdraw further because they feel pressured or emotionally suffo- cated. When clients do not meet a therapist's expectations, some may detect underlying feelings of disappointment or frustration in the therapist. Through time, not keeping therapeutic relationships in perspective can also lead to emotional exhaustion or burnout in therapists.
epyi | A final aspect of interpersonal self-discipline in the therapy process involves perspective and responsibility- taking. According to the IRM, it is the therapist's respon- sibility to manage the more challenging aspects of the re- lationship and continually strive to fortify the relationship with the client. This aspect of interpersonal self-discipline is particularly relevant to working with more frustrating clients who are interpersonally sensitive, difficult, or oth- erwise vulnerable. Even if a client misperceives a ther- apist's good intentions, attempts to break professional boundaries, or becomes upset with the therapist for no apparent reason, it is the therapist's responsibility to re- spond to the client in a way that is ethical and maximally therapeutic given the client's interpersonal characteristics and the circumstances of therapy. More information about therapeutic responding is provided in Chapter 7.

uc9r | Principle 3: It Is Necessary to Keep Head Before Heart
l0ap | Responding to clients from the heart-that is, intuitively, spontaneously, and emotionally-should be considered an indulgence and a privilege earned by therapists rather than an entitlement. Responding from the heart must be accompanied by sufficient development of critical self-awareness and interpersonal self-discipline. With suf- ficient experience and practice, therapists become aware of the various types of positive therapeutic communica- tion of which they are capable. By the same token, ther- apists become familiar with the many potential ways in which their communication (or lack of communication) has the potential to become nontherapeutic, psycholog- ically risky, ambiguous, or (at worst) emotionally harm- ful to clients. With sufficient practice, a disciplined and systematic process of therapeutic responding becomes automatic and intuitive. Through time, therapists feel as if they are responding to their clients spontaneously

us5v | According to this principle, it is incorrect to assume that so long as your heart is in the right place you natu- rally react and behave appropriately in therapy. Instead, it is important to know that each of us has certain tendencies that do not always play out positively for a client simply because we care, have compassion, or can appreciate the client's life story. To be sure, these are all important atti- tudes for a therapist to sustain, but they are not a replace- ment for thoughtful self-knowledge and self-discipline.
rs2m | Principle 4: Mindful Empathy Is Required to Know Your Client
uz9y | As reviewed in Chapter 1, the centrality and importance of empathy to the client-therapist relationship is supported by several occupational therapy scholars and practitioners. A therapist's capacity for empathy is a prerequisite for a functional client-therapist relationship. However, the IRM differs from prior discussions of empathy in the

c3lz | occupational therapy literature in that it treats empathy as a mindful process rather than a predominantly affec- tive one. The concept of mindful empathy was developed based on Heinz Kohut's (1984) underlying theory of self-psychology.
8bwk | Mindful empathy is an objective mode of observation in which the therapist comes to feel and understand a client's underlying emotions, needs, and motives while at the same time maintaining an objective viewpoint. Kohut labeled the empathic process of accessing a cli- ent's internal world "vicarious introspection," and he consistently emphasized the importance of evaluating each client's experiences and behaviors from the client's unique perspective (Gardner, 1991; Kohut, 1984). The idea of mindful empathy, which was influenced by some

mqot | According to the IRM, mindful empathy is funda- mental to interpersonal reasoning. It guides both the therapist's response to interpersonal events and the ther- apist's efforts to sustain the therapeutic relationship. For instance, mindful empathy is necessary to interpret accu- rately a client's reactions to a given interpersonal event. Achieving an understanding of the client's cognitive inter- pretation and emotional and behavioral reactions to the event must be accomplished through empathically based listening and questioning. Although the client's interper- sonal characteristics are likely to play a role in his or her interpretation and reactions to the event, assumptions about a client's reaction and needs should not be made until the client's reactions have been verified through

gipz | reflective listening and an explicit conversation about the event that has occurred. Assumptions should not be based entirely on prior knowledge of the client's interpersonal characteristics. Mindful empathy is an advanced skill in the therapist's interpersonal knowledge base. More infor- mation about this skill and examples of how therapists have employed mindful empathy in practice is presented in subsequent chapters of this book.
b4wj | Principle 5: Grow Your Interpersonal Knowledge Base
5xlt | Interpersonal communication is as complex as the limits of human understanding. From client to client, commu- nication is as variegated and unique as are the differences between and within individuals, families, social networks, communities, neighborhoods, nations, cultures, geog- raphies, climates, and governments. For these reasons, therapists benefit from knowing as much about human behavior as possible, particularly as it pertains to more commonly occurring events in the client-therapist relationship.
9bz4 | The IRM describes skills that are essential to meet- ing the basic interpersonal demands of practice, such as listening effectively, communicating clearly, overcoming basic conflicts and events, and being reliable and predict- able in interactions. The model describes additional skills that are required to achieve a level of communication with a client that responds to his or her interpersonal needs. This continuum of skills is described in detail and accom- panied by clinical examples in Chapters 8 through 16.
yfv2 | Principle 6: Provided That They Are Purely and Flexibly Applied, a Wide Range of Therapeutic Modes Can Work and Be Utilized Interchangeably in Occupational Therapy
pujl | Individuals who enter the profession of occupational ther- apy have a side to their personalities that is oriented to- ward others and desires to support, uplift, empathize with, motivate, advocate for, guide, or otherwise empower peo- ple. At the same time, each therapist has a unique combi- nation of interpersonal characteristics that largely derive from his or her temperament, usual interpersonal style with others, and from life experience. These characteris-

nil3 | mode or modes (i.e., particular ways of relating to a client in a given situation). As already mentioned, the six inter- personal therapeutic modes are the advocating mode, col- laborating mode, empathizing mode, encouraging mode, instructing mode, and problem-solving mode. The thera- peutic mode or set of modes that characterize a therapist's general approach to interacting with clients is referred to as the therapist's interpersonal style.
68a1 | An underlying principle of the IRM is that no partic- ular mode or interpersonal style is superior to another. Two therapists with diametrically opposite personali- ties, who use different combinations of modes, can be equally effective. However, certain interpersonal styles tend to work better with different populations and cir- cumstances. Thus, therapists who are critically self-aware choose areas of practice most suited for their interper- sonal style.
seik | More importantly, effective use of self depends on the flexible and appropriate use of modes depending on the client and the situation. A therapist who relies heavily on only one therapeutic mode is effective with a narrower range of circumstances and clients than a therapist who can employ a variety of modes in response to changing interpersonal circumstances. Thus, the IRM recommends that therapists make an ongoing effort to expand their capacity to use different modes as demanded by individ- ual differences between clients and the unique features of specific interpersonal events that may occur during therapy.
oq7c | When a therapist decides to invoke a particular mode, it is important that the mode is communicated to the client accurately in its pure form. To achieve the pure, accurate use of a mode, it is recommended that the ther- apist remain within that mode for as long as it takes to communicate and ensure that the client has received the intended interpersonal message (e.g., that the intention for the moment is solely to empathize, solely to instruct, solely to problem-solve, or what have you). If a therapist attempts to blend modes so two interpersonal messages are being communicated simultaneously, it is likely to weaken the intended communication of both modes and to result in the client becoming confused. For example, if a therapist's true intention is to address a client's behav- ior by using the instructing mode but, instead, begins to question the client about the reasons behind the behavior in a way that conveys disapproval, the therapist is blend- ing the problem-solving mode into the instructing mode.

jai3 | The result is that the client receives a confused message about the desirability of the behavior (e.g., does the ther- apist want me to stop the behavior, or might it be okay if I explain to her why I am doing this?). Similarly, if a thera- pist shifts modes too rapidly it may also lead to confusion or weakening of the communication, depending on the cognitive level and emotional maturity of the particular client. Although the IRM acknowledges the need for ther- apists occasionally to share mixed feelings with a client and send complex messages to clients that involve many mode shifts, this approach to communication must be done with great circumspection. These and other issues pertinent to shifting modes are discussed in more detail in Chapter 7.
p57i | Principle 7: The Client Defines a Successful Relationship
u5ug | Clients differ widely in terms of what they are seeking from their relationships with health-care professionals. For instance, some clients prefer a relationship that is pro- fessional, hierarchical, and relatively distant in which the therapist provides specific instructions, technologies, or resources to assist in the accomplishment of occupational goals and objectives. Other clients desire a relationship that involves a more personalized connection and results in feelings of emotional support as well as tangible occu- pational outcomes. Still others wish for a collaborative re- lationship in which mutual planning and problem-solving take place.
i9k5 | What is considered a successful relationship in occu- pational therapy must be defined by the client rather than the therapist. A successful client-therapist relationship must be based on the achievement of the type of ther- apeutic relationship the client needs most and is capable of during the time he or she is in therapy. This means that a successful therapeutic relationship is not defined by a feeling of closeness, or connection, unless the client clearly wants it as a feature of the relationship. Although in many circumstances these variables are associated with the client's perception of a successful relationship, for some clients a successful relationship may mean one that involves a certain level of professional distance or some other kind of interaction that is consistent with the cli- ent's prior experiences with health-care professionals and cultural expectations.
20z2 | A corollary to this principle is that clients may change through time in their desires for the therapeutic relation- ship. The following are some examples. A client who at first desires a more hierarchical and therapist-structured relationship following a traumatic event resulting in im- pairment may wish for a more collaborative relationship later during the course of therapy. A long-term client seen first as a child may wish to achieve more distance as he or she comes into adolescence. A client who previously insisted on a highly collaborative relationship may, fol- lowing an exacerbation of an impairment or symptom or during a crisis, need an empathic and supportive relation- ship. Such changes in a client's desires for the therapeutic relationship may reflect such factors as responses to stress, personal growth, or natural development. They must be respected and accommodated by the therapist.
