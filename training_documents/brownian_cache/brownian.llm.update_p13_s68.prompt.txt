You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

cuh0 | fective potential for a high, <LATEX>\Upsilon = 1 0 ,</LATEX> and a low, <LATEX>\Upsilon = 1</LATEX> 1, temperature for the polynomial and unequal L-J poten- tials respectively. As <LATEX>k \rightarrow 0</LATEX> is approached, a distinct single minimum develops, indicating the average position of the particle. As expected, the lower the temperature, the closest the effective minimum is to the bare poten- tial's global minimum, reflecting the relative weakness of fluctuations to force the particle to spend time away from it. As one might expect, it takes 'longer' in <LATEX>k</LATEX> evo- lution for local features - e.g. barriers - to disappear in the <LATEX>\Upsilon = 1</LATEX> case as fluctuations at each <LATEX>k \quad s c a l e \quad h a v e</LATEX> less energy than their equivalent for the <LATEX>\Upsilon = 1 0</LATEX> and the particle's stochastic motion between barriers is less frequent. Physically this means that the fluctuations we have integrated out up to scale <LATEX>k</LATEX> do not contribute significantly to the particle moving between minima.
k36t | We see a similar phenomenon in Fig. 3 for the flow from the bare to the effective potential for <LATEX>\Upsilon = 3 ,</LATEX> and <LATEX>\Upsilon = 1</LATEX> for an <LATEX>x ^ { 2 }</LATEX> potential with 6 gaussian bumps/dips. Here the original Langevin potential is much more com-
z1wx | plicated than in the previous two cases but the fRG is still able to smoothen out these features in a non-trivial way. This example further demonstrates how the flow of the effective potential is driven by the local curvature, the gaussian features imposed here, since for an <LATEX>x ^ { 2 }</LATEX> potential the fRG flow equation (88) yields no change beyond an unphysical shift by an overall additive constant.
o6gf | It is clear in all three figures that at the high temper- ature there is not much change in the shape of the po- tential when <LATEX>k</LATEX> has reached the value given by the green, dot-dashed line. Physically this means that the fluctua- tions integrated out in this range do not contribute signif- icantly to the particle evolution and transition between minima. However, by the time <LATEX>k</LATEX> has been lowered to the value of the yellow, dashed line we have started to inte- grate over fluctuations over timescales relevant for inter- minima transitions. Naturally, when <LATEX>k = 0</LATEX> is reached the potential is fully convex (as it must be by definition of T) with no local features to overcome. Similar behaviour is obtained where again we consider the corresponding
0hs6 | <LATEX>\Upsilon = 3 .</LATEX> lower temperature. As one might expect it takes 'longer' in <LATEX>k</LATEX> evolution for the barrier to disappear as fluctuations at each <LATEX>k</LATEX> scale have less energy than their equivalent for the high temperature case. Of note is that not only is
m05x | the evolution different but the final shape of <LATEX>V _ { k = 0 } \left( x \right)</LATEX> is different for the two different temperature regimes. Both the position and gradient near the global minimum are changed. This is suggestive of longer time scales required at lower temperatures to reach equilibrium. It also indi- cates longer times for the equilibrium covariance to decay, as we discuss below.
ds29 | Regarding WFR, the full numerical solutions to (96) for the unequal L-J potential at <LATEX>\Upsilon = 1 0 , 2</LATEX> and for an <LATEX>x ^ { 2 }</LATEX> potential with 6 gaussian bumps/dips at <LATEX>\Upsilon = 3 ,</LATEX> are shown in Figs. 4 and 5 respectively. We see that from the initial condition, <LATEX>\zeta _ { x } = 1</LATEX> everywhere, features appear as <LATEX>k \rightarrow 0</LATEX> in direct contrast with the evolution of the effective higher temperatures it is clear that <LATEX>a t \quad k = 0 \quad a \quad l o c a l</LATEX> minima appears at the same place as the global minimum for the effective potential where the height of the local minima is linked to the equilibrium covariance - see equation (119). Looking at Fig. 4 (b) however we can see that this is no longer the case and the features generated by the fRG flow are much greater than in the high temperature case. We will see later that the neighbouring features in <LATEX>\zeta _ { x }</LATEX> will help to better describe dynamical evolution than the bare potential alone.
