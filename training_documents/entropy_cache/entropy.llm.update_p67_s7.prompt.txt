You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

f9cy | Let's do this integral!
3vhx | Let's compute the Boltzmann distribution p(p, q) and the entropy S. To keep the formulas clean, we'll work in units where m = K = k = h =1, and compute everything at one special temperature: T = 1.
1lk7 | In this setup h = 27, and
rkgd | e-BE(p,q) =e-(p2+q2)/2
jbj0 | is a beautiful Gaussian with integral
f7b0 | 00 e-(p2+q2)/2 = 27T.
9bdp | These two factors of 27 cancel when we compute the denominator of the probability distribution p(p, q):
b1jn | dpdq 2TT 2TT .= 1. =
f02j | Thus, we get simply
uc93 | p(p,q) =e-(p2+q2)/2
24jr | The entropy of the harmonic oscillator is thus
weol | dpdq when K = k = h =T =1. Next let's do this integral.
zo3w | S = - e-(p2+ 2)/2 In (e-(p2+2)/2) −∞ -00
bqsc | ENTROPY OF THE HARMONIC OSCILLATOR: 6
c2j4 | When m =k=k=h=T=1 the entropy of a classical harmonic oscillator is

otfh | (doing the 0 integral)
6dzi | = ( ue "du
nk46 | (substituting u = r2 /2)
sbg4 | = 1
0vsm | Now let's do the integral to compute the entropy of the harmonic oscillator. We copy a famous trick for computing the integral of a Gaussian. First we switch to polar coordinates in the pq plane, where
rrsc | r2 = p2 + q2 and dpdq = rdrd0.
xjfg | Then we integrate with respect to 0, which cancels out the factor of 1/2T. Then we do a substitution u = r2/2. But for us r2/2 is minus the logarithm of the Gaussian:
iw9o | − (p+02 /2)=1]
enxg | so we're left with
vmnz | S = | ue -" du
82g8 | which we can do with integration by parts.
l3g2 | After all this work, we get an incredibly simple answer:
5ah7 | S = 1.
cq8x | So in the special case where m = K = k = h =T = 1, the entropy of a classical harmonic oscillator in thermal equilibrium is 1.
dxup | Now let's return to the general case, and finish the job.
0xhz | ENTROPY OF THE HARMONIC OSCILLATOR: 7
thwq | A classical harmonic oscillator with frequency w has entropy
nmx1 | S = kln(akT/hw)
ng95 | for some dimensionless constant Q.
ldw4 | But when m = K= k =h=T=1 we have w = 1 and S = 1, so we must have
gynb | and thus finally
yp2i | kT hw +1
gm15 | S = k ln
uwgf | Knowing the entropy in one special case, we can figure out the constant a in our general formula for the entropy. Our general formula says
ai15 | S = kln(akT /hw).
heo3 | But when m = k=T = h=1 we get w=k/m =1, and we saw last time that in this special case we get
u2cj | S = 1.
aq9q | So a must equal e.
dc5c | Thus, the entropy of an oscillator with frequency w at temperature T is
9diq | S= kln(ekT/hw) =k k (In ( AT) +1).
c10k | The extra 1 here is fascinating to me. If we had slacked off, ignored the possibility of a dimensionless constant o, and crudely used dimensional analysis to guess S approxi- mately the way people often do, we might have gotten
f8yn | S=kln(kT/hw)
ahrs | This would be off by 1 nat.
k7hf | What does the 1 extra nat mean? It seems pretty mysterious now. But later we'll understand it! I already mentioned that often entropy is roughly k times the logarithm of something called the 'number of accessible states'. But that formula is not exactly right: there's also an extra term related to energy, and that accounts for the 1 extra nat here. Be patient, and you'll see what I mean.
wl64 | WHERE ARE WE NOW?
qrks | The mystery: why does each molecule of hydrogen have ~ 23 bits of entropy at standard temperature and pressure?
m9te | The goal: derive and understand the formula for the entropy of a classical ideal monatomic gas:
qpsk | = AN V N + 3 In KI + 7)
sx3l | including the mysterious constant y.
zm2g | The subgoal: compute the entropy of a single classical particle in a 1-dimensional box.
ui7p | The sub-subgoal: explain entropy from the ground up, and compute the entropy of a classical harmonic oscillator:
ubys | S = k ln - kT +1) how ✓
hphn | Okay, so we've gotten somewhere! By doing the right integral, we've figured out that the entropy S of a classical harmonic oscillator of frequency w in thermal equilibrium at temperature T is
ves3 | S = k ( KI +1). kT
h4py | where k is Boltzmann's constant and h is Planck's constant.
p612 | We could compute the entropy of a single particle in a box the same way, and also the entropy of a classical ideal diatomic gas. But the integrals get a bit hairy, so people prefer to use a clever trick called the 'partition function'. It's definitely worth learning. It's not merely a clever trick, it gives new insights on the relation between entropy, energy and temperature. So let's talk about it.
2ll3 | THE PARTITION FUNCTION
roki | If a system has a set of states X with measure dx and its energy is a function E : X -> R, its partition function is
xzvf | Z(B) = ye-BE(x) dx
vw6g | where ß is the coolness.
5ltn | I want to compute the entropy of a particle in a box, and ultimately the entropy of a box of hydrogen. We could do it directly, but that's a bit ugly. It's better to use the 'partition function'. This amazing function knows everything about statistical mechanics. From it you can get the entropy-and much more!
vqad | THE PARTITION FUNCTION AND THE BOLTZMANN DISTRIBUTION
2xj0 | If a system has a set of states X with measure dx and its energy is E : X -> R, in thermal equilibrium at coolness ß its probability distribution of states is the Boltzmann distribution:
567t | p(x) = Sx e-BE(x) dx e-BE(x) = e-BE(x) Z(3)
sk0p | where Z(B) = ze-8F(x) dx
vwq7 | is its partition function.
beyn | In fact we've already seen the partition function: it's the thing you have to divide e-BE(x) by to get a function whose integral is 1. And that function whose integral is 1 is the Boltzmann distribution: the probability distribution of states in thermal equilibrium at coolness . So the partition function is a humble normalizing factor! And yet we'll see that it's incredibly powerful. It's kind of surprising.
jwlq | Like Lagrangians in classical mechanics, it's fairly easy to use partition functions, but it's harder to understand what they 'really mean'. We will try. But first let's see how to use them.

q2it | THE PARTITION FUNCTION KNOWS ALL!
