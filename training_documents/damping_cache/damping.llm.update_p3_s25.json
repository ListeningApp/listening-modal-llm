The solutions of (twenty-two) are known as harmonic maps to the unit sphere, which turn up in several equations in physics, such as Ginzburg-Landau equation, and were extensively investigated mathematically in the past decades due to their importance both in mathematics and in many applied fields; see, for example, Some results on the dynamic version of (twenty-two) can be found.\nojro | Three.
