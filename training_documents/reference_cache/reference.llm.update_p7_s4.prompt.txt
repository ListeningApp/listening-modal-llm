You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

vbni | Embedded librarianship is one specialized method for offering outreach where librarians have an information intermediary role in a team or community.34 For example, public librarians can be embed- ded personally or virtually in local government or community organizations and can serve as a great resource in times of crisis.35 Academic outreach librarians, also called liaison librarians,36 may have office hours or get embedded in online classes (see also Chapter 9: Learning and Research Institutions: Academic Libraries),37 and they can serve as resources on curriculum planning committees at the de- partmental and university levels.38 Embedded librarians have also developed a variety of collaborative relationships with patrons, city administrators, and even medical teams doing hospital rounds.39 In fact, embedded librarians serve as information resources for everyone from local boards doing city planning to rapid response teams during medical emergencies.40
dgcw | A more traditional but still successful application of embedded librarianship is when information professionals collaborate in team-taught information literacy components of online courses and face- to-face classes.41 Providing just-in-time individual instruction and research assistance for students ensures that an information professional is available at the point of need in classes.42 Whatever their specific role is, embedded librarians are there to provide relevant information for students, teams, and the community whether it is in person or on demand asynchronously.
gvwz | Supporting the educational mission of schools, community colleges, universities, and more is another important role of information intermediators. Reference librarians play an educational role in person and virtually by helping users learn how to locate, navigate, and evaluate information. For example, library staff support the information needs for the College Depot at the Phoenix Public Library43 in addition to providing homework help and tutoring services for local school students and homeschoolers alike. During the COVID-19 pandemic when schools44 and institutions of higher edu- cation had to pivot most or all their classes online, librarians were already positioned to use streaming media to deliver virtual reference transactions and library instruction at the point of need for students.
sk5m | Information professionals are also stepping up and using their information skills to take a more active community service role. In his book Palaces for the People, Eric Klinenberg,45 discusses how li- braries can help address social inequality in civic life by helping with information needs in community hubs46 during times of crisis. For example, librarians can help communities address everything from hurricanes and wildfires to food insecurity and a global pandemic47 or by providing on-demand infor- mation via mental health kiosks (see Textbox 13.4).48
qws8 | Helping individuals use new technologies and develop new skills is another role for reference librarians. Brian Kenney49 addresses this issue in his article, "Where Reference Fits in the Modern Library," when he argues that users are looking for ways to do everything from using 3D printers to doing genealogy research rather than simply locating information. Libraries offer technology help in

She contacted her local library looking for information on how she could obtain food assistance. The person at the reference desk contacted a local food bank, explained the situation, and was able to get back to the woman in crisis with contact information needed for immediate community assistance.

Likewise, help with in- formation on how to do things also takes place in makerspaces and beta spaces that foster innovation and experimentation.
d52l | A unique challenge for information professionals is that their roles have had to constantly change and adapt as today's modes of services also change and evolve. This means that twenty-first-century information professionals need the flexibility to deal with rapid political, health, climate, and work-re- lated changes and to learn new processes and procedures in support of their service philosophy for the communities they serve.50 For example, while information professionals were pivoting to provide ser- vices virtually during the COVID-19 pandemic, they were also simultaneously challenged to reimagine how their information services would be provided in the postpandemic new normal.51 This means that reference librarians and information intermediators of all kinds need to be creative, innovative, and technologically skilled, and information intermediators need new skill sets to offer the high-tech reference services their users want.
qlbb | For example, school librarians were frequently the go-to people as technology integration leaders when schoolteachers and students had to switch to online instruction during the 2020-2021 academic year. In addition, school librarians assisted with everything from helping configure and distribute Chromebooks to students and helping teachers learn to use various learning management platforms such as Canvas on one hand to expanding online learning resources for online classes on the other.52
nhsg | Academic, public, and special librarians all faced similar challenges when figuring out how to safely offer reference services while working from home, using Zoom for instruction, meetings, and reference interviews, and developing online tutorials, Bitmoji virtual libraries,53 and subject guides. However, no matter which delivery model is used or what type of information organization is involved, information professionals have demonstrated that they are pre- pared to integrate intermediation services and tech- nology skills with other parts of their organizations to pivot and address the information needs of users in and outside of those organizations.54

4jmz | The array of job titles other than the term "ref- erence librarian" reflect the wide range of jobs that entail helping users find and access information that they need. For example, job titles can range from emerging technology librarian to community librarian to student success librarian.55 These emerging roles also can address interdepartmental responsibili- ties that range from managing learning resources centers in schools and institutions of higher educa-
b7cq | tion to using learning management systems that pro- vide access to digital resources and reference services.
