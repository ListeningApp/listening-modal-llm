You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

06yq | Microdosing with psychedelics to self-medicate for ADHD symptoms in adults: A naturalistic study
dpv6 | ARTICLE INFO
8r5j | ABSTRACT
2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

o22k | Few are going above and beyond in delivering on the student experience. Just four out of 10 institutions reported that the experience they provide students consistently (9 percent) or even occasionally (28 percent) exceeded student expectations. Institutions in the UK, Germany and Australia lagged behind the other jurisdictions in the study, with just 29, 28 and 24 percent, respectively, indicating that student experience exceeded expectations.
nwfz | Nearly 8 out of 10 higher education institutions are making customer centricity a top or high priority
nvfy | "What priority is your institution placing on its customer-centric strategy?"
mror | The future of higher education in a disruptive world
zlxc | Many institutions have some distance to go in matching leading customer experience practices in other sectors.
k0bw | The survey revealed that security, technology and people/process hurdles stand between institutions and the successful execution of customer-centric strategies. While higher-education institutions face numerous obstacles to success, their lack of qualified staff was listed as the number one barrier to the successful execution of customer-centric strategies, cited by 33 percent of respondents.
aq5a | Barrier number two, cited by 29 percent of institutions, was students who "arrive lacking key academic and/or personal skills." It is, to put it mildly, unorthodox for a provider which actually selects its own customers then to say that some of them are the problem in executing a customer-centric strategy.
sc5y | Institutions are also dealing with several other security and technology challenges, including concerns over data security and privacy (31 percent), difficulty sharing student data and analytics between channels, jurisdictions and locations (28 percent), and a lack of integrated communication channels (27 percent).
0yab | The KPMG International-commissioned research conducted by Forrester Consulting on its own terms suggests that many institutions have some distance to go in matching leading customer experience practices in other sectors, and it's thought that even their responses might be inflated due to lack of awareness about what other sectors are actually doing.
w95z | Turning specifically to the eight critical capabilities of a connected enterprise, a very mixed picture emerged:
0i1k | Insight-driven strategies and actions: Sixty-nine percent of respondents had sound data analytics strategy and governance processes, but just half had the analytics tools (49 percent) and data collection and enrichment practices (49 percent) to deliver timely and accurate insights for decision making.
dqlg | Il
p6pq | Experience centricity by design: Most institutions said they could design student journeys (73 percent) and were co-designing learning pathways with students (69 percent), but some have more work to do to better integrate their ecosystems for education, research and knowledge exchange, with just 60 percent reporting good or excellent execution in this area.
zse6 | G
p2n3 | Responsive operations and supply chain: Seventy-five percent or more said that operational excellence was embedded in their institution and that their service capabilities were agile, but fewer said that assets and liabilities were aligned with strategy (65 percent) or that their operational approach was driven by a clear view of demand (56 percent).
ohh7 | C
vbni | Aligned and empowered workforce: Decision makers gave their institutions high marks for institutional design and governance (68 percent) as well as leadership and culture (67 percent) capabilities. However, they more critically rated their workforce strategy capabilities (59 percent) - the ability to optimize current capabilities, plan for future institution needs and develop career paths that manage and retain talent.
dgcw | Seamless interactions and commerce: Nearly three-quarters (72 percent) rated their intake and referral management capabilities favorably, but institutions could do more to develop a clear channel strategy that promotes seamless interactions and supports omnichannel access, with just 57 percent and 48 percent, respectively, rating their execution as good or excellent.
gvwz | Integrated partner and alliance ecosystem: Most institutions reported having a clear understanding of when to enhance their internal capabilities with those offered by partners (68 percent), but 50 percent lacked integrated partner governance to effectively engage and manage partnerships, alliances and vendors to meet stakeholder needs.
sk5m | Innovative products and services: Most institutions were effective at understanding current and future needs (63 percent), but less-developed at outcome measurement (53 percent) and learning-planning capabilities (49 percent) mean just half were continuously monitoring and improving the quality of learning offerings.
qws8 | Digitally enabled technology architecture: Sixty-seven percent said their digital strategy promoted a flexible, resilient and experience-centric operating model, but only about half built their capabilities on common digital platforms (54 percent) and even fewer had an enterprise architecture that they feel could support both current and future strategy objectives (43 percent).
877u | 19
rzhj | The future of higher education in a disruptive world
bfax | The ability to execute on most capabilities leaves room for improvement, assuming that respondents were not being too optimistic in the first place. Over two-thirds of institutions described their ability to execute on objectives tied to both experience centricity and to responsive operations and supply chain as good or excellent; at least 50 percent cited good or excellent execution on objectives around aligned and empowered workforces (63 percent), seamless interactions and commerce (55 percent), insight-driven strategies and actions (52 percent), and an integrated partner and alliance ecosystem (52 percent). The weakest areas for higher-education institutions included innovative products and services (49 percent) and digitally enabled technology architecture (46 percent).
f2y8 | Near-term investments will focus on shoring up strong areas of execution. In the near term, institutions will be significantly investing in some stronger areas (experience centricity) as well as some weaker areas (digitally enabled architecture). However, many are deprioritizing investments in less-developed areas (innovative products/services).
o7qm | Long-term investment priorities will remain relatively stable. Over the next two to three years, institutions will continue to put investment into areas of strength (experience centricity), but they will fail to boost investment to improve weaker capabilities (innovative products/services, digitally enabled architecture).
d52l | Even though most decision makers surveyed by Forrester Consulting indicated that "consumer centeredness" was a top or high priority, many institutions have designed their service delivery models, operational processes and technology solutions to meet the needs and preferences of funders and policy makers, rather than students.
qlbb | 3.Operating model
nhsg | A further building block of transformation is adopting a target operating model. Many universities are unable to articulate clearly what is their existing operating model, or at best they post-rationalize from the status quo rather than point to a plan deliberately executed. The challenges ahead require a clear conceptual approach to a target operating model, showing how the enterprise will organize itself to execute its strategy and what detailed processes will be used.
hy0l | 4. Technology
4jmz | Investment in technology will likely be key to efficient transformation, the challenge being to link seamlessly front-, middle- and back-office systems while coping with the complexity of the modern higher-education institution.
b7cq | As seen in the KPMG International-commissioned research conducted by Forrester Consulting, only about half of the surveyed higher education institutions built their capabilities on common digital platforms (54 percent) and even fewer had an enterprise architecture that they felt could support both current and future strategy objectives (43 percent).
0b39 | To reach the scale and efficiency of operations which tomorrow's funding climate will be willing to pay for, a huge agenda of investment in technology will be required by universities over the next decade.

57lp | The future of higher education in a disruptive world
ukth | For most higher-education institutions, deliberate and proactive transformation or optimization will be the means of surviving and thriving in a world which is becoming tougher. University leaders should be asking themselves:
kpvt | - How can we operate on a scale that yields productivity gains sufficient to cover our rising salary and other costs?
jie2 | - Which customers do we want to serve and can do so responsibly?
d0ik | - How will we really know what they want and feel?
0x0s | What are the most important learning, personal and consumer experiences that we need to deliver?
4exe | - How can we better use data to make decisions in real-time that meaningfully improve student experiences and make our operations more responsive?
0myz | — How future-proofed are our operations and information infrastructure in the face of disruptive factors?
xh3i | - What organizational capabilities does our workforce require to prepare for the profound changes in roles and workflow brought about by digital transformation?
syiw | These are complex questions with many potential solutions and outcomes. The way forward is to design and execute a comprehensive strategy and blueprint built on the foundations of KPMG's Connected Enterprise for Higher Education framework.
kg3t | How KPMG can help
