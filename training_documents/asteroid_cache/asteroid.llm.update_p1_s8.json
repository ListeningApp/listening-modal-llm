        "content": "mror | Evidence for early asteroidal collisions prior to four point one five billion years ago from basaltic eucrite phosphate uranium-lead chronology\nzlxc | Article history: Received twenty-four March twenty twenty. Received in revised form nine July twenty twenty. Accepted twenty-three July twenty twenty. Available online twenty-six August twenty twenty. Editor: F. Moynier\nk0bw | One. Introduction\naq5a | Geological and geochemical records of the Earth-Moon system seem to indicate a surge in the impact flux at approximately three point nine billion years ago. Radiometric ages of multiple Apollo samples and lunar meteorites present a broad variation in ages with a peak at three point nine billion years ago. Some studies interpret cratering ages of the large lunar basins as concentrated between approximately four billion years ago and three point eight billion years ago\nsc5y | ABSTRACT\n0yab | The late heavy bombardment hypothesis, wherein the terrestrial planets are thought to have suffered intense collisions approximately three point nine billion years ago, is under debate. Coupled with new dynamical calculations, re-examination of geochronological data seem to support an earlier solar system instability and a smooth monotonic decline in impacts, as opposed to a \"cataclysm.\" To better understand this collisional history, records from the asteroidal meteorites are required. Here, we report a uranium-lead chronological dataset for eucrite meteorites thought to originate from the asteroid four Vesta; this dataset indicates a continuous history of collisions prior to four point one five billion years ago. Our model ages of apatite and merrillite from three brecciated basaltic eucrites-Juvinas four thousand one hundred fifty point three plus or minus eleven point six million years ago (merrillite only), Camel Donga (disturbed around four thousand five hundred seventy to four thousand three hundred seventy million years ago), and Stannern four thousand one hundred forty-three point zero plus or minus twelve point five million years ago- record multiple thermal metamorphic events during the period of approximately four point four to four point one five billion years ago. We interpret this to mean that Vesta or the vestoid cluster underwent multiple impacts and moderate high-temperature reheating during this time. The ages of approximately four point four to four point one five billion years ago are distinctly younger than the initial magmatic process on Vesta (greater than four point five billion years ago) but are significantly older than a later \"impact peak\" based on some interpretations of forty argon-thirty-nine argon chronologies approximately three point nine to three point five billion years ago. The intense collisions prior to four point one five billion years ago on Vesta are at odds with the conventional late heavy bombardment hypothesis but not inconsistent with the much earlier bombardment and monotonic decline scenario. Different radiometric chronologies of the asteroid likely represent the different stages of a continual collisional process. Conversely, the model two hundred seven lead star divided by two hundred six lead star ages of apatite in the unbrecciated basaltic eucrite, Agoult, returned an age of four thousand five hundred twenty-four point eight plus or minus nine point six million years ago. This may represent slow cooling from an earlier global reheating of the crust on Vesta at four point five five billion years ago, as documented by other radiometric chronologies. The apatite in Juvinas recorded a coincident timing of four thousand five hundred sixteen point nine plus or minus ten point four million years ago, which could be due to either slow crustal cooling or impact.

Orbital migrations of Jupiter and the other giant planets, triggered by a massive early cometary disk in the trans-Neptunian region, may have caused the intense impacts within the inner solar system (Nice model). If such planetary migrations occurred at three point nine billion years ago, results like those from the late heavy bombardment model might be observed. Chronological data from various asteroidal meteorites, however, cast doubt on this interpretation. The alternative early instability scenario, where the earlier planetary migrations provoked inner solar system collisions that monotonically decreased over the\n0i1k | next several hundreds of millions of years, seems to better explain the present data. Recent geochronology-based re-examinations provide timing constraints showing that the terrestrial planets suffered the intense bombardments at or before four point four eight billion years ago. Because most records on the terrestrial planets were overwritten by later internal and external processes, geochronologies of asteroids are valuable hints for understanding the ancient collisional history.",
