You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,

82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

qws8 | Remark 2.3. This expansion can be given a meaning as a converging infinite ex- pansion at the level of operators when <LATEX>\widetilde { \mathcal{L} } _ { \mathrm { p h y s } } ^ { ^ { \sim } }</LATEX> is Lo-bounded, and <LATEX>\mathcal{L} _ { 0 }</LATEX> and its inverse are restricted to <LATEX>\Pi _ { 0 } L ^ { 2 } \left( \psi _ { 0 } \right)</LATEX> (see [29, Theorem 5.2]). However, the perturbation we con- sider in Section 3 will be quite general and it cannot be assumed that the perturbation operator is L0-bounded.
877u | Proof. It is sufficient to prove the result for <LATEX>\varphi \in \mathscr{S} _ { 0 } ,</LATEX> as we can replace <LATEX>\varphi</LATEX> by <LATEX>\varphi + C</LATEX> for some constant <LATEX>C ,</LATEX> since fk has average 0 with respect to <LATEX>\psi _ { 0 }</LATEX> for any <LATEX>k .</LATEX> Using the definition of <LATEX>\mathfrak{f} _ { k } ,</LATEX> a straightforward computation gives, for <LATEX>\phi \in \mathscr{S}</LATEX> ,
rzhj | <LATEX>\int _ { \mathcal{X} } \left( \mathcal{L} _ { \eta } \phi \right) \left( 1 + \eta \mathfrak{f} _ { 1 } + \cdots + \eta ^ { k - 1 } \mathfrak{f} _ { k - 1 } \right) \psi _ { 0 } = \eta ^ { k } \int _ { \mathcal{X} } \left( \widetilde { \mathcal{L} } _ { \mathrm { p h y s } } \phi \right) \mathfrak{f} _ { k - 1 } \psi _ { 0 } .</LATEX> Note that all functions which appear in the above integrals are in <LATEX>\mathscr{S} ,</LATEX> so that their integrals with respect to <LATEX>\psi _ { 0 }</LATEX> are well defined. One would like at this stage to replace <LATEX>\phi</LATEX> by <LATEX>\mathcal{L} _ { \eta } ^ { - 1 } \Pi _ { \eta } \varphi ,</LATEX> which would already give the result. However, this would require con- trolling the integrability of derivatives of <LATEX>\mathcal{L} _ { \eta } ^ { - 1 } \Pi _ { \eta } \varphi ,</LATEX> which does not follow from our assumptions. We therefore consider an operator <LATEX>Q _ { \eta , k } ,</LATEX> defined on <LATEX>\mathscr{S} _ { 0 } ,</LATEX> which approxi- mates <LATEX>\mathcal{L} _ { \eta } ^ { - 1 }</LATEX> in some sense. Replacing <LATEX>\phi</LATEX> by <LATEX>Q _ { \eta , k } \varphi</LATEX> leads to
bfax | <LATEX>\int _ { \mathcal{X} } \mathcal{L} _ { \eta } Q _ { \eta , k } \varphi \psi _ { \eta } = 0 = \int _ { \mathcal{X} } \mathcal{L} _ { \eta } Q _ { \eta , k } \varphi \left( 1 + \eta \mathfrak{f} _ { 1 } + \cdots + \eta ^ { k - 1 } \mathfrak{f} _ { k - 1 } \right) \psi _ { 0 }</LATEX> <LATEX>- \eta ^ { k } \int _ { \mathcal{V} } \left( \widetilde { \mathcal{L} } _ { \mathrm { p h y s } } Q _ { \eta , k } \varphi \right) \mathfrak{f} _ { k - 1 } \psi _ { 0 } .</LATEX> (2.28)
f2y8 | In order to construct <LATEX>Q _ { n , k } ,</LATEX> we start from the following formal identity:
o7qm | <LATEX>\left( \mathcal{L} _ { 0 } + \eta \widetilde { \mathcal{L} } _ { \mathrm { p h y s } } \right) ^ { - 1 } = \mathcal{L} _ { 0 } ^ { - 1 } \left( 1 + \eta \widetilde { \mathcal{L} } _ { \mathrm { p h y s } } \mathcal{L} _ { 0 } ^ { - 1 } \right) ^ { - 1 }</LATEX> <LATEX>= \mathcal{L} _ { 0 } ^ { - 1 } \left( 1 - \eta \widetilde { \mathcal{L} } _ { \mathrm { p h y s } } \mathcal{L} _ { 0 } ^ { - 1 } + \cdots + \left( - \eta \right) ^ { k } \left( \widetilde { \mathcal{L} } _ { \mathrm { p h y s } } \mathcal{L} _ { 0 } ^ { - 1 } \right) ^ { k } + \cdots \right) .</LATEX> The previous expansion suggests to introduce an approximate inverse operator, ob- tained by truncating the formal infinite expansion at order <LATEX>\mathrm { O } \left( \eta ^ { k } \right) .</LATEX> It is moreover sufficient to construct a pseudo-inverse on <LATEX>\mathscr{S} _ { 0 } ,</LATEX> which amounts to restricting all the operators using <LATEX>\Pi _ { 0 }</LATEX> on the left and on the right. We therefore introduce
d52l | (2.29)
qlbb | <LATEX>Q _ { \eta , k } = \Pi _ { 0 } \mathcal{L} _ { 0 } ^ { - 1 } \Pi _ { 0 } + \sum _ { n = 1 } ^ { k - 1 } \left( - \eta \right) ^ { n } \Pi _ { 0 } \mathcal{L} _ { 0 } ^ { - 1 } \Pi _ { 0 } \left( \widetilde { \mathcal{L} } _ { \mathrm { p h y s } } \Pi _ { 0 } \mathcal{L} _ { 0 } ^ { - 1 } \Pi _ { 0 } \right) ^ { n } .</LATEX> This operator is well-defined by Assumptions 3 and 4, as it consists of finite com- positions of operators leaving <LATEX>/</LATEX> invariant, so that <LATEX>Q _ { \eta , k } : \mathscr{S} \rightarrow \mathscr{S} _ { 0 } .</LATEX> Note that, by construction,
nhsg | <LATEX>\mathcal{L} _ { \eta } Q _ { \eta , k } = \Pi _ { 0 } + \left( - 1 \right) ^ { k - 1 } \eta ^ { k } \left( \widetilde { \mathcal{L} } _ { \mathrm { p h y s } } \Pi _ { 0 } \mathcal{L} _ { 0 } ^ { - 1 } \Pi _ { 0 } \right) ^ { k } .</LATEX> Equation (2.28) then becomes

qecd | <LATEX>\mathscr{R} _ { \eta , \varphi , k } = \left( - 1 \right) ^ { k } \int _ { \mathcal{X} } \left( \widetilde { \mathcal{L} } _ { \mathrm { p h y s } } \Pi _ { 0 } \mathcal{L} _ { 0 } ^ { - 1 } \Pi _ { 0 } \right) ^ { k } \varphi \psi _ { \eta }</LATEX> <LATEX>+ \int _ { \mathcal{X} } \left( \left( - 1 \right) ^ { k - 1 } \left[ \left( \widetilde { \mathcal{L} } _ { \mathrm { p h y s } } \Pi _ { 0 } \mathcal{L} _ { 0 } ^ { - 1 } \Pi _ { 0 } \right) ^ { k } \varphi \right] \left( 1 + \cdots + \eta ^ { k - 1 } \mathfrak{f} _ { k - 1 } \right) - \left( \widetilde { \mathcal{L} } _ { \mathrm { p h y s } } Q _ { \eta , k } \varphi \right) \mathfrak{f} _ { k - 1 } \right) \psi _ { 0 } .</LATEX> (2.31) Equation (2.30) is the desired result (2.27), since <LATEX>\Pi _ { 0 } \varphi = \varphi</LATEX> for
1o7p | <LATEX>\varphi \in \mathscr{S} _ { 0 } .</LATEX> It remains at this stage to show that the remainder term <LATEX>\mathscr{R} _ { \eta , \varphi , k }</LATEX> is uniformly bounded. We introduce, for notational convenience, the operator <LATEX>\mathcal{A} = \widetilde { \mathcal{L} } _ { \mathrm { p h y s } } \Pi _ { 0 } \mathcal{L} _ { 0 } ^ { - 1 } \Pi _ { 0 } .</LATEX> Since <LATEX>\varphi \in \mathscr{S} ,</LATEX> it holds that <LATEX>\mathcal{A} ^ { k } \varphi \in \mathscr{S}</LATEX> by Assumptions 3 and 4. By Assumption 2, there exists <LATEX>m _ { k } \in \mathbb{N}</LATEX> such that
cp13 | <LATEX>\forall | \eta | \leqslant \eta _ { * } , \quad | \int _ { \mathcal{X} } \mathcal{A} ^ { k - 1 } \varphi \psi _ { \eta } | \leqslant \| \mathcal{A} ^ { k - 1 } \varphi \| _ { B _ { m _ { k } } ^ { \infty } } \int _ { \mathcal{X} } \mathcal{K} _ { m _ { k } } \psi _ { \eta }</LATEX> <LATEX>\leqslant \| \mathcal{A} ^ { k - 1 } \varphi \| _ { B _ { m _ { k } } ^ { \infty } } \| \mathcal{K} _ { m _ { k } } \| _ { L ^ { 2 } \left( \psi _ { \eta } \right) } .</LATEX> (2.32)
bgre | The latter quantity is uniformly bounded in <LATEX>\eta</LATEX> in view of (2.5), with a bound depending only on <LATEX>\eta _ { * } ,</LATEX> <LATEX>\varphi</LATEX> and k.
57lp | A similar uniform bound can be found for the second integral in (2.31), since all the functions which appear in the integral belong to some space <LATEX>B _ { m _ { k } } ^ { \infty } ,</LATEX> upon possibly increasing <LATEX>m _ { k } .</LATEX> Indeed, since <LATEX>\mathfrak{f} _ { i } \in \mathscr{S}</LATEX> for any <LATEX>1 \leqslant i \leqslant k - 1 ,</LATEX> there exist <LATEX>m _ { k ^ { \prime } } \geqslant 1</LATEX> such that
