This severed internal relationship with the self needs to be restored so that the person can go on to trust and value themselves, as well as begin to trust others again. When this type of healing has yet to occur, people functioning from the fearful-avoidant attachment style will tend to see themselves as broken and unworthy and will expect that others are untrustworthy or will only hurt them in the end. In more extreme cases, this attachment style is associated with high relationship turmoil, dissatisfaction and toxicity, self-destructive behaviors, relationship abuse, mental illness and addictions.\nn91l | Diane Poole Heller makes two important distinctions in regard to this attachment style. The first is that the expression of this style can either look more dismissive and withdrawing or more anxious, clingy and pursuing. Heller refers to these two variations as either being more disorganized avoidant or disorganized anxious. In my own practice, I make a distinction between the internal fearful-avoidant and the external fearful-avoidant. In the category of internal fearful-avoidant, we find people who, when under stress or threat, are triggered into higher anxiety and have the internal disorganized experience of wanting connection and wanting to move closer to someone, yet simultaneously feeling an inner pull back, believing the connection to be unsafe. However, such people do not act this dynamic out in ways that are destructive to themselves or others. The experience is more internally disruptive than externally damaging.\niknb | Other people express the experience of having one foot on the gas and the other on the brake in a relationship in a much more external and reactive way. These people react externally in ways that are confusing, contradictory or harmful. The distinction between internal and external fearful-avoidant might be a difference in degree or severity within this attachment style, or it might also be two different stages in healing. A person with a fearful-avoidant attachment style who has been engaging in healing work that is moving them towards more secure functioning may initially develop less external reactivity while still experiencing an inner \"push/pull\" dynamic. The process of resolving their trauma may have enabled them to now choose differently with how they externally respond.\n3ohm | The second important distinction that Heller makes is that we can have a chronically disorganized style that functions as a primary attachment style, or more of a situational disorganized style. In the situational kind, someone might be more consistently secure, dismissive or preoccupied in their attachment style, but in certain situations or under the influence of certain triggers, they get activated into a temporary disorganized state. Once the stressor or situation resolves, they then return to their other, more dominant style.\nenn6 | Since people with the fearful-avoidant style experience both attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance, see which of the above statements for the dismissive and preoccupied styles also describe your experience. Some statements that someone with a fearful-avoidant style might make are:\nvoir | I often don't feel safe or fully trusting in relationships, even if my partner acts in safe and trustworthy ways.\nbxm5 | I frequently get triggered by things that may seem to come out of nowhere.\n6cnd | I genuinely want intimacy and closeness but I can experience episodes of fearful overwhelm when intimacy with a partner increases.\nz41z | When in conflict, I can vacillate from being overwhelmed or aggressive to being dismissive and numb.\nk1hn | I can vacillate between different types of chaos or rigidity.\n853d | When in distress I have acted in ways that have been harmful to myself or my partners.\npx3f | I often expect that the worst will happen in a relationship, even when things are going well.\n28wa | I have elaborate negative fantasies about what will go wrong or how my partner will inevitably hurt me beyond repair, even if things are mostly going well.\n1jce | Being in a relationship can cause me to become dysregulated, dissociative or confused.\njfbn | There are times when I look fine on the outside, but I am actually a complete tsunami on the inside.\ncn1a | I frequently experience the conflicting internal drives of wanting to be close\n0j5u | and share myself but fearing that closeness or vulnerability will be dangerous or cause the relationship to end.\nu6dp | Parental Interactions\nhnb4 | Protective\na0sw | Emotionally available\naak4 | Responsive\n7l7y | Attuned\np1kn | Unavailable\n49ym | Unresponsive\nabvj | Imperceptive or mis-attuned\nk4xq | Rejecting\nok5a | Inconsistently responsive, available or attuned\n2ngm | Intrusive\nmtp1 | Acting out of their needs for attention or affection over the child's needs\n171k | Frightening\ngugp | Threatening\naxri | Frightened\niqve | Disorienting\no7st | Alarming\njsfl | fearful-avoidant style might initially test as being one of the other insecure styles). Gender differences have not been found between the different styles.\n0px6 | An important takeaway from this overview of attachment theory is the importance of securely attaching to others who will care for us. This is our first survival strategy because without the loving and attentive presence from others we would die. Accordingly, emotional attunement and connection are wired into us as basic human needs that persist through life. Depending on the environment and circumstance that we were born into and how well our parents were able to meet our attachment needs we will either develop a secure attachment style, where we feel safe to be with our caretakers and explore the world beyond them, or we will develop an insecure attachment style. Insecure attachment can take the form of overly pulling into ourselves to avoid and withdraw, overly turning outward to others to grasp and procure, or vacillating between the two. These insecure attachment styles are secondary survival strategies that make sense based on what we went through as a child and will continue to impact how we attach and bond in our adult romantic relationships. Here I invite you to reflect on your own personal attachment history, what style or styles you experienced with your different attachment figures and how this relates to the attachment behaviors you have exhibited in your adult romantic relationships.\n9n3l | CHAPTER TWO THE DIFFERENT DIMENSIONS OF ATTACHMENT\n09gz | MOST ATTACHMENT RESEARCHERS base their work on the idea of categorizing people under one of four specific types: secure, preoccupied, dismissive or fearful-avoidant. More recently, however, some researchers have proposed that attachment is better described using the two dimensions of attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance, and looking at the different ways these dimensions can interact. They place each of these dimensions along an axis from high to low, and then cross the axes to form a diagram with four quadrants. While this model still produces the same four basic types, it lets us see a few things in more nuanced ways based on how far along each axis we find ourselves. Not every person with a preoccupied attachment style is exactly the same, for instance. It also helps show the common ground between the different types; for example, both the fearful and the dismissive attachment styles share a higher level of emotional avoidance. This model can help us better understand how we might be able to move the needle on our own emotional tendencies when they're not serving us well.\npppg | Being high in the attachment anxiety dimension relates to increased fears of being rejected, neglected, abandoned or separated from an attachment figure. Being low in attachment anxiety relates to being less fearful or preoccupied that such things will occur. Attachment avoidance is the dimension that relates to how comfortable or uncomfortable a person feels when it comes to being close, intimate or reliant on a partner. Stated more positively, low attachment avoidance refers to being more comfortable with intimacy, closeness and reliance on a partner and being more likely to approach and engage with a partner.\nclpf | Low Avoidance\nish5 | Preoccupied\ngazp | Secure\nospq | Low Anxiety\nl6fu | High Anxiety\n031c | Fearful\ngrg5 | Dismissive\n0n4f | High Avoidance\nwbhc | The four different attachment styles relate to where people land on these two dimensions.\nkqsp | When someone is low in attachment anxiety and low in attachment avoidance, they are in the secure attachment zone.",
