Ascribed demographics included age (in years), gender zero equals female, one equals male, and ethnicity zero equals non-White, one equals White. Achieved demographics included education\ng3tm | zero equals no college, one equals at least some college, group tenure (number of years in the group), and job status zero equals support staff, one equals manager or professional.\ntfra | Analyses\n5lm9 | To assess the amount of incremental variance explained by each type of antecedent, we analyzed data with hierarchical regression. First we entered the control variables (firm type, firm size, age, gender, ethnicity, education, group tenure, job status). Consistent with the work on contextual analysis, we entered the individual-level predictors (satisfaction with the group and global self-esteem) prior to the group-level predictors (group size and style of management). Given the past emphasis on satisfaction as an antecedent of voice, we entered satisfaction prior to self-esteem. In the final step, we entered the product terms for each interaction. We assessed the significance of each step with the delta F and evaluated individual parameters at each step with t values. We plotted significant interactions using median splits.\nwp2c | Results\nus5v | Descriptive statistics and intercorrelations are reported in Table one, and results for the hierarchical regression analysis are summarized in Table two. Overall, our model explained seventeen percent (fourteen percent adjusted) of the variance in voice behavior assessed six months later,\nrs2m | F left parenthesis sixteen, four hundred twenty-four right parenthesis equals five point four one, P is less than point zero zero one. As a block, the control variables explained seven percent of the variance in voice behavior six months later, F left parenthesis eight, four hundred thirty-two right parenthesis equals three point nine nine, P is less than point zero zero one, and several of the control variable terms were significant. Individuals in nonmanufacturing firms engaged in significantly more voice than individuals in manufacturing firms. Men, Whites, and those with at least some college experience engaged in more voice than women, non-Whites, and those with no college experience.\nuz9y | Satisfaction with the group explained an additional three percent of the variance in voice behavior six months later, delta F left parenthesis one, four hundred thirty-one right parenthesis equals sixteen point seven three, P is less than point zero zero one, providing support for Hypothesis one. As expected, group members who were more satisfied with the group engaged in more voice than group members who were less satisfied with their group.\n8ov0 | Global self-esteem explained an additional one percent of the variance in voice behavior six months later over and above the variance accounted for by satisfaction with the work group and the controls; however, this relationship was only marginally significant, delta F left parenthesis one, four hundred thirty right parenthesis equals two point eight zero, P is less than point one zero. Consistent with Hypothesis two, group members with higher levels of global self-esteem engaged in more voice than group members with lower self-esteem.\nmj9m | As a block, the situational factors explained three percent of the variance in voice behavior six months later over and above that explained by the controls, satisfaction with the group,\n94h3 | Descriptive N equals four hundred forty-one Statistics and Intercorrelations\n9jx1 | One.

Consistent with Hypothesis three, individuals in small groups engaged in more voice than individuals in large groups. Consistent with Hypothesis four, individuals in self-managed groups exhibited more voice behavior than individuals in traditionally managed groups.\nseik | Finally, the block of interactions explained three percent of the variance in voice behavior six months later, A F left parenthesis four, four hundred twenty-four right parenthesis equals three point five six, p is less than point zero one. Table two shows that both of the self-esteem-situation interactions reached significance. Figure one illustrates the global self-esteem-group size interaction. Consistent with Hypothesis five A, the negative relationship between group size and voice was stronger for individuals with low self-esteem than for those with high self-esteem. Figure two shows the global self-esteem and style of management interaction. As predicted by Hypothesis five B, the positive relationship between self-management and voice was stronger for individuals with low self-esteem than for individuals with high self-esteem.\noq7c | Although Table two shows that both of the satisfaction-situation interactions reached statistical significance, the plots illustrated in Figures three and four did not support Hypotheses six A and six B. Whereas we expected stronger relationships between the situational factors (group size and style of management) for individuals with low levels of satis-\nz4mi | faction, the plots indicated stronger relationships for individuals who were highly satisfied with their group. Spe-\nhkft | cifically, Figure three illustrates the stronger negative relationship between group size and voice for individuals who were more satisfied with the group and Figure four depicts the stronger positive relationship between self-management and voice for individuals who were more satisfied with their group.\njai3 | Discussion\np57i | Given the increasing prevalence of work groups and the need for flexibility, adaptation, and innovation, voice behavior is an important concept that merits increased research attention. Although some studies have examined voice on the basis of Hirschman's model of exit, voice, and loyalty, past research had weak explanatory power. This difficulty stems\n```",
