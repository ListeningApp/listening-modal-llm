Apart from the above base version, we\n2gnm | Ninety-seven further explored the behavioural performance of ChatGPT with the following modifications of the Ninety-eight task presented in Figure three:\nemgw | Ninety-nine. We added three quad dash six noise symbols to the input on every trial to examine the LLM's behaviour when to make it impossible to get the correct answer by simply doing string match between stimulus inputs.\nxaqt | One hundred two. In human behavioural studies, a common strategy to improve participants' performance is to One hundred three provide feedback after each trial. Here in the task, after the LLM provided a response One hundred four for the previous trial, we added feedback on whether its response was correct or wrong One hundred five alongside the stimulus input of the current trial.\n5rcb | One hundred six. Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has proved helpful in eliciting reasoning in LLMs. Here we instructed the LLM to think step by step when giving a response.\n524j | One hundred eight. Three point two Spatial n-back experiments\nxd3m | One hundred nine. Although in its very nature, LLMs are text-based, but at least one study has demonstrated that they One hundred ten have spatial reasoning abilities. To build on this promising trail and further examine the spatial working memory of ChatGPT. In the base version of the spatial n-back task, we constructed a three by three One hundred eleven\n8qb6 | One hundred twelve grid using ASCII characters (see Table two for detailed prompts). For n equals one, two, three respectively, we\nwkbn | One hundred thirteen generated fifty blocks of grid sequences each featuring a letter X in one of the nine positions. Note that\nftfg | One hundred fourteen the letter X here was arbitrarily chosen to represent an occupied spatial location textually and could One hundred fifteen be substituted by any other letter or symbol. Each block contains twenty-four grids, including eight match trials\n7xi5 | One hundred seventeen on match trials and \"-\" on nonmatch trials. We further explored the spatial working memory capacity\nw8r5 | One hundred eighteen of ChatGPT with the following modifications of the task:\nybik | One hundred nineteen. As in the variants of verbal n n-back tasks, we also have \"spatial-with-noise\", \"spatial-with-feedback\", and \"spatial-with-CoT-reasoning\" versions of the task. The prompts for the One hundred twenty-one the with-feedback and with-reasoning versions were basically the same as those for the\ngii5 | One hundred twenty-two corresponding verbal tasks (see Table one). For the spatial-with-noise version, we added a noise character (chosen from number sign dollar percent ampersand at tilde) to one to three unoccupied locations in the three by three grid\nq5eu | One hundred twenty-four on every trial. This is a first step to examine the LLM's spatial working memory when it One hundred twenty-five was not able to get the correct answer by simply doing string match.\na7ao | One hundred twenty-six. To further confirm that the LLM can really reason in a spatial way rather than trivially One hundred twenty-seven performing some kind of string match under the hood, we further introduced two variants One hundred twenty-eight that specifically require abstract spatial reasoning; a model that would otherwise simply One hundred twenty-nine match strings would have failed. To achieve so, in these two tasks, a match is defined as One hundred thirty when the location of the letter X is in the same row or column as the X n trials ago. The One hundred thirty-one difference is whether identical locations also count as a match. We expect the version One hundred thirty-two excluding identical locations to be harder for the LLM to perform.",
