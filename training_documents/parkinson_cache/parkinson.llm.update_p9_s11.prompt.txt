You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

epyi | Role in Mitophagy and Beyond. Under physiological conditions, autophagy plays a crucial role in clearing unwanted proteins, as well as damaged mitochondria through a targeted mechanism called mitophagy (Nguyen et al. 2016). Loss-of-function mutations in PINK1 and Parkin (PARK2 and PARK6), result in recessively-inherited early-onset PD and significantly, both genes were discovered to be essential for mitophagy (Kitada et al. 1998; Valente et al. 2004; Mori et al. 1998). PINK1 is a serine/threonine protein kinase that acts as a surveillance molecule for mitochondrial health and accumulates on the outer membrane of abnormal mitochondria (Nguyen et al. 2016). PINK1 attracts recruitment of Parkin to damaged mitochondria, which through its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity (Kane et al. 2014; Narendra et al. 2010), coats the mitochondria with ubiquitin triggering autophagosomes to engulf the mitochondria (Narendra et al. 2008), culminating in lysosomal degradation (Figure 1A, C). Discoveries of PINK1 and Parkin mutations were the first genes to shed

x95m | light on the direct involvement of autophagy and E-L system in PD pathogenesis (Pickrell & Youle 2015). These observations also helped in validating previous neurotoxic studies (Przedborski et al. 2004) which identified mitochondrial dysfunction as one of the primary causes of neurodegeneration. Though the symptoms are indistinguishable from sporadic cases, several studies on brains of PD patients with Parkin mutations do not show a- synuclein aggregation and Lewy body pathology (Doherty & Hardy 2013). Only one report suggests PINK1-linked parkinsonism to be associated with Lewy pathology (Samaranch et al. 2010). This prompts us to speculate if there are alternative neuropathological cascades in PD that are a-synuclein independent but centered around the E-L system. In addition to their well-defined roles in mitophagy, Parkin was identified to modulate E-L system through Rab7 ubiquitination (Song et al. 2016), whereas PINK1 phosphorylates some Rab proteins (Lai et al. 2015). It is also worth noting that several of these rab proteins (for example Rab7) regulate mitochondrial dynamics and quality control independent of Parkin/PINK1 (Wang et al., 2018). Parkin mutations are also known to directly affect retromer recruitment (Williams et al. 2018) and interact strongly with VPS35 by ubiquinating it (Martinez et al. 2017; Malik et al. 2015). Parkin binds to endophilin A and functions in its ubiquitination (Cao et al. 2014). Parkin also ubiquitinates EPS15 to regulate epidermal growth factor receptors and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI(3)K)-Akt signalling that plays a role in neuronal survival (Fallon et al. 2006). These developments suggest mitophagy-independent routes these proteins may take towards PD. Further investigations of Parkin and PINK1 in this direction might provide crucial insights in understanding neurodegenerative mechanisms that are Lewy-body independent.
yfum | a-Synuclein aggregates initially in presynaptic termini, where the protein is enriched (Kramer & Schulz-Schaeffer 2007). a-Synuclein aggregates are a major target for autophagy-mediated degradation (Xilouri et al. 2008). In both genetic and sporadic PD, aggregated a-synuclein is likely to enhance autophagosome formation to meet the higher demand for its degradation (Wong & Holzbaur 2015). Once threshold reaches beyond compensatory limits, mutant/overexpressed a-synuclein starts to accumulate, turning detrimental to cellular homeostasis. In fact, A53T and A30P a-synuclein mutants blocked their own uptake and other substrates by lysosomes for degradation through the chaperone- mediated autophagy pathway in vitro (Cuervo et al. 2004). Dopamine-modified a-synuclein is identified to further exacerbate this process, which may explain the selective vulnerability of dopaminergic neurons in PD (Martinez-Vicente et al. 2008). A recent study on mammalian cells and transgenic mice shows that a-synuclein overexpression mediated autophagy defects are exerted through Rab1a inhibition (Winslow et al. 2010). Further understanding of the mechanisms for a-synuclein-autophagy crosstalk in PD might have crucial therapeutic applications. Backing this notion, both in vitro and in vivo studies show that enhancing autophagy and autophagosome-lysosome fusion could ameliorate PD-like features by clearing aggregated a-synuclein (Suresh et al. 2017; Suresh et al. 2018a).
ppx4 | Several other PD causing genes associated with the E-L system exert their pathological effects through impairing synaptic autophagy. The R258Q SynJ1 mutation directly affects autophagosome biogenesis and maturation at synaptic terminals of flies and neurites of
qf11 | human iPSC derived neurons. The observation of dopaminergic neuronal loss in these flies suggests autophagosome generation defects as one of the possible mechanisms through which SynJ1 mutations lead to dopaminergic neurodegeneration and PD (Vanhauwaert et al. 2017). Presynaptic endocytic membrane bending protein endophilin A also has functions in providing docking sites for autophagy proteins and facilitating autophagosome expansion. This is achieved by phosphorylation of endophilin A-BAR domain by LRRK2, as noted in a fly model (Soukup & Verstreken 2017). Congruent to these observations, mice lacking endophilin A revealed deficiency in autophagosome formation and developed a Parkinsonian phenotype (Murdoch et al. 2016). These studies, along with recent finding of clathrin involvement in autophagy regulation (Rong et al. 2012), suggest a cooperative crosstalk between SV endocytosis and autophagy.
8oqt | Macromolecules and organelles in the presynaptic terminal travel a long distance from the soma, making them old and vulnerable. Rapid turnover of proteins, membranes, receptors, and vesicles in the pre-synapse assigns autophagy a major role in maintaining synaptic homeostasis. This tasks synaptic autophagy with quality control responsibilities. Though there is compelling evidence that compromised autophagy contributes to PD, these studies primarily looked at the soma from a proteinopathy or mitophagy perspective (Lynch-Day et al. 2012). Selective inactivation of autophagy by conditional knockout of autophagy protein atg7 in dopaminergic neurons leads to enhanced dopamine release and rapid presynaptic recovery with abnormal axonal profiles (Hernandez et al. 2012). Conversely, autophagy enhancement through mTOR inhibition slows dopamine release, reduces the number of synaptic vesicles, and increases autophagosome density in the axons (Hernandez et al. 2012). These results emphasize the importance of synaptic autophagy in normal dopamine transmission and further evaluation is warranted to understand if additional synaptic autophagy defects exist, which may lead to PD pathogenesis.
