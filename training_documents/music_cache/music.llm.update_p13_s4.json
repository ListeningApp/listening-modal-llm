        "content": "4exe | The land of conjecture, however, is so extensive and unappropriated, that every new cultivator has a right to break up fresh ground, or to seize upon any spot that has long lain fallow, without the sanction of a grant from anyone who may arrogate to himself the sovereignty of the whole, or of any neglected part of it. But though no one has an exclusive right to these imaginary regions, yet the public has a just power of censuring the methods of improvement adopted by any new inhabitant, and of condemning such productions as may be deemed unfit for use.\n0myz | The opinions of mankind seldom agree, concerning the most common and obvious things; and consequently will be still less likely to coincide about others, that are reducible to no standard of truth or excellence, but are subject to the lawless control of every individual who shall think fit to condemn them, either with, or without understanding them.\nxh3i | Dr. Johnson has well said, that \"those who think they have done much, see but little to do;\" and with respect to ancient music, I believe those who have taken the greatest pains to investigate the subject, are least satisfied with the success of their labours.\nsyiw | What the ancient music really was, it is not easy to determine; the whole is now become a matter of faith; but of this we are certain, that it was something with which mankind was extremely delighted: for not only the poets, but the historians and philosophers of the best ages of Greece and Rome, are as diffuse in its praises as of those arts concerning which sufficient remains are come down to us, to evince the truth of their panegyrics. And so great was the sensibility of the ancient Greeks, and so accentuated and refined their language, that they seem to have been, in both respects, to the rest of the world, what the modern Italians are at present; for of these last, the language itself is music, and their ears are so polished and accustomed to sweet sounds, that they are rendered fastidious judges of melody, both by habit and education.\nkg3t | But as to the superior or inferior degree of excellence in the ancient music, compared with the modern, it is now as impossible to determine, as it is to hear both sides.\nlvae | A GENERAL HISTORY OF MUSIC\no9sc | Indeed it is so entirely lost, that the study of it is become as unprofitable as learning a dead language, in which there are no books; and yet this study has given rise to so much pedantry, and to such an ambition in modern musical authors, to be thought well versed in the writings of the ancients upon music, that their treatises are rendered both disgusting and unintelligible by it. Words only are come down to us without things. We have so few remains of ancient music by which to illustrate its rules, that we cannot, as in painting, poetry, sculpture, or architecture, judge of it, or profit by examples; and to several of these terms which are crammed into our books, we are utterly unable to affix any precise or useful meaning. To write, therefore, in favour of ancient music now, is like the emperor Julian's defending paganism, when mankind had given it up as indefensible, and had attached themselves to another religion.\n121u | However, it is, perhaps, a fortunate circumstance for modern music that the ancient is lost, as it might not have suited the genius of our language, and might have tied us down to precedent; as the writers of modern Latin never dare hazard a single thought or expression without classical authority.\nzh03 | The subject itself of ancient music is so dark, and writers concerning it are so discordant in their opinions, that every intelligent reader who finds how little there is to be known, has reason to lament that there still remains so much to be said. Indeed, I should have been glad to have waived all discussion about it: for, to say the truth, the study of ancient music is now become the business of an antiquary more than of a musician. But in every history of music extant, in other languages, the practice had been so constant for the author to make a display of what he knew, and what he did not know concerning ancient music, that it seemed absolutely necessary for me to say something about it, if it were only to prove, that if I have not been more successful in my enquiries than my predecessors, I have not been less diligent. And it appeared likewise necessary, before I attempted a history of ancient Greek music, to endeavor to investigate its properties, or at least to tell the little I knew of it, and ingenuously to confess my ignorance and doubts about the rest.\n1mvw | Indeed it was once my intention to begin my history with the invention of the present musical scale and counterpoint; for\n6d4s | \"What can we reason, but from what we know?\"\nmqah | But it was impossible to read a great number of books upon the subject, without meeting with conjectures, and it was not easy to peruse these, without forming others of my own. If those which I have hazarded should throw any light upon the subject, it will enable my readers to travel through the dark maze of enquiry with more facility, and consequently less disgust; and if I fail in my researches, and leave both the subject and them where I found them, as the expectation which I encourage is but small, so it is hoped will be their disappointment. For with respect to all I\nxxr8 | PREFACE\nrl4j | have to say, I must confess that the Spanish motto, adopted by Francis le Vayer, is wholly applicable.\nvz32 | De las cosas mas seguras La mas seguras es dudar.\nncb0 | In wading through innumerable volumes, with promising titles, and submitting to the drudgery of all such reading as was never read, I frequently found that those who were most diffuse upon the subject, knew least of the matter; and that technical jargon, and unintelligible pedantry so loaded each page, that not an eligible thought could be found, in exploring thousands of them. Indeed my researches were sometimes so unsuccessful, that I seemed to resemble a wretch in the street, raking the kennels for an old rusty nail. However, the ardour of enquiry was now and then revived by congenial ideas, and by gleams of light emitted from penetration and intelligence; and these will be gratefully acknowledged, whenever they afford assistance.\n8mp0 | There are already more profound books on the subject of ancient, as well as modern music, than have ever been read; it was time to try to treat it in such a manner as was likely to engage the attention of those that are unable, or unwilling, to read treatises written, for the most part, by persons who were more ambitious of appearing learned themselves, than of making others so. Indeed, I have long since found it necessary to read with caution the splendid assertions of writers concerning music, till I was convinced of their knowledge of the subject; for I have frequently detected ancients as well as moderns, whose fame sets them almost above censure, of utter ignorance in this particular, while they have thought it necessary to talk about it. Apuleius, Pausanias, and Athenaeus, among the ancients, were certainly musicians; but it is not so evident that Cicero, Horace, and others, who have interspersed many passages concerning music in their works, understood the subject any more than our Addison, Pope, and Swift. Among these, the two first have written odes on St. Cecilia's day, in which they manifest the entire separation of music and poetry, and show the possibility of writing well on what is neither felt nor understood. For Pope, who received not the least pleasure from music himself, by the help of his friends, was enabled to describe its power with all the rapture and sublimity of a great genius, music-mad. This appears not only in his Ode of St. Cecilia, but in speaking of Handel, in the Dunciad.",
