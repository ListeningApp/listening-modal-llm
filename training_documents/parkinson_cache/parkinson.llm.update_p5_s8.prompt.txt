You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021.

ywxn | 2. E-L system dysfunction: the holy grail of PD pathophysiology?
uxhs | soma for lysosomal degradation (Figure 1B) (Yang et al. 2013). Here, long-distance axonal microtubule networks provide significant support to the neuronal E-L system (Yang et al. 2013). These spatial challenges to address a unique structural geometry, high metabolic demand, enhanced responsiveness to chemical/electrical stimulation, and the requirement for longevity due to their postmitotic nature, place a tremendous burden on the E-L system. Nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons have an additional burden in terms of long and highly branched axons, larger surface area, selective transporters for external toxins, large fluctuations in free Ca2+, less buffering capacity, and higher oxidative stress, reducing their threshold for degeneration (Surmeier et al. 2017; Vidyadhara et al. 2019; Vidyadhara et al. 2016; Vidyadhara et al. 2017). These vulnerabilities are further exacerbated with aging. Faced with environmental and genetic risk factors, disease pathogenesis abounds.
ed6e | In 1997, identification of dominant mutations in the a-synuclein (SNCA) gene (PARK1) which encodes a-synuclein as a cause of familial PD (Polymeropoulos et al. 1997), brought a conceptual shift toward the importance of genetics in disease pathogenesis. Subsequent findings revealed various other genetic mutations, with at least 10-15% of PD patients having familial PD of an absolute genetic origin. Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2, PARK8) and Parkin (PRKN, PARK2) mutations are the most common genetic variants of dominant and recessively inherited PD, respectively (Deng et al. 2018). Mutations and gene multiplications of SNCA (PARK1 and PARK4) (Chartier-Harlin et al. 2004; Singleton et al. 2003) and Glucosidase Beta Acid (GBA) are also highly prevalent, whereas PD pathology was also noted with abnormal forms of Parkinsonism associated with deglycase or DJ1 (PARK7), and PTEN induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1, PARK6) (Deng et al. 2018). There is also compelling evidence for a genetic component to sporadic PD. In fact, a rigid distinction between the genetic and environmental basis of PD pathogenesis may not exist considering that cases are phenotypically indistinguishable (except for the onset) (Baba et al. 2006), implying genetic and sporadic cases share common underlying mechanisms. Even after considerable studies on these familial mutations and their interaction with environment, the core pathomechanisms of PD are still unclear, limiting treatment strategies. Over the past ten years, advancements in high-throughput sequencing, the application of genome wide association studies (GWAS), and meta-analysis, have identified new genetic mutations (refer to Deng et al. 2018 for a list of all PARK genes and risk alleles). Intriguingly, most of these identified genes have links to the E-L system (refer Table 1). Mechanistic studies also suggest that these proteins are the downstream targets of previously identified broad spectrum dysfunction in a-synuclein and LRRK2 mutations. It is now becoming clear that most PD-linked genes (Table 1) and known pathomechanisms are, in one way or another, associated with the E-L system, strongly suggesting this pathway as the key master regulator of PD pathogenesis. Recent studies suggest that neurodegeneration is initiated at the dopaminergic presynaptic terminals of striatum, years before the clinical diagnosis (Imbriani et al. 2018). Evidence that most of the E-L system genes associated with PD function at this terminal further establishes their fundamental role in PD pathogenesis. Below, we discuss our understanding of the known functions of these E-L system genes and their dysfunction in PD. We also discuss how other key PD-associated proteins target E-L pathways.
6qqm | 3. Clathrin-mediated synaptic vesicle endocytosis: A prime target?
onum | 3.1 The DNAJ family of heat shock proteins in the presynaptic terminal and beyond:
3iir | SV endocytosis is predominantly mediated through CME (Figure 1C). Following exocytosis, the SV membrane is endocytosed primarily through CME, which involves formation of a clathrin coat, composed of an outer clathrin layer and an inner layer of adaptors (Saheki & De Camilli 2012). The most common adaptors such as AP-2 and AP180 binds to endocytic motifs on the SV membrane, as well as phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P2] present in the plasma membrane. Endophilin A1 and a-synuclein drive membrane bending and curvature formation of the developing clathrin coated pit (Westphal & Chandra 2013; Bai et al. 2010). Following this, the clathrin coated pit in conjunction with dynamin and other accessory proteins undergoes membrane fission to form a CCV (Saheki & De Camilli 2012). Regeneration of SVs from CCVs and recycling of clathrin and related coat components for further endocytosis requires un-coating of clathrin from CCVs (Figure 1C). The clathrin uncoating step is carried out by the coordinated action of the PI phosphatase synaptojanin-1 and the co-chaperone auxilin with Hsc70. Endophilin A1 and cyclin G Associated Kinase (GAK) also regulate clathrin uncoating to facilitate CME at the presynaptic terminal (Figure 1C) (Saheki & De Camilli 2012). Mutations of these E-L system genes in familial PD envisage synaptic endocytosis dysfunction as a prime trigger for PD pathogenesis.
7a0a | Auxilin: DNAJC6 gene encodes auxilin, the major presynaptic endocytic protein linked to PD. Auxilin is a brain specific co-chaperone belonging to the DNAJC family (Table 1), a subclass of heat shock proteins (HSP40). Auxilin plays an important role in clathrin un- coating, recruiting ATP-activated Hsc70 to CCVs, which in turn, disassembles clathrin from vesicles facilitating their recycling (Gorenberg & Chandra 2017; Lemmon 2001) (Figure 1C). Loss-of-function autosomal recessive mutations of auxilin (PARK19) have been shown to cause juvenile/early onset PD, first observed in two teenage brothers of a Palestinian family (Edvardson et al. 2012). The study noted abnormal mRNA splicing and a decrease in auxilin mRNA levels. Other variants of auxilin mutations were later noted in a Brazilian family with similar mis-splicing of mRNA, whereas mutations affecting the J-domain (p.Q791*, p.Q846* and p.R927G) were observed in a few other consanguineous families (Koroglu et al. 2013; Olgiati et al. 2016). Along with typical PD symptoms, patients with nonsense mutations have cognitive impairment, one of the cardinal non-motor symptoms of PD. Epilepsy and mental retardation have also been noted for some PD patients with auxilin mutations (Koroglu et al. 2013). These human genetic studies suggest widespread neuronal dysfunction besides nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurodegeneration. Hence, future studies on post-mortem brains documenting PD-typical Lewy body pathology and dopaminergic neuronal loss are necessary to concretely categorize the pathology as PD or parkinsonism.
