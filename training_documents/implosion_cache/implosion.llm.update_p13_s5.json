How can they be defined or limited?\nkg3t | Now with resources and research tools at hand, try to answer more questions. If possible keep track of where the answers are and where they are not. Note which answers turn out to be harder to get than you anticipated. Perhaps some statistics you assumed were regularly collected have not been for decades. Perhaps they were never collected because no one was interested, or they were specifically not interested.\nlvae | Who controls these answers-what persons, institutions, databases, experts, disciplines? Each answer is also an implosion with its own dimensions: the history of its coming to be posed, the disciplinary formations that made it askable in the first place, the material infrastructure that made it visible, and the archive that preserved it. Archaeology of Knowledge is exemplary in analyzing this process for every question and answer:\no9sc | Who is speaking? Who, among the totality of speaking individuals is accorded the right to use this sort of language? . . . it involves a system of differentiation and relations with other individuals . . . medical statements cannot come from anybody. . .. We must also describe the institutional sites from which the doctor makes his discourse, and from which the discourse derives its legitimate source and point of application. . . . And the positions of the subject defined by situations: questioning subject, listening subject, seeing subject, observing subject.\n121u | emphasizes seeing each statement you discover as part of a material archive: it has survived its initial production and been transformed and preserved so that you could find it. Your task is to attend to the specific archives about the implosion you are studying as a way of thinking about how they are connected to it.\nzh03 | The task consists of not \"treating discourses as groups of signs but as practices that systematically form the objects of which they speak. Of course discourses are composed of signs, but what they do is more than use these signs to designate things. It is this more that renders them irreducible to language and to speech. It is this 'more' that we must reveal and describe.\"\n1mvw | In work, the archives are active participants in the implosions she studies; they are often appendages (e.g., Rockefeller) of the institutional missions that produced the implosions, and the archives are often part of the mission itself. The Smithsonian Institution's mission to archive itself helps shape the collecting projects that generate animal knowledge and types.\n6d4s | As you answer your questions, you can start to see the contours of knowledge and attention that maybe help explain how you came to know and not know. As puts it, \"Discourses are not just 'words'; they are material-semiotic practices through which objects of attention and knowing subjects are both constituted.\" This notion of how our world can \"bend our attention and warp our certainties\" and sometimes productively be called ideology if we use it to see how materially specific it is and how productive it is in giving us some stories to tell, even while disabling others.\nmqah | Twist Four: Exhaustion-Isn't this Incredibly Messy and Time Consuming?\nxxr8 | I cannot follow here each of my stem cells, much less the much larger set that would be needed for the excessive account of technoscience that I crave. But I try to work out at least some of the knots.\nrl4j | The reaction many of my students have to the messiness and overwhelming data this process generates itself requires examination. Do we think that stories of objects and facts and practices should be straightforward and not imploded? How much do we value efficiency and condensation over partial connections, extra\nvz32 | accountability, and more homework? Why have we been shaped so that we know the things we do and are ignorant to various degrees about so much else?\nncb0 | The process so far has been diagnostic. If you are seriously considering a topic for a research project or, cyborg forbid, a dissertation, and you get sick or bored of it after a week of imploding it, then you definitely need a different topic. The implosion process is designed to daunt and to lure. If you already know your story, then you will do no more than repeat common sense. Ideally the process will reveal connections that you did not know and that you did not know you cared about. Thicker weaves of dependence, accountability, and care are part of the result of this process. \"Commitment after the implosions of technoscience requires immersion in the work of materializing new tropes in an always contingent practice of grounding or worlding.\"\n8mp0 | Teaching Implosion\n```",
