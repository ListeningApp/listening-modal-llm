The fields of one,two,three-triazole application are described in numerous recent reviews. The main trends are bioorthogonal chemistry, organic synthesis, creation of new ligands and complexes and using the latter as catalysts, construction of functionalized macromolecules and polymeric materials, modified nanoparticles, sensors, blocks for energetic materials, the use in medicinal chemistry for the search of new biologically active compounds, and as approved medicines.\nixcc | Such a broad application of triazoles is a result of not only their functionality but also their synthetic accessibility. Among the synthetic approaches toward one,two,three-triazoles, four general directions could be stressed: metal-catalyzed alkyne-azide cycloaddition including mostly Copper-catalyzed P equals two four, equals two five and Ruthenium-catalyzed, strain-promoted alkyne-azide cycloaddition, organocatalytic synthesis of triazoles from azides and nonalkyne C three synthones fifty-one using enamine-mediated or enolate-mediated routes, and azide/alkyne/metal-free approaches. Among these methodologies, Copper-catalyzed alkyne-azide cycloaddition, discovered by Sharpless, Fokin, and Meldal groups independently in two thousand two, remains number one for the synthesis of one,four-disubstituted one,two,three-triazoles due to high regioselectivity, efficiency, and tolerance in the presence of many functional groups.\n8p6h | Since the discovery, Copper-catalyzed alkyne-azide cycloaddition has been also expanded for the regioselective synthesis of five-iodo(bromo)-one,four-disubstituted one,two,three-triazoles starting from iodo(bromo) alkynes (Scheme one A) and one-substituted four-ethynyl-one,two,three-triazoles from either terminal diacetylenes or trialkylsilylbuta-one,three-diynes with a one-pot desilylation (Scheme one D).\npmgl | Taking into account that both a halogen atom, especially iodine, and a triple bond are useful functional groups\n90no | responsible for special properties and possibility of further chemical modification, other methods for the synthesis of five-iodo- and four-ethynyltriazoles have been elaborated. Copper-catalyzed alkyne-azide cycloaddition in the presence of electrophilic iodine species generated in situ and amine ligands has been investigated for the synthesis\njt0y | Conditions: seven e (zero point one millimoles), eight a (zero point one millimoles), and a catalyst (five mol percent) were used in an appropriate solvent with the addition of an appropriate ligand with a reaction time of eighteen hours at room temperature. NMR conversion and yields. One,three,five-trimethoxybenzene was used as an internal standard. One mol percent catalyst was used; TEA, triethylamine; TBTA, tris(benzyltriazolylmethyl)amine; CuCl(IPr), chloro[one,three-bis(two,six-diisopropylphenyl)imidazol- two-ylidene ]copper(One).\nqb7o | of five-iodotriazoles (Scheme one B) and was employed for the preparation of bioactive triazole derivatives. An approach based on direct C five lithiation of one,four-substituted triazoles with subsequent halogenation was also proposed for obtaining of some five-iodo derivatives (Scheme one C). An alternative way for the synthesis of four- ethynyltriazoles reported earlier used the reaction of one,two,three-triazoles-four-carbaldehydes with the Bestmann-Ohira reagent (Scheme one E).\noae5 | While some methodologies are presently available for the preparation of five-iodo- and four-ethynyl-one,two,three-triazoles, among one,two,three-triazoles having both halogen and ethynyl moieties, the only example of a five-chloro derivative accessible through a multistep synthetic sequence has been reported and four-ethynyl-five-iodo-one,two,three-triazoles still remain unknown.\ns0fl | We decided to study Copper-catalyzed alkyne-azide cycloaddition of one-iodobuta-one,three-diynes with organic azides as a one-step synthetic approach to four-ethynyl-five-\n43ia | iodo-one,two,three-triazoles (Scheme one F), taking into account that routes B and C being applied to the terminal buta-one,three-diynes and four-ethynyl-one,two,three-triazoles, respectively, could be complicated with side reactions such as iodination of the second triple bond by electrophilic iodine species or acetylene-allene isomerization induced by strong bases. In the present work, we report the scope and limitation of this methodology along with the synthetic utility of four-ethynyl-five-iodo-one,two,three-triazoles as versatile synthetic intermediates.\n3g2y | RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\ngc7v | It is of first importance that starting one-iodobuta-one,three-diynes seven a-j are synthetically available compounds and can be synthesized either by iodination of terminal buta-one,three-diynes using different iodination agents or from trimethylsilyl-protected buta-one,three-diynes\nwqfv | through a one-pot desilylation/iodination approach (Scheme two).",
