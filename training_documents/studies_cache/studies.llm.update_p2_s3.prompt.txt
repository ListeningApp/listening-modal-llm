You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

magd | A picture of the SES field has thus started to emerge, but the SES oncept is nevertheless still in transition (Herrero-Jáuregui et al. 2018), and there are gaps in our understanding of how the field functions and develops (Colding and Barthel 2019). Aside from lacking a broadly agreed-upon definition for SES (Herrero- Jáuregui et al. 2018, Colding and Barthel 2019), much of this gap relates to the methodological pluralism that characterizes the field (Partelow 2018). Methodological pluralism creates challenges for synthesis and data comparison, in part because it is more difficult to know what methods can and should be used in research (Partelow 2018). Lack of methodological transparency hampers attempts to generalize across case studies and frameworks (Magliocca et al. 2018, Colding and Barthel 2019), and can prove particularly challenging for postgraduate students and other early-career researchers (Haider et al. 2018). Understanding and interrogating methods used in the SES field is also important because of the nature of the systems being investigated. There is increasing agreement that SES can be conceptualized as complex adaptive systems (CAS) (Liu et al. 2007b, Levin et al. 2013, Rogers et al. 2013, Folke et al. 2016, Preiser et al. 2018, Herrero-Jáuregui et al. 2018), which place demands on the approaches and methods that SES researchers employ (Preiser et al. 2018), and necessitates an understanding and interrogation of the methods used in the field.
tb74 | We thus expand on recent reviews of the development of the SES field, focusing specifically on the methods used in empirical, place-based SES research. We define methods as codified ways of producing knowledge of a focus of interest, a specific information-generating practice (Pahl-Wostl et al. 2013, Stirling 2015). By having a clearer idea of the range of methods that SES researchers are using when engaging in real-world problem- solving or solution-based research, we can improve our characterization of SES research as a field of inquiry, and also help guide researchers new to the field in identifying and selecting appropriate research methods.
8l69 | We used a systematic review approach to conduct a broad analysis of the different terms being used to study coupled social and ecological systems and characterize these studies according to their type, distinguishing place-based studies from studies that outline "frameworks" and "reviews." Focusing on a subset of place-based research, we then identified the journals, institutions, and countries in which SES have been studied, and how these have changed over time. Having broadly contextualized SES research, we identified a large set of methods used in place-based research,
1jyv | and explored the topics or problems they have most commonly sought to investigate. We summarized the methods into categories, providing a typology that can serve as a guide to the range of methods used in SES research.
olce | Our positioning in this paper centers around the conceptualizations of SES as complex adaptive systems (CAS; Liu et al. 2007b, Levin et al. 2013, Rogers et al. 2013, Folke et al. 2016, Preiser et al. 2018). In this realm, Preiser et al. (2018) have recently made some progress in moving toward a cohesive, theoretically derived definition (Schlüter et al. 2012, Cumming 2014, Bots et al. 2015) of SES research. They offer a typology of six underlying organizing principles of CAS that characterize the various features and properties of such systems. This typology (Table 1) can be used to recognize and assess the demands that CAS make on the methods that SES researchers employ. A final goal of this paper was thus to relate the list of method categories to these underlying principles of CAS through an exploratory assessment of how well different method categories account for core features of CAS.
erx1 | METHODS
b3bt | Systematic reviews are synthesis-based approaches that have in common the aim to build new knowledge from a rigorous analysis of existing research findings (Thorne et al. 2004). Regardless of their aim, systematic reviews follow a strict protocol to maximize transparency and repeatability while minimizing bias (Petticrew and Roberts 2006, Pullin and Stewart 2006, Pullin and Knight 2009, Gough et al. 2012). The systematic review process can be summarized as: formulating a question, generating a protocol, systematic selection, critical appraisal of results, data extraction, data synthesis, and reporting and dissemination (Gough et al. 2012).
0w8m | Defining a search strategy and predocument selection
vcu3 | After situating our study in the conceptual framework outlined in the introduction and defining our study questions, we conducted a first exploratory search in Google Scholar and Scopus databases. We used the search terms "social-ecological," "coupled human*," "SES," "CHANS," "coupled human- environment*," and "social relations to nature." We found that the acronyms "CHANS" and "SES" produced a lot of noise in our results, and subsequently dropped these from our search. During this exploratory phase, we discovered several additional terms that identified studies dealing with human-nature interactions, and included them in subsequent searches. The final terms used in our systematic review were: "social-ecological," "socio-ecological," "human environment," "human-environment*," "affective ecology*," "social-environmental," "socio-environmental," "human-nature relation*," "coupled human*," "human-earth relation*," "environment relation*," "human-environment*," "man-environment relation*," "eco-social," and "nature-society relation" (Appendix 1).
hjzj | Document selection
j79f | Document selection was based on a key word search in Scopus, limited to the title, abstract, and key words. We chose Scopus because of its extensive and interdisciplinary coverage and high recognition as a standardized database for conducting meta- analyses (Wagner et al. 2011). Our first search, using the final key words above to search all journals in the Scopus database over all
6tbv | years, yielded over 20,000 documents. This included results from the mental health, engineering, and information technology literature, which were not relevant to our study. We thus removed results with the key words "adolescent," "male" and "female,"
xb13 | "middle aged," "aged," and "child" because these were associated with social-ecological critical theory in psychology, which is different from the SES focus of this article. We also restricted the search to the subject areas of environmental science, social
cxqi | science, agricultural and biological science, Earth and planetary science, economics, econometrics and finance, energy, "multidisciplinary," and decision sciences. We excluded environmental education because the overlaps with the health and psychological literature produced a lot of nonrelevant studies. Further, we restricted our search to journals, books, and book series, and to publications in English, and items published or in press. Our final search, conducted on 22 July 2015, yielded a result of 5222 documents. In addition to the abstracts and (index and author) key words, we downloaded the year published, journals published in, number of citations, and the institutions and geographical locations of authors.
qfmx | First screening and coding
rut3 | The next step was to screen abstracts for inclusion or exclusion in the study. We characterized papers as follows:
m3cp | · Review: a review of papers about SES, theoretical concepts, and/or frameworks;
mq4s | · Framework: papers that explicitly proposed a framework for understanding SES;
95el | · Framework and place-based: papers that proposed a framework, and also used this framework to analyze a place- based system;
