You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

06yq | Microdosing with psychedelics to self-medicate for ADHD symptoms in adults: A naturalistic study
dpv6 | ARTICLE INFO
8r5j | ABSTRACT
2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

k36t | Q: It is often said that it is better to leave people with their beliefs, rather than to disturb them.
z1wx | A: If the belief is equivalent to believing that an appendix pain is the work of the devil, it is wrong to leave the patient with it, for he is likely to die.
o6gf | THE MAN WHO FELL OFF A MOUNTAIN
0hs6 | It may not be our role to do anything for him, but on the lower level, we can't be prevented from alluding to his state. People like this sometimes resemble the man who fell off a mountain. When he had reached half-way down, he said to himself: 'five thousand feet and nothing has happened yet - in fact it is quite pleasurable'.
m05x | We may have to leave such a man alone, but we can't help noting his real situation. Such people are often those who turn up and say: 'I am following the X Path, and I find it rewarding, but I would like to add a little of your wisdom ... '

qcmr | WHAT RELIGION IS
7c6p | The belief that something which is really, for instance, a selfish self-absorption in religious activity is anti-religion in effect. Sheikh Ibrahim Gazur-Ilahi truly says: 'That which takes you to God is religion/whatever stands between you and God is "the world" How many pious people realise that?
d1ee | The levels of sociology and psychology, which your question regards as a 'reduction' are, in fact, essential to examine at the learning how to learn stage, because unless the psychology is correctly oriented, there is no spirituality, though there can be ob- session and emotionality, often mistaken for it Those who trade in such things, mistaking them for spirituality, have of course - knowingly or otherwise - a vested interest in discouraging interest in the psychological and sociological levels. Those interested in truth, however, cannot afford such luxuries. As for the social level, this and the psychological are dealt with by this quotation from one of the greatest of all Sufis, who is not dealing in spirituality, if you define this term narrowly:
itx4 | Sheikh Abdullah Ansari says:
vwrs | What is worship? To realise reality. What is the sacred law? To do no evil. What is reality? Selflessness.
xjkw | This is the Sufi approach-not the other way about. There can be no spirituality, according to the Sufi masters, without psychology, psychological insight and sociological balance.
wght | So, if you are looking for spirituality which requires such insights, you have to look at the 'reduction' by the great classical Sufi masters, not by me, for I am no innovator in this respect. If, too, you imagine that the Sufis are not to be regarded as 'spiritual' because of their insistence on psy- chology and sociology, you are out of luck again: not only Islamic authorities but scholars from all faiths continue to regard the
3lgb | Sufis as among the greatest exponents of the spiritual among humankind.
ttwt | There is no wisdom where there is no common sense: it can- not under those conditions find any expression.
x5l2 | They say: 'Seek wisdom while you have the strength, or you may lose the strength without gaining wisdom.'
ilrs | THE INVISIBLE CAT
0a03 | But you must start where it counts: you cannot start halfway along and expect results. Mark Twain advertised, as a hoax, that he had lost a cat so black that it could not be seen by ordinary light, and wanted it back. Nearly a thousand people contacted him claiming to have seen it. Would you begin to teach such people, or at least people in such a state of mind, anything?
auae | THE ROBBER-PRIEST
5b6y | In England, no time ago, there was a priest who was a burglar, who even burgled another vicarage, an abbey and a school. He was caught trying to rob a bank, which he travelled to by taxi, having enlisted his housekeeper, convincing her that they were doing something good. Should the social and psychological levels of such a person not be looked at before proceeding with the spiritual, the higher, levels? Another priest got divorced and married a witch ...

tynp | On Attention
ob0u | Characteristics of Attention and Observation
50o1 | Q: Can you define characteristics of attention and observation as of importance in Sufic studies?
cw76 | A: Study the attracting, extending and reception, as well as the interchange, of attention.
lkk5 | One of the keys to human behaviour is the attention-factor.
molj | Anyone can verify that many instances, generally supposed to be important or useful human transactions on any subject (social, commercial, etc.,) are in fact disguised attention-situations.
5pto | It is contended that if a person does not know what he is doing (in this case that he is basically demanding, extending or ex- changing attention) and as a consequence thinks that he is doing something else (contributing to human knowledge, learning, buying, selling, informing, etc.,) he will (a) be more inefficient at both the overt and the covert activity; (b) have less capacity of planning his behaviour and will make mistakes of emotion and intellect because he considers attention to be other than it is.
mo6k | If this is true, it is most important that individuals realise:
zh6q | 1. That this attention-factor is operating in virtually all trans- actions;
kp04 | 2. That the apparent motivation of transactions may be other than it really is. And that it is often generated by the need or desire for attention-activity (giving, receiving, exchanging).
3e8r | 3. That attention-activity, like any other demand for food, warmth, etc., when placed under volitional control, must result in increased scope for the human being who would then not be at the mercy of random sources of attention, or even more confused than usual if things do not pan out as they expect
8g7g | 85
5j4f | CERTAIN PRINCIPLES MAY BE ENUNCIATED. THEY INCLUDE: -
4xe7 | 1. Too much attention can be bad, (inefficient).
pg4b | 2. Too little attention can be bad.
b0d0 | 3. Attention may be 'hostile' or friendly' and still fulfil the appetite for attention. This is confused by the moral aspect.
d7eu | 4. When people need a great deal of attention they are vulner- able to the message which too often accompanies the exercise of attention towards them. E.g., someone wanting attention might be able to get it only from some person or organisation which might thereafter exercise (as 'its price') an undue influence upon the attention-starved individual's mind.
xndr | 5. Present beliefs have often been inculcated at a time and under circumstances connected with attention-demand, and not arrived at by the method attributed to them.
m6hi | 6. Many paradoxical reversals of opinion, or of associates and commitments may be seen as due to the change in a source of attention.
vpkf | 7. People are almost always stimulated by an offer of attention, since most people are frequently attention-deprived. This is one reason why new friends, or circumstances, for instance, may be pre- ferred to old ones.
4d67 | 8. If people could learn to assuage attention-hunger, they would be in a better position than most present cultures allow them, to attend to other things. They could extend the effectiveness of their learning capacity.
e7j2 | 9. Among the things which unstarved people (in the sense of attention) could investigate, is the comparative attraction of ideas, individuals, etc., apart from their purely attention-supplying func- tion.
lqzt | 10. The desire for attention starts at an early stage of infancy. It is, of course, at that point linked with feeding and protection. This is not to say that this desire has no further nor future development value. But it can be adapted beyond its ordinary adult usage of mere satisfaction.
1ocm | 11. Even a cursory survey of human communities shows that, while the random eating tendency, possessiveness and other un- differentiated characteristics are very early trained or diverted-
527v | 86
lrri | weaned-the attention-factor does not get the same treatment. The consequence is that the adult human being, deprived of any method of handling his desire for attention, continues to be confused by it: as it usually remains primitive throughout life.
5cl9 | 12. Very numerous individual observations of human trans- actions have been made. They show that an interchange between two people always has an attention-factor.
u7a3 | 13. Observation shows that people's desires for attention ebb and flow. When in an ebb or flow of attention-desire, the human being not realising that this is his condition, attributes his actions and feelings to other factors, e.g., the hostility or pleasantness of others. He may even say that it is a 'lucky day', when his attention- needs have been quickly and adequately met. Re-examination of such situations has shown that such experiences are best accounted for by the attention-theory.
w409 | 14. Objections based upon the supposed pleasure of attention being strongest when it is randomly achieved do not stand up when carefully examined. 'I prefer to be surprised by attention' can be paraphrased by saying, 'I prefer not to know where my next meal is coming from'. It simply underlines a primitive stage of feeling and thinking on this subject.
m04y | 15. Situations which seem different when viewed from an over- simplified perspective (which is the usual one) are seen to be the same by the application of attention-theory. E.g .: People follow- ing an authority-figure may be exercising the desire for attention or the desire to give it. The interchange between people and their authority-figure may be explained by mutual-attention behaviour. Some gain only attention from this interchange. Some can gain more.
23jk | 16. Another confusion is caused by the fact that the object of attention may be a person, a cult, an object, an idea, interest, etc. Because the foci of attention can be so diverse, people in general have not yet identified the common factor-the desire for atten- tion.
oa63 | 17. One of the advantages of this theory is that it allows the human mind to link in a coherent and easily-understood way many things which it has always (wrongly) been taught are very
e3lv | 87
rqv6 | different, not susceptible to comparison, etc. This incorrect train- ing has, of course, impaired the possible efficiency in functioning of the brain, though only culturally, not permanently.
oa48 | 18. The inability to feel when attention is extended, and also to encourage or to prevent its being called forth, makes man almost uniquely vulnerable to being influenced, especially in having ideas implanted in his brain, and being indoctrinated.
3fp1 | 19. Raising the emotional pitch is the most primitive method of increasing attention towards the instrument which increased the emotion. It is the prelude to, or accompaniment of, almost every form of indoctrination.
557x | 20. Traditional philosophical and other teachings have been used to prescribe exercises in the control and focussing of atten- tion. Their value, however, has been to a great measure lost because the individual exercises, prescribed for people in need of exercise, have been written down and repeated as unique truths and practised in a manner, with people and at a rate and under circumstances which, by their very randomness, have not been able to effect any change in the attention-training. This treatment has, however, produced obsession. It continues to do so.
ep8e | 21. Here and there proverbs and other pieces of literary material indicate that there has been at one time a widespread knowledge of attention on the lines now being described. Deprived, however, of context, these indications survive as fossil indicators rather than being a useful guide to attention-exercise for contemporary man.
7mv3 | Attention upon oneself, or upon a teacher, without the exercise of securing what is being offered from beyond the immediate surroundings, is a sort of short-circuit. As Rumi said: 'Do not look at me, but take what is in my hand'.

njvp | Sufi Study Themes
s8b5 | Sufi Study Themes
p450 | Q: If you were to give a number of study themes to the people present, which ones would you stress?
rsvo | A:
z4m8 | 1. All approaches to a study or an individual may start with a desire for attention. However they start, they must never end up in this manner.
ukf0 | 2. Study the assumptions behind your actions. Then study the iptions behind your assumptions.
k38m | 3. "Why did I do such-and-such a thing?' is all very well. But what about 'How otherwise could I have done it?'
nkj9 | 4. You have come a long way, and you do not know it. You have a long way to go, and you do know what that means.
35a8 | 5. In respect to some, you may have advanced. In relation to others, you have not progressed at all. Neither observation is more important than the other.
337o | 6. If your desire for 'good' is based on greed, it is not good, but
cuth | 7. Exercise power by means of kindness, and you may be causing more damage than you could by cruelty. Neither approach correct.
09z2 | 8. The man who knows must discharge a function. The one ho does not, cannot arrogate one to himself; he can only try to do
13fv | 9- Do not try to be humble: learn humility.
v5pj | 10. Assume that you are part-hypocrite and part heedless, and ou will not be far wrong.
trab | 11. To copy a virtue in another is more copying than it is virtue. Try to learn what that virtue is based upon.
grxs | 12. No practice exists in isolation.
u9dn | 13. If you seek a teacher, try to become a real student. If you ant to be a student, try to find a real teacher.
t25w | 14. The more often you do a thing, the more likely you are to
x62u | 91
aoc8 | do it again. There is no certainty that you wiH gain anything else from repetition than a likelihood of further repetition.
3mdu | 15. At first, you are not worthy of the robes and implements of the Sufi. Later you do not need them. Finally, you may need them for the sake of others.
m04v | 16. If you cannot laugh frequently and genuinely, you have no soul.
3aip | 17. When a belief becomes more than an instrument, you are lost. You remain lost until you learn what "belief is really for.
q3gu | 18. When a dervish shows interest in your material welfare, you may be pleased. But it is frequently because you are not yet ready for anything else.
txab | 19. When someone asks for you to help in doing something, do you imagine that it is because he cannot do it unaided? Perhaps he is a Sufi who wants to help you by connecting you with his task.
dov0 | 20. If you are lazy, count yourself lucky if someone points this out, giving you a chance to improve. Laziness is always your fault. It is the sign that a man has persevered in uselessness for too long.
xd5o | These points are in fact exercises in outwitting the false self, which thrives on smaller satisfactions. The Sufi aims at Tana (passing away-of the False Self) and Baga (remaining - of the Real). Behind the supposed 'I', which is impermanent, lies the real one, which is characterised by the awareness of truth, of reality.
3gny | And listen to the words of Junaid of Baghdad, when he said: 'A good-natured sensualist is better than a bad-tempered so-called Sufi.'

vyos | Things of the World
w4hq | An Eastern Sage and the Newspapers
ghbe | LETTER TO A SAGE
1lkf | A WESTERN student of the spiritual wrote a fierce and reproving letter to a certain Eastern sage, when he saw his name in a news- paper. "You should be completely unconcerned with the things of this world!' he said - and much else.
uobn | When I visited the sage, I asked him what he had thought of the letter, as I wanted to report his reaction to the writer of it
3194 | 'I do get letters, it is true,' he murmured, 'but I am afraid I do not read them, because, you see, they are things of this world, and I am not concerned with them.'
r22o | 'Things of this world' include, according to the Sufis, anything other than Truth.
