        "content": "z8tt | Local Survey Data and the Determinants of Land Prices\n9g22 | Thus far, the analysis has focused exclusively upon the larger CRG records, and we now turn to the more detailed data-set derived from the questionnaire survey. However, because of the limited sample size, these data are usually analysed for the whole\n41fx | sample, occasionally broken down either by colonia or into two groups-the 'Control Group', most of whom live in Las Lomas, and the 'Study Group' which comprise the other colonias and some (twenty-three cases) from the unplatted area of Las Lomas.\n7um8 | We will not repeat the findings from the household survey; suffice to say that the household data show an almost identical cyclical pattern in real (nineteen eighty-three) prices to that described above for the larger CRG database with a similar sharp peak in nineteen ninety-four and ninety-five. The full line indicates nominal or unadjusted prices. Overall, taking the real price of lots and land units from the late nineteen seventies through to late nineteen nineties, prices remained fairly flat over time. Statistically, no correlation was found between rising prices and the progression of years through the nineteen eighties and nineteen nineties, either for all cases combined, or differentiated between the 'Control' and the CRG-intervened 'Study' Groups. However, Control Group lots do appear to be slightly lower in price\nuow2 | than those of the Study settlements and this is consistent with the generally lower price of land in Las Lomas (where most Control Group households lived) and the earlier period of that cluster of colonias' development. Differentiating between the two groups continued to show a lack of any clear relationship between price and yearly progression and, although the correlation coefficient is positive (zero point one one four), it is not statistically significant. Moreover, disaggregating the data by cohort or period of purchase does not seem to make any difference either: there is a low negative correlation for the nineteen eighty-nine to ninety-four period, and only if one takes the nineteen seventy-nine to ninety-four period does one observe a positive correlation of positive zero point one five seven (significant at the five percent level).\niat7 | Tracking prices since CRG intervention (nineteen ninety-five onwards). In summary, the survey data reveal some small hint of a real price increase over time, but only for the overall period nineteen seventy-nine to ninety-four and not for the rush of lot sales during nineteen eighty-nine to ninety-four. Between nineteen ninety-five and two thousand one, there is a negative correlation between prices-when they actually decline quite sharply-as we saw earlier. However, the number of cases is rather\nywwr | small: examining the price paid for land in the last few years (nineteen ninety-five to two thousand one) embracing the period of CRG intervention (nineteen ninety-seven to two thousand two) we have a total of thirty-five cases, but with only three to four cases each year in the most recent period. Our conclusions are tentative, therefore. The results show a sharp decline in nineteen ninety-seven, picking up again from two thousand onwards, but not getting back to nineteen ninety-five and ninety-six levels. While it is possible that CRG intervention actually drove prices downwards, it must be stated this is likely to have been in combination with a number of factors, some of which were alluded to earlier, but it is not possible to be conclusive. Further research is required to track prices for a much larger number of cases since nineteen ninety-seven and to analyse in detail whether the resulting changes are related to CRG intervention and titling. Prima facie it appears that the promise, or the likelihood of title transfers being provided by the CRG, has not had an inflationary impact upon land values: indeed, the trend is in the opposite direction. But in order to be sure, it is necessary to analyse\n0i6j | more cases exclusively for the post-intervention period since nineteen ninety-seven and to conduct further follow-up studies for the period two thousand one to zero five. Put simply, although it is probably too soon to ascertain definitively whether title provision has had a significant direct impact upon land prices, our initial assessment is that it has not had a significant effect.\n87cq | The costs and affordability of land acquisition in Rio Grande City. Earlier in this article, we observed that Starr County is among the poorest in Texas and we were interested to know how far the land market was constructed in such a way as to ensure that even here land for self-help housing remained affordable. Lot prices and square foot prices are shown in Table three. The overall trimmed mean (nineteen eighty-three) price is two thousand five hundred fifty-two dollars (median equals two thousand one hundred twenty-two dollars), equaling forty-five cents and forty-two cents per square foot respectively. In order to express in two thousand two values, multiply by one point seven three five. These costs of land are broadly comparable in unit price terms with other Texas colonias studied using an almost identical methodology. Where those other study colonias showed significantly lower unit prices, it was usually due to their much larger average lot sizes (reducing the overall bid prices). For example, Pueblo Nuevo colonia in Webb County, outside Laredo, had a trimmed mean price of thirteen cents per square foot, but these were for average lots of almost one acre in size; while Sparks colonia in El Paso County had a median cost of thirty-five cents per square foot on lots that averaged twice the size of those in Starr County, around eleven thousand square feet compared with five thousand square feet. Cameron Park in Cameron County-a better point of comparison, given its Lower Rio Grande Valley location and similar land properties-had a median of thirty-nine cents per square foot, with average lot sizes of seven thousand square feet. Thus, we are confident in concluding that Starr County unit land prices are broadly similar to equivalent colonia lots found elsewhere in the border area.\n0qs3 | The data show that overall lot prices in Starr County are 'cheaper' (or more affordable) than those of most other counties and",
