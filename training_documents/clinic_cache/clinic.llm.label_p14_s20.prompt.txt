You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

The total number of teeth lost per patient per year of SPC was 0.08 (all studies: average of 9.88 SPC years) and 0.06 (conventional APT studies: average of 12.75 SPC years). Heterogene- ity in the tooth-level studies/analyses varied from unimportant to considerably higher compared to the subject-level findings but did not affect the direction of effects (i.e., lack of periodontal stability led to tooth loss) and only affected the precision with which the summary effect was calculated.

svhz | This systematic review confirms that very few periodontitis cases achieve the proposed endpoints following steps 1, 2 and 3 of peri- odontal therapy. In studies following conventional APT, 9.43% of sub- jects achieved 'stable periodontitis' and 27.6% achieved the desirable 'endpoints of therapy'. Our data showed that 54.2% of subjects achieved 'controlled periodontitis', coinciding with a multi-centre study where approximately 50% of the population was within the limits of 'controlled periodontitis' (Feres et al., 2020). The prevalence

qrd3 | of achieving and sustaining these endpoints is likely to be reduced fur- ther with increased time of SPC (Bertl et al., 2022) and reduced opera- tor experience (Fleischer et al., 1989). Therefore, the reality of successfully achieving or sustaining these endpoints in general dental practice is likely to be limited further.
rxrg | An average of 11.36 teeth per patient were considered 'diseased' after APT. This result needs to be interpreted in light of the proven efficacy of steps 1 and 2 of periodontal therapy, which show an over- all proportion of 74% of 'pocket closure' (PPD â‰¤ 4 mm and an absence of BoP; Suvan et al., 2020), bearing in mind that the effi- ciency of NSPT is reduced in areas of difficult access, such as furca- tions or deep pockets (Caffesse et al., 1986; Fleischer et al., 1989; Tomasi et al., 2007).
tf43 | Analysing long-term outcomes showed that 29.05% of 'unstable' subjects, as per WWC 2017 and following conventional APT, experi- enced tooth loss during a mean observation period of 12.75 years. Yet, only 8.49% of teeth responsible for an 'unstable' diagnosis were extracted. The lack of a statistically significant association of tooth loss at the subject level <LATEX>\left( R R = 1 . 3 6 ; \right.</LATEX> <LATEX>\left. p = . 2 0 7 2 \right)</LATEX> within this data sup- ports that an 'unstable' periodontitis subject does not increase the risk for periodontitis-related tooth loss among subjects strongly com- pliant with SPC (Bertl et al., 2022). Consideration of this endpoint may be important when planning treatment at the tooth level, for example, utilising a 'stable' abutment tooth where our data highlight an <LATEX>R R = 1 0 . 2 7</LATEX> for tooth loss if the tooth is 'unstable'.

8uji | Although approximately one third (34.34%) of the subjects not meeting the 'endpoints of therapy' lost teeth during SPC after con- ventional APT, similarly, statistical significance was reached only at the tooth level <LATEX>\left( R R = 1 4 . 8 6 ; \right.</LATEX> <LATEX>\left. p = . 0 1 5 1 \right) .</LATEX> This may be due to BoP, a variable of these composite endpoints, which has been found to be a useful predictor of periodontal progression and subsequent tooth loss only at the tooth level (Claffey & Egelberg, 1995; Matuliene et al., 2008). Yet, the effect of smoking on masking the predictive abil- ity of BoP cannot be excluded (BergstrÃ¶m & BostrÃ¶m, 2001). Less than 20% of subjects within this dataset were current smokers.
df3e | 'Controlled periodontitis' was the most frequently achieved end- point (52.42%) among studies following conventional APT. At the sub- ject level, it has an RR of 2.78 <LATEX>\left( p = . 0 0 6 8 \right)</LATEX> of tooth loss during SPC when not achieved, which is similar to the findings reported else- where (Siow et al., 2022). Unlike other subject-level endpoints, this endpoint considers multiple residual sites, which is relevant, as subject- and tooth-level factors can affect the treatment response, particularly in relation to specific tooth types (Tomasi et al., 2007). All endpoints showed low PPVs and high NPVs at the subject level, sup- porting existing literature (Saydzai et al., 2022).
53eu | The number of teeth lost per subject per year of SPC varied between 0.06 and 0.08, corroborating that a small number of teeth are lost in a small proportion of the population (Hirschfeld & Wasserman, 1978; McFall, 1982; Needleman et al., 2018; Nibali et al., 2017). Optimal adherence to long-term SPC has been shown to
a5u1 | effectively reduce the progression of periodontitis and tooth loss, par- ticularly in private practice and university-based hospitals (Axelsson & Lindhe, 1981; Chambrone et al., 2010; Leow et al., 2022). This is sup- ported by our data at the subject and tooth level, respectively, where the highest incidence of tooth loss was reported in studies where <10% of subjects adhered to the recommended SPC regime (De Wet et al., 2018) and where SPC regimes were executed by the subjects' general dental practices (Nibali et al., 2020). With maxillary molar teeth being the most frequently lost teeth within SPC, this raises the question whether end- points should be individualized to the tooth type, as their complex anat- omy may affect 'pocket closure' (Tomasi et al., 2007).
ry7u | This systematic review has many strengths including analyses of very large amount of clinical data from several settings and countries reflecting global periodontal practices, which increases its external validity and power. Limitations are evident, such as potential selection bias due to exclusion of studies, cases with no available data and restriction to studies published from 2017. Most included studies were retrospective cohort studies. Information and residual confound- ing bias cannot be excluded because of the unavailability of some of the required data. Multi-level and meta-regression analyses were not per- formed, as not all required data were available. Therefore, the low tooth loss rate may not be generalizable for all periodontitis patients. Including different stages of periodontitis and APT protocols may affect the dis- criminative power of the study. Study selection was limited to those pub- lished after 2017, as they better reflect current practice globally, particularly since official endpoints were proposed by the WWC 2017. IPD analyses are resource-intensive and we felt a 5-year restriction, which still included 12,884 subjects, would be pragmatic.
5mda | Further research is required to assess the different endpoints and their accuracy when predicting tooth loss, oral-health-related quality of life and the systemic impact of periodontitis, which collectively form the true endpoints of periodontitis.
i4li | Overall, the data collected from 12,884 periodontitis subjects and presented here demonstrate the following:
r8sm | . An overwhelming majority of subjects and teeth do not success- fully achieve 'stability' or meet the recommended 'endpoints of therapy' of current guidelines following APT. This suggests that either periodontal treatment still has a long way to go before being considered efficacious or the currently proposed endpoints are not realistic. We, with a certain degree of optimism based on the rela- tively low tooth loss during SPC, would like to believe in the latter.
cuin | . Certain surrogate endpoints may be more relevant at the tooth level than <LATEX>\mathrm { a t }</LATEX> the subject level. Endpoints should be specific to the tooth type if more personalised treatment approaches are required.
n1i7 | . The present findings apply to patients compliant with SPC. Yet, non-compliant patients represent a major proportion of treated patients. The generalisability of the results may depend on the extent, stage and grade of periodontitis.
0r5m | Periodontally involved teeth can be well maintained when compli- ant with SPC. Rethinking endpoint selection may resolve any

Furthermore, as healthcare moves towards persona- lised medicine and the paradigm surrounding pathogenesis of peri- odontitis has shifted to consider the individual's host immune- inflammatory response, it may be justified to consider individualized endpoints acknowledging the patients' demographic, systemic and lifestyle factors.
