You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

06yq | Microdosing with psychedelics to self-medicate for ADHD symptoms in adults: A naturalistic study
dpv6 | ARTICLE INFO
8r5j | ABSTRACT
2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

gtxr | Summary
ehqu | In this chapter, you learned how to use Quick Filters and Dashboard Actions not only to provide greater interactivity for users, but also to provide an efficient user experience. You also learned how to create parameters to filter single and multiple data sources, as well as to govern the visualizations that appear on a dashboard. You studied the implications in dashboard performance when using different methods of filtering, all of which will give your dashboard users a greater control over the data points that they choose to explore. It will also create a more personal, relevant, and compelling data story.
5hiy | In the next chapter, we will discuss publishing your work, which is the last step to creating and distributing your work in Tableau Public.

xeng | Publishing your work on the Cloud with Tableau Public is the core of the application's value proposition, and with Tableau Public 9.0, it's easy to save and share your work. There's more to publishing than just locating a file on a web server. Publishing your work and managing your author and workbook profiles is the best way of helping people browse through your visualizations to create more personal connections with your data story. When people are personally connected and relate to you and your work as a human, they are more likely to share it.
jf2c | In this section, we'll discuss the following topics:
9qk9 | · Saving your work and logging in to Tableau Public
mki0 | . Opening your work from the Cloud on your computer
din5 | · Managing your profile
qc24 | · Viewing your work online
ktw4 | · Sharing your work with others
0wr0 | · Managing workbook details
01xg | Saving your work and logging in to Tableau Public

yohk | Chapter 9
0qgi | Giving your analysis a good name is critical. First, it's the title that other people will see when they look at your profile on Tableau Public. Also, the name of the workbook and individual dashboards are a part of the URL of the file. It's important not to include special characters, such as ampersands, question marks, and periods, because they can disrupt the format of the URL. It's fine to include numbers though. You can name your workbook as shown in following screenshot:
awut | If you want to replace an existing file with the one that you have opened now, you can perform the following steps:
pjzb | 1. Select Save to Tableau Public As ... from the File menu.
a2ry | 2. From the dropdown list of the existing files, select the file that you want to overwrite.
8zhz | 3. Click on Save.

06s5 | The destination page that you reach when you login is your profile page. This is where all the dashboards that you created are organized. It is also a great place for you to add information about yourself. You can add links to your Twitter and LinkedIn accounts as well as the blogs or corporate websites that you would like to promote. (It's important to make sure that you have the permission before presenting URLs of organizations of which you're not an associate).
f3g2 | My profile is shown in the following screenshot:
zlrt | You can change settings related to specific workbooks by hovering over them. As your catalogue of work grows, you should curate it by being selective about which visualizations are featured.
8szg | When you roll over any of the thumbnails for a specific visualization, you can do several things; the following are a few of these things:
hh47 | 1. First, on the upper right-hand side, select MAKE FEATURED to make it the featured visualization, which will move it to the upper-most left spot on your profile.
adpv | 2. On the upper right-hand side, you can change the visibility settings.

iknb | 3. On the lower right-hand side, you can delete workbooks. This is a good idea in case you would like to delete the earlier iterations of a finished product, but keep in mind that you don't have the file saved on your computer. So, be judicious when using the Delete button.
3ohm | 4. On the lower right-hand side, you will see the workbook name and the number of views that it has.
enn6 | 1
voir | A view is each visit to the page by a browser. So, if you go to the workbook five times a day, that's five views. Note that this is not the number of unique visitors.
bxm5 | 5. Then, above the workbook name, you can download the workbook.
6cnd | 6. At the center, you have the View option in case you wish to view the workbook, as shown in the following screenshot:

28wa | From left to right, you can perform the following tasks:
1jce | · Go back to your profile
jfbn | · Keep on clicking and go through other workbooks
cn1a | . Edit the details of the workbook that you have opened
0j5u | · Download the workbook, as shown in following screenshot:
u6dp | If you scroll to the bottom of the dashboard, you have the following additional controls:
hnb4 | 1. Undo, Redo, and Reset any changes that you have made. For instance, if you have filtered your workbook and want to revert to the original state, just click on the Reset button.
a0sw | 2. Share your work in the following way:
aak4 | ° You can share the Current View, which includes filter conditions or parameter selections. Alternatively, you can share the Original View.
7l7y | ° Embed Code allows you to copy an automatically generated block of HTML that you can use to embed the visualization on another web page. This code identifies the viewing attributes of your workbook, such as whether the toolbars are showing, the height and width of the workbook, and its title. For instance, if you want to embed the dashboard on your blog, you just need to copy the code. Then, in the management console of your blog, either insert the code directly, or create and then insert a snippet of HTML. If you have the capabilities, you can utilize Tableau Public's JavaScript API to embed the visualization in a webpage and then allow users to interact with it through web objects that are native to the source page. That's beyond the scope of this chapter though.

k4xq | ° To share the workbook with others, you can copy the link as well as simply highlight and copy the text and then paste it into a new e-mail in the tool of your choice.
ok5a | ° You also can share the workbook on Twitter or Facebook by clicking on either of the two buttons that open a pop-up on your browser and ask you to enter your credentials for the medium that you have selected, as shown in the following screenshot:
2ngm | When you share your work via Twitter or Facebook, the description that you enter in the workbook details will automatically be populated, as shown in following screenshot. You can always change the description and remove the via @tableau string, but it's much more likely that people will find your tweet if you leave that tag:

iqve | The information that you provide about your work is important; it's the first part of the story that you're telling that people will take in. The workbook name is important, and so is the description and additional links.
o7st | If you scroll down the page past the Share button, you will see the workbook title as well as a link that allows you to edit the workbook details, as shown in the following screenshot:
jsfl | Now, perform the following steps:
0px6 | 1. Make sure that the Title of the workbook says exactly what you want to appear on your profile.
9n3l | 2. Add a Permalink. Though this isn't required, it's a good way to promote your blog.
09gz | 3. Enter a good description in the Description. This is the text that search engines will index. Also, if you want people to tweet your work, then you need to enter a description that's 82 characters or less, because the link that Tableau generates for your workbook will consist of 62 characters.
pppg | 4. Toolbar Settings typically include control buttons as well as a link to your author profile. If you choose not to include those, then the HTML generated to embed your work will be adjusted.
clpf | 5. An additional setting that you can adjust is Show workbook sheets as tabs. If all the worksheets in your workbook are on your dashboard and you have hidden them, then you don't need to select this.
