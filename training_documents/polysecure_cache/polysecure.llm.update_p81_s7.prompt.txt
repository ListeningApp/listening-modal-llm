You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

Physical prox- imity is needed for the development of attachment, since it is through touch and face-to-face contact that we forge bonds with each other, and it is by responding to a child's cries with our own bodies that we inform them that they are safe and not alone. Voice also plays an important role in the attachment system & The right tone and cadence from our attachment figures can have the powerful ability to soothe us when distressed, and a person's voice and body language can also alert us to how trusting and safe they are.
vb88 | Optimal functioning of the attachment system and the formation of attachment security are best facilitated by consistent interactions with significant others who are responsive to our needs for proximity. We need to know that our attachment figures are available to us, that they are within arm's reach (literally and virtually) and that they will be available and responsive when we call for them. When we experience our partners as being here with us, it results in the positive beliefs that our partners care about us, we matter to them and we are worthy of their love and attention. Conversely, when our partners are unavailable, unresponsive or mentally elsewhere, attachment insecurity can arise, feeding the fears and doubts that we are not valued, loved or worthy.
0dzg | The Buddhist monk and peace activist Thich Nhat Hanh is widely attributed as providing the quote "the most precious gift we can offer is our presence," but entrepreneur Malcolm Forbes is said to have reminded us that "presence is more than just being there." Being in the same physical space does not necessarily mean that you are here and present with the people you are near. When you are with your partners, are you really focusing on them and giving your full attention, or are you distracted by your phone, by the stresses from the day, by your worries about the future or by your other partners? Are you really listening to your partners when they talk, or are you thinking about other things, only partially listening or mentally pre- paring for what you want to say next? Physical proximity is extremely important and necessary for attachment, but it is not sufficient if the quality of presence is poor.
qrj3 | Being present with your partner is important for people in any relationship struc- ture, but struggling with presence and availability is a common complaint in non- monogamous relationships since there are typically more people to attend to in any given day or week. One of the most common complaints that I hear is of situa- tions where partners are spending quality time together and one partner is mes- saging with other people in ways that feel distracting and interruptive.
erv1 | Attachment is an embodied experience, and it is first through being present with ourselves in our own bodies and present with our loved ones that the rest of the attachment-based skills and capacities of the HEART of being polysecure can be developed and expressed. As an adult who wants to function from a secure place in your relationships, you can't affirm, attune, repair or even play if you are not here with yourself or with your partners. Being present is not just putting your phone down for a few minutes. It is a way of being, from interaction to interaction, where you consciously inhabit your own body and show up with the best of your atten- tion, offering your presence as a gift.
4u8c | Questions to Consider
m3ho | . How do you show that you are here with your partners?
pse1 | . How could you be more present when you are with your partners?
9wyj | . Are there ways that you could be more available and responsive to your part- ners?
hmko | . How do your partners demonstrate that they are being present with you?
tsxi | . Do you trust that your partners will be available and responsive if and when you need them?
fidk | . Are there things that your partners could do that would enhance your sense that they are here with you when you are together and here for you in general?
ju2k | Things to Try and to Experiment With
wldo | . In order to be truly present with one another, we need to experience and have access to an inner state that is different from our ordinary state of conscious- ness. To do this, it is important to learn practices that cultivate a state of
ct9a | presence so that you can bring this to the people you are with. Explore dif- ferent practices to create a state of presence and mindfulness.
rh8p | . Articulate being here and present as a value that you have for yourself and as an intention in your relationships.
vopc | . Prioritize regular time with your partners when you are both fully here and present with each other. This is especially important when you only get lim- ited time together, but it is just as important when you live together and spend a lot of time in each other's company, but are not actually connecting without the distractions of kids, house, work, pets, meals, etc.
k4qz | . Put your phone down, take your smartwatch off. If you are on a date with a partner, put your electronic devices away. With the exceptions of legitimate situations that need urgent and immediate attention, do your best to take care of any messaging, logistics or calls with other partners before or after your date. If you have partners who can't handle not being in contact with you for a period of time, professional support might be needed to work through at- tachment insecurities or patterns of codependency. Even though attachment- based relationships do require regular maintenance, when we are functioning from secure attachment with our partners we will be flexible, gracious, tol- erant and even appreciative of time apart.
k3w9 | . There will be times when having your phone away is not realistic. For exam- ple, if you nest with your partner and you are both home together, but it's not necessarily designated quality time together, or if you and a partner are on an extended trip and it's not realistic to not talk to other partners for several days. In these situations, I find that it is best to just be transparent about when you need to step away and message or make calls. Do your best not to sneak in messages to others while the partners you are with are in the bath- room or while you're lying in bed together (unless your partners truly take no offense at this, which some people don't). With nesting partners, it can be helpful to have designated times of the day or during the week where you are both off your phone and focused on each other, so that the times when you
lijr | are on your phone throughout the day do not become problematic. When you are with non-nesting partners, clearly let them know when you need a certain amount of time to be on your phone and that you'll be fully present when you're back. This can go a long way in preventing tensions and strain.
43dz | . When you are struggling with being present because you are in conflict with another partner or have other life stressors going on, the next best thing you can do is to just name what is tugging at your presence. You do not neces- sarily have to go fully into what is distracting you since you might not want to spend your time with one partner processing what's going on with another, and some of the things that you are struggling with may require honoring the privacy of your other partners, but being able to name where you are at and what is preventing you from being fully present (instead of trying to pretend that you're fine when you're clearly not) is another way of being present with where you are in that moment. It may not be ideal, but it is honest and part- ners will typically appreciate this.
fyrt | . In your relationships, discuss how available you want to be to each other (i.e., to what extent or at what frequency), be clear about what you can gener- ally offer and follow through regarding time, attention and forms of com- munication.
