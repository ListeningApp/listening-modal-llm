        "content": "mror | very low-income buyers. Average colonia lot prices in Rio Grande City and Starr County are generally lower than in many other border counties, but the unit price per square foot is about the same, the lower prices in Rio Grande City coming through smaller lot size.\nzlxc | While there is substantial evidence that colonias offer an important medium for creating home equity, this is achieved primarily through improving the land by engaging in self-help house construction or, as is more usual in Texas sub-divisions, by placing a manufactured home on the lot, perhaps with self-help extensions. However, the ability to realise this property investment through sale in the market-place is severely limited by the lack of demand. This is because other poor people cannot afford to buy properties at this lower end of the market, where, as we have observed, homes average thirty thousand dollars or more. Unless financing mechanisms are put in place to facilitate home sales, there is little prospect that low-income populations will be able to find buyers that will allow them to cash-in on their sweat equity investments.\nk0bw | These findings run in the same direction as recent work in Mexico and elsewhere in Latin America. Title regularisation per se appears to have little impact upon land prices or, for that matter, upon the upgrading process, although it may have broader significance in those situations-such as in Texas-where the tradition of formal and full property title is strongly engrained. Elsewhere we have analysed what land title means for residents in the same study settlements examined in this article and we show how the clearing of titles by the CRG was indeed important for these colonia populations in Rio Grande City, particularly in so far as it gave householders greater self-esteem and assertiveness in dealing with the local authorities, and in empowering their political participation. However, receiving full title from the CRG appears to have made little difference in the extent and rate at which households made\naq5a | home improvements; nor does it enhance their propensity to use the homes as collateral against leveraging credit. Low-income Mexican-origin populations in Texas, like their counterparts in Mexico, are extremely cautious about taking on debt that might endanger losing their homes.\nsc5y | Previous research in Mexico and elsewhere has demonstrated that determinants other than title are invariably more important in shaping people's sense of security of occupancy in irregular settlements. Such determinants include the size of the settlement, its age, the level of services already installed and the political contacts of local leaders. In Rio Grande City, however, these determinants did not apply for a number of important reasons: the settlement size is much smaller; there is the generalised context and expectancy of full legality of property tiles in Texas and the U.S.; and, city or county governments are largely unresponsive to informal settlements. These three factors combined to generate a sense of vulnerability among residents, such that those without clean title welcomed the CRG's intervention. The point to underscore is that the significance of gaining title did not translate into an enhanced functioning of the land market, nor did it translate into a quickening of dwelling improvements or a newfound opportunity to leverage credit against property titles.\n0yab | An important difference between Texas colonias and their irregular settlement counterparts in Mexico and elsewhere is that in less developed countries the processes of illegal land capture and self-build housing and mutual aid community programmes generally have a much greater impact upon overall land valorisation. This is largely because the initial costs of land acquisition are non-existent or very low and because state intervention to provide services offers significant 'windfall' gains to low-income households that complement their sweat efforts.\nw95z | In these contexts, the informal market works quite well-at least, it does in the earlier phases of irregular settlement development-and it is common to find lots 'for sale' in the incipient stages of settlement and dwelling improvement. However, as in Texas colonias, homesteaders confront a rising lack of demand, once the settlement is established and 'consolidating', and there appears to be relatively little outward mobility by first-generation homesteaders. Fortunately for them, most owner households in Mexico and elsewhere do not wish to move and it is the 'use' value of the lot as a place to live and raise a family that is more important than the exchange value. But those that do need to move out will be hard-pressed to find a buyer, since the increased value of their now consolidated properties places the total cost beyond most of the effective demand. Thus property prices are depressed and/or transactions will move back into informal exchanges creating potential further downstream title irregularities.\n0i1k | Other researchers who are also sceptical of de Soto's views about the merits of title and its benefits in bringing people into the formal market-place have shown that immobility is the rule, not the exception, and that the effective demand is extremely limited. In Mexico, for example, only those former irregular settlements that are particularly favoured in their location are likely to attract buy-outs from better-off working-class or lower-middle-income residents. Similarly, prime lots such as those on block corners or along main streets may be attractive to commercial establishments and here the full lot value may be realised. But, for most first-generation homesteaders, a dwelling is for life, and the lot and home are likely to be recast and remodelled to take account of second- and third-generation households or kinsmen sharing the lot or dwelling space. Texas colonias are similarly disadvantaged for the same reasons-a lack of effective demand-although to date, at least, there is little or no discernable densification even though this\ndqlg | will almost certainly occur as future generations grow to adulthood.\np6pq | Thus, at the meso-level analysis of colonia land markets in Texas that has been our focus in this paper, there is not much cause for optimism or for any indication that land titling is likely to have a significant impact in improving the operation of the now formal land market. Provision of legal title does not appear to unlock the 'mysteries' and benefits of capital and offer participation to the poor in colonia land markets. Supply-side policies related to regularisation and clearing of clouded lot title will have little or no effect without broader initiatives to enhance effective demand. And even though policies to install essential services and to provide greater opportunities for purchaser financing are urgently required and will undoubtedly help, real effective demand is not likely to change without improved incomes and local economic opportunities. Researchers in Texas and elsewhere are unlikely to find much 'mystery' in that.\nzse6 | to different base-level years nineteen eighty-three in the survey, and two thousand two in CRG database analysis. In order to convert nineteen eighty-three constant prices to those of two thousand two, one should multiply by one point seven three five. The 'trimmed mean' is the average in which the highest and lowest five percent of values are excluded. These â€˜outliers' often significantly distort the overall mean and can lead to misleading conclusions. It is safe to use the trimmed mean so long as there is a sufficiently large number of data points. Where that is not the case, one should use the mean with caution or, better still, take the median value.",
