As introduced in Chapter three, to be most therapeutic a mode must be used purely, without confusion with another mode. Pure use of modes communicates a single message, and it ensures that the therapist is taking responsibility for his or her chosen means of communicating within a given moment.\nnorp | For example, when a therapist functioning in the collaborative mode during the time a client is engaging in a familiar task notes that a client appears to need more structure and guidance when engaging in an unfamiliar task, this observation would naturally prompt a shift from the collaborating mode to the instructing mode. In this case, the therapist may cease turning to the client for input and may, instead, make a statement such as: \"Would you like me to provide you with some guidance for this task?\" Assuming that the client wishes for this guidance, the therapist would then begin to provide clear instruction, making suggestions along the way and providing constructive feedback, where necessary.\nchx3 | Mode Mismatch, Mixed and Incongruent Mode Use\nsfcf | There are three circumstances that characterize suboptimal mode use: a mode mismatch, mixed mode use, and incongruent mode use. A mode mismatch occurs when a therapist communicates within a mode that does not meet the client's interpersonal needs or is inconsistent with the client's interpersonal characteristics or any interpersonal events that happen to be occurring in that moment. In Chapter one, when the topic of chemotherapy came up between Erika and her client Vera, Erika presented a research article about recent advances in chemotherapy while smiling to illustrate her point. In this instance, Erika's attempt to use the instructing mode of communication should be considered a mode mismatch. As a mode mismatch, her attempt failed for two reasons. First, the instructing mode would not be the first mode that the IRM would recommend for a client whose predominant interpersonal characteristic involves a high need for control. Clients that need to be in control do not always appreciate receiving unsolicited information. Second, the interpersonal event that occurred between Vera and Erika, a power dilemma, also characterizes a situation\nnuxs | typically be avoided. Vera and Erika were debating or arguing with a client about a given topic (Erika supporting the use of chemotherapy versus Vera not supporting the use of chemotherapy). In this circumstance, Erika providing information to justify her opposing position was not appreciated by Vera. Although Vera did not share her reaction directly with Erika at the time, she later requested to be assigned to a different therapist.\numx0 | The second circumstance of suboptimal mode use concerns mixing modes. Mixing modes occurs when a therapist is not clear about his or her intended message and conveys two modes simultaneously within a single moment of communication (typically within the same sentence). When one wishes to shift from one mode to another, one should ensure that there is a strong rationale for the mode shift and that the two modes can be easily distinguishable by the type of phrase, action, or question chosen, and by the congruity of one's facial expression and body language. In doing this, the word but should not be used to join the modes. The rationale for avoiding the word but is that it is a word that conveys contradiction. When joining two ideas, using this word undermines the first idea, and, at the same time, the second idea is not any more convincing (because the first idea remains, undeniably, a part of the sentence). When a therapist intends to empathize with a client and, instead, blends the empathizing mode with the instructing mode, he or she sends a mixed message to the client about his or her true thoughts, feelings, and intentions. For example, a therapist locked in a power struggle with her client regarding the client's alcohol use sends a mixed message by saying in a single breath: \"I understand why you want to use alcohol, but I am concerned that, among other things, it will interact with your other medications and exacerbate your balance problems.\" This can be confusing for clients, and it weakens the intended message or messages. Ultimately, it may weaken the therapist's influence within the relationship and the client's trust in the process.\no306 | The third circumstance of suboptimal mode use involves mode incongruence. Incongruent mode use occurs when a therapist shows emotional incongruence when communicating with a client. Emotional incongruence occurs when a person is communicating one statement verbally and the same person's emotional expression, facial expression, or body language contradicts or does not support what the person is saying. Correspondingly, mode incongruence occurs when a therapist delivers a mode\nqm1b | verbally but his or her facial expression or body language is inconsistent with the mode or with the overall interpersonal context of the communication. In Chapter one, when Erika smiled as she delivered the instructing mode, her smile was a nervous smile, and it was emotionally incongruent. Typically, it is not appropriate to smile during an intense dialogue or argument. Mode incongruence happens frequently, particularly when a therapist is nervous or uncomfortable during an interaction. Table four point two presents a synopsis of the three circumstances of suboptimal mode use and additional examples. It is important to note that emotional incongruence, in general, is most likely to occur within the overall context of suboptimal communication; it is not something that occurs exclusively during mode use. This will be covered in more detail in a later chapter.\nn9ms | Mode Shifting: Avoiding Suboptimal Communication\nicdp | Much more can be accomplished interpersonally if a therapist shifts modes clearly and intentionally by applying interpersonal reasoning. When shifting modes, three powerful techniques may be used to separate the communication of one mode from another. The first involves\nwtse | between the two phrases or sentences that characterize the different modes, the more likely it is that the client will understand that a different approach to communication is being used. The second concerns body language. If appropriate within the therapeutic context, the therapist should move to a different part of the room, change posture, or, if appropriate, shift the therapeutic activity to mark the new idea being communicated. The third involves announcing one's intention to shift modes to the client. Ideally, any two or, if appropriate, all three of these techniques will maximize the likelihood that the mode shift will take place in a way that the client fully understands that a different approach to communication is being used.\nbm7g | In the example about the client with alcoholism, the therapist could have applied any three of these techniques to shift modes cleanly, improving the clarity and intentionality of communication with the client. If the therapist would have used the pausing technique, she would have taken considerable time to listen to and understand the client's perspective on alcohol use, asking a few additional deepening questions to better understand what initiated and is sustaining the addiction, if appropriate. Then, after the therapist received some nonverbal or verbal indication from the client indicating that she has felt fully seen and heard, the therapist would shift into an instructing",
