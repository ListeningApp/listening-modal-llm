You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

ftfg | Grief Counseling and Grief Therapy
7xi5 | The main distinctions between grief and depression are these: In depression as well as grief, you may find the classic symptoms of sleep disturbance, appetite disturbance, and intense sadness; however, in a grief reaction, there is not the loss of self-esteem commonly found in most clinical depressions. That is, the people who have lost someone do not have less regard for themselves as a result of such a loss, or if they do, it tends to be for only a brief time. And if the survivors of the deceased experience guilt, it is usually guilt associated with some spe- cific aspect of the loss rather than a general overall sense of culpability. Even though grief and depression share similar objective and subjec- tive features, they do seem to be different conditions. Depression over- laps with bereavement but is not the same (Robinson & Fleming, 1989, 1992; Wakefield & Schmitz, 2013; Worden & Silverman, 1993; Zisook & Kendler, 2007). Freud believed that in grief, the world looks poor and empty, while in depression, the person feels poor and empty. These differences in cognitive style have been identified by Beck and associ- ates (1979) and other cognitive therapists who have suggested that the depressed have negative evaluations of themselves, the world, and the future. Although such negative evaluations can exist in the bereaved, they tend to be more transient.
w8r5 | However, there are some bereaved individuals who do develop major depressive episodes (MDE) following a loss (Zisook, & Kendler, 2007; Zisook, Paulus, Shucter & Judd, 1997; Zisook & Shuchter, 1993, 2001). The recent Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (5th ed .; DSM-5; American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2013) allows for this distinc- tion. Zisook and colleagues (2012), who were influential in the drop- ping of the previous 2-month bereavement exclusion where depression could not be diagnosed in the bereaved until 2 months after the death, argue that, "the preponderance of data suggests that bereavement-related depres- sion is not different from MDE that presents in any other context; it is equally genetically influenced, most likely to occur in individuals with past personal and family histories of MDE, has similar personality characteristics and patterns of comorbidity, is as likely to be chronic and/or recurrent, and responds to antidepressant medications." If a major depressive episode develops during bereavement, this should be considered a type of complicated mourning-exaggerated grief (see Chapter 5).
ybik | At Yale, Jacobs, Hansen, Berkman, Kasi, and Ostfeld (1989), Jacobs et al. (1990), and Jacobs, Nelson, and Zisook (1987) have been interested in depression within the context of bereavement. According to them, "Although the majority of depressions of bereavement are transient and require no professional attention, there is growing appreciation that some depressions, especially those that persist throughout the first year
gii5 | 1 Attachment, Loss, and the Experience of Grief
q5eu | of bereavement, are clinically significant" (1987, p. 501). They have used antidepressant medication to treat patients whose depression persisted late into the course of bereavement and did not resolve spontaneously or respond to interpersonal interventions. These were usually people who had a history of depression or some other mental health disorder. They found improvement in sleep disorders and appetite disturbance as well as an improvement in mood and cognition. This response sug- gests a biological dimension to the depression.
a7ao | A section in the DSM-5 (APA, 2013) advises that:
29a3 | Responses to a significant loss [such as bereavement] may include the feeling of intense sadness, rumination about the loss, insomnia, poor appetite and weight loss which may resemble a depressive episode. Although such symptoms may be understandable or con- sidered appropriate to the loss, the presence of a major depres- sive episode in addition to the normal response to a significant loss should also be carefully considered. This decision inevitably requires the exercise of clinical judgement based on the individu- al's history and the cultural norms for the expression of distress in the context of loss. (p. 95)
sb1e | One of the functions of the counselor who has contact with peo- ple during the time of acute grief is to assess which patients might be undergoing a major depression by using current standard diagnostic criteria from the DSM-5 (APA, 2013). Patients so identified can then be given additional help such as a medical evaluation and possibly the use of antidepressant medications. Once depression begins to lift through medication, then the focus of treatment changes to the underlying con- flicts of the attachment. These conflicts cannot be addressed through medications alone (Miller et al., 1994).
w2yn | If grief is defined as one's experiences after a loss, then mourning is the process one goes through leading to an adaptation to the loss. In the next two chapters, we look at the mourning process in detail.
