        "content": "hone | When a person has low avoidance but high anxiety, their attachment style is preoccupied.\nsngr | Dismissive attachment happens when a person's anxiety is low, but their avoidance is high.\nojot | When someone is high in both anxiety and avoidance, they have a fearful-avoidant style.\nrg5s | These dimensions also influence each other. For example, both the secure and preoccupied styles are low in attachment avoidance, but their differences in attachment anxiety will alter the way a person expresses their attachment. Someone lower in attachment anxiety will approach a partner from a more secure stance, moving\nyppk | towards them with a sense of openness, flexibility and interdependence, whereas someone who is higher in anxiety is more likely to seek proximity to their partner in order to grasp at or control them, be overly dependent on them, or simply to alleviate their own fears and anxiety.\net9b | On the flip side, the internal experience of being higher in attachment avoidance will be very different based on where someone is positioned on the attachment anxiety dimension. Someone who is high in avoidant behaviors but low in attachment anxiety might experience minimal internal conflict when there is increased distance from a partner-this person may not even recognize their own high avoidance. Someone who is equally high in avoidance but higher in anxiety can feel an enormous amount of internal conflict and distress. Their avoidance does not necessarily feel like a safe refuge for them, but can feel more like a freeze response. This person feels two things at once: desire for proximity to a partner but fear of what that closeness might bring.\n1svs | I also think that the ways someone might experience being low in attachment anxiety will vary greatly depending on where they lie in the attachment avoidance dimension. For example, both the secure and dismissive styles would be considered as being low in attachment anxiety, but I don't think they are felt in the same way. Someone who is more secure and lower in attachment avoidance probably experiences little anxiety, whereas for someone who is more dismissive and higher in attachment avoidance, low anxiety is probably related to the repressing or evading of anxious feelings rather than not having them.\nizqt | Both personally and professionally I have experienced this four-quadrant model as more both more precise and more useful than simply talking about the four attachment styles as stand-alone concepts. When I present attachment in this way to workshop participants and clients, they express being able to better place themselves within these dimensions. We are then able to have much more nuanced and empowering conversations about approach/avoidance behaviors and low or high anxiety. With this model, people seem better able to reflect on how and why these dimensions play out (often differently) in their relationships. Clients often describe\nvub1 | feeling less \"pathologized\" by this approach.\nzfhy | Speaking for myself, before learning about these dimensions, I was often confused about exactly where I fit within the three insecure styles. From going through the Adult Attachment Interview with my own therapist, I knew I had earned secure attachment, but there were still times when my insecure strategies arose, especially when under relational stress. I could place some of my behaviors in the dismissive style (I was self-reliant to a fault) but not all of them (I'm extremely empathic, comfortable with intimacy and emotionally focused). I could definitely relate to several of the ways the preoccupied style internally experiences things, but externally I was not presenting as the anxious preoccupied type at all. Some of my childhood experiences undoubtedly fall into the disorganized camp, but the initial descriptions of the fearful-avoidant style that I encountered were encumbered with much more volatility, toxicity and dysfunction than I had experienced in my adult life and relationships.\np9bw | When I came across Mikulincer and Shaver's two-dimensional description of attachment I could immediately place myself as sometimes being high in anxiety and high in avoidance (fearful avoidance). Under certain circumstances, I experience internal anxiety, feel mentally preoccupied with relational dynamics and have emotional flare-ups in response to the slightest signal that a partner is withdrawing or low in their ability to be present and attuned. But externally, I was more likely to withdraw, play it cool and take the self-reliant route. My reaction could go unnoticed or be seen as me pulling in and withdrawing, but internally I was thrashing around, getting emotional whiplash from the \"one foot on the gas and one foot on the brake\" experience. The two-dimensional model offered more accuracy in understanding my own attachment style and helped me to identify the directions I still needed to focus on in my own healing.\n2l8i | I've found that many of my clients also describe relating to this style. They too are not presenting in the more extreme ways that the fearful-avoidant style is typically depicted, where mental illness, violence, abuse and-or forms of self-abuse are\nlocx | at play, but nonetheless they are functioning from this style and still need support in the unresolved trauma and pains that it surfaces from. These less extreme or overt expressions of fearful-avoidance can easily go undetected by professionals, leaving people confused about how to understand and identify their own attachment experiences. For any psychological model, there will always be people who do not neatly fit into what the theory or diagnostic criteria state, and when a typology is too rigid it can easily leave people to fall through the cracks. It is important that we recognize the significance of these different attachment categories and acknowledge that they are shining a beneficial light on specific patterns that arise for people. But we also need to hold these categorical descriptions with some flexibility. Different attachment patterns can exist on a spectrum, such as in this case with fearful-avoidant showing up in mild, moderate or more extreme expressions.\nz2dl | FROM DYSFUNCTION TO DESIRE\nvtxq | Another way to conceive of the attachment dimensions is not through their \"dysfunctions,\" but through their strengths and desires. Defining the attachment styles through the dimensions of attachment avoidance and attachment anxiety can easily paint a bleak picture of dysfunction and leave people focusing on what's \"wrong\" with them. Based on this two-dimensional model, even a secure attachment, which is revered as the desired goal, is just being framed as how low in attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance it is, instead of being presented in its fullness with all the positive strengths and capacities that this attachment style embodies.\n571b | Let's take a person with a dismissive style as an example and look at how negative framing works. Because they're high on the avoidance axis and low on the anxiety axis, someone with a dismissive style is likely to use distancing and deactivating strategies when faced with relationship challenges. On the other end of the spectrum, someone in the preoccupied style sits low on the avoidance axis and high on the anxiety axis. Their strategies look more like hyperactivation and pursuing their partner in moments of relationship pain.\nfg6a | But we don't need to only use this negative framing of how these attachment-based emotional tendencies often play out.
