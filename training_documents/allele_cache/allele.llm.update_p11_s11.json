        "content": "favz | Accounting for BAD. The observed distribution of ChIP-Seq allelic read counts on heterozygous SNVs significantly depends on aneuploidy and the CNV profile of the cells. The modes of distribution correspond to the most represented copy number, e.g., the distribution is bimodal for mostly triploid K five six two cells. However, the mixture of two Binomial distributions poorly approximates the data, showing a significant overdispersion. To systematically reduce the overdispersion from local CNVs and aneuploidy, we reconstructed the genome-wide BAD maps from read counts at the heterozygous variants. The distributions of the allelic read counts at SNVs segregated by BAD show a notably reduced overdispersion.\n7szx | BAD calling with Bayesian changepoint identification. To construct genome-wide BAD maps from filtered heterozygous SNV calls, we developed a novel algorithm, the BAD caller by Bayesian changepoint identification.\nhx9e | At the first stage, BABACHI divides the chromosomes into smaller sub-chromosome regions by detecting centromeric regions, long deletions, loss of heterozygosity regions, and other regions depleted of SNVs. At this stage, only the distances between neighboring SNVs are taken into account and long gaps are marked. The sub-chromosome regions with fewer than three SNVs or chromosomes with one hundred each sub-\nywn2 | X equals the minimum. Be distributed according to the truncated Binomial distribution given that the number of reads overlapping the variant; the number of successes k is limited to five is less than or equal to k is less than or equal to n minus five, the read coverage filter, and P is either one divided by the quantity BAD plus one or BAD divided by the quantity BAD plus one, matching one of the expected allelic read frequencies.\na63r | BAD of each segment is selected from the discrete set one, four thirds, three halves, two, five halves, three, four, five, six, considering that the total copy number of a particular genomic region rarely exceeds seven. The prior distribution of BAD is assumed to be a discrete uniform, with the support being the same discrete set as above, non-informative prior. Details and mathematical substantiation of the algorithm are provided in the Supplementary Methods.\ndqvj | Practical BAD calling with the ADASTRA pipeline. To provide better genome coverage and robust BAD estimates, we merged the sets of variant calls from ChIP-Seq data sets produced in the same laboratory for the same cell type and in the same series, i.e., sharing either ENCODE biosample or GEO G S E ID. Different SNVs at the same genome position, either originating from different data sets or with different alternative alleles, were considered as independent observations. For each data set, chromosomes with fewer than one hundred SNVs were excluded from BAD calling and further analysis.\nr17u | To assess the reliability of the BAD maps, for each BAD, we separately estimated ROC and PRC. Here we considered the BAD maps as binary classifiers according to BAD, with COSMIC CNV data as the ground truth.

The paired-end reads of MCF seven deep genome sequencing (SRA accession S R R eight six five two one zero five) were aligned to hg thirty-eight genome assembly using bowtie two with default settings. Overall, twenty-eight million, two hundred seventy-eight thousand, twenty-six, two point five percent of a total of one billion, one hundred thirty-six million, six hundred sixty-six thousand, five hundred sixty paired reads were marked as duplicates, one hundred twelve million, three hundred twenty-three thousand, nine hundred twenty-five, nine point nine percent were filtered by GATK filter by mapping quality greater than or equal to ten, leaving nine hundred ninety-six million, sixty-four thousand, six hundred nine reads for SNP calling. A total of three million, nine hundred sixty-nine thousand, two hundred fifty SNPs was reported by GATK HaplotypeCaller, among which one million, four hundred twenty-seven thousand, four hundred ninety-two SNPs were annotated as heterozygous, passed the basic ADASTRA filter, greater than or equal to five reads on each allele, and were used to produce the independent reference MCF seven BAD map with BABACHI sixty-nine.\nsvhz | ASB calling with the Negative Binomial mixture model. To account for mapping separate Negative Binomial mixture models for the scoring of Ref-and Alt- ASBs. For each BAD and each fixed read count at Ref- and Alt- alleles, we obtained separate fits using SNVs from all available data sets.\noaen | For every fixed read count value at a particular allele, we approximated the distribution of read counts mapped to the other allele as a mixture of two Negative Binomial distributions. The model estimates the number of successes X, the number of reads mapped to the selected allele, given the number of failures R, the number of reads mapped to the second allele, in the series of Bernoulli trials with probability of success P for the first distribution in the mixture or one minus P for the second distribution in the mixture.
