For the internalizing subgroup, most children transitioned to the no problems subgroup (T one - T two: forty-three point one percent, T two - T three: fifty-one point zero percent), with some transitioning to the externalizing (T one - T two: three point four percent, T two - T three: seven point seven percent) and DP (T one - T two: fifteen point five percent, T two - T three: three point seven percent) subgroups. Those children in the externalizing subgroup were also likely to transition to the no problems subgroup (T one - T two: thirty-five point six percent, T two - T three: thirty-three point four percent), and to a lesser extent to the internalizing (T one - T two: ten point one percent, T two - T three: eight point one percent) and DP (T one - T two: seventeen point zero percent, T two - T three: ten point seven percent) subgroups. Lastly, for those in the DP, the transition probability towards the no problems group decreased with age (T one - T two:\ne8nr | twenty-one point nine percent, T two - T three: eight point six percent), whereas the probability of transitioning towards the internalizing subgroup (T one - T two: eleven point one percent, T two - T three: thirty-five point six percent) increased with age and transitioning to the externalizing subgroup remained stable across age (T one - T two: twenty-two point three percent, T two - T three: twenty-two point one percent). Transition probabilities for the model including covariates were similar to those obtained in the model without covariates and are presented in Supplementary Table five and six.\nk78w | Discussion\ng9du | We utilized three time points of behavioral assessments in a large, population-based birth cohort to examine stability and change in symptoms of psychopathology from childhood into adolescence. Similar to earlier studies, subgroups of psychopathology included four profiles, namely; no problems, internalizing, externalizing and DP. In line with our hypotheses, we observed that externalizing behavior becomes more stable with age, but that the stability of children remaining within the DP subgroup decreases from late childhood into adolescence. Contrary to our hypothesis, internalizing problems did not become increasingly stable with age. Interestingly, the majority (fifty-one percent) of the children classified in the internalizing subgroup in late childhood progressed to the no problems group in adolescence. Our most notable finding is that, while there is considerable change in behavior for children classified in the DP in childhood, the vast majority (ninety-one percent of the children) remain in one of the three psychopathology subgroups.\nf682 | Not surprising, the largest number of children was classified as having no problems across childhood and adolescence. Further, the homotypic continuity observed in this subgroup was eighty-five to eighty-eight percent, meaning that most individuals that do not exhibit psychopathology at an early age, will remain having no psychopathology in adolescence. However, our results also indicate that five to eight percent of the children that had no problems in either early or late childhood, transition towards the internalizing group in early childhood or early adolescence, and similarly about six percent transitioned towards the externalizing subgroup. Studying potential underlying mechanisms, including genetic, biological and environmental factors, could ultimately help study and implement prevention strategies targeted on those individuals at-risk.\nli1k | Together with the work by Basten et al. we show that from late toddlerhood until late childhood the percentage of children included in the internalizing subgroup increases, whereas the rates of children classified in the internalizing subgroup remains stable from late childhood into adolescence. Indeed, studies assessing the age of onset for internalizing disorders find that anxiety disorders, dependent of the subtype of disorder, can emerge at any time during life, whereas the incidence of mood disorders begins to rise\npbea | during adolescence. However, the median age of onset for specific anxiety and mood disorders is either in early childhood or after early adolescence, with the exception of social phobia. The stable prevalence we observe between late childhood and early adolescence suggests a certain stability in the rate of anxiety symptoms, with fewer children developing internalizing symptoms during this age range. More importantly, in late childhood and early adolescence we found that an increasing proportion of those who transition to the internalizing symptoms subgroup, transitioned either from the externalizing or the DP subgroup at an earlier time point. Thus, these individuals represent a group of children who are already identifiably at-risk, as opposed to those who develop internalizing symptoms after initially having no problems. A future extension of our findings should assess whether intervening to reduce externalizing and DP symptoms can help prevent the later development of internalizing symptoms in those individuals.\nccpt | We found an increase in the percentage of children with externalizing behavior as these children develop from early childhood into adolescence. This pattern has been observed in earlier work using LPA and it is known that externalizing disorders, such as oppositional defiant disorder and conduct disorder, can develop until late childhood. However, studies have also found a decrease in continuous externalizing symptoms using growth modelling in this age range. While at first glance these results appear contradicting, LTA results obtained in our study as well as in earlier work show that children transitioning to the externalizing subgroup are mainly those who were in the DP at earlier time points. As those in the DP have higher symptoms on all syndrome scales, this increase in individuals in the externalizing subgroup is in line with a decrease in continuous externalizing symptoms. Moreover, those children who transitioned out of the externalizing subgroup, transitioned primarily to the no problems subgroup, which also translates into an overall decrease in externalizing symptoms.\n0fpw | Although a similar pattern for stability within the internalizing and externalizing subgroups was observed earlier, the homotypic continuity we observe is lower than previously reported. Most notably, a larger number of children from the internalizing and externalizing subgroups in early or late childhood transitioned to the no problems group over time, suggesting that for many children symptoms of psychopathology during childhood are a transient phase of development. The differences in homotypic continuity might reflect actual differences between the samples used, but are also likely to be partially dependent on the differences in how psychopathology is reported on the CBCL used here and the Development and Wellbeing Assessment used in earlier work. Whereas the CBCL is a continuous measure of psychopathology, the Development and Wellbeing Assessment is a structured\ndqn8 | clinical interview to diagnose psychopathology. Because of our use of continuous measures, the internalizing and externalizing subgroup consists of children with mostly subclinical symptoms. Possibly, homotypic continuity is higher for those with clinical diagnoses than for those with subclinical symptoms. It would thus be interesting to study whether the initial level of symptoms is predictive of the likelihood that children have persistent problems in a sample enriched for children with subclinical and clinical levels of psychopathology.",
