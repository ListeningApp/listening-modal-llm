Nevertheless, when comparing these models' advantages and disadvantages, the potential outcomes are considered to outweigh the ethical questions when these are properly addressed.\ngxfd | As mentioned before, cancer three-D models can be applied to various fields of research and development, such as the preclinical testing of metallodrugs. Next, we describe and discuss the importance of metallodrugs in cancer, as well as the application of cancer three-D models for the preclinical evaluation of these types of drugs.\ns2v1 | Four. Metallodrugs in Cancer\njkp9 | Currently, there are several targeted therapies available to treat different types of cancer, for example, anti-hormonal treatments and monoclonal antibodies against cancer cell-specific receptors. Nevertheless, conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy remain the key tools for cancer treatment. Thus, there is an unmet need to develop innovative and improved pharmacological options for cancer therapy, but the design and development of effective anti-cancer drugs with high selectivity, minimal toxicity, and reduced side effects is still a challenging endeavor.\nz8tt | Metal-based compounds have been used throughout history for their therapeutic properties. Despite the widespread use of this type of compound, the absence of a clear demarcation between therapeutic and hazardous dosages posed a significant obstacle. In the nineteen sixties, the \"accidental\" discovery by Barnett Rosenberg of cisplatin (cis-platanum-ammonia-dichloride), a platinum compound, paved the way for modern metal-based anti-cancer drugs. Besides platinum, research regarding the application of other transition metals, such as ruthenium, gold, silver, iron, copper, arsenic, and cobalt, as anti-tumoral compounds have gained increasing interest among the scientific community, and a wide range of metal-based compounds has been developed.\n9g22 | Transition metal complexes have been particularly explored for therapeutic applications in cancer due to their distinctive properties such as redox activity, various coordination modes (allowing for the design of different metal complexes), d orbitals partially filled (allowing for electrons to be easily removed or added to these orbitals, making them suitable to act as catalysts or to develop compounds with multiple oxidation states), and reactivity towards organic substrates (allowing for the design of drugs that preferentially interact with a biomolecular target). Additionally, metals have the important characteristic of forming positively charged ions in an aqueous solution, which can bind to negatively charged biomolecules. Therefore, the compound's charge can be modified according to the coordination environment, directing the drug to the desired biological target. Furthermore, the metal itself, the ligand, and the metal-ligand interactions endow different characteristics to metal complexes, and thus metal-based anticancer agents can be generally classified as functional compounds, structural compounds, metal ions as carriers of active ligands, metal compounds that behave as catalysts, and photoactive metal compounds.\n41fx | The chemical and anti-tumoral properties, as well as the potential mechanism of action of metallodrugs, have been extensively reviewed elsewhere, and the reader is referred to excellent publications for further information on this topic, which is out of the scope of the present review.\n7um8 | Despite the intense research in the design and biological evaluation of novel anti-cancer metallodrugs with very promising results that, in some instances led to advancement to clinical trials (particularly for platinum and ruthenium-based compounds), very few have been approved for clinical use. Cisplatin was approved in nineteen seventy-eight for the treatment of advanced bladder, testicular, and ovarian cancers, followed by two other platinum-based drugs: carboplatin, which started to be used in clinical practice in nineteen eighty-nine for the treatment of initial ovarian cancer, and oxaliplatin, which was approved in nineteen ninety-six, in Europe, and two thousand three, in the USA, for advanced colorectal cancer. Other than these, the only metallic non-platinum drug that was clinically approved in the two thousands for cancer therapy is arsenic trioxide.\nuow2 | Five. Three-Dimensional Models as Tools to Test Metallodrugs\niat7 | When considering the preclinical testing scenario of different types of anticancer drugs such as organic and inorganic small molecules, antibodies, or biological-based drugs and metallodrugs, three-D cellular models present favorable characteristics that promote a more realistic evaluation of the antitumoral potential of these different classes of drugs, and potentially improve drug discovery and development. However, in the pharmaceutical industry, drug portfolios are increasingly diversified with only forty-fifty percent being small molecules, and there are now a broad diversity of chemistries and mechanisms of action or toxicity to consider. Therefore, for three-D models to become widely implemented as new preclinical models, there is still the need for a demonstration that their performance is reliable across a suitably broad set of compounds, such as large molecules and biologic therapies in a robust and repeatable manner, and the definition of ways for companies to implement the technology within routine preclinical workflows.\nywwr | In the case of metallodrugs, despite the numerous advantages of three-D models described in the previous sections, the application of these platforms is still quite scarce. Conventional two-D and animal models appear to be the standard tools to test the biological response to metallodrugs. As mentioned previously, there is not an ideal model that is able to fully recapitulate in vivo tumor characteristics; therefore, two-D, three-D, and animal models should be incorporated into cancer research, each one allowing for evaluating different aspects of the therapeutic potential of a metallodrug.\n0i6j | Particularly relevant for metallodrugs is the establishment of oxygen gradients within the three-D multicellular structure, as some complexes are redox active, and this feature allows for a more realistic evaluation of their predicted in vivo activity. Additionally, the availability of several analytical techniques suitable for the determination of the metal distribution and the metallodrug's active species is an experimental advantage in the applicability of three-D models for this type of anticancer drug. Nevertheless, there are some important practical challenges in the adaptability of cancer three-D models for metallodrug testing that need to be acknowledged. For instance, suspension cultures might not be the ideal model for high-throughput assays, while some of the materials used in microengineering-based and coating-dependent models may absorb hydrophobic compounds, a common feature in several classes of metallodrugs. Several other important hurdles still need to be overcome, such as a lack of harmonization of protocols and assays, limited access to biological materials in uncommon tumor types, and particularly the time-sensitiveness of tumoroids due to the number of passages between tissue collection and drug testing.",
