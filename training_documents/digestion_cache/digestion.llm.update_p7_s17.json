        "content": "3pn1 | The main endopeptidases for most crustaceans are trypsin and chymotrypsin. Trypsin is considered one of the most important enzymes in decapod crustaceans. In Marsupenaeus japonicus and Melicertus kerathurus, this enzyme accounts for forty to fifty percent of the total proteolysis, whereas it is reported to be about fifty to sixty percent in giant tiger prawn (Penaeus monodon), kuruma shrimp (Marsupenaeus japonicus), redtail prawn (Fenneropenaeus penicillatus formerly Penaeus penicillatus), speckled shrimp (Metapenaeus monoceros) and Euphausia superba, and thirty-three percent in the fiddler crab Uca pugilator.\n\nwjuz | In giant freshwater prawn (Macrobrachium rosenbergii) trypsin and chymotrypsin account for between fifty-five and eighty-two percent of proteolytic activity. Some species produce cathepsin L as the main proteolytic enzyme e.g. the North Sea shrimp Crangon crangon and Crangon allmani most individuals of which lack trypsin and chymotrypsin.\n\n3yxv | Trypsins have been described in decapod crustaceans that are capable of hydrolysing the triple helix of native collagen under physiological conditions. These enzymes, discovered in the fiddler crab Uca pugilator, have been named \"collagenolytic proteases\". True collagenases are metalloproteases that degrade native collagen under physiological conditions, but are unable to hydrolyse denatured collagen or other native proteins. The main difference with the collagenolytic proteinases resides in the structure of the active sites. Proteases able to degrade native collagen have also been found in Penaeus monodon.\n\nd8zj | In crustaceans, amino acids are absorbed by the R-cells and F-cells of the hepatopancreas and, to a lesser extent, by the midgut intestine. Amino acids are transported to the various tissues and are utilized as required, either being incorporated into proteins or used in a range of biochemical processes. Between twenty-five and fifty percent of dietary amino acids are incorporated into the body protein. The deposition of protein is consequently a major determinant of amino acid utilization and requirements.\n\nywxn | Three point two. Carbohydrases\n\nuxhs | The term carbohydrases applies to enzymes that digest carbohydrates. Carbohydrate digestion, like protein digestion, involves hydrolysis of polymeric bonds (the bonds between polymers - chemical compound or mixture of compounds consisting of repeating structural units) and proceeds in stages until the basic units (monosaccharides) are produced. There are two classes of enzymes that hydrolyze polysaccharides (polymers of saccharides): the polysaccharidases and the oligosaccharidases. Polysaccharides are long carbohydrate molecules of up to three thousand monosaccharide units joined together. An oligosaccharide contains a relatively small number (typically two to ten) of monosaccharides.\n\ned6e | The most common polysaccharidase enzymes are amylases, which hydrolyze plant starches (amylose and amylopectin) and animal glycogen; these all are polysaccharides with alpha-bonds between the subunits.\n\n6qqm | The oligosaccharidases hydrolyze trisaccharides such as raffinose, and disaccharides, such as maltose, sucrose, lactose (milk sugar) and trehalose (a common insect sugar). Maltose, sucrose and trehalose all contain a glucose bound by an alpha-bond to a second monosaccharide and are hydrolyzed by alpha-glucosidases (e.g., maltase and sucrase - also called invertase in invertebrates - and trehalase). Glucose linked to other monosaccharides by a beta-bond (e.g. lactose, cellobiose) is hydrolyzed by beta-glycosidases (e.g. lactase or beta-galactosidase).\n\nonum | Decapod crustaceans are able to hydrolyze a great variety of polysaccharides and oligosaccharides, greatly surpassing the range of herbivorous fish. A wide range of enzymes have been identified in shrimp hepatopancreas and other sections of the digestive tract: alpha- and beta-galactosidases, alpha-fucosidase, laminarinase, alpha-mannosidase, beta-glucuronidase, beta-glucosaminidase, xylanase, alpha-xylosidase, raffinase, beta-fructofuranosidase, chitobiase and cellulase.\n\n3iir | The activity of amylases is of great importance for herbivorous crustaceans and in the (omnivorous) common prawn (Palaemon serratus), its activity is more important than proteolytic activity. Sequencing of three alpha-amylases extracted from Litopenaeus vannamei has revealed close evolutionary relationships with mammals (fifty-nine to sixty-three percent identity) and with insects (fifty-two to sixty-two percent identity).\n\n7a0a | The digestibility of starch is an important factor in determining the availability of glucose in feed formulations. The enzyme alpha-amylase hydrolyses starch into maltose. Additional enzymes, maltase and isomaltase, then hydrolyse maltose further into glucose. These enzymes are present in the gastrointestinal tract of fish and shrimp but their activity and effectiveness vary between species. Data are limited for crustacean species but in fish, a reduction in digestibility is observed when the dietary level of starch increases, irrespective of the starch origin.\n\no1qp | Data sources: Cousin and Rivas-Vega.\n\njrik | According to Stone, the reduction in the digestibility of carbohydrates when dietary levels increase may be the result of an overload on the digestive enzymes that become saturated with substrate. The threshold for enzyme saturation by substrate is unknown in crustaceans and it is not apparent in the data shown in Table Two.\n\nxv78 | Herbivorous species of fish have high activity and efficacy of starch degrading enzymes. Omnivorous species have moderate activity whilst carnivores have only a limited ability to digest starch.",
