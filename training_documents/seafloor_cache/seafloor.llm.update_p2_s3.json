        "content": "h83u | and hydrothermal fluids tend to be focused along faults with minimal influx of cold seawater and form discordant pipe-like alteration zones. In contrast, volcaniclastic-dominated strata have high permeability and porosity, promoting lateral fluid flow, widespread mixing with seawater, and broadly stratiform alteration zones. There are numerous examples of ancient volcaniclastic-hosted volcanogenic massive sulfide deposits, including the Mattabi deposit in the Sturgeon Lake Caldera Complex, Canada, the Horne and Bouchard-Hebert deposits in the Noranda mining district, Canada, the Boundary deposit in the Newfoundland Appalachians, Canada, and the Rosebery deposit in the Mount Read Volcanics belt of western Tasmania. In these deposits, the massive sulfide orebodies occur as stratiform lenses that are interpreted to form in whole or in part below the seafloor. Underlying the massive sulfide lenses, stringer mineralization is vertically restricted, occurring as semiconformable zones of disseminated sulfide mineralization. In the immediate footwall of the volcanogenic massive sulfide deposits, zones of diffuse pipe-like alteration occur along synvolcanic faults, consisting of extreme leaching, silica mobility, and iron metasomatism. Typical alteration assemblages are sericite and chlorite, occurring as matrix cement and pervasive replacement of glass-rich clasts. These diffuse pipe-like zones merge outward into more widespread semiconformable alteration zones. The geometry of these zones can be distinguished using oxygen isotope mapping, where increasing eight one eight O values of altered rocks are associated with decreasing temperatures of hydrothermal activity. Importantly, silicified horizons tend to form near the seafloor, acting as impermeable caps that isolate high-temperature circulation from shallow, low-temperature hydrothermal regimes. This highlights the importance of early hydrothermal processes, such as silicification, in controlling the pathways of subsequent fluid flow. While hydrothermal fluid flow regimes and associated alteration processes are well studied in the ancient rock record, these processes are largely unknown in modern settings due to a lack of seafloor drilling to investigate the third dimension of these systems.\nkjoa | The Tinakula seafloor massive sulfide deposit is the first identified modern analog of a mafic volcaniclastic-dominated deposit of the type described by Morton and Franklin. It is located in the Jean Charcot troughs in the northern New Hebrides back arc, centered at one six seven degrees three six minutes five zero seconds east and one two degrees one two minutes one zero seconds south. This part of the Jean Charcot troughs is characterized by enhanced magmatism where regional structures, including the east-west-trending Tikopia fracture zone, extend into the back arc. The transition from the arc to the back arc is marked by an abrupt change from tectonic extension associated with normal faulting to magmatic-tectonic extension where dike-fed lavas have erupted along linear fissures. Unlike hydrothermal systems in many deep back-arc basins, which are localized along mid-ocean ridge-type spreading centers, hydrothermal activity\nwb1c | at Tinakula is focused along a row of young mafic cinder cones on the flank of the Starfish stratovolcano. Cinder cones are common volcanic landforms but have not been widely described on the modern seafloor. These features form from the buildup of volcanic tephra associated with Strombolian-style eruptions, i.e., fire-fountaining. Submarine pyroclastic deposits associated with fire-fountaining eruptions have been described in the ancient rock record. This style of eruption may be more common in arc-proximal settings where mafic magmas have higher water contents compared to those in other tectonic settings.\nak13 | In this paper, we present a comprehensive three-dimensional study of an actively forming massive sulfide deposit, with seafloor and subseafloor components, in a nascent back-arc setting dominated by bimodal mafic volcaniclastic rocks. We investigate how features of the volcaniclastic substrate have influenced the mineralization and alteration at Tinakula, including the possible roles of boiling, fluid mixing, duration of hydrothermal activity, host-rock compositions, and magmatic contributions to the hydrothermal system.\ns7el | Regional Geology and Exploration History",
