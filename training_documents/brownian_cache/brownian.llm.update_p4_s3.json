        "content": "108o | One equals the integral DX sub f the integral from x sub i to x sub f D x of t delta of x of t minus x sub eta of t equals the integral DX sub f the integral from x sub i to x sub f D x of t delta of x dot plus V sub x minus eta of t d e t M.\nd2za | Equals the integral from x sub j D x of t delta of x dot plus V sub x minus eta of t det M.\nr38m | where the matrix M of t, t prime is:\nqq0z | M is equivalent to the partial derivative of x dot plus V sub x minus eta of t with respect to x of t prime equals the partial derivative with respect to t plus V sub x x delta of t minus t prime. This identity expresses the obvious fact that, if the particle starts at some x sub i and follows a particular history x sub eta of t dictated by the Langevin equation without disappearing, it will end up somewhere after time t sub f. We have used the standard subscript notation to denote derivative with respect to that variable e.g. V sub x x equals the partial derivative of V with respect to x x. Note that the path integral in equation thirteen is over all paths starting at x sub i at t sub i and ending at y x at t sub f. Inserting this 'fat unity' factor equation thirteen into equation eleven and noting that the delta function there restricts x of t sub f to be x sub f we obtain:\nrgva | P of x sub f given x sub i equals the integral from x of t sub i equals x sub i to x of t sub f equals x sub f D eta D x delta of x dot plus V sub x minus eta det M times the exponential of the negative integral d t of eta squared of t divided by two upsilon.\nmlcd | where the D x of t integral is taken over all paths beginning at x sub i and ending at x sub f. We can rewrite the delta function as a functional Fourier transform using a new variable x tilde which is usually called the response field:\n2qe7 | Delta of x dot plus V sub x minus eta equals the integral D x tilde exponential of i the integral d t x tilde of x dot plus V sub x minus eta.\nlpzf | There are a couple of standard ways we can incorporate det M into an exponential. We can formally write\n24rz | M equals the partial derivative with respect to t times one plus the inverse partial derivative with respect to t V sub x x is equivalent to the partial derivative with respect to t M tilde.\n091m | where\nsot6 | The inverse partial derivative with respect to t of t, t prime equals lambda theta of t minus t prime minus one minus lambda theta of t prime minus t.\nd6sf | Imposing retarded causal boundary conditions, which are appropriate for the problem at hand, requires that we set lambda equals one and we find\n7haq | Det M equals det of the partial derivative with respect to t times det M tilde proportional to the exponential of Tr log of M tilde proportional to the exponential of one half the integral d t V sub x x.\nubwu | where we used the Stratonovich prescription theta of zero equals one half. Alternatively, and to make the link with supersymmetry, we can use anticommuting Grassmann variables C and C bar such that:\nucme | Det M equals the integral D C D C bar exponential of the integral d t C bar of the partial derivative with respect to t plus V sub x x C.\nqnl5 | The determination of det M then requires appropriate boundary conditions for C bar and C, which are\nwdx9 | C of t sub in equals zero, C bar of t sub f equals zero.",
