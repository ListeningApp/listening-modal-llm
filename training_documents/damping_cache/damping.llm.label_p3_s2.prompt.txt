You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,

82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

9d4o | The rest of the paper is divided as follows. In the next sec- tion we investigate the long time behaviour of the solutions. Section 3 discusses the sensitivity of the obtained solutions with respect to nonlocal damping factor <LATEX>\zeta .</LATEX> More precisely we characterize the limit problem for both high and small <LATEX>\zeta .</LATEX> We conclude the paper in Section 4 by giving some comments.
cjq2 | 2. The Limit as t Goes to +00
5esx | We investigate the long time behaviour of the solutions. More precisely, we study the w-limit set of the trajectories and characterize the @-limit points as solutions of a suitable stationary problem. We proceed as in Carbou-Fabrie [13].
m5ka | Let <LATEX>M</LATEX> be a weak solution of (1). We call w-limit set of the trajectory <LATEX>M</LATEX> the following set:
byu8 | <LATEX>\omega \left( M \right) = \left\{ \mathrm { m } \in \mathbb{H} ^ { 1 } \left( \Omega \right) , \exists t _ { n } , \lim _ { n \rightarrow + \infty } t _ { n } = + \infty , M \left( t _ { n } , \cdot \right) \right.</LATEX> (13)
76b0 | - <LATEX>m</LATEX> in <LATEX>\mathbb{H} ^ { 1 } \left( \Omega \right)</LATEX> weakly} .
zxz6 | Consider a weak solution <LATEX>M</LATEX> of (1). From the energy estimate (12), the @-limit <LATEX>\mathrm { s e t } \omega \left( M \right)</LATEX> is nonempty. We denote by <LATEX>\mathfrak{m}</LATEX> a point of this set. There exists a nondecreasing sequence <LATEX>\left( t _ { n } \right) _ { n } ,</LATEX> such that <LATEX>t _ { n } \rightarrow + \infty</LATEX> and <LATEX>M \left( t _ { n } , \cdot \right) \rightharpoonup m</LATEX> in <LATEX>\widetilde { \Vdash } l ^ { 1 } \left( \Omega \right)</LATEX> weakly. Since <LATEX>\Omega</LATEX> is a smooth bounded domain, then <LATEX>M \left( t _ { n } , \cdot \right)</LATEX> tends to <LATEX>m</LATEX> in <LATEX>\mathbb{L} ^ { p } \left( \Omega \right)</LATEX> strongly for <LATEX>p \in \left[ 1 , 6 \left[ , \text { and } \right. \right.</LATEX> extracting a subsequence, we assume that <LATEX>M \left( t _ { n } , \cdot \right)</LATEX> tends to <LATEX>\mathfrak{m}</LATEX> almost everywhere, so that the saturation constraint <LATEX>| \mathrm { m } | = 1</LATEX> is satis- fied almost everywhere. In addition, we remark that, for all <LATEX>n ,</LATEX> <LATEX>| M \left( t _ { n } , \cdot \right) | = 1</LATEX> almost everywhere, so that <LATEX>\| M \left( t _ { n } , \cdot \right) \| _ { L ^ { \infty } \left( \Omega \right) } = 1</LATEX> 1. By interpolation inequalities in <LATEX>\mathbb{L} ^ { p }</LATEX> spaces, we obtain that, for all <LATEX>p < + \infty ,</LATEX> <LATEX>M \left( t _ { n } , \cdot \right)</LATEX> tends to m in <LATEX>\mathbb{L} ^ { P } \left( \Omega \right)</LATEX> strongly.
xnth | For <LATEX>s \in \left( - 1 , 1 \right)</LATEX> and <LATEX>x \in \Omega</LATEX> we define for <LATEX>n</LATEX> large enough
vafm | <LATEX>m _ { n } \left( s , x \right) = M \left( t _ { n } + s , x \right)</LATEX> . (14)
2zmw | We have the following convergence result.
bf9k | Lemma 4. The sequence <LATEX>\left( m _ { n } \right) _ { n \geq 1 }</LATEX> satisfies the following conver- gences:
otkr | <LATEX>m _ { n } \longrightarrow m \quad i n L ^ { 2 } \left( \left( - 1 , 1 \right) \times \Omega \right) s t r o n g l y ,</LATEX> <LATEX>m _ { n } \rightharpoonup m \quad i n L ^ { 2 } \left( \left( - 1 , 1 \right) ; \mathbb{H} ^ { 1 } \left( \Omega \right) \right) w e a k l y .</LATEX> (15)
ibgs | Proof. Following [14], we have the estimate

d6r4 | <LATEX>\frac { 1 } { 2 } \int _ { - 1 } ^ { 1 } \int _ { \Omega } | m _ { n } \left( s , x \right) - M \left( t _ { n } , x \right) | ^ { 2 } d x d s</LATEX> <LATEX>\leq \int _ { t _ { n } - 1 } ^ { + \infty } \int _ { \Omega } | \partial _ { t } M \left( \tau , x \right) | ^ { 2 } d x d \tau .</LATEX> <LATEX>\partial _ { t } M</LATEX> lies in <LATEX>L ^ { 2 } \left( R ^ { + } \times \Omega \right) ,</LATEX> one gets
9mrz | <LATEX>\lim _ { n \rightarrow + \infty } \frac { 1 } { 2 } \int _ { - 1 } ^ { 1 } \int _ { \Omega } | m _ { n } \left( s , x \right) - M \left( t _ { n } , s \right) | ^ { 2 } d x d s = 0 .</LATEX> (17)
pk06 | Since <LATEX>M \left( t _ { n } , \cdot \right)</LATEX> tends to m in <LATEX>L ^ { 2 } \left( \Omega \right)</LATEX> strongly, <LATEX>m _ { n }</LATEX> tend to m in <LATEX>\mathbb{L} ^ { 2 } \left( \left( - 1 , 1 \right) ; \mathbb{L} ^ { 2 } \left( \Omega \right) \right)</LATEX> strongly. Moreover, we have obviously seen
7wn9 | that <LATEX>\left( \nabla m _ { n } \right) _ { n \geq 1 }</LATEX> is bounded in <LATEX>L ^ { 2 } \left( \left( - 1 , 1 \right) \times \Omega \right)</LATEX> so there exists a subsequence still denoted by <LATEX>\left( m _ { n } \right) _ { n \geq 1 }</LATEX> such that <LATEX>m _ { r } ,</LATEX> tends to <LATEX>m</LATEX> in <LATEX>L ^ { 2 } \left( \left( - 1 , 1 \right) , \left[ \right] ^ { 1 } \left( \Omega \right) \right)</LATEX> weakly and in <LATEX>\mathbb{L} ^ { 2 } \left( \left( - 1 , 1 \right) , \mathbb{L} ^ { 2 } \left( \Omega \right) \right)</LATEX> strongly almost everywhere in <LATEX>\left( - 1 , 1 \right) \times \Omega .</LATEX> This ends the proof of the lemma.
wcd0 | Now, we consider a function <LATEX>\rho \in \mathscr{C} _ { 0 } ^ { \infty } \left( \left( - 1 , 1 \right) \right)</LATEX> such that <LATEX>0 \leq \rho \left( \tau \right) \leq 1 , | \rho ^ { \prime } \left( \tau \right) | \leq 2 .</LATEX> In the weak formulation (11) we take as test function <LATEX>G \left( t , x \right) = \rho \left( t - t _ { n } \right) \Psi \left( x \right) ,</LATEX> where <LATEX>\Psi</LATEX> is a function lying in <LATEX>\mathscr{D} \left( \bar { \Omega } \right)</LATEX> and <LATEX>n</LATEX> fixed. We obtain after the change of variables
caos | <LATEX>s = t - t _ { n }</LATEX> <LATEX>\frac { 1 } { 1 + \alpha ^ { 2 } } \left( \int _ { - 1 } ^ { 1 } \int _ { \Omega } \left( \partial _ { t } m _ { n } \left( s , x \right) - \alpha m _ { n } \left( s , x \right) \times \partial _ { t } m _ { n } \left( s , x \right) \right) \right.</LATEX> <LATEX>\left. \cdot \Psi \left( x \right) \rho \left( s \right) d x d s \right) - D \int _ { - 1 } ^ { 1 } \int _ { \Omega } m _ { n } \left( s , x \right)</LATEX> <LATEX>\times \partial _ { t } m _ { n } \left( s , x \right) \cdot \partial _ { t } \Psi \left( x \right) \rho \left( s \right) d x d s</LATEX> <LATEX>- \zeta \int _ { - 1 } ^ { 1 } \int _ { \Omega } m _ { n } \left( s , x \right) \times \partial _ { i } \left( \partial _ { t } m _ { n } \right) \left( s , x \right) \cdot \partial _ { i } \Psi \left( x \right) \rho \left( s \right) d x d s</LATEX> (18)
qrvy | We take the limit of the previous equation when <LATEX>n</LATEX> tends to +00. In order to pass to the limit, we bound each term of the above formulation. For example, for the last term we have
