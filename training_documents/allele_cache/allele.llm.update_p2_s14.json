        "content": "j79f | We present a reproducible workflow for ASB calling and metaanalysis across human TFs and cell types. First, the variants are called from premade ChIP-Seq read alignments against the hg thirty-eight genome assembly. Next, the variant calls are filtered by excluding homozygous and low-covered variants (less than five reads supporting any of two alleles), as well as variants absent from the common subset as putative de novo point mutations. The filtered SNVs from related ChIP-Seq data sets (sharing the cell type and particular wet lab) are used to identify the cell type features (aneuploidy and CNVs). A total set of variants is used to assess the global read mapping bias that is used as the basis for statistical model parametrization. Finally, ASB calling is performed separately for each ChIP-Seq experiment, and the resulting allele read bias P values are aggregated using the George-Mudholkar's method for each SNV, either at the TF level (across ChIP-Seq data for a selected TF from all cell types) or the cell type level (across ChIP-Seq data for a selected cell type for all TFs).\n6tbv | We used the workflow to process seven thousand six hundred sixty-nine ChIP-Seq read alignments from GTRD covering one thousand twenty-five human TFs and five hundred sixty-six cell types, and detected more than two hundred thousand ASBs at more than two hundred thousand SNPs for various TFs and three hundred thousand ASBs for cell types passing the Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate adjusted P value of zero point zero five, see for an overview. Reaching these numbers has become possible because of the large volume of the starting data (the filtered list of considered variant calls contained more than fifty-four million entries) and the advanced statistical framework that we describe below. An overview of the\nxb13 | ARTICLE\ncxqi | ARTICLE\nqfmx | processed data sets and variant calls per TF and cell type is shown in Supplementary Figure one.\nrut3 | Estimating background allelic dosage from single-nucleotide variant calls. ASB is assessed against expected relative frequencies of reads supporting alternative alleles of a particular SNV in a particular genomic region. Assuming there was no read mapping bias, these expected frequencies would be mostly determined by the copy number of the respective genomic segments. In this study, we estimated the joint effect of local copy-number variation and global chromosome ploidy from the read counts at SNV calls, taking into account that the background for ASB calling is defined by the expected relative frequencies of the read counts supporting alternative alleles rather than by absolute allelic copy numbers.\nm3cp | We introduce background allelic dosage as the ratio of the major to minor allele dosage in the particular genomic segment, which depends on chromosome structural variants and aneuploidy. Background allelic dosage can be estimated from the number of reads mapped at each allelic variant and does not require haplotype phasing. For example, if a particular genomic region has the same copy both alleles, e.g., one to one (diploid), two to two, or three to three, then it has B A D equals one, i.e., the expected ratio of reads mapped to alternative alleles on a heterozygous SNV is one. All triploid regions have B A D equals two, and the expected allelic reads ratio is either two or one half. In general, if background allelic dosage of a particular region is known, then the expected frequencies of reads supporting alternative alleles are one divided by left parenthesis B A D plus one right parenthesis and background allelic dosage divided by\nmq4s | left parenthesis B A D plus one right parenthesis. Importantly, accounting for background allelic dosage provides an answer to the question of the necessity of overdispersion in the statistical evaluation of ASBs. In fact, a large portion of overdispersion of read counts disappears once the variant calls are segregated according to background allelic dosages of the respective genomic segments (see \"Methods\").\n95el | Background allelic dosage calling with Bayesian changepoint identification. In this study, we present a novel method for reconstructing a genome-wide background allelic dosage map of a given cell type. The idea is to find genomic regions with approximately stable background allelic dosage using the read counts at SNV calls. Assuming that both differential chromatin accessibility and sequence-specific TF binding affect only a minor fraction of variants, the read counts for most of the SNVs must be close to equilibrium and thus provide imprecise but multiple measurements of background allelic dosage.\na0a5 | We have developed a Bayesian changepoint identification algorithm, which one segments the genomic sequence into regions of the constant background allelic dosage using dynamic programming to maximize the marginal likelihood and then two assigns background allelic dosage with the maximal posterior to each segment (see \"Methods\"). An additional preprocessing employs distances between neighboring SNVs to exclude long deletions and centromeric regions from background allelic dosage estimation. The background allelic dosage caller in action is illustrated for two chromosomes using ENCODE K five sixty-two data (see the segmentation map of the complete genome with multiple deletions in Supplementary Figure two).\ngocl | We performed the background allelic dosage calling for two thousand five hundred fifty-six groups of variant calls, where each group consisted of calls obtained from ChIP-Seq alignments for a particular cell type and GEO series or ENCODE biosample ID (i.e., for K five sixty-two cells of different studies, the background allelic dosage calling was performed independently). In background allelic dosage calling, recurrent SNVs sharing IDs and found in different data sets within the same group were considered as independent observations. To systematically assess the reliability of the resulting background allelic dosage maps, we compared the predicted background allelic dosages at all SNVs with the ground truth background allelic dosages estimated from COSMIC CNV data for seventy-six matched cell",
