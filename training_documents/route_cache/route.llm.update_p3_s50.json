        "content": "j30a | Terminal diacetylenes bearing aromatic substituents five a through d were synthesized from diacetylenic diol one hundred seventy-four by potassium carbonate-induced selective deprotection of one carbinol group by the retro-Favorskii reaction followed by the Sonogashira coupling of resulting two-methylhexa-three,five-diyn-two-ol with iodoarenes and the second retro-Favorskii reaction (Scheme two). Trimethylsilyl-protected buta-one,three-diynes six c through e were prepared by the Cadiot-Chodkiewicz coupling according to known procedures. Trimethylsilyl-Protected arylbuta-one,three-diynes six a and b were available through the Sonogashira coupling of corresponding bromoalkynes with trimethylsilyl-acetylene. Iodination of terminal buta-one,three-diynes using the N-iodosuccinimide/silver nitrate system proceeded in high yields for diacetylenes two and five a, b, d, affording iodides seven a, b, d, j. However, in the case of four-(para-dimethylaminophenyl)-buta-one,three-diyne five c, iodination with the use of NIS/DBU was more efficient for the synthesis of seven c. The second approach toward iodobutadiynes based on desilylation/iodination of trimethylsilyl-diacetylenes six a through e in one-pot by NIS/silver fluoride allowed compounds seven e through i to be obtained in high yields (Scheme two).\n7bdk | Initially, copper(I)-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) of para-tolylbuta-one,three-diyne seven e with benzyl azide eight a was studied for the search of optimal conditions. A series of copper catalysts, ligands, and solvents employed earlier for the successful synthesis of five-iodo-1,4-triazoles and five-unsubstituted 1,4-triazoles were tested.\nfim0 | We found that the result of the reaction strongly depends on the nature of a catalyst, a ligand, and a solvent. It was a surprise that copper iodide with different ligands reported as the best conditions for the synthesis of five-iodotriazoles gave unsatisfactory results with the iododiacetylene seven e. The maximal twenty-five percent\nojro | yield of triazole nine a was reached in the case of tris-benzyltriazolylmethylamine (TBTA) ligand. Moreover, when we used triethylamine (TEA) as a ligand and acetonitrile as a solvent instead of tetrahydrofuran, the main reaction product detected in the reaction mixture was a tetrayne eleven. In the presence of copper iodide with glycerol, no conversion of the starting compound was observed. Solvent-free conditions using the complex copper iodide-triphenylphosphine three together with two,six-lutidine as a ligand turned out to be the most effective catalytic system, providing a complete conversion of the starting iodobutadiyne to ethynyliodotriazole nine a in ninety-two percent yield.\nl6t9 | Despite the fact that the copper(I) complex with N-heterocyclic carbene ligand was very efficient in the case of iodoalkyne/azide cycloaddition, for iododiacetylene seven e, no traces of any products were detected in the reaction mixture after eighteen hours. When copper acetate with TBTA was used, the reaction proceeded very slowly giving only traces of cycloaddition product nine a.\n1ujy | Then the scope of copper-catalyzed one-iodobuta-one,three-diyne/azide cycloaddition was explored with respect to the substituents effect at conjugate triple bonds (Scheme three).\nqzor | Copper iodide-triphenylphosphine three in the presence of two,six-lutidine was chosen as the best catalytic system. Iodobutadiynes bearing aromatic substituents with both electron-donating groups seven c, e, f and electron-withdrawing groups seven a, b and hydroxyalkyl-substituted iododiacetylenes seven g, j were studied in CuAAC with benzylazide eight a. It should be particularly emphasized that the reaction studied proceeds with a high chemoselectivity and regioselectivity and afforded exclusively one-benzyl-four-ethynyl-five-iodo-1,2,3-triazoles nine a through h in high yields.\na0by | The formation of five-iodo-four-ethynyl-1,2,3-triazoles was proved by the two-D nuclear magnetic resonance analysis of triazole nine a and additionally by X-ray analysis of the cross-coupling products thirteen d and fifteen a and b of five-iodo-four-ethynyl-1,2,3-triazoles nine a, c, d (see below).\nu1ky | A preferred coordination of a copper-catalyst to an iodo-substituted triple bond compared with an internal triple bond is supposed to be a reason for the excellent chemoselectivity of azide interaction with the iodo-substituted triple bond of one-iodobuta-one,three-diynes. On the other hand, a regioselective reaction of azides with one-iodobutadiynes could be explained by the mechanism of CuAAC for iodoalkynes with less activation barrier values for the formation of one,four-cycloadducts rather than for one,five-cycloadducts that is in agreement with numerous examples of CuAAC for iodoalkynes.\nhtm9 | It is important to note that cycloaddition of hydroxyalkyl iododiacetylenes seven g, j and dimethylamino derivative seven c required two mole percent catalyst instead of one mole percent catalyst in order to reach full conversion of one-iodo(buta-one,three-diyne). In the case of iodopenyldiacetylenes with an electron-withdrawing group, an increased catalyst loading was also essential. While two mole percent was optimal for four-chlorophenyl-substituted diyne seven a, a stronger electron-withdrawing group nitro, seven b demanded five mole percent catalyst. The drop of reactivity for iodobutadiynes bearing an electron-withdrawing group could be explained in less donating ability of the iodo-substituted triple bond because of conjugation with the electron-withdrawing group, that would hinder the formation of pi copper-alkyne complexes, which is very important in the proposed mechanism of CuAAC with iodoalkynes.\n8hul | Further reaction capabilities have been studied using a series of structurally and functionally diverse azides eight b through i with variedly substituted one-iodobutadiynes seven a, g through j (Scheme four).",
