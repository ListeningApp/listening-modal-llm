        "content": "bqfb | Much has been learned about the biology of the eosinophil and its role in the pathogenesis of allergic, gastrointestinal, and hypereosinophilic disorders since its discovery in eighteen seventy-nine. The importance of its role in parasitic infections remains a large question, despite the plethora of studies in animals and human populations. Although we wait for unequivocal evidence for the salutary role of the eosinophil in helminth infections, we are left still with strong epidemiologic support for the eosinophil's benefit. Although unsatisfying as a conclusion, we must endeavor to elucidate its role more definitively if we consider the billions of persons worldwide infected with these multicellular and elusive parasitic organisms.\nwwdt | feature articles\nmn1r | Reviews and\n5vqw | feature articles\nmeyw | Reviews and\n2e62 | feature articles\n75y3 | Reviews and",
