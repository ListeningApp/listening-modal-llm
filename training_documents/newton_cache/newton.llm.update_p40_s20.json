Since script I of x sub k comma delta equals script I of x star comma zero and x sub k in the ball of x star comma delta sub cvx comma, we know equation forty-nine holds. We can refine equation forty-nine by combining Assumption three point one, script I of x sub k comma delta equals script I of x sub k comma zero equals script I of x star comma zero and equation seven c to obtain\nd1y5 | the norm of g sub k raised to the script I of x sub k comma delta equals the norm of g sub k raised to the script I of x sub k comma zero minus g star raised to the script I of x star comma zero is less than or equal to the norm of g sub k minus g star is less than or equal to L sub g times the norm of x sub k minus x star equals L sub g times the norm of x sub k raised to the script I of x sub k comma delta minus x star raised to the script I of x sub k comma delta.\nrl20 | Inexact Newton-type Methods for Optimisation with Nonnegativity Constraints\nt91r | Combining this bound,",
