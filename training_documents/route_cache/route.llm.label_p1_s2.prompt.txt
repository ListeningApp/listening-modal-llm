You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

06yq | INTRODUCTION â– 
dpv6 | During recent years 1,2,3-triazoles have been holding a leadership in different areas of fundamental and applied research. The fields of 1,2,3-triazole application are described in numerous recent reviews. The main trends are bioorthog- onal chemistry,""" organic synthesis,34 creation of new ligands and complexes5-7 and using the latter as catalysts, construction of functionalized macromolecules and polymeric materials,9-13 modified nanoparticles, 4 sensors, blocks for energetic materials, the use in medicinal chemistry for the search of new biologically active compounds, and as approved medicines 17-22
8r5j | Such a broad application of triazoles is a result of not only their functionality but also their synthetic accessibility." Among the synthetic approaches toward 1,2,3-triazoles, four general directions could be stressed: metal-catalyzed alkyne- azide cycloaddition (AAC) including mostly Cu-catalyzed <LATEX>\left( \text { CuAAC } \right) ^ { 2 4 , 2 5 }</LATEX> and Ru-catalyzed (RuAAC),2, strain-pro- moted alkyne-azide cycloaddition (SPAAC),28-30 organo- catalytic synthesis of triazoles from azides and nonalkyne C3 synthones51 using enamine-mediated5 or enolate-mediated 31 routes, and azide/alkyne/metal-free approaches.34,35 Among these methodologies, CuAAC, discovered by Sharpless, Fokin,30 and Meldal37 groups independently in 2002, remains number one for the synthesis of 1,4-disubstituted 1,2,3- triazoles due to high regioselectivity, efficiency, and tolerance in the presence of many functional groups.
2taz | Since the discovery, CuAAC has been also expanded for the regioselective synthesis of 5-iodo(bromo)-1,4-disubstituted 1,2,3-triazoles starting from iodo(bromo) alkynes38-47 (Scheme 1A) and 1-substituted 4-ethynyl-1,2,3-triazoles from either terminal diacetylenes48-54 or trialkylsilylbuta-1,3-diynes with a one-pot desylilation55-57 (Scheme 1D).

7toz | While some methodologies are presently available for the preparation of 5-iodo- and 4-ethynyl-1,2,3-triazoles, among 1,2,3-triazoles having both halogen and ethynyl moieties, the only example of a 5-chloro derivative accessible through a multistep synthetic sequence has been reported73 and 4- ethynyl-5-iodo-1,2,3-triazoles still remain unknown.

In the present work, we report the scope and limitation of this methodology along with the synthetic utility of 4-ethynyl-5-iodo-1,2,3-triazoles as versatile synthetic intermediates.
cwrw | RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
4i0e | It is of first importance that starting 1-iodobuta-1,3-diynes 7a- j are synthetically available compounds and can be synthesized either by iodination of terminal buta-1,3-diynes using different iodination agents or from TMS-protected buta-1,3-diynes

on9b | Terminal diacetylenes bearing aromatic substituents 5a-d were synthesized from diacetylenic diol 174 by K2CO3-induced selective deprotection of one carbinol group by the retro- Favorskii reaction75 followed by the Sonogashira coupling76 of resulting 2-methylhexa-3,5-diyn-2-ol (2) with iodoarenes and the second retro-Favorskii reaction (Scheme 2). TMS- Protected buta-1,3-diynes 6c-e were prepared by the Cadiot-Chodkiewicz coupling according to known proce- dures. TMS-Protected arylbuta-1,3-diynes 6a,b were available through the Sonogashira coupling of corresponding bromoal- kynes with TMS-acetylene.78 Iodination of terminal buta-1,3- diynes using the N-iodosuccinimide/AgNO3 system proceeded in high yields for diacetylenes 2 and 5a,b,d, affording iodides 7a,b,d,j. However, in the case of 4-(p-dimethylaminophenyl)- buta-1,3-diyne 5c, iodination with the use of NIS/DBU was more efficient for the synthesis of 7c. The second approach toward iodobutadiynes based on desililation/iodination of TMS-diacetylenes 6a-e in one-pot by NIS/AgF80 allowed compounds 7e-i to be obtained in high yields (Scheme 2).
a8ge | Initially, CuAAC of p-tolylbuta-1,3-diyne 7e with benzyl azide 8a was studied for the search of optimal conditions. A series of Cu catalysts, ligands, and solvents employed earlier for the successful synthesis of 5-iodo-1,4-triazoles (entries 1- 6) 38,46,81 and 5-unsubstituted 1,4-triazoles (entry 7) were tested (Table 1).
h27a | We found that the result of the reaction strongly depends on the nature of a catalyst, a ligand, and a solvent. It was a surprise that CuI with different ligands reported as the best conditions for the synthesis of 5-iodotriazoles38 gave unsatisfactory results with the iododiacetylene 7e (entries 1-3). The maximal 25%

xmgs | yield of triazole 9a was reached in the case of tris- (benzyltriazolylmethyl)amine (TBTA) ligand (entry 3). More- over, when we used triethylamine (TEA) as a ligand and MeCN as a solvent instead of THF, the main reaction product detected in the reaction mixture was a tetrayne 11 (entry 2). In the presence of Cul with glycerol, no conversion of the starting compound was observed (entry 4). Solvent-free conditions using the complex CuI(PPh3)3 together with 2,6- lutidine as a ligand46 (entry 5) turned out to be the most effective catalytic system, providing a complete conversion of the starting iodobutadiyne to ethynyliodotriazole 9a in 92% yield.
bd9h | Despite the fact that the Cu(I) complex with N-heterocyclic carbene ligand was very efficient in the case of iodoalkyne/ azide cycloaddition,4 for iododiacetylene 7e, no traces of any products were detected in the reaction mixture after 18 h (entry 6). When Cu(OAc)2 with TBTA was used,82 the reaction proceeded very slowly giving only traces of cyclo- addition product 9a (entry 7).
m047 | Then the scope of Cu-catalyzed 1-iodobuta-1,3-diyne/azide cycloaddition was explored with respect to the substituents effect at conjugate triple bonds (Scheme 3).
gy8c | CuI(PPh3)3 in the presence of 2,6-lutidine was chosen as the best catalytic system. Iodobutadiynes bearing aromatic substituents with both electron-donating groups (EDGs) 7c,e,f and electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) 7a,b and hydroxyalkyl-substituted iododiacetylenes 7g,j were studied in CuAAC with benzylazide 8a. It should be particularly emphasized that the reaction studied proceeds with a high chemoselectivity and regioselectivity and afforded exclusively 1-benzyl-4-ethynyl-5-iodo-1,2,3-triazoles 9a-h in high yields.

ousl | Scheme 4. Scope of 1-Iodobuta-1,3-diynes and Azides in CuAAC
m4ju | The formation of 5-iodo-4-ethynyl-1,2,3-triazoles was proved by the 2D NMR analysis of triazole 9a and additionally by X-ray analysis of the cross-coupling products 13d and 15a,b of 5-iodo-4-ethynyl-1,2,3-triazoles 9a,c,d (see below).83
a0mb | A preferred coordination of a Cu-catalyst to an iodo- substituted triple bond compared with an internal triple bond is supposed to be a reason for the excellent chemoselectivity of azide interaction with the iodo-substituted triple bond of 1- iodobuta-1,3-diynes. On the other hand, a regioselective reaction of azides with 1-iodobutadiynes could be explained by the mechanism of CuAAC for iodoalkynes with less activation barrier values for the formation of 1,4-cycloadducts rather than for 1,5-cycloadducts40 that is in an agreement with numerous examples of CuAAC for iodoalkynes.38,41,43,44,46,47
ki8m | It is important to note that cycloaddition of hydroxyalkyl iododiacetylenes <LATEX>7 g , j</LATEX> and dimethylamino derivative 7c required 2 mol % catalyst instead of 1 mol <LATEX>\mathfrak{o} / _ { \mathbb{C} }</LATEX> in order to reach full conversion of 1-iodo(buta-1,3-diyne). In the case of iodopenyldiacetylenes with an EWG, an increased catalyst loading was also essential. While 2 mol % was optimal for 4- chlorophenyl-substituted diyne 7a, a stronger EWG (NO2, 7b) demanded 5 mol % catalyst.84 The drop of reactivity for iodobutadiynes bearing an EWG could be explained in less donating ability of the iodo-substituted triple bond because of conjugation with the EWG, that would hinder the formation of <LATEX>\pi</LATEX> Cu-alkyne complexes, which is very important in the proposed mechanism of CuAAC with iodoalkynes.46,86
