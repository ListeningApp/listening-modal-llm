You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

o9sc | 3.6 Thermophysical parameters of hydrogen at underground storage conditions
121u | Comprehension of the thermophysical properties of hydrogen is essential for a detailed consideration of its storage potential in UHS systems. In particular, with regard to the storage of hydrogen in aquifers and depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs, a detailed consideration of its two
zh03 | thermophysical properties, density and viscosity, is essential under pressure and temperature conditions prevailing in the storage system. For this application, it is also useful to compare these properties of hydrogen with those of methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) (Figures 1, 2). All thermophysical properties of H2, CH4, and CO2 presented here were obtained from the NIST chemistry web book database (Lemmon et al., 2023) and are intended to serve as a reference for upcoming UHS systems.
1mvw | One of the most notable thermophysical characteristics of hydrogen is its low density, which dictates that it must be compressed or liquefied for any practical application (Osman et al., 2021). At standard temperature (0℃ or 273.15 K) and pressure (0.1 MPa or 1 bar), the density of hydrogen is 0.08871 kg/m3 according to the equation of state for normal hydrogen (Leachman et al., 2009). Due to the low critical temperature (-240.005℃ or 33.145 K) and low critical pressure
6d4s | (1.2964 MPa or 12.964 bar) of hydrogen (Leachman et al., 2009), it would be stored in the gaseous phase in porous storage systems (Züttel, 2004). Hydrogen is a highly compressible gas, and its density increases significantly with increasing pressure and barely with increasing temperature (Figure 1A). Consequently, hydrogen storage efficiency increases with increasing reservoir depth. But, because CH4 (Setzmann and Wagner, 1991) and CO2 (Span and Wagner, 1996) is much denser than hydrogen (Figures 2A, C), storing hydrogen gas of the same mass requires higher pressure (Tarkowski et al., 2021) and less hydrogen can be stored in the same reservoir volume compared to CH4 and CO2 (e.g., Lanz et al., 2001; Lankof and Tarkowski, 2020; Zivar et al., 2021; Epelle et al., 2022). This underlines the importance of storage capacity in hydrogen storage. In this context, depleted hydrocarbon storage facilities represent a more interesting storage option compared to salt caverns and aquifers due to their large storage space and high availability (e.g., Reitenbach et al., 2015). Moreover, the large density difference between H2 and dense formation water and cushion gas (e.g., CH4) can cause a strong gravity segregation effect (Ide et al., 2007; Jamshidnezhad et al., 2010; Rossen et al., 2010; Han et al., 2016; Rabinovich and Cheng, 2020), resulting in the accumulation of a hydrogen cap beneath the cap rock (Ruith and Meiburg, 2000; Heinemann et al., 2021c; Muhammed et al., 2022), which could ensure that H2 will remain in the reservoir (Iglauer, 2022). Conversely, Osman et al. (2021) emphasized that an H2 plume is susceptible to formidable buoyancy forces, with the magnitude of said
mqah | forces directly correlating to the potential for hydrogen leakage. Literature by Heinemann et al. (2021c) and Sainz-García et al. (2017) suggests that water may ascend towards the production well under these conditions, making seasonal storage of hydrogen in porous storage systems challenging.
