You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

uooz | sold them the lot; to describe the state of the lot at the time of purchase and whether or not there was any house or construction already on the lot at the time; and to outline what, if any, problems they had encountered when making their payments. This generated an overall database of some 1790 records, with data stretching over some 17 years from 1972 to 1999. However, although the infor- mation dates as far back as the earliest pur- chases in the 1970s and includes records up to the late 1990s, in fact most people bought lots during the 1980s (see Table 1). The database includes information for all 15 of the sub-divisions included in the CRG pro- gramme, from which data for the following variables were extracted: the sub-division name; the purchase date (year); the price paid; from whom it was bought; and, whether or not the lot was sold with or
pxbq | without a Deed (a Contract for Deed usu- ally). As well as analysing the general trend for all records, we were also able to disaggre- gate data for a number of specific colonias- 4 of which had a good sample size (Table 2). These 4 colonias represent 64 per cent of all records in our usable CRG database.
jfsr | Our first task in the analysis was to con- vert all data from nominal prices (i.e. unad- justed for inflation) into constant land prices using standard deflators.4 Due to occasional flaws detected in the CRG records, after cross-checking we omitted any case where there was uncertainty, or where there was missing information. This reduced the total number of cases from the original 1790 to a 'working database' comprising 1406 records that are shown in Table 1. These data are used to undertake the first phase of our land price analysis and, compared with other simi-
u15r | lar surveys, they represent a relatively large data-set (Jones and Ward, 1994; Ward et al. 2000). Not only is it relatively large, but we are confident that the information had been consistently and accurately collected and recorded.
lq35 | Real land prices were computed for each lot but, because lot size sometimes varied, it was important to calculate in unit-price terms, as the real cost per square foot. Al- though most people recalled how much they had paid, or the deal that was struck at the outset, there was less certainty about the exact size of their lots, so in each case this was cross-checked with the data at the CRG office which were based upon plat infor- mation and were known to be accurate. Also, in Starr County, we were greatly helped by the fact that most of the lots sold were of a uniform size-50 ×100 sq ft-which is small by colonia standards in Texas. This largely obviated any possible inaccuracies by having to rely solely upon the size as re- ported by respondent. Thus, from both the questionnaire survey and the CRG database, we had the nominal and real price paid for the lot, and the same for unit prices per square foot, all matched to the year of pur- chase. These form the basis for the following graphs. Moreover, in aggregate data presen- tations, wherever possible the 'trimmed' mean value was adopted since this automati- cally excludes the outliers that would distort the average and mislead the analysis.5 Thus, the median and trimmed mean values offer the most accurate picture of lot prices in any single year.
3g9w | Occasionally, nominal price data on lot prices were taken directly from the CRG
d09o | 2629
ylhz | database (as were lot-size data since these were always more accurate than the self-esti- mates offered by respondents). The CRG data were checked against that provided by survey respondents in order to gauge accu- racy and consistency of the survey data and they proved a reasonably close match-es- pecially the medians-although the average lot price in the survey was almost $300 higher. Upon further investigation, it tran- spired that this was because some respon- dents had, in fact, purchased two adjacent lots, but considered the purchase as a single (larger) lot. Where this was known to be the case, the survey data were recalculated in order to reflect a single lot price, but just in case we have not caught all of those cases we occasionally prefer to use the median value (as in Table 3). Generally, though, we are comfortable using the survey data and we are confident that they are sufficiently accurate to warrant further analysis.
a3td | One assumption that we do make here is that, at the time of purchase, these were unimproved parcels of land-i.e. they did not have any dwelling on them. This was almost always the case, even though some lots have been resold (traspasos) and, in these cases, it was possible that they may have included a dwelling structure of some sort (although these would probably be excluded by using the trimmed mean). In addition, we were able to control for two variables in order to ex- clude lot sales that might have contained a dwelling structure: first to focus only upon those cases where the vendor was either Blas Chapa or Elías López since they never sold lots with structures; and, secondly, in the more recent cases that were likely to be
ex5k | 2630
9d4o | traspasos, to exclude regular-sized lot sales costing more than $15 000 in real terms since this price was considerably over the odds and would indicate the presence of a dwelling. (Similarly, we excluded the extremely low reported prices, since these were probably misinformed prices placed on the record by CRG officials in those cases where the per- son had paid very little, or was receiving the lot through the CRG.)
cjq2 | Most residents (72 per cent overall) de- clared that they had bought their lot from Blas Chapa and/or from Elías López. This has two important implications for our analy- sis: first, these would have been 'first-hand' buyers, as both men were the original devel- opers of these colonias and did not deal in anything other than unimproved lots; and, secondly, it meant that it was they who had set the asking price-according to their own criteria-rather than these being prices set in the (open) market-place (although one could assume that the two would be closely interre- lated), or by another private third-party indi- vidual. But other studies have shown that it is not uncommon for 'non-market' criteria to enter the equation particularly where the sale is made by a friend or relation of the devel- oper (Ward et al., 1993).
5esx | Land Price Trends over Time
m5ka | In our first model of land-price changes over time, we calculated yearly real average land prices per square foot for the whole period covered in the CRG database. The mean and median real sq ft land prices range from 0.475¢ in 1983 to a high point of $1.296 in 1995 (see Table 1).6 Examining the curves in Figure 1, first for vacant lots and secondly for all lots combined, one can see that there is little difference between the two indicators: the same general trend is replicated in each curve. At first sight, 'real' prices appear to have been around the 0.70¢ per sq ft mark in the late 1970s through to 1982, dropping to 0.50¢ and then remaining flat for the remain- der of the decade, before rising steadily from 1991, rising sharply in 1993 through to 1995, and declining thereafter (see Figure 1).
byu8 | What can be said about the overall trend depicted in the figure? First, it seems to us that, once adjusted for inflation, land prices in the long term are relatively 'flat' through- out-as indicated by the log curve, which shows no perceptible upward slope. The two- year moving average (which tends to 'smooth' any one particularly high or low year in the date), also shows this same mod-
76b0 | est 'cyclical' movement, with a clear sense of prices declining in the late 1970s, rising again in the late 1980s/early 1990s to a high(-ish) point mid-decade, before declin- ing again thereafter. Secondly, there ap- pear to have been two notable 'spikes' in higher land prices, in 1990 and again in 1994. Thirdly, lot prices appear to have declined significantly in real times since 1995/96.
zxz6 | It should be remembered that most colonia residents bought into these settlements dur- ing the 1980s (even if they did not occupy immediately) and that they did so at a time when no services were provided or promised and before major state-wide concerns began to be raised about the existence and nature of colonias. Concern and government interven- tion really only kicked-in as a result of the 1989 and 1991 sessions of the state legisla- ture, and then again in 1995 which came to represent a major defining moment in legisla- tive intervention (Ward, 1999). While this latter session led to the creation of the CRG Receivership intervention, the programme did not truly begin until 1997 and quickened
xnth | 2631
vafm | from 1999 through to 2002, when most titles began to be systematically cleared.
2zmw | Although we are confident that these trends are an accurate portrayal of land price fluctuations since the late 1970s, explaining them is less straightforward. We propose three tentative conclusions: first, that overall land prices have remained consistently low because, up until 1995 at least, unimproved lots were always sold without any firm ex- pectation that services would be provided or that local governments would subsequently intervene one way or another to improve housing conditions. Secondly, it seems likely that the emerging publicity about colonias from 1989 onwards and the beginnings of the State's commitment to intervene in order to prevent their further proliferation, combined with the stated intention to explore financing means that would provide services to colo- nias, probably provoked a rise in the asking price from the developers and led to a more systematic (i.e. less discretionary) setting of sale prices to interested potential buyers.7 As Table 1 clearly shows, this was the high point of lot sales.
bf9k | 2632
otkr | Our third proposition arising from the data is that, although the actual number of lot sales began to decline in 1994, and did so sharply in 1995, the 1994/95 'spike' was also motivated by a growing awareness among potential buyers (and developers) that the supply of lots was about to decline or be severely limited altogether. It was widely known that the Texas State government was preparing to intervene in a major way, pro- viding water and wastewater regularisation to colonias; but that the government was also about to get serious and curtail for good any further unserviced platted or unplatted devel- opment by developers. Correctly or not, many would-be colonia owners probably saw this as their last chance to break into colonia ownership, but now with the added expect- ancy that services would come on-line shortly thereafter. Of course, developers had even better information than did the average buyer and for them by 1994 the storm clouds were firmly on the horizon with the threat that some developers were about to be prose- cuted and might have their land develop- ments sequestrated. It was becoming apparent that major legislation would be con- sidered in 1995 (to come into effect in Sep- tember that year) that would tie developers' hands from further lot sales (without ap- proved platting and servicing) and restrict their ability to sell lots under the Contract for Deed arrangement. (This is precisely what happened through House Bill 1001 and Sen- ate Bill 336 in that year.) Therefore, prior to enactment, developers may well have been tempted to offload their remaining lots and get out before they were prevented entirely from engaging in further lot sales.
ibgs | However, the decline in prices that we observe post-1995 requires some explanation since, if there was a general expectation that services would come on-line and that colo- nias would become legitimate and enter the formal land market, then one would expect prices to rise-not fall. By itself, the fact that there was a sharp actual decline in sales is not surprising since after 1995 developer sales were largely prohibited. Therefore it must be assumed that most sales in the 1996-
colo | 99 period were resales (traspasos) by earlier residents/buyers.8 The lower prices during the later 1990s may, therefore, reflect one or more of the following factors: an oversupply relative to demand after the spate of last-min- ute sales in 1993/94 (described above); the moratorium on lot sales, and uncertainty about what was going to happen in Starr County colonias generally, and specifically in the CRG-intervened Rio Grande City colonias; and, the switch from a relatively consistent price-setting system on the part of one or two very experienced developers, to a more individualised price-setting by individ- uals who were less experienced in negotiat- ing land sales than their developer counterparts. Specifically, 'absentee' lot owners living nearby (see Ward et al., 2000) and residents who had purchased more than one lot in the colonia, may have been in- clined to sell their vacant lot holdings for fear that they would be dispossessed-if and when the CRG or government formally inter- vened. Whatever the reason, our data suggest a sharp decline in land prices during the period 1996-2002.
d6r4 | Our interpretation is that this decline was due to the post-1995 uncertainties in the land market, rather than the anticipated impact of CRG intervention. Given the lack of data for 2000-02 when our survey ended, we cannot say how CRG involvement and the titling programme from 1997 onwards actually af- fected the operations of the land market in terms of land prices. However, we can note that the expectancy that clear title would be provided, of itself, did not appear to trigger a rise in lot values. But it may simply be too soon to tell. At the very least we do now have good baseline data against which to measure land price changes from 2000 on- wards.
9mrz | Figure 2 shows the mean real price per square foot. The data indicate that there is some variation over time between settle- ments in average prices. Las Lomas is the oldest colonia and shows generally lower prices (compared with the other selected sub- divisions) during the 1980s (when prices were low), with a moderate increase in the
pk06 | 1990s and a drop at the end of the period. Mike's colonia has consistently higher land prices than most settlements throughout, but also shows an increase in the mid 1990s, while Share 52 colonia has the most dramatic 'spike' of all in the mid 1990s. This alerted us to the possibility that the upward peak noted earlier in Figure 1 for the mid 1990s may have derived from the Share 52 data entering the data-set at that time, but further analysis in the colonia revealed that this represented only 5 cases for 1994 and 1995, and that excluding Share 52 data from the overall trend did not change the curve significantly.
