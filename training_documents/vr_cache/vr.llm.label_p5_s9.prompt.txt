You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,

82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

wzno | VR may enhance engagement with clinical evaluations through the immersive, realistic, enjoyable environments enabled by the technology.52,53 The term "presence" has been used in VR research to refer to the subjective experience of being in a place or environment, even when one is physi- cally situated in another.1 The feeling of presence is influ- enced by the degree of immersion, defined as the extent to which the system generates sensory stimulation consistent with sensorimotor experience (eg, images are updated as the head moves). Sense of presence has traditionally been linked to an individual's level of engagement54 and moti- vation.55 As such, high rates of presence and immersion reported within investigations of clinical uses of VR point to the ability of the technology to enhance engagement with clinical evaluation.56-58 However, it is currently difficult to create VR environments with a high level of realism, which can create a strong aversion to the experience.59
xagm | VR could further increase engagement with clinical evalua- tion by adding elements of digital games to the assessments, a process known as "gamification."60 Incorporating features of games, such as rewards and feedback, within VR may

uooz | engage individuals more fully in the evaluation process, limiting distractions that may compete for attention. Pollak et al53 reported that young participants (aged 9 to 17) rated a VR attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) assessment significantly more enjoyable than a computer- ized test of attention. The affordances inherent within VR technology have the potential to increase engagement with clinical evaluation for all individuals across presenting disorders, potentially improving the reliability and validity of the assessments.
pxbq | Applications of VR for assessment in clinical research studies
jfsr | Owing to the ecological validity, immersive capabilities, and ease of standardized data collection as discussed above, the field has begun to explore the use of VR for the assess- ment of clinically relevant outcomes. To date, these have fallen into three main areas: social functioning, cognition, and symptomatology. Social functioning can be assessed using automatic data capture such as eye gaze, proximity to VR avatars, and recording of responses to simulated social situations.25,56 Across studies, individuals with mental health conditions known to impact social functioning differed from control participants on VR-recorded measures. Cognition was among the first outcomes to be assessed with early- stage VR programs,61-63 focusing on memory and executive function, commonly assessed using maze navigation and attention tasks. For example, response to a VR-adminis- tered continuous performance task assessed attention and response inhibition in children and teens with ADHD compared with controls.64 Finally, VR environments have also been used to elicit and assess symptoms, such as para- noid ideation in the general population,19,65 individuals at risk for psychosis, 32,37 those with a first-episode psychosis,57 and individuals with long-standing persecutory delusions.66 Other symptoms such as auditory hallucinations,67 disor- dered eating,68 addiction,69 and phobia47 have also been studied using VR.
u15r | Considerations and limitations
lq35 | Whereas VR offers exciting opportunities to advance multiple areas of mental health, it is important to remain cautiously optimistic. Mirroring broader issues within the field of digital mental health, the following are major areas where caution is needed.

d09o | Cost and access
ylhz | Although VR has been around for several decades, only recently has the technology advanced to the point of commercial readiness. A major milestone occurred in 2010 with the release of the Oculus Rift, a relatively affordable VR device directed at consumers. Prior to this, VR tech- nology mainly existed behind the closed doors of software companies and specialized research labs.1 Over the past decade, we have seen rapid technological advancement and proliferation of the marketplace, with various companies offering a range of devices suited to different consumers and budgets. Critical to VRs viability, 2019 saw the release of the fully mobile HMD Oculus Quest.70 Mobile HMDs can be run without a cable connecting them to a computer, overcoming earlier problems with mobility and ease of use. It is now easier to imagine VR becoming commonplace in clinics, hospitals, and people's homes because it is easier to set up and more convenient to use. However, the cost of these devices is still prohibitive for many, with the most recent version of the Oculus Quest costing around US $400.
a3td | The biggest limiting factor to the implementation of VR into clinical practice at present is the lack of evidence-based VR programs that can be bought off the shelf and used by clini- cians and researchers. A number of labs around the world are developing their own software packages and testing them, but they are not yet commercially available. The few commercially available products developed by software companies have not been tested to show whether they are safe and effective. Additionally, because the technology is advancing so rapidly, hardware becomes outdated quickly and proprietary issues limit the availability of VR applica- tions across newer platforms. Consequently, we are yet to see VR have the same market penetration as smartphones, with only a small proportion of consumers currently owning these devices. Some clinicians have integrated VR into their practice,71 but again we are yet to see these treatments become widely available despite good evidence base for some approaches, particularly exposure therapy for anxiety disorders.2 In comparison, there has been a more steady increase in the use of VR within mental health research.72 The slow integration of VR into clinical care is due to many factors. These include a lack in infrastructure to support the technology within services, absence of training and stan- dardized evidence-based VR packages, the learning curve and costs associated with adopting new technologies, and more broadly, fears that technology may hinder engage-

9d4o | ment or even replace mental health professionals' roles.73 For these reasons, it is imperative that new VR applications, and in fact any digital technology, are designed with consid- erations for the systems and context in which they will be implemented.74,75
cjq2 | Developing evidence base
5esx | Traditionally, medical research is painstakingly slow at developing new evidence.76 Research is costly, time consuming, and in many ways, inefficient. This is partic- ularly problematic in digital mental health, where research operates at a much slower pace compared with technology development. Therefore, research often lags behind in providing the evidence base necessary to justify the hype surrounding many technologies.74 As a result, the market- place is largely dominated by mental health technologies that lack the evidence to substantiate their claims.77 VR is no exception, with a booming market of HMDs, games, and applications ready for consumer use.
m5ka | In addition to the complexities in developing and validating new VR technologies, it is also difficult to maintain them. Updates to software and hardware require ongoing mainte- nance costs that are not afforded in the traditional funding model offered by research grants. Potential solutions are still unfolding; however, currently, it is rare for the tech- nologies and applications developed by researchers to be widely available for consumers and clinicians.78 They are also often developed in isolation, with collaboration across research centers lacking. Better partnerships across insti- tutions as well as with commercial companies may offer solutions to this problem, but until this time, clinicians and researchers may find themselves frustrated by the lack of readily available VR assessment tools.
byu8 | Technical requirements and issues
76b0 | Technology can be complex and unstable, with teams of experts required for effective development and maintenance. Anyone interested in developing new VR applications for research should be warned that considerable technical, design, and computational expertise is required.79 Enhancing ecological validity is a major offering of VR; however, the degree of immersion necessary to generate the sense of pres- ence is a matter of ongoing research. Features that affect this sense of immersion include the display parameters of the VR system (eg, frame rate and resolution), design features (eg, realism of visual objects), and multisensory

xnth | feedback.1 An interesting phenomenon related to this that is often observed in VR is termed the "uncanny" valley.59 This refers to the way in which humanoid characters in a virtual world can elicit a feeling of unease or revulsion if they look very human-like but are imperfect (eg, their breathing movements are not realistic), reducing the overall realism of the environment. Interestingly, avatars with more cartoon- like feature might overcome this problem as they are easily accepted and do not seem to elicit the same sense of unease as more real-like humanoids.80 Clearly, the design of reliable and immersive VR experiences is complex. This, combined with the computing power and hardware required to build and run VR experiences, is a challenge for those in the field.
vafm | Ethical issues
2zmw | A number of reviews and commentaries have been written about the ethical landscape of digital mental health.81-83 Common themes across this literature include privacy, confidentiality, transparency, security, and ownership of data. These issues are also relevant to VR, especially when the application involves the collection of personal informa- tion and is accessed via the Internet. VR brings about more specific ethical challenges, however. More conceptually, the blurring of realities may have undue consequences on how we relate to and understand the world, perhaps especially so for conditions such as psychosis where reality distortion is already a challenge. As discussed previously, research has demonstrated that experiences in VR can have the same impact as if they occurred in the real world, necessitating considerable caution when conducting VR experiments designed to manipulate behavior.84 Some have commented on the dangers of enabling continual access to alternate real- ities, potentially perpetuating escape from the discomfort of the real world.85 The side effects of VR-namely, eye strain, cybersickness, and reality distortion1-are also important considerations, and limited research exists on their long- term effects. In considering these factors, Madary and Metzinger,84 and Rizzo and Schulheis,85 provide recommen- dations for the ethical use of VR within research, drawing on general principles underpinning respect for rights and protection from harm.

Advances in hardware, software, and research evidence has progressed in recent years; however, more studies are clearly needed to establish the reliability and validity of VR-based assessments, and issues with access to these resources and ethics require attention, thought, and research as the field develops. .
