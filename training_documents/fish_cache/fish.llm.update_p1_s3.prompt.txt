You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

9g22 | Biology, fisheries, assessment and management of Pacific hake (Merluccius productus)
41fx | Chapter 9 Biology, fisheries, assessment and management of Pacific hake (Merluccius productus)
7um8 | 9.1 Introduction
uow2 | Pacific hake (Merluccius productus) is the most productive and economically important commercial fish species off the west coast of North America, south of Alaska. The largely mid-water and domestic fisheries catch upwards of 200,000 t each year and are managed jointly by the United States and Canada. Pacific hake migrate along the coast each year, typically spawning near the southern end of their range in the winter. Their movement, growth and reproductive success are all heavily dependent on environmental conditions along the coast. Pacific hake are an important part of the California Current Large Marine Ecosystem (CCLME) along with being a key target for North American west coast fisheries.
iat7 | 9.2 Stocks
ywwr | Three or more biologically and genetically distinct stocks of Pacific hake occur along the west coast of North America. These stocks include the large coastal stock and smaller, spatially restricted inshore stocks, one within Puget Sound and another in the Strait of Georgia (Iwamoto et al., 2004; Figure 9.1). A 'dwarf' Pacific hake stock had previously been recognised off Baja Califor- nia but is now considered a separate species (Vrooman and Paloma, 1977; Ermakov, 1982; Mathews, 1985; Grant and Leslie, 2001). Here, we focus on the large coastal stock of Pacific hake, which is the most abundant groundfish population in the CCLME. The majority of this population migrates annually from offshore of southern California and Mexico (~lat. 30-35°N) during the winter spawning season to coastal areas as far north as Haida Gwaii (formerly the Queen Charlotte Islands; lat. 53ºN) or, in some years, southeast Alaska (~58°N), during the spring, summer and fall. Although there is thought to be little overlap in time and space among hake stocks, recent research supports the hypothesis that hake from the separately managed inshore stocks over- lap with the large coastal stock, particularly in the summer. Gao et al. (2010) found evidence of two stocks of hake off the Washington coast based on iso- topic signatures in the core of otoliths. This finding is consistent with Puget Sound or Strait of Georgia stocks being found throughout the Strait of Juan de Fuca and near the northern-western tip of Washington. In addition, King et al. (2012) reported genetic evidence, supported by differences in biological parameters and parasite infection levels, of three separate stocks of resident Pacific hake in Canadian waters. They also found that there was likely mixing of inshore resident stocks and the coastal stock during the summer, especially
0i6j | in Queen Charlotte Sound where the Canadian fishery operates to varying degrees each summer. On the basis of these two studies, mixing of inshore resident and migratory coastal stocks occurs in some, if not all years, result- ing in some harvest of resident Pacific hake by the fishery targeting the coastal stock. The exploitation level of inshore stocks is likely dependent on the relative population sizes of coastal and inshore stocks and their spatial distributions in any year.
87cq | 9.3 Biology, life history and ecology
0qs3 | 9.3.1 Environment
z8f7 | Pacific hake reside primarily within the CCLME. Climate and ocean condi- tions affect the distribution and abundance of coastal Pacific hake throughout its life history (cf. Ressler et <LATEX>a l . ,</LATEX> 2007 for a more extensive review of this topic). The California Current exhibits spatially complex and temporally varied flow dynamics. During the spring and summer, northerly wind stress drives coastal upwelling and southward surface flow, while in fall and winter, southerly wind stress leads to downwelling and northward surface flow (e.g. Hickey, 1979; Strub and James, 2000; Figure 9.2, top). Along Vancouver Island, the large volumes of freshwater discharged from coastal rivers onto the continental shelf result in northward surface flow in the summer as well (Thomson et al., 1989). The California Undercurrent, a subsurface northward flow, exists year-round on the continental shelf and upper slope, at a varying proximity to the shelf break (reviewed by Hickey, 1989; Huyer <LATEX>e t</LATEX> al., 1989; Thomson et al., 1989; Pierce et al., 2000; Agostini et al., 2006; Figure 9.2, bottom). The Undercurrent is nearly contiguous from lat. 33° to 51ºN, with a relatively narrow core (10-20 km) at depths of 200-300 m where mean sustained velocities of 10-20 cm/ s have been recorded (Pierce et al., 2000). Upwelling brings cool, dense and nutrient-rich waters to or near to the surface along the coast, increases the productivity of the CCLME (Mann and Lazier, 1996; Batchelder et al., 2002) and contributes to favourable feeding areas for Pacific hake during the summer months.
7w7j | Climate forcing at inter-decadal (e.g. regime shifts) and inter-annual time scales (e.g. El Niño/La Niña events) affects the distribution and productivity of marine species within the CCLME (McFarlane et al., 2000; Benson and Trites, 2002; King, 2005). Regime shifts, detected from coincidental changes in the distribution, survival, and abundance of many marine plankton and fish species, occurred in 1925, 1947, 1977, 1989 and 1998 (King, 2005). These shifts represent relatively abrupt, widespread and persistent changes in productivity, with effects cascading through all trophic levels. Within these regimes, ocean conditions are affected by El Niño events, resulting in warming of coastal waters offshore of the shelf-break and stronger poleward flow in the CCLME, and La Niña events, that couple cooling of surface temperatures with reduced poleward flow. A warming trend detected in all global oceans accounts for
51vd | a 1℃ increase in average annual water temperature in the CCLME over the past 50 years (Di Lorenzo et al., 2005). This warming is likely to have widespread consequences for the CCLME, including the patterns in spawning, recruitment, abundance and distribution of the coastal Pacific hake stock that we describe in this chapter. King et al. (2011) concluded that warmer years would likely reduce recruitment success for Pacific hake and/or result in a northward shift in spawning and rearing areas. However, increased upwelling could increase euphausiid density at the continental shelf break resulting in increased growth of Pacific hake, while warmer conditions would likely result in farther average northward migration and development of resident stocks farther north as well.
