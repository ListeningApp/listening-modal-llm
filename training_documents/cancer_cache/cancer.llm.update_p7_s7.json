Additionally, microfluidic devices can be adapted to study several biological changes that occur in cancer, such as metastasis and angiogenesis. A major advantage of microfluidic devices is the capacity to control the tumor microenvironment, allowing for a controlled release of several molecules, such as growth factors and nutrients. Microfluidic systems have other advantages, such as affordability, transparency, and the power to establish a physiologically accurate environment, making them suitable alternatives for anti-tumoral drug testing. Overall, microfluidic devices are able to mimic different aspects of the tumor microenvironment, such as vasculature, pressure, co-culture, shear stress, and oxygen and nutrient gradients. Despite being an interesting platform for high-throughput drug screening, the manipulation of microfluidic devices requires specific equipment and the number of cells cultured may be lower than what is needed for certain assays. To overcome this last problem, several laboratorial assays have been adapted to be compatible with lower cell numbers, and systems that are able to produce higher cell numbers have also been developed.\n78r8 | Three point three. Scaffold-Based Models\n320g | Scaffolds are three dimensional biomaterials designed to resemble the ECM, promoting cellular interactions and proliferation while remaining non-toxic. Scaffolds can be used to produce spheroid-like aggregates, or their surface can be functionalized in order to allow for cell adhesion. The three dimensional scaffold-based models are particularly used for cancer cell proliferation and to mimic the complexity of the tumor microenvironment, being an interesting tool to study cellular functions and interactions. These biomaterials can be pro-\ntp8g | duced from natural or synthetic materials, such as chitosan and poly-lactic-co-glycolic acid, respectively, according to the desired application. Additionally, hybrid materials, made of biological and synthetic components, can also be used, such as polyethylene glycol associated with collagen and Matrigel. Porous scaffolds and hydrogels are two scaffolding techniques commonly used.\ngxfd | Three point three point one. Porous Scaffolds\ns2v1 | Porous scaffolds can have a sponge, foam, or mesh appearance, and their porosity enables cell seeding and adequate nutrient exchange. Porous scaffolds provide a surface for cells to adhere to and build their own ECM, as well as enhance nutrient delivery via interconnected pores, lowering the likelihood of a necrotic center forming. However, this type of scaffold presents thickness and non-transparency as its key disadvantages, making observing biological events through high-content imaging approaches quite challenging.\njkp9 | Three point three point two. Hydrogels\nz8tt | Hydrogels are cross-linked three-dimensional networks of hydrophilic polymers that are rich in water content and are important for the development of three dimensional cancer models due to their ability to mimic the in vivo ECM. In this type of scaffold, cells can be grown on top of the matrix after it has solidified, or they can be mixed with the liquid hydrogel and embedded inside the matrix during gelation. Despite being interesting for their similar mechanics, chemistry, and structural properties to in vivo tissues, hydrogels still have some limitations. Similar to other scaffolds, hydrogels derived from natural materials, such as collagen or Matrigel, have weak mechanical properties, may be subject to batch-to-batch variation and rapid degradation, and can result in immunogenic responses. Therefore, synthetic materials, such as polyethylene glycol, present themselves, in some cases, as a better alternative, allowing for better reproducibility, control over microenvironmental cues, and molecule transport. Nevertheless, synthetic hydrogels may present some problems, such as the availability of oxygen, discrepancy in the distribution of soluble growth factors, microenvironment variability, and imaging and cell analysis complications. Another important issue is that scaffold-based three dimensional models have a low propensity for vascularization, which is crucial in cancer development research.\n9g22 | Three point four. Organoids and Tumoroids\n41fx | Organoids are in vitro aggregates derived from stem cells that are capable of self-organization, forming a structure similar to an organ with several cell types while maintaining similarities with the in vivo tissue. The utilization of organoids in research aims to replicate the organ's structure, organization, and function. Despite several protocols that have been established for the production of cancer organoids, as far as we know, all of them require exogenous ECM. This represents a limitation as it is known that cancer development triggers several biological changes, such as ECM remodeling, which affects drug resistance.\n7um8 | Tumoroids are organoids derived from patient biopsies that are able to recapitulate the patients' tumors more accurately as they preserve the genetic characteristics and heterogeneity of the original tumor, hence better capturing inter-patient heterogeneity. This makes tumoroids a crucial model for studying rare cancers for which there are no immortalized cell lines. Tumoroid growth protocols for several types of cancer have been established. Similar to some organoid protocols, tumoroids need to be supplemented with external growth factors and be in the presence of exogenous ECM, such as Matrigel. An important advantage of using tumoroids is that drug response in these models more accurately represents the patient's drug response and thus may allow for a personalized therapy selection. A drawback of this model, as well as organoids, is the need for highly trained staff to perform patient cell isolation and manipulation. Moreover, these cell models may be prone to ethical concerns, regarding the\nuow2 | source of the stem cells, and the informed consent and privacy of cell donors. Nevertheless, when comparing these models' advantages and disadvantages, the potential outcomes are considered to outweigh the ethical questions when these are properly addressed.\niat7 | As mentioned before, cancer three dimensional models can be applied to various fields of research and development, such as the preclinical testing of metallodrugs. Next, we describe and discuss the importance of metallodrugs in cancer, as well as the application of cancer three dimensional models for the preclinical evaluation of these types of drugs.\nywwr | Four. Metallodrugs in Cancer\n0i6j | Currently, there are several targeted therapies available to treat different types of cancer, for example, anti-hormonal treatments and monoclonal antibodies against cancer cell-specific receptors. Nevertheless, conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy remain the key tools for cancer treatment. Thus, there is an unmet need to develop innovative and improved pharmacological options for cancer therapy, but the design and development of effective anti-cancer drugs with high selectivity, minimal toxicity, and reduced side effects is still a challenging endeavor.\n```",
