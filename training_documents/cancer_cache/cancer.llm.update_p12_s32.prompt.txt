You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

qws8 | 5.2.2. Boron Clusters as a Novel Therapy against Glioblastoma
877u | Metallacarboranes ([M(C2B9H11)2] ) are 3D aromatic complexes composed of a cen- tral metal ion, usually Co or Fe, that is the common vertex of two joined icosahedrons, with interesting advantages in terms of their high stability, water solubility, and redox potential [176-178]. Similar to carboranes, these compounds are tunable, but the metal core adds additional features regarding the redox potential and the charge of the molecule [70].
rzhj | In a glioblastoma cell model, studies have been performed using metallacarboranes with both Fe and Co as a central core, to assess their therapeutic potential [70,73,179]. The cytotoxicity of cobaltabis(dicarbollides) ([o-COSAN]- and [8,8'-I2-0-COSAN]-) and ferrabis(dicarbollides) ([0-FESAN]- and [8,8'-I2-0-FESAN] ) was first assessed in mono- layer cultures of glioblastoma cell lines, and then in spheroids derived from the same cell lines using the APH assay (Figure 3A, and Figure 3C, respectively). The cytotoxicity of another ferrabis(dicarbollide), [0-57FESAN]-, with the potential to treat glioblastoma using the Mössbauer effect, was also evaluated in U87 spheroids (prepared in Nunclon™M Sphera™M ultra-low-attachment 96U-well plates at a density of 1250 cells per well) using the CellTiter-Glo® 3D Viability Assay (Figure 3E) [73]. In general, the results revealed that
bfax | glioblastoma cells were more sensitive when cultured as a 2D model than when cultured as spheroids, reiterating the relevance of 3D models in cancer research [180]. A physical assessment (area and circularity) of the spheroids was also performed after incubation with the metallacarboranes. The results obtained revealed that all the metallacarboranes tested significantly affected the spheroid growth, resulting in a considerable decrease in the spheroid area, with the exception of Na [8,8'-I2-0-FESAN] (Figure 3B,D,F). On the other hand, neither compound significantly affected the spheroid circularity.
f2y8 | Interestingly, the potential radiosensitizing effects of the metallacarboranes mentioned above were also explored, although most of these studies were performed in monolayer cultures. The cobaltabis (dicarbollides) compounds were studied as potential radiosen- sitizers for boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT), due to their high boron (B) content and high tumor uptake. The concept of BNCT is based on the deposition of high doses of radiation in tumor cells containing 10B-based compounds through a thermal neutron capture reaction that yields high linear energy transfer of « particles able to induce damage in the tumor [179].
o7qm | The radiosensitizing effects of the ferrabis(dicarbollides), [o-FESAN]-, and [8,8'-I2-0- FESAN]-, were further assessed using low dose y-rays and X-rays, considering that the interaction of Fe with low radiation doses could lead to the emission of photoelectrons, Auger electrons and other secondary electrons, and Compton scattering, increasing the total radiation dose to the tumor cells, consequently causing deleterious effects. Furthermore, the radiosensitizing effect of these compounds was also assessed with proton irradiation considering that the interaction of B with protons in the cells would, theoretically, increase the number of « particles emitted due to a nuclear fusion reaction (proton boron fusion reac- tion (PBFR)) [70]. Finally, as referred, [0-57 FESAN]- was used to study the radiosensitizing effects of Mössbauer absorption in glioblastoma monolayer cultured cells and spheroids, bearing in mind that the secondary radiation that accompanies the resonance absorption of the Mössbauer radiation, in the 57Fe nuclei, is able to produce a powerful local effect on the tumor cells [73].
d52l | 5.2.3. A New Generation of Anticancer Palladium Agents That Restrain the Growth of Ovarian Cancer Tumoroids
qlbb | N-heterocyclic carbenes are found in some of the most active palladium compounds, stabilizing the complex and avoiding its rapid degradation in a biological environment [181,182]. The anticancer activity and cytotoxicity of Pd(II)-n3-allyl organometallic complex have been evaluated in two ovarian cancer cell lines, A2780 and SKOV-3, and both the antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic activity appeared to be very promising [183]. Scattolin et al. then studied the effects of these Pd compounds on liver organoids, to evaluate the hepatotoxicity, and ovarian cancer tumoroids, to assess their anticancer activity on more complex models [77]. Regarding the hepatoxicity, the organoids were first characterized by immunohistochem- istry using premature and mature hepatocyte markers. Then, it was possible to determine the IC50 of 0.03 ± 0.01 µM for cisplatin and 3 ± 2 uM for the selected Pd compound. This shows that this Pd complex is 100 times less toxic than cisplatin, corroborating with the data from assays on 2D models and supporting the use of the compound in future clinical applications [77].
nhsg | To evaluate the anticancer activity of the selected Pd complex, tumoroids of three patients with high-grade serous ovarian cancer subtypes were developed. Tumor samples of both primary and metastatic sites were used. The morphologic and cytologic similarities between tumoroids and parental tumors were assessed and confirmed using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. On all of the tumoroids, the Pd compound was active at low concentrations, contrary to what was observed with carboplatin, as shown in Table 2 [77]. The results of these hepatoxicity and anticancer activity assays suggest that this new Pd complex could be interesting for therapeutic applications [77].
hy0l | 5.2.4. Oral Mucosal Organoids as a Potential Platform for Personalized Cancer Therapy
4jmz | Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) lines have been cultured in 3D models to overcome the limitations of their 2D counterparts. In this study, Driehuis et al. aimed to study the potential of tumoroids, derived from HNSCC patients, for personalized therapy [78].
b7cq | Tumoroids were grown from patient-derived HNSCC samples obtained through surgical resections or biopsies and cultured in an appropriate organoid culture medium, and their morphology and histopathology were confirmed using brightfield microscopy, H&E, and immunohistochemistry staining. Following that, 13 tumoroid lines were exposed to cisplatin and carboplatin, two drugs used in the treatment of HNSCC patients. As depicted in Table 3, tumoroids of different origins presented different levels of sensitivity to the compounds [78]. In all of the samples, cisplatin was shown to be more effective at lower doses than carboplatin [78,184]. Moreover, differential gene expression analysis of RNA-seq data was performed to verify if expression profiles could predict how these therapies would work. However, gene enrichment analysis on these gene sets yielded no clear indications of resistance mechanisms.
