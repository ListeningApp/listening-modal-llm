        "content": "pn9j | Large Kinetic Isotope Effects in Methane Oxidation Catalyzed by Methane Monooxygenase: Evidence for C-H Bond Cleavage in a Reaction Cycle Intermediate\n1pmc | ABSTRACT: The reduced hydroxylase component of soluble methane monooxygenase from Methylosinus trichosporium OB three B reacts with molecular oxygen and methane to produce methanol and water in a single-turnover reaction. Transient kinetic analysis of this reaction has revealed at least five and probably six intermediates during the turnover. One intermediate, termed compound Q, reacts with methane to yield enzyme-bound product. It is shown here that the deuterium kinetic isotope effect for the reaction of compound Q with methane is fifty to one hundred, which is one of the largest effects observed to date. The rate constants for the reactions of the deuterated homologs of methane decrease monotonically as the deuterium content increases, suggesting that a large primary isotope effect dominates. The KIEs determined by analyzing the products after a single turnover have the following values: one to one methane to fully deuterated methane nineteen; CD three H twelve; CD two H two nine; and CH three D four. The KIE values determined by directly observing the reactive intermediate and by monitoring product ratios are all large, consistent with complete C-H bond breaking in the oxygenation step of the reaction. However, the differences in the KIE values determined by these two methods suggest that the reaction is more complex than currently proposed. A modified mechanism introducing the possibility of hydrogen-atom reabstraction by an intermediate methyl radical is proposed.\n5z6q | Methane monooxygenase isolated from methanotrophic bacteria catalyzes the incorporation of one atom of oxygen from molecular oxygen into an unactivated C-H bond of methane to form methanol. The second atom of oxygen is reduced to water. Many other hydrocarbons serve as adventitious substrates. The oxidation reaction of the soluble form of methane monooxygenase occurs in the active site of the hydroxylase component of this three-protein-component enzyme system. The other two components are a NADH-coupled reductase, which contains FAD and iron-sulfur cofactors, and a cofactorless protein termed component B. Methane monooxygenase hydroxylase contains a hydroxide-bridged diiron cluster that cycles between an activated diferrous state and a resting diferric state during each catalytic cycle.\nyeoh | Recently, as illustrated in Figure one, we and others have shown that at least five, and probably six, transient intermediates occur as the diferrous methane monooxygenase hydroxylase cycles back to the diferric state after exposure to oxygen in the presence of component B and substrate. One of these intermediates, termed compound Q, absorbs at three hundred thirty and four hundred thirty nanometers and exhibits an unusual Mössbauer spectrum best characterized as arising from a symmetric iron four iron four state of the cluster.\nb8hf | Isotope Effects in Methane Monooxygenase Catalysis\nhntf | The structure of compound Q is not known, comparison of the Mössbauer spectral features with recently developed model systems suggests that there are two bridging u-oxo or hydroxo ligands forming a so-called \"diamond core\" structure. The formation rate of compound Q is independent of substrate concentration for most substrates. In contrast, its decay rate is linearly dependent on substrate concentration, making the reaction appear second order overall. The rate constant for compound Q decay is strongly dependent on the particular methane monooxygenase substrate added. Methane elicits the largest value among the many alkanes, alkenes, and heterocyclic compounds investigated so far. Chemical quench experiments indicate that product is formed in the active site at the same rate as compound Q decays. Together these observations suggest that compound Q reacts directly with substrate to form product and, thus, represents the form of the enzyme carrying the activated oxygen species capable of attacking unactivated hydrocarbon bonds.\n99fo | Several potential mechanisms for the intriguing oxygen insertion reaction of the soluble methane monooxygenase have been suggested. All of the proposals invoke direct coordination of oxygen to the diferrous cluster of methane monooxygenase hydroxylase to generate a peroxo adduct of some type, which is then cleaved homolytically or heterolytically to generate a radical or oxenoid reactive oxygen species, respectively. Barton and co-workers have suggested that an iron oxenoid species might facilitate the formation of a bond between the iron and the substrate carbon to form a species that would allow direct insertion of oxygen. Feig and Lippard have suggested that an active site cysteine is oxidized by one reducing equivalent by an oxenoid species to produce an active site diradical. In one proposed reaction from this species, concerted hydrogen atom abstraction by the cysteinyl radical and insertion by the cluster-associated oxygen radical would lead to product. Shteinman and Shestakov and Shilov have proposed that the diamond core structure of compound Q allows the redistribution of electron density, such that the irons are predominantly iron three and each of the bridging oxygens has radical character. The coordinated attack of these radicals on substrate, one to carbon and one to hydrogen, is proposed to result in direct oxygen addition to the carbon to form a five-coordinate methane intermediate that facilitates C-H bond breakage to yield product. We and others have speculated that a metal oxenoid species abstracts a hydrogen atom from the substrate to yield an intermediate substrate radical and a metal-bound hydroxyl moiety. Rebound of the hydroxyl would yield product. Considerable support for the latter mechanism has derived from experiments that showed that R- or S-deuterium one, three-one ethane undergoes partial inversion of configuration during the course of oxidation to ethanol, implying the formation of an unbound substrate-derived intermediate, probably a substrate radical, that can rotate in the active site before the reaction is consummated.",
