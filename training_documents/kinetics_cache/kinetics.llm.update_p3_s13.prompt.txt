You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

b3bt | Maximum likelihood estimation of parameters
0w8m | Here we introduce a method of estimating the kinetic pa- rameters in our hierarchical model using the expression data of each gene. For a given expression read of observed cells, the most common parameter estimation method is the maximum likelihood estimation, which can be formulated as the following optimization problem of five parameters 0 = (a, b, c, k, h) in our case
vcu3 | arg min (-L(y;0)) = arg min θ -In(P(Y=y;0)), (8) y where P(Y = y;0) is described in Equation (6).
hjzj | Because of the complex integral and unnormalized prob- ability mass function in Equation (6), calculating the inte- gral directly through the MCMC method (50) would be at a high cost of computation, and in particular, it is hard to use in the analysis of genome-wide data. Therefore, we ap- ply the Generalized Gauss-Laguerre Quadrature Rules (51) to Equation (6) instead of the use of the MCMC method, realizing a rapid calculation in inference:
j79f | P(Y= y; 0)=N [(x) e-x,a(1+)-1-x/b (1+(x/k) dx 0
6tbv | (9)
xb13 | where xi, wi can be determined by the generalized Laguerre polynomials.
cxqi | In particular, a simple algebraic transformation in Equa- tion (7) yields the explicit expression of the probability dis- tribution in the case of non-feedback:
qfmx | P(Y= y ;- ) = 100 (x)" y! ο-λχ
rut3 | bar (a) 1 xa-le-x/bdx
m3cp | = (a+y) B(a, y+1) (b)+1)/+a' (bx)y
mq4s | (10)
95el | where B(., .) is the Beta function.
a0a5 | Optimization method and initial values setting
gocl | To realize a fast calculation for solving the optimization problem (Equation (8)) of parameter estimation, we use the fmincon function in the LBFGS method of MAT- LAB (https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html), a nonlinear programming solver, to find the minimum of the optimization problem given a set of initial val- ues and parameter intervals a =(10-1,30), b = (1, 20), k = (1,103), h = (-10, -1)or(1, 10). For each gene and each case of positive, negative, and non-feedbacks, we repeatedly solve the optimization problem 30 times.
ob1z | We restrict that the initial values of the optimization problem obey the following rules. First, we consider initial
m4cb | points of a (burst frequency) and <LATEX>b</LATEX> (burst size). Here <LATEX>X</LATEX> is a random variable of the distribution in Equation (5). Since Gamma distribution is a special case of Equation (5), we assume that the initial points <LATEX>a</LATEX> and <LATEX>b</LATEX> follow
m61y | <LATEX>\mathrm { E } \left[ X \right] = a b , \mathrm { V a r } \left[ X \right] = a b ^ { 2 } .</LATEX> (11)
u2ob | On the other hand, by considering the initial values of <LATEX>Y</LATEX> generated by our hierarchical model, we have
2gnm | <LATEX>\mathrm { E } \left[ Y \right] = \mathrm { E } \left[ \mathrm { E } \left[ Y | X \right] \right] = \lambda \mathrm { E } \left[ X \right] = \lambda a b ,</LATEX> <LATEX>\mathrm { V a r } \left[ Y \right] = \mathrm { E } \left[ \mathrm { V a r } \left[ Y | X \right] \right] + \mathrm { V a r } \left[ \mathrm { E } \left[ Y | X \right] \right] = \lambda a b + \lambda ^ { 2 } a b ^ { 2 } .</LATEX> (12) (13)
emgw | Given the expectation and variance of <LATEX>Y ,</LATEX> we can in return estimate burst frequency <LATEX>a</LATEX> and burst size <LATEX>b</LATEX> by rearranging Equations (12) and (13), which are then taken as initial val- ues
xaqt | <LATEX>a = \frac { \mathrm { E } \left[ Y \right] ^ { 2 } } { \mathrm { V a r } \left[ Y \right] - \mathrm { E } \left[ Y \right] } , b = \left( \frac { \mathrm { V a r } \left[ Y \right] } { \mathrm { E } \left[ Y \right] } - 1 \right) / \lambda .</LATEX> (14)
5rcb | Usually, the transcriptional rate in the OFF state is much smaller than that in the ON state. And a small enough leaky rate does not affect the distribution shape of gene expres- sion. Therefore, we fix & at the constant of 0.05 during our inference. The <LATEX>h</LATEX> value is extracted from a uniform distribu- tion between the integer -5 and -1 (positive feedback) or in- tegers 1 and 5 (negative feedback). And the values of param- eter <LATEX>k</LATEX> are extracted from the log-uniform (logarithm base 10) distribution on interval
524j | <LATEX>\left[ 0 , 2 \right] .</LATEX> Model selection
xd3m | Using the above inference method, we obtain 90 inferred re- sults for each case of positive, negative, and non-feedbacks. Then, we filter out the unreliable results on the inference boundary, which are possibly caused by the optimization program setting. On this basis, we compute the value of the corrected Akaike information criterion (AICc) (52) and se- lect the best model corresponding to the smallest AICc,
8qb6 | <LATEX>\mathrm { A I C c } = - 2 \log L \left( \widehat { \theta } \right) + 2 k + \frac { 2 k \left( k + 1 \right) } { n - k - 1 } ,</LATEX> (15)
wkbn | where the maximum likelihood <LATEX>L \left( \widehat { \theta } \right)</LATEX> is the result during the inference run, <LATEX>k</LATEX> is the number of model parameters, and n is the sample size of observed data.
ftfg | Validation on synthetic scRNA-seq data
7xi5 | In order to check whether the above statistical inference method can effectively infer burst frequency, burst size, and feedback form in our hierarchical model, we produce syn- thetic single-cell RNA data. Given a set of model param- eter values <LATEX>\theta = \left( a , b , \varepsilon , k , h \right) ,</LATEX> we first calculate the prob- ability distributions of these parameters according to the method described in the above section and then carry out random samples according to the probability of each pa- rameter value to obtain the input data for the inference pro- cess.
w8r5 | We show the precision regions for the inference of burst kinetics (burst frequencies and burst sizes) under different
