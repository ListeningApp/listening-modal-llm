You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

uvy5 | Real andOstensible Self-Improvement
x07b | Q: Does the Sufi school do anything about the automatism of man?
emi3 | A: Ostensibly, and as far as they understand, people may be trying to improve themselves.
nxxc | In fact (as can be determined by studying what they are actually doing and what they really mean by what they say) they are often automatising or diverting themselves.
2xv2 | This is only because they are working with a shallow use of the mind, an area which becomes conditioned comparatively easily.
bzt8 | Ironically, many who have heard of this process, and see it in others, think that they are immune from it by the very act of repeating that 'man becomes moribund, conditioned'. Yet this very repetition will automatise, condition him. Liberation, for such theoreticians, is farther than it is from the 'non-initiate', who has never heard of the argument.
5nc5 | It is possible to turn away from automatism by using techniques devised to outmanoeuvre it. But first we must register sufficiently deeply, not just frequently or excitedly, that such a process is needed. Second, we must discover whether the individual involved has the capacity to be deautomatised. Third, we must prescribe the treatment for that particular individual. Fourth, we must assess whether he will abide by the treatment.
3pdc | These are among the reasons for the techniques and
ol1k | specialised studies of the real Sufi school.
ozr9 | Some people are inwardly determined to retain their automat- ism, while trying to profit from a Sufi school's work. I think that that is the real problem. 'You are in the bonds of attending to the beard and turban,' says the Diwan of Shams-i-Tabriz, 'how will you gain the quaffer of the great goblet?'
h0je | The automatism of man is overcome, in the words of Dhun'Nun, by aiming for 'being as you were, where you were, before you were'.
bne6 | Roles of Teacher and Student
7vps | Q: How does the Sufi teacher overcome the fixed but unper- ceived biases of the student?
msu3 | A: Let us look at the relative positions of the teacher and the student. The student regards the teacher as someone who has a quantity of something, and will give him a part of it. Or he may look upon him as someone who knows a method of achieving something.
g5o6 | The teacher sees the student as someone who is eligible for gaining a portion of something. In another sense he looks upon him as someone who can achieve something.
jyg1 | Each in its own way, the attitudes of the two have a connection.
eoh9 | The problem of the teacher is greater than the problem of the student. One reason for this is that the student is anxious to learn but seldom realises that he can learn ONLY UNDER THE CONDITIONS WHICH MAKE THIS LEARNING POS- SIBLE.
tgod | He cannot make real progress until he has undergone a prepara- tion for learning. When this preparation is complete, the student may progress slowly, rapidly or instandy through a number of phases in which he understands what he has called the meaning of life, or to know himself.
je54 | The most important thing, therefore, is to get the student into an alignment in which his progress can be effective and continuous.
syga | This can only be directed by someone who knows the whole picture, and who knows what is possible and what is not, with an individual and a given group of people.
hpwj | Because the student is likely to be imprisoned by attitudes which have trained him, he will tend to approach the teacher, and the teaching, in all kinds of ineffective and minor ways. He will ask for 'peace of mind', progress in his worldly life, money, knowledge, illumination, assurances - all things which may be important in one way or another, but which are not necessarily
fymx | relevant to his situation. In other words, he asks to be taught, or to be given, knowledge and things which HE HAPPENS TO BE WANTING FOR THE SOLE REASON THAT HE HAS DECIDED THAT THESE ARE NECESSARY OR URGENT.
2jl2 | This, from some viewpoints, is a ridiculous situation. It is as if a schoolboy were to say: 'Yes, teach me French, but teach me only at 4 p.m.', or 'I want to learn mathematics, but I will not do so in this particular class', or, again, 'I would like to learn the principles of biology, but first I must have some information about tadpoles, because to my mind they are the most important thing'.
iie4 | The fact is that you can learn only what you can be taught. If
s13i | you impose or interpose conditions gained from speculation, emo- tion , imagination, intellect and so on, you will still have to learn
jmvl | how to learn. This means finding out how to collect knowledge, stage by correct stage, without the foregoing limitations.
8nb9 | The human being, not knowing what he really is, not knowing where he came from or where he can go to, is hardly in a position merely to assume that he should get his instruction in this or that form; or that before he does anything else his warts should be charmed or his house set in order in a way which he happens capriciously, or even dedicatedly, to demand.
mwck | The first duty of the teacher is to make this plain and not to compromise with the superficial sentiments which many people be- lieve are fundamentals.
r1m5 | Rumi says: 'You are a lover of your own experience not of me/You turn to me to feel your own emotion.'
75uu | If you look at the way in which you approach things, including your desire to leam and its expression in action, and if you note what mistakes you have made and also what the Sufis say about the roles of teacher and student, you will realise that the fixed but unperceived biases of the student to which you refer need someone outside of the student to supply the stimuli which will enable him (or her) to escape from the trap of customary thinking-patterns.
kebm | STUDENTS WHO DO NOT LEARN
zsr7 | Sheikh Abdullah Ansari of Herat, recognised as one of the clearest exponents of the School, as well as one of its greatest sages, lists the things which people do and think which block their progress.
otjo | These cause bafflement, sorrow and confusion. People who do not follow their teacher's prescriptions either remain in one of those conditions or else adopt some-often unperceived - psycho- logical stratagem which causes hypocrisy, fanaticism or imagined understanding.
hzzp | These are the things which the student cannot measure in himself, and which the teacher attends to:
jk6l | 'To want before it is due To desire more than is due To want for oneself what belongs to others.'
sttm | Some people, of course, are so wilful that even if you tell them that you are not going to compromise with fixed biases, they will continue to battle. In such cases the teacher will disappoint their expectations by making himself out to be unsuitable to the student, borrowing from the Malamati techniques. Even then, the de- linquent student may not be able to understand what is going on, and will put all kinds of fanciful interpretations on the matter. Saadi, in the Gulistan, has a tale about this.
qmh1 | TALE OF THE MUEZZIN
a2ok | There was once a Muezzin who called the faithful to prayer with such an awful voice that the mosque trustee, a kindly man, offered him ten dinars to go to another town. Subsequendy he came across the trustee and said, 'You offered me only ten dinars to go to another town, but where I am now they are offering twenty, but I still refuse to leave.'
d9jm | The trustee laughed and said: 'Hold out, and you will find that they will even go as high as fifty.'
