You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

2nib | Early analytical and experimental studies [16, 105] demonstrated that all of the links above the level of the column under consideration would not develop their maximum shear forces simultaneously. Based on this observation a lower overstrength factor was suggested by AISC 341-10 [3] for the capacity design of columns in EBFs of three or more stories of bracing, when compared with the Q2 value used in the design of brace members. Columns also need to be checked for the amplified seismic axial force of Q20PEQ, where 20 is the structural overstrength factor taken as 2.0 per ASCE 7-10 [140] and PEQ is the column axial force generated by the code-specified earthquake loads. It is important to note that drift-induced flexural forces are generally neglected in the design of columns as permitted by AISC 341-10 [3].
naev | During the design process, it is necessary to estimate link end moments in order to determine the internal force distribution after formation of the expected plastic mechanism. For links located in the middle portion of floor beams (internal links) the end moments will almost be equal throughout a seismic loading. On the other hand, for links connected to columns (external links) the end moments will not be identical in the elastic range. However, early studies of Kasai and Popov [10, 15] proved that for most cases these moments would equalize as the link goes through large plastic rotations. Thus, in both cases, the link end moments can be readily estimated using equilibrium. The only exception reported by Kasai and Popov [10, 15] was the case of external links with p ≤ 1.3, for which the end moments did not equalize at the ultimate state. For such cases, recommendations for moment distribution were developed by these researchers. Kasai and Popov [15] also demonstrated that it is
7h0h | advantageous to avoid EBF configurations with inactive links (e.g. Figure 1f) in which only one of the links located at one end of a brace would dissipate most of the energy (and thus become active) while the other would not contribute notably to the energy dissipation of the system (and thus remain inactive).
a64c | It is worth mentioning that early multi-story tests [16, 89, 90] demonstrated that, in some cases, the plastic behavior could be concentrated in the first story links leading to the development of a soft story mechanism. Popov et al. [141] attributed this issue to the incorrect proportioning of the links along the height of the EBFs in the above-mentioned tests. The static pushover and dynamic time- history analyses of Kasai and Popov [15], Ricles and Popov [105], Ricles and Bolin [142, 143], and Popov et al. [141] revealed that in order to achieve a reasonable distribution of link inelastic action throughout an EBF height, all of the links need to have uniform capacity-to-demand ratios.
gi7n | 5.2. Research on Seismic Performance
3pn1 | An enormous amount of research on the seismic performance and design of EBF systems has been conducted in the past decades and important aspects of this research are briefly discussed in this section.
wjuz | In a series of studies by Koboevic and her colleagues [56, 57, 138, 144] in late 1990s and 2010s the seismic behavior of low-, mid-, and high-rise EBF systems was investigated under several earthquake records via nonlinear time-history analysis. Similar to previous findings [11, 64, 139], limited yielding in EBF beams was found acceptable provided that braces were capable of resisting the additional moments. The use of a higher overstrength factor in the capacity design of upper tier columns was recommended, which is the approach used in CSA S16-14 [17]. The importance of drift- induced column flexural forces was also demonstrated in the above studies. The last observation was reported previously by Kasai and Han [145] as well. An iterative design methodology based on selecting appropriate earthquake records and performing time-history analyses was also outlined by these researchers [138, 144]. Although all of the links in the studied EBFs had similar capacity-to-
3yxv | demand ratios, the numerical results [56, 57] revealed that the energy dissipation might be non- uniform along the EBF height and more concentrated in the first and last story links.
d8zj | The seismic behavior of six-story one-bay EBFs with long links under several earthquake records was studied by Tirca and Gioncu [146] in 1999. It was concluded that long links should be used with caution and avoided as much as possible due to their poor performance as observed in some of the studied cases.
ywxn | The effect of shear-moment interaction in the plastic design of EBFs was studied by Mastrandrea et al. [147, 148], where a procedure for determining the ultimate link shear force and link end moments was proposed for a given collapse mechanism. In companion studies [149, 150], a design methodology for EBFs was developed which ensures formation of a global mechanism and prevents partial or local collapse mechanisms. The behavior of EBFs designed with this method was compared to that of EBFs designed using a simplified method proposed by Kasai and Han [145] and satisfactory results were reported [149]. Further nonlinear static and dynamic analyses were conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in distributing the inelastic link action through an EBF height while preventing the occurrence of undesirable failure modes [150]. The method was also verified via incremental dynamic analysis (IDA) in a study by Mastrandrea et al. [151] in 2013. The above-mentioned plastic mechanism control theory was recently implemented in the design of dual EBFs (i.e. systems composed of EBFs and MRFs) by Montuori et al. [152].
uxhs | In 2006, Köber and Stefanescu [153] compared the seismic behavior of EBFs designed on the basis of four different specifications including AISC 341-02 [68] and Eurocode 8-2002 [154] using nonlinear time-history analysis. It was reported that AISC 341-02 [68] required heavier sections for columns, beams, and braces. In a companion study by these researchers [155] the positive and negative aspects of placing webs of I-shaped braces normal or parallel to the plane of EBFs were investigated. Recommendations regarding each configuration were given considering seismic performance and required amounts of steel. In 2009, Köber and Ștefanescu [156] investigated the effects of using different structural details at the plastic hinge locations near the bottom of the first story columns in EBFs. Numerical results pointed to the advantages of utilizing a detail with reduced column flanges at these locations.
ed6e | The effects of frame geometry on the seismic behavior and weight of chevron EBFs were investigated in 2008 by Özhendekci and Özhendekci [157]. It was concluded that EBFs with shear links performed better than those with intermediate and moment links. Furthermore, the use of longer shear links and shorter intermediate links was found to be advantageous in terms of seismic performance. However, it was demonstrated that for shear links, the frame weight would also increase along with the link length.
