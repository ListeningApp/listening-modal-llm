You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

next | on the relative residual prior to termination does too. In particular, at first glance, this might suggest that the smaller the inexactness tolerance <LATEX>\eta ,</LATEX> the more iterations MINRES is expected to perform before NPC detection. We argue that this is not the case. Firstly, an upper bound on the number of MINRES iterations until a NPC direction is encountered is independent of the termination criteria <LATEX>\eta</LATEX> Liu & Roosta (2022b, Corollary 2). In fact, by construction, the MIN- RES iterates are independent of the termination tolerance <LATEX>\eta</LATEX> and the magnitude of <LATEX>\| \mathrm { g } \|</LATEX> see discussion and numeri- cal examples around Liu & Roosta (2022b, Assumption 4). Additionally, in the case where <LATEX>\mathrm { g } \notin \mathrm { R a n g e } \left( \mathrm { H } \right) ,</LATEX> we always have <LATEX>\| \mathrm { r } ^ { \left( t - 1 \right) } \| \geq \| \left( \mathrm { I } - \mathrm { H H } ^ { \dagger } \right) \mathrm { g } \| ,</LATEX> which is clearly indepen- <LATEX>\mathrm { d e n t } \mathrm { o f } \eta .</LATEX> Together, these lines of argumentation constitute our justification for Assumption 3.6.
3dfm | Recall that Algorithm 1 includes a manual verification of user specified strongly positive curvature over <LATEX>\mathcal{K} _ { t } \left( \mathrm { H } , \mathrm { g } \right)</LATEX> in <LATEX>\mathrm { D } _ { \mathrm { t y p e } } = \mathrm { S O I }</LATEX> case, while Algorithm 2 only certifies strict positive curvature through the NPC condition (9). Liu & Roosta (2022a) demonstrated that as long as the NPC con- dition (9) has not been detected, we have <LATEX>\mathrm { T } _ { t } \succ 0</LATEX> where <LATEX>\mathrm { T } _ { t } \in \mathbb{R} ^ { t \times t }</LATEX> is the symmetric tridiagonal matrix obtained in the <LATEX>t ^ { \mathrm { t h } }</LATEX> iteration of MINRES (see Appendix <LATEX>\mathrm { A }</LATEX> for more

cxx7 | Assumption 3.7. There exists <LATEX>\sigma > 0</LATEX> such that for any <LATEX>\mathrm { x } _ { k }</LATEX> in the sequence of SOL type iterates returned by Algorithm 2, we have
uzqc | <LATEX>\mathrm { T } _ { t } \succ \sigma \mathrm { I } .</LATEX> Assumption 3.7 implies that, as long as the NPC condition (9) has not been detected, for any <LATEX>\mathrm { v } \in \mathcal{K} _ { t } \left( \mathrm { H } , \mathrm { g } \right)</LATEX> we have <LATEX>\langle \mathrm { v } , \mathrm { H v } \rangle \geq \sigma \| \mathrm { v } \| ^ { 2 } .</LATEX> Assumption 3.7 is satisfied by an ob- jective function whose Hessian contains positive g-relevant eigenvalues (eigenspaces not orthogonal to the gradient) uniformly separated from zero. A simple example is an under-determined least-squares problem.
dqwn | Together, Assumptions 3.6 and 3.7 allow us to control the curvature of our step, which is necessary to obtain an im- proved rate over Algorithm 1 using a Lipschitz Hessian upper bound. We now present the convergence result for Algorithm 2. We defer the proof to Appendix C.
g58m | Theorem 3.8 (Global Complexity of Algorithm <LATEX>\left. 2 \right) .</LATEX> Let <LATEX>\epsilon _ { g } \in \left( 0 , 1 \right) .</LATEX> Under Assumptions 3.1, 3.2 and 3.5 to 3.7, if we choose <LATEX>\delta _ { k } = \epsilon _ { k } = \epsilon _ { g } ^ { 1 / 2 } ,</LATEX> Algorithm 2 produces an Eg-FO point in at most <LATEX>\mathcal{O} \left( \epsilon _ { g } ^ { - 3 / 2 } \right)</LATEX> iterations.
kf9u | Remark 3.9. A direct corollary to Theorems 3.3 and 3.8, under some mild additional assumptions, is a bound on the operational complexity in terms of gradient and Hessian- vector product evaluations. In particular, to produce a <LATEX>\epsilon _ { g } \mathrm { - F O }</LATEX> point, the operation complexity for Algorithms 1 and 2 is, respectively, <LATEX>\mathcal{O} \left( \epsilon _ { g } ^ { - 2 } \right)</LATEX> and <LATEX>\widetilde { \mathcal{O} } \left( \epsilon _ { g } ^ { - 3 / 2 } \right)</LATEX> see Appendix D.
tl2g | Remark 3.10. In all our algorithms, each step includes the Newton-MR component. The integration of the gradient and Newton-MR step is feasible in our algorithm due to the properties of the MINRES iterates (Lemmas A.2 and A.3), allowing for a more flexible analysis with only first-order information. In contrast, it appears that second-order infor- mation is crucial for achieving descent with the capped-CG procedure, a central aspect of Xie & Wright (2023). This constraint prevents the algorithm from taking a step simulta- neously comprised of gradient and Newton-CG components.
