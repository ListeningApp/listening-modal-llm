You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

8ov0 | GPCRs and Cancer Immune Evasion
mj9m | The immune system is intricately linked to cancer initiation and progression, and as such, cancer immunotherapy is now one of the fastest growing areas of translational and clinical research for cancer treatment. Indeed, the functional roles of GPCRs in inflammation, cell trafficking, and the
94h3 | diversity of ligands they bind, establish GPCRs as major regulators of the tumor-immune microenvironment.
9jx1 | Chemokine receptors were initially discovered in the context of immune cell migration, where expression of chemokines in different tissues and/or in response to infection and tissue injury act to direct and recruit a diverse range of innate and adaptive immune cells225-227. This process can be hijacked by cancer cells that express chemokines such as CCL17, CCL22 and others, to attract immunosuppressive immune cells including T-regulatory cells (Tregs), which specifically express the respective receptor CCR4, to promote a tumor permissive environment and dampen immune recognition228-230 (Figure 1). This can create a potent feed-forward control system where immune suppressive cells, such as myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), which are recruited by a host of chemokines such as CXCL8, CXCL1, and CCL2, can further inhibit T cell activation and migration to the tumor231,232. Together, these processes can polarize macrophages, to the M2, or tumor associated macrophage (TAM) phenotype, further dampening the tumor- immune microenvironment233.
c3lz | In tandem, the infiltration of cytotoxic immune cells providing an anti-tumor response is also dependent on a repertoire of chemokines and chemokine receptors. The infiltration of CD8+ T cells and natural killer (NK) cells has been shown to have high prognostic value and it is mainly guided by CXCR3, which binds the CXCL9 and CXCL10 ligands in the tumor microenvironment234 (Figure 1). Additionally, conventional dendritic cells (cDCs), namely, Batf3+ cDC1s, have been shown to be the main DC subtype responsible for taking up dead tumor cells and cross-prime T cells, and their function largely depends on trafficking to the tumor by XCR1235,236. The exclusivity of XCR1 expression on cDC1s may make it an ideal target for boosting the dendritic cell antigen presentation response.
8bwk | Many by-products of tumor cell metabolism are ligands that bind GPCRs, suggesting that they may also dictate the success of cancer immunotherapies. More specifically, studies have shown that lipid compounds, nucleosides (adenosine), and prostaglandins, some of the main products of ATP breakdown and inflammation, bind GPCRs to suppress cytotoxic function of immune cells237,238. As our understanding of normal and aberrant GPCR signalling deepens, assessing levels of bioactive GPCR ligands, in addition to chemokine and chemokine receptor expression could also help guide clinical strategies. For example, increased CXCL9, CXCL10 and CXCL11 are associated with improved survival, and are part of an interferon-induced gene expression

mqot | Tumor-immune interactions are increasingly becoming the target of therapeutic agents intended to break the cross-talk that enables cancer progression. Currently, there are several therapeutics targeting chemokine receptors such CXCR4, CCR2 and CCR4, and the adenosine-binding A2AR receptor (ADORA2A) being explored for the treatment of cancer240,241 (Figure 1). For example, mogamulizumab, an FDA-approved monoclonal antibody targeting CCR4 is being used for the treatment of lymphomas as monotherapy and is being tested in combination with other treatments242. Targeting GPCRs for their immunomodulatory functions in cancer present an exciting and promising field that has the potential to revolutionize how cancer is treated in the future.
oc99 | GPCRs and Tumor Promoting Inflammation
gipz | Chronic inflammation has been consistently linked to cancer. In particular, prostaglandins (PG) and specifically prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) are key mediators of inflammation, generated by cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes from arachidonic acid243,244. Binding of PGE2 to their cognate GPCRs, EP1-4 (PTGER1-4), induces inflammatory responses tightly linking GPCR-driven signalling to inflammation that is well established to contribute to tumor development and progression (Figure 1). COX2 mediated production of PGs, in particular PGE2 has been found to promote tumorigenesis in a broad range of cancer types, with a prominent role in gastrointestinal cancers245-247. In the context of colorectal cancer, increased expression of PGE2 has been found to drive polyp formation, proliferation and cell motility248. This has been suggested in part, to be due to PGE2-driven activation of ß-catenin, which may synergize with APC inactivation commonly found in colon cancer133,249,250. COX-2 and PGE2 driven expression of pro-angiogenic chemokines can further enhance the tumor growth and progression251,252. Chronic inflammation, via COX2 overexpression, can also lead to immune suppression and promote tumor growth (see above) 253-256
b4wj | Overexpression of COX-2 itself has been shown to be sufficient to induce tumorigenesis and invasiveness in various models257,258. Conversely, there is strong epidemiological data linking decreased mortality for colorectal carcinoma patients taking NSAIDs, which are inhibitors of both COX-1 and COX-2132,259. Aligned with this, COX inhibitors are being explored in multiple human clinical trials for cancer prevention and as an adjuvant therapy, and have shown promising results in colorectal cancer and other cancer types 260-262.
5xlt | GPCRs and Cancer Metastasis
9bz4 | Migration and metastasis of cancer cells are highly coordinated processes that are tightly regulated by numerous signalling and transcriptional events263. Signalling through G protein- coupled chemokine receptors is central to many of these processes and consequently, has been widely implicated in driving several aspects of cancer metastasis. Upon binding of their chemokine ligands, chemokine receptors (CXCRs) can stimulate interaction, migration and trafficking of both immune and cancer cells within and between tissues in the body4,264. Both chemokines and bioactive lipids can also induce the secretion of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) by tumor and immune cells to facilitate tumor cell extravasation 231,244,265-267
