You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

ap5o | In that particular case, Deane J went on to find that the arguments for change based upon suggested policy and principle were 'not sufficiently strong' to warrant the court's departing from the established law.100 He stated that, in such a situation, change was the proper domain of the leg- islation 'enacted after full inquiry and informed assessment of interna- tional as well as domestic considerations of a kind which the Court is not equipped to make of its own initiative.'101 Despite these cautious words, one is left with the impression that, if the policy considerations before Deane J had been considered more compelling, the judge would have had little hesitation in overruling the pre-existing authorities. As such, the comments of Deane J represent a clear recognition of the proper and legitimate creative role of the courts - especially of the nation's highest court.
7zvf | THE HIGH COURT 'CREATES' LAW
mov9 | That the High Court of Australia has substantially abandoned strict ad- herence to past authority and the notion of judicial restraint is evidenced not just in Mabo. It can be seen in a number of recent decisions which exemplify that court's new-found creativity.
ks7m | In Trident General Insurance Co. Ltd v McNeice Bros Pty Ltd, 102 the High Court by majority103 held that a person, not a party to an insurance con- tract, was entitled to enforce the indemnity against the party's liability to pay damages as the result of a successful claim in negligence against the party. While the ramifications of the decision remain to be explored, the decision may have dispensed with the doctrine of privity of contract. It
w1w1 | may have done so by court decision and this despite many calls for legis- lative reform which earlier fell upon deaf ears in Parliament.
h8gv | Similarly, in Mckinney v The Queen, 104 the High Court, by majority,105 laid down a 'rule of practice for the future' to be applied in the context of confessions made by a person in police custody. The 'rule' was that, wher- ever police evidence of a confessional statement allegedly made by an accused while in police custody was disputed at trial, and its making was not reliably corroborated, the judge should warn the jury of the danger of convicting on the basis of that evidence alone.106 Law reform bodies had for years cried out for legislative reform in this area (as Brennan J noted in a powerful dissent107). The court-mandated requirement would have implications for police practice and resources. Yet the High Court would wait no longer for legislation based on law reform reports. It acted reso- lutely itself to defend the justice of proceedings in Australian courts.
kwkp | In R v L,108 the High Court unanimously109 rejected the notion that, by reason of marriage, there was an irrevocable consent to sexual intercourse on the part of a spouse. This legal fiction had survived for two centuries. It was peremptorily terminated.
yj0m | In Australian Capital Television Pty Ltd v The Commonwealth (No. 2)110 the High Court, by majority,111 held invalid key provisions of the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Act 1991 (Cth) upon the ground that they involved a severe impairment of freedoms previously enjoyed by Australian citizens to discuss public and political affairs and to criticise federal institutions. An implied guarantee of freedom of speech with re- spect to public and political discussion was found to be inherent to a con- stitutional democracy such as Australia.112 This was despite the fact that previous suggestions that the Australian Constitution required freedom of speech and other communication113 had been strongly rejected.114
ewfp | In David Securities Pty Ltd & Ors v Commonwealth Bank of Australia, 115 the majority116 held that a rule, well settled for nearly 200 years, preclud-

m50z | ing the recovery of money paid under mistake of law should no longer be regarded as part of the law of Australia.
me84 | In Dietrich v The Queen,117 the majority118 held that, in the absence of exceptional circumstances, a judge should, on application, adjourn, post- pone or stay a criminal trial where an indigent accused person, charged with a serious offence is, through no fault of their own, unable to obtain legal representation. If such an application were refused and the result- ing trial were unfair, the conviction might be quashed upon the ground of miscarriage of justice. This decision was in marked contrast to the ear- lier decision of the High Court in McInnis v The Queen.119 The dissent of Murphy J in that case was approved, and followed, in the Dietrich case.
o56m | These examples clearly demonstrate the High Court's marked tendency towards judicial activism and creativity.120 Against such a pro-active and reformatory approach, it ought not have come as any real surprise to the astute observer of the judiciary in Australia that the High Court in Mabo would adopt the course which it did. No doubt the Mabo decision is crea- tive. No doubt it sits upon the fine line which separates a truly legislative act from the exercise of true judicial function. However, it is certainly consistent with the recent approach of the High Court to many difficult problems where injustices have long endured and been completely ig- nored by the legislature despite repeated calls for urgent reform.
slz6 | A system based upon the common law, of its nature, requires a crea- tive judiciary. If the judges of the common law did not so act, the law would fail to adapt and change to modern society. In the past, strict legal- ism usually served society well. Nowadays, a mature common law sys- tem requires that strict legalism be tempered by judicial consideration of both principle and policy in stating what the law is. Strict and complete legalism, giving effect to simple views concerning the separation of pow- ers doctrine, has become entirely inappropriate to a modern common law system. This is especially the case where the system operates under a written constitution designed to endure indefinitely. The recent increase in apparent creativity on the part of the courts in Australia may be the more noticeable only because of their earlier abstinence long maintained. That abstinence may have created a log jam of injustice which only now the High Court and other Australian courts are striving to clear.
90k5 | Where inquiry is focused upon the creative nature of the judiciary, except in very clear cases, the debate often turns to emotive, rather than substantive, questions. Mabo is a very clear example of this. The essential complaint is not about the legal veracity of the Mabo decision. Pace Mr Connolly, few would argue that six of the seven Justices of the High Court
9m8s | simply got the law wrong. The essential complaint, as I understand it, is that the court ought not have done what it did in this case. Yet Mabo, reduced to fundamentals, says only that: (a) our system of real property law accommodates native title; (b) native title may be extinguished; (c) it may be extinguished in a number of ways by either the Crown or by the indigenous people themselves; and (d) where it has been extinguished there may (or may not) be a right to compensation.
