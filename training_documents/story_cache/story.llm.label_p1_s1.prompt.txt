You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

06yq | Microdosing with psychedelics to self-medicate for ADHD symptoms in adults: A naturalistic study

2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

t8vv | NARRATIVE APPPROACH
qvnu | Assumptions:
kggw | 1. People create meaning through narratives. - > making sense of the world through narratives / stories
xrd1 | 2. Meaning is contructed in historical, social, cultural, and political contexts.
5746 | 3. There is no "truth", only interpretations of "reality". -- > subjective construction
7toz | 4. Narratives shape one's self-concept and identity. The stories people tell about themselves reflect their beliefs, values, and personal history, contributing to the formation of a coherent sense of self.

y4mj | NARRATIVE ANALYSIS
vpgq | an approach taken to interview data that is concerned with understanding how and why people talk about their lives as a story or a series of stories. This inevitably includes issues of identity and the interaction between the narrator and audience(s).
ousl | STEPS:
m4ju | FRAMING THE ANALYTICAL PROCESS
a0mb | Clearly define the objective of your analysis. Decide what aspect of the narratives you want to explore and what insights you hope to gain.
ki8m | COLLECT THE NARRATIVE / S
km8w | Decide on how you would collect the narratives / stories
wzno | FAMILIARIZATION
xagm | Read or listen to the narratives multiple times to become familiar with the content and context. Take notes on key themes, emotions, patterns, and any initial impressions.
iwn5 | CODING
uooz | Identify and code meaningful units within the narratives. Codes are labels or categories that capture recurring themes, emotions, events, or elements of the stories -- > Read references, review related literature (make sure codes are justifiable!)
pxbq | STEPS:
jfsr | THEME DEVELOPMENT
u15r | Analyze the coded data within each category to identify overarching themes. These themes could represent recurring patterns, ideas, emotions, or experiences that are present in the narratives.
lq35 | NARRATIVE STRUCTURE ANALYSIS
3g9w | Pay attention to the structure of the narratives, including the way events are sequenced, the use of chronology, temporal shifts, and the inclusion of reflective elements. This can provide insights into how individuals construct their stories.
d09o | CONTEXTUAL ANALYSIS
ylhz | Consider the cultural, social, historical, and personal contexts in which the narratives were created. These contexts can influence the way narratives are constructed and interpreted.
a3td | INTERPRETATION AND MEANING- MAKING
ex5k | Reflect on the meanings conveyed in the narratives. Consider how individuals use storytelling to make sense of their experiences, emotions, and identities. Interpret the underlying messages and values present in the stories.
9d4o | STEPS:
cjq2 | GENERATING FINDINGS
5esx | Summarize your findings in a coherent and organized manner. Present the main themes, insights, and interpretations that emerged from the analysis.
m5ka | REFLEXIVITY
byu8 | Reflect on your own biases, assumptions, and perspectives that might have influenced the analysis. This reflexivity helps ensure the validity and credibility of your findings.
76b0 | ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS
zxz6 | Throughout the analysis process, ensure ethical treatment of the narratives and the individuals who shared them. Protect confidentiality, respect privacy, and accurately represent the narratives.
xnth | REPORT WRITING
vafm | Write a comprehensive report detailing your narrative analysis process, findings, and interpretations. Include relevant excerpts from the narratives to support your points.
