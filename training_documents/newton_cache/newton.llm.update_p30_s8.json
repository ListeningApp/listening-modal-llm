We now demonstrate the sufficient decrease of the Type Two step.\nxbmu | Lemma C point six Type Two Step: Sufficient Decrease. Assume that F satisfies Assumptions three point one and three point five. Suppose that a Type Two step is taken on iteration K of Algorithm two, that is, I left parenthesis X sub K comma delta sub K right parenthesis is not equal to empty set and norm of G sub K superscript I is greater than epsilon sub K squared. Let X sub K plus one equal to P left parenthesis X sub K plus alpha sub K P sub K right parenthesis where alpha sub K is the largest step size satisfying the termination condition eleven, see Lemma C point four. Suppose that MINRES returns D sub NPE equals SOL and Assumption three point seven is satisfied. Then, if norm of G sub K plus one superscript I is greater than zero we have\nrp75 | F left parenthesis X sub K plus one right parenthesis minus F left parenthesis X sub K right parenthesis is less than negative rho sigma minimum of the square root of three sigma left parenthesis one minus two rho right parenthesis divided by L sub H C sub sigma comma L sub G to the power of three halves, epsilon sub K cubed, C sub sigma comma L sub G cubed delta sub K epsilon sub K squared, C sub zero squared norm of G sub K plus one superscript I squared divided by two epsilon sub K squared, C sub zero squared epsilon sub K squared divided by two. Where C sub zero is defined in Lemma C point five. Note that if norm of G sub K plus one superscript I equals zero strict inequality must be replaced with superscript mathfrak C sub zeta stackrel less than or equal to superscript mathcal W. On the other hand, if D sub RPPE equals NPC and Assumption three point six is satisfied, then\n62hx | F left parenthesis X sub K plus one right parenthesis minus F left parenthesis X sub K right parenthesis is less than negative rho minimum of the square root of six left parenthesis one minus rho right parenthesis divided by L sub H omega to the power of three halves epsilon sub K cubed, omega delta sub K epsilon sub K squared.\nn5mv | Inexact Newton-type Methods for Optimisation with Nonnegativity Constraints.\n3lem | Proof.
