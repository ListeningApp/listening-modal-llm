        "content": "013l | Say a system with finitely many states maximizes entropy subject to a constraint on the expected value of some quantity E that we choose to call 'energy'. Then its probability of being in the ith state is proportional to exp(negative B E i) for some number.\n4flw | When B is big and positive, the probability of being in a state of high energy is tiny, since exp(negative B E i) gets very small for large energies E j. This means our system is cold.\npzyx | Conversely when B is small and positive, exp(negative B E i) drops off very slowly as the energy E i gets bigger. So, high-energy states become quite likely when B is small and positive. This means our system is hot.\nqc4k | It turns out B is inversely proportional to the temperature more about that later. But in modern physics, B is just as important as temperature. It comes straight from the principle of maximum entropy!\nbtsb | So B deserves a name. And its name is 'coolness'.\ns1u0 | By the way, the formula\nju0a | Pi equals B E i\ne4y0 | is only strictly true when B is finite. There's also a limiting case B approaches plus zero, when pi equals zero except for states of the very lowest energy. And there's a limiting case B approaches negative zero, where Pi equals zero except for states of the very highest energy. I'll say a bit about these oddities later. First I'll say more about what coolness has to do with temperature.\nkpra | COOLNESS VERSUS TEMPERATURE\negbi | Coolness B is inversely proportional to temperature T:\nbnhs | where k is Boltzmann's constant.\nktv2 | Coolness is measured in joules to the negative one, temperature is measured in kelvin, and Boltzmann's constant is a conversion factor:\nwoy6 | k equals one point three eight zero six four nine times ten to the negative twenty-three joules kelvin\n6xev | In statistical mechanics, coolness is inversely proportional to temperature. But coolness has units of energy to the negative one, not temperature to the negative one. So we need a constant to convert between coolness and inverse temperature! And this constant is very interesting.\nu2ud | Remember: when a system maximizes entropy with a constraint on its expected energy, the probability of it having energy E is proportional to exp(negative B E) where B is its coolness. But we can only exponentiate dimensionless quantities! (Why?) So B has dimensions of one over energy.\n3qum | Since coolness is inversely proportional to temperature, we must have B equals one over k T where k is some constant with dimensions of energy over temperature. This constant k is called 'Boltzmann's constant'. It's tiny:\nobst | k equals one point three eight zero six four nine times ten to the negative twenty-three joules per kelvin,\n3mg9 | This is mainly because we use units of energy, joules, suited to macroscopic objects like a cup of hot water. Boltzmann's constant being tiny reveals that such things have enormously many microscopic states!\n4j8f | Later we'll see that a single classical point particle, in empty space, has energy three k T divided by two when it's maximizing entropy at temperature T. The three here is because the atom can move in three directions, the one half because we integrate x squared to get this result. The important part is k T. The k T says: if an ideal gas is made of atoms, each atom contributes just a tiny bit of energy per kelvin, or degree Celsius: roughly ten to the negative twenty-three joules. So a little bit of gas, like a gram of hydrogen, must have roughly ten to the twenty-three atoms in it. This is a very rough estimate, but it's a big deal.\ne3ba | Indeed, the number of atoms in a gram of hydrogen is about six times ten to the twenty-three. You may have heard of Avogadro's number-this is quite close to that. So Boltzmann's constant gives a hint that matter is made of atoms-and even better, a nice rough estimate of how many per gram!\n8c0j | Later we will see that Boltzmann's constant has another important meaning: it's a fundamental unit of entropy, a nat, expressed in joules per kelvin.\nurfd | TEMPERATURE\nwhtg | If a system has finitely many states with energies E i, in thermal equilibrium at temperature T the probability that it's in the ith state is Pi propotional to exp(negative E i over k T)\n2u5k | where k is Boltzmann's constant and T can be positive, negative, or even infinite:\nf8wg | T equals infinity\nhgz1 | T is less than zero\nkhf5 | T is greater than zero\nya4d | A system with finitely many states can be pretty weird. It can have negative temperature! Even weirder: as you heat it up, its temperature becomes large and positive, then it reaches infinity, and then it 'wraps around' and becomes large and negative.\ndzub | The reason: coolness is more fundamental than temperature. The coolness B is inversely proportional to the temperature T:\noidq | B equals one over k T.\nfp0u | When the temperature goes up to infinity and then suddenly becomes a large negative number, it's really just the coolness going down to zero and becoming negative. Temperatures 'wrap around' infinity, as shown in the picture.\n34lv | A system with finitely many states can have negative or infinite temperature because in thermal equilibrium, its probability of being in the ith state is\ngmoh | proportional to exp(negative B E i) over the sum of exp(negative B E i) from i equals one to n.\n2xvo | Pi\nfhh2 | where E i is the energy of the ith state, and this makes sense for any B in the reals. Moreover, the probability pi depends continuously on B, even as B passes through zero. This means a large positive temperature is almost like a large negative temperature!\nc2q0 | But the circle of temperature can be misleading. Temperatures wrap around T equals infinity but not T equals zero. A system with a small positive temperature is very different from one with a small negative temperature! That's because pi for B is much greater than zero is very different than it is for B is less than zero.\n4wwg | For a system with finitely many states we can take the limit of the Boltzmann distribution when B approaches plus zero; then the system will only occupy its lowest-energy state or states. We can also take the limit when B approaches negative infinity; then the system will only occupy its highest-energy state or states. In terms of temperature, this means that the limit where T approaches zero from above is very different than the limit where T approaches zero from below.\nix7t | So, for a system with finitely many states, the best picture of possible thermal equilibria is not a circle of temperatures but a closed interval of coolness: the coolness B can be anything in negative zero to plus infinity, which topologically is a closed interval. In terms of coolness, plus zero is different from negative zero, but approaching zero from above is the same as approaching it from below. But in terms of temperature, approaching zero from above is different from approaching zero from below, while a temperature of infinity is the same as a temperature of negative zero.\na46e | Now, if all this seems very weird, here's why: we often describe physical systems using infinitely many states, with a lowest possible energy but no highest possible energy. In this case the sum in the Boltzmann distribution can't converge for B is less than zero, so negative temperatures are ruled out.\nozpq | However, some physical systems can be approximately described using a finite set of states (or in quantum theory, a finite-dimensional Hilbert space of states). Then the things I just said hold true! And people enjoy studying these systems, and their strange properties, in the lab.\n22sy | It's good to look at a simple example, and work everything out explicitly:\nkuwj | Puzzle twenty-five. Suppose a system has two states with energies E one and E two. Compute the probabilities pi that it is in either of these states in thermal equilibrium as a function of the coolness B. Then express these probabilities as a function of the temperature T. Using these functions pi(T):\nb3n9 | Show that when zero is less than T and T is less than infinity, the system is more likely to be in the lower-energy state: P one of T is greater than p two of T.\n",
