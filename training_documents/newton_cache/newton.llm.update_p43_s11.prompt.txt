You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

tpiw | We first show that if <LATEX>\mathrm { z } ^ { * } = \left[ \mathrm { x } _ { + } ^ { * } , \mathrm { x } _ { - } ^ { * } \right]</LATEX> satisfies (59) and (60) then <LATEX>\mathrm { x } ^ { * } = \mathrm { x } _ { + } ^ { * } - \mathrm { x } _ { - } ^ { * }</LATEX> satisfies (61). First, suppose <LATEX>\left[ \mathrm { x } ^ { * } \right] ^ { i } > 0 .</LATEX> In this case, we must have <LATEX>\left[ \mathrm { x } ^ { * } \right] ^ { i } = \left[ \mathrm { x } _ { + } ^ { * } \right] ^ { i } > 0 = \left[ \mathrm { x } _ { - } ^ { * } \right] ^ { i } ,</LATEX> which from the first case of (59) implies the first case of (61). When <LATEX>\left[ \mathrm { x } ^ { * } \right] ^ { i } < 0 ,</LATEX> since <LATEX>\left[ \mathrm { x } ^ { * } \right] ^ { i } = \left[ \mathrm { x } _ { - } ^ { * } \right] ^ { i } > 0 = \left[ \mathrm { x } _ { + } ^ { * } \right] ^ { i } ,</LATEX> the first case of (60) implies the first case of (61). Finally, when <LATEX>\left[ \mathrm { x } ^ { * } \right] ^ { i } = 0 ,</LATEX> we have <LATEX>\left[ \mathrm { x } _ { + } ^ { * } \right] ^ { i } = \left[ \mathrm { x } _ { - } ^ { * } \right] ^ { i } = 0 ,</LATEX> and we appeal to the second case of both (59) and (60) to obtain
dgkq | <LATEX>\left[ \nabla f \left( \mathrm { x } _ { * } \right) \right] ^ { i } \geq - \lambda , \quad \mathrm { a n d } \quad \left[ \nabla f \left( \mathrm { x } _ { * } \right) \right] ^ { i } \leq \lambda ,</LATEX> which implies <LATEX>| \left[ \nabla f \left( \mathrm { x } _ { * } \right) \right] ^ { i } | \leq \lambda ,</LATEX> i.e., the third case of (61).
hxjr | We now show that if <LATEX>\mathrm { x } ^ { * } = \mathrm { x } _ { + } ^ { * } - \mathrm { x } _ { - } ^ { * }</LATEX> satisfies (61), then if <LATEX>\mathrm { z } ^ { * } = \left[ \mathrm { x } _ { + } ^ { * } , \mathrm { x } _ { - } ^ { * } \right]</LATEX> satisfies (59) and (60). Consider the first case of (61). Noting again that <LATEX>\left[ \mathrm { x } ^ { * } \right] ^ { i } = \left[ \mathrm { x } _ { + } ^ { * } \right] ^ { i } > 0 = \left[ \mathrm { x } _ { - } ^ { * } \right] ^ { i } ,</LATEX> it clearly implies the first and the second cases of (59) and (60), respectively (recall <LATEX>\lambda > 0</LATEX> 0). Similarly, the second case of (61) implies the second and the first cases of (59) and (60), respectively. Finally, it is clear that the third case of (61) implies the second case for both (59) and (60).
2yv3 | F.3. Additional Experimental Details
opoe | Oracle Calls as Complexity Measure Following the typical convection in the optimisation literature, in all our ex- periments, we plot the objective value against the total number of oracle calls for function, gradient, and Hessian-vector product evaluations. We adopt this approach because the measurement of "wall-clock" time can be heavily dependent on specific implementation details and computational platform. In contrast, counting the number of equivalent function evaluations, as an implementation and system independent unit of complexity is more appropriate and fair. More specifically, upon evaluating the function, computing its gradient is equivalent to one additional function evaluation, and computing a Hessian-vector product requires two additional function evaluations compared to a gradient evaluation (Pearlmutter, 1994). For example, in neural networks, for a given data at the input layer, evaluation of network's output, i.e., function evaluation, involves one forward propagation. The corresponding gradient is computed by performing one additional backward propagation. After computing the gradient, an additional forward followed by a backward propagation give the corresponding Hessian-vector product (Goodfellow et al., 2016).
vr2v | Parameter Settings In all experiments we set <LATEX>\epsilon _ { k } = \delta _ { k } = \sqrt { \epsilon _ { g } }</LATEX> as per Theorem 3.8. For the Newton-MR TMP we set the inexactness condition for MINRES, i.e., (10), to <LATEX>\eta = 1 0 ^ { - 2 }</LATEX> for convex problems and <LATEX>\eta = 1</LATEX> for nonconvex problems. We apply a less stringent tolerance in the nonconvex case to maximise the chances of terminating early with a "good enough"

Specifically, in the notation of Xie & Wright (2023), we set the accuracy parameter and back tracking parameter to <LATEX>\zeta = \theta = 0 . 5</LATEX> and the step acceptance parameter to <LATEX>\eta = 0 . 2 .</LATEX> Furthermore, following the algorithmic to have equivalent termination conditions, we modify the gradient negativity check <LATEX>\begin{array}{} \text { lescription of Xie } 8 \text { Wright } \left( 2 0 2 3 \right) , \text { and } \\ \text { from } g _ { L } ^ { i } < - \epsilon _ { L } ^ { 3 / 2 } \text { to g } _ { k } ^ { i } < - \epsilon _ { k } \text { for this } \end{array}</LATEX> <LATEX>\mathrm { g } _ { k } ^ { i } < - \epsilon _ { k } ^ { 3 / 2 }</LATEX> <LATEX>\mathrm { g } _ { k } ^ { i } < - \epsilon _ { k }</LATEX> method.
