Left untreated or with failure of the Kasai procedure, biliary atresia progresses to biliary cirrhosis, end-stage liver failure and death within the first years of life. Differentiating biliary atresia from other nonsurgical causes of neonatal cholestasis is difficult as there is no single method for diagnosing biliary atresia and clinical, laboratory and imaging features of this disease overlap with those of other causes of neonatal cholestasis. In this second part, we discuss the roles of magnetic resonance cholecystopancreatography, hepatobiliary scintigraphy, percutaneous biopsy and percutaneous cholecysto-cholangiography. Among imaging techniques, ultrasound signs have a high specificity, although a normal ultrasound examination does not rule out biliary atresia. Other imaging techniques with direct opacification of the biliary tree combined with percutaneous liver biopsy have roles in equivocal cases. Magnetic resonance cholecystopancreatography and hepatobiliary scintigraphy are not useful for the diagnosis of biliary atresia. We propose a decisional flowchart for biliary atresia diagnosis based on ultrasound signs, including elastography, percutaneous cholecysto-cholangiography or endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and liver biopsy.\ncop0 | Introduction\nlhkq | Biliary atresia is an important cause of obstructive jaundice in infants causing progressive fibrosis and obliteration of extrahepatic and intrahepatic bile ducts and resulting in biliary cirrhosis in the absence of early surgery. Jaundice with pale\n82ju | stools and dark urine is present within the first days or weeks of life. The prevalence of biliary atresia ranges from one in five thousand to one in twenty thousand worldwide depending on the geographic area, with the highest prevalence in Taiwan. The aetiology of biliary atresia is unknown and different causes have been proposed including viral infections, genetic factors or toxins.\ny2qo | There are two forms of biliary atresia: the non-syndromic form, which accounts for about eighty percent of cases, and the syndromic form, also called biliary atresia splenic malformation syndrome, which accounts for about twenty percent of cases. The syndromic form is associated with polysplenia, intestinal malrotation, preduodenal portal vein, interrupted\n1piq | inferior vena cava, aberrant hepatic artery, abdominal heterotaxia and congenital heart disease. There are also different subtypes of biliary atresia according to the extent of fibrosis in extrahepatic bile ducts and the presence of a cyst of the extrahepatic bile duct. In all cases, intrahepatic bile ducts\n7fqw | are fibrotic, which explains the absence of bile duct dilatation despite a biliary obstacle. The histology is characterized by bile duct proliferation, bile plugs, portal or perilobular fibrosis, oedema and the preservation of the basic hepatic lobular architecture. Histology is not specific\nrhaz | and disorders such as parenteral nutrition-associated cholestasis, cystic fibrosis and alpha one antitrypsin deficiency may mimic biliary atresia. Liver biopsy specimens obtained before six weeks of age could be indistinguishable from neonatal hepatitis. If left untreated, patients with biliary atresia will die within the first years of life from complications of biliary cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease.\nwak1 | The primary treatment for biliary atresia is the Kasai hepatoportoenterostomy, which consists of resecting the choledocal remnants, gallbladder and portal plate and constructing a jejunal Roux-en-Y anastomosis (Kasai procedure) or cholecystostomy to restore biliary drainage. If biliary atresia patients have surgery within the first sixty days of life, bile flow can be established in seventy percent of cases; patients who have surgery after ninety days of life achieve sufficient bile flow only in twenty percent of cases. Liver transplantation is performed if primary Kasai hepatoportoenteostomy fails or in case of delayed diagnosis with advanced cirrhosis that contraindicates Kasai surgery. Rapid diagnosis at the onset of symptoms is the main goal of imaging considering the paramount importance of early surgical treatment.\nwtfz | Differentiating biliary atresia from other nonsurgical causes of neonatal cholestasis is challenging. Gamma glutamyl transpeptidase is an important biomarker in the differential diagnosis of neonatal cholestasis showing higher levels in children with biliary atresia than in those without biliary atresia. Ultrasound, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography, hepatobiliary scintigraphy, liver percutaneous biopsy, percutaneous cholecysto-cholangiography and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography are used in the work-up for biliary atresia, but surgery with intraoperative cholangiography and biopsy is the only reference standard for diagnosis.\nqy1i | We divided our results in two linked papers. In part one, we discussed the prenatal ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging diagnosis and the early postnatal ultrasound findings. In this second part, we discuss the role of magnetic resonance cholecystopancreatography, nuclear medicine, percutaneous biopsy, percutaneous cholecystocholangiography and risk scores. Based on this literature review and discussions within the European Society of Paediatric Radiology Abdominal Taskforce, both via emails and during plenary sessions, a suggested diagnostic pathway for patients with suspected biliary atresia is proposed as a consensus statement from the European Society of Paediatric Radiology.\n1k9e | Systematic review\n5bjs | The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement was applied to this review. In December twenty nineteen, two of the authors, both with sixteen years of experience, independently and systematically\nuodj | searched on PubMed all articles published from January nineteen ninety-nine to December one, twenty nineteen. Keywords included magnetic resonance imaging and biliary atresia, percutaneous cholecystocholangiography and biliary atresia, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and biliary atresia, percutaneous liver biopsy and biliary atresia, nuclear medicine and biliary atresia, biliary atresia and risk scores. The two readers in consensus selected eligible papers based on title and abstract. Only articles in English were considered for analysis. We matched author names and affiliations to avoid data duplication and we included only the most recent or complete study of the same authors including the same patients. No papers were dismissed due to the children's ages or the type of study.\nk16v | Imaging techniques\nb2lm | Magnetic resonance cholecystopancreatography\nti7f | One hundred fifty-two studies were identified for initial review. On the basis of title or abstract, one hundred forty-one papers were excluded and eleven papers were identified as relevant.\n```",
