        "content": "pbea | The follow-up form also included a series of \"yes/no\" questions asking about the abortion experience, including satisfaction with the service, and whether: using it had been the right choice; affording the full donation (which at the time of data collection was ninety dollars) had been difficult; enough information had been provided about\nccpt | Articles\n0fpw | the abortion process; and enough support was available from family and friends. We calculated the proportions of people answering \"yes\" and \"no\" to each question.\ndqn8 | Data analysis was conducted using Stata version fifteen point one. The Institutional Review Board of the University of Texas at Austin approved the study.\ncop0 | Role of the funding source\nlhkq | Neither funding source that supported the investigators during the study had any involvement in study design, data collection, analysis or interpretation, and had no role in the writing of this manuscript or the decision to submit for publication.\n82ju | Results\ny2qo | Between twentieth March two thousand eighteen and twentieth March two thousand nineteen, Aid Access provided mifepristone and misoprostol by mail to four thousand five hundred eighty-four people. Among these, three thousand one hundred eighty-six provided follow-up information for a follow-up rate of seventy percent. Of those who provided follow-up information, two thousand seven hundred ninety-seven, eighty-eight percent, confirmed use of the medications and provided information on the outcome of their abortion, while three hundred eighty-nine, twelve percent, confirmed non-use of the medications. Reasons for non-use included spontaneous pregnancy loss, forty-five percent, accessing abortion care in a clinic, twenty-one percent, deciding to continue the pregnancy, nineteen percent, shipping delays, six percent, having self-managed using another method, three percent, the pregnancy being a false alarm, three percent; and experiencing symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy, for which they reported receiving clinical treatment, zero point five percent. An additional three percent did not specify a reason for not using the medications.\n1piq | The demographic and clinical characteristics of those who provided follow-up information vs. those who did not are shown in Table one. Among those who provided follow-up, ninety-four point nine percent reported being under seven weeks pregnant at the time of requesting the service. The majority, sixty-three point one percent, were aged under thirty. Virtually all, ninety-nine point four percent, felt okay about their decision to have an abortion and none\n7fqw | had any contraindications to abortion medications. A greater proportion of those who provided follow-up were aged twenty or over, eighty-nine point one percent vs. eighty-five point four, P is less than point zero one, already had children, fifty-eight point one percent vs. forty-eight point four percent, P is less than point zero zero one, and had not received an ultrasound scan prior to their abortion, ninety point four percent vs. eighty-seven point six percent, P equals point zero zero five. There were no significant differences in any characteristic, including gestation, that might reasonably bias the follow-up group towards more favorable outcomes.\nrhaz | Among those who confirmed use of the medications, N equals two thousand seven hundred ninety-seven, two thousand four hundred two, eighty-six percent, reported being under ten weeks pregnant, while three hundred ninety-five, fourteen percent, reported being ten weeks pregnant or more. Overall, ninety-nine point zero percent of all those who used the medications reported having ended their pregnancies, and ninety-six point four percent reported a successful medication abortion, i.e., ending their pregnancies with no surgical intervention. There was no significant difference by gestation in the proportion reporting ending their pregnancies, ninety-nine point one percent vs. ninety-eight point two percent, P equals zero point zero nine seven, but those who were less than ten weeks pregnant had a lower rate of surgical intervention compared to those who were ten weeks or more, two point zero percent vs. six point one percent, P is less than point zero zero one. Overall, among the seventy-two people who reported receiving a procedure to help end their pregnancy, fifty-four received dilation and curettage, twelve received aspiration, and six did not specify procedure type. No ectopic pregnancies were reported among those who confirmed use of the medications.\nwak1 | Potentially serious adverse events were not common. Overall, twenty-nine people, one point zero percent, reported experiencing any serious adverse event. Of these, eighteen people, zero point six percent, reported receiving a blood transfusion and fifteen, zero point five percent, reported receiving intravenous antibiotics, four people reported receiving both. No deaths were reported by family, friends, clinicians, the authorities, or the media. Rates of adverse events overall were more common among those who reported a gestation of ten weeks or more as compared with those who were less than ten weeks, two point three percent vs. zero point eight percent, P equals zero point zero zero nine.\nwtfz | Among the two thousand seven hundred ninety-seven people who provided follow-up information, two thousand two hundred sixty-eight, eighty-one percent, reported on the acceptability of their self-management experience. Almost\nqy1i | all, ninety-eight point four percent, felt satisfied with the service, and ninety-five point five percent felt it was the right choice for them. Most, ninety-eight point one percent, felt they had enough information on how to use the medications, and ninety-three point four percent felt they had enough information\n1k9e | Articles\n5bjs | on what to expect from the process. Fewer, eighty-one percent, felt that they had enough support from family or friends, and sixty-one point eight percent had difficulty affording the full requested donation.\nuodj | Articles\nk16v | Discussion\nb2lm | We used a data set containing all available outcomes of self-managed medication abortions provided through online telemedicine, outside the formal healthcare system, in the U.S. for one year. We found that abortions self-managed using this model were highly effective, with reported success rates comparing favorably with medication abortions carried out up to ten weeks within the formal U.S. healthcare setting. The reported prevalence of serious adverse events was very low, and the users of service reported high levels of satisfaction.\nti7f | Our results offer the first insight into the outcomes of self-managed medication abortions provided using online telemedicine in the U.S. The high effectiveness rates and low prevalence of serious adverse events we found mirror findings from other countries where medication self-management is used. We note that although most people in our study did not receive an ultrasound, they reported awareness of the duration of their pregnancy at the time of medication use. These findings are in line with prior evidence suggesting that last menstrual period is an accurate method for determining gestation in early pregnancy and World Health Organization guidelines, which clearly specifies that ultrasound is not a necessary pre-requisite for medication abortion.\noksu | Our findings also add to evidence on the safety and effectiveness of self-managed medication abortion beyond ten weeks. While rates of surgical intervention were higher among the small proportion in our study who used the medications after ten weeks compared to those at ten weeks or under, almost all were able to end their pregnancies and the rate of successful medication",
