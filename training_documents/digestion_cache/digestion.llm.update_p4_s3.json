        "content": "dvms | The midgut is connected to the hepatopancreas, so named because it combines the functions of the vertebrate liver and pancreas. The hepatopancreas forms a pair of glands on either side of the stomach where it occupies a large proportion of the cephalothorax.\nqrd3 | The hepatopancreas is also known as the midgut gland or digestive gland. This organ is particularly large in decapod crustaceans, where it makes up two to six percent of the body mass. The colour of the hepatopancreas is variable (e.g., brown, red, green, yellow) depending on the pigments that it contains. Each half of the hepatopancreas consists of a cluster of ducts that subdivide into small tubules that make up the glandular mass. The primary duct of each gland opens into the midgut. Digested food and secretions exchange between the gland and the midgut as a result of the peristaltic action of circular and longitudinal muscles.\nrxrg | The hepatopancreas is responsible for the secretion of digestive enzymes, the absorption of nutrients, the storage of energy reserves and the transport of monovalent and divalent ions. Digestive enzymes are synthesized in the F-cells, fibrillar cells, and accumulate in the B-cells, blister-like cells.\ntf43 | The products of digestion are absorbed and stored by the hepatopancreas. This tubular system has a single layer of epithelial cells that facilitate rapid trans-cellular nutrient transport to the haemolymph. Two of the cell types of the hepatopancreas, the R- resorptive cells and F-cells, are equipped with microvilli, indicating absorptive functions. Epithelial cells of the intestinal ceca, present in several shrimp species, also have well organized microvilli. The midgut intestine is capable of absorbing nutrients such as amino acids and glucose but this is relatively minor compared to the role played by the hepatopancreas.\nfcco | Significant sodium-dependent glucose and glutamate uptake and non-sodium-dependent alanine and lysine uptake has been demonstrated in crustacean hepatopancreas; transport rates are several orders of magnitude greater than those of the intestine.\n8uji | Experiments on penaeids have revealed that R- resorptive cells and B-cells of the hepatopancreas possess different types of glucose transport mechanisms with B cells showing a sodium-dependent sugar transport process and R cells showing a sodium-independent sugar carrier system. Simmons et al. found that, in the hepatopancreas of the White shrimp, Litopenaeus setiferus, sodium, potassium, and metallic cations such as zinc and manganese may stimulate the absorption of de-glucose, l-leucine and l-histidine by independent carrier-mediated transport processes. These mechanisms use the gradient of one solute's concentration to force the other molecule or ion against its gradient. Such mechanisms are known as cotransporters.\ndf3e | The activities of several membrane transporters in the hepatopancreas are pH-dependent. This has been demonstrated for the sodium-de-glucose cotransporter, the sodium-chloride-alanine cotransporter, the sodium-two chloride-leucine cotransporter and the sodium-chloride-glutamate cotransporter. The low pH in the hepatopancreatic lumen facilitates nutrient influx into the epithelial cells.\na5u1 | Undigested residues from the hepatopancreas are passed back to the midgut intestine and combine with material that was diverted away from the hepatopancreas opening. This material is compacted in the intestine where water and ions are removed and transported across the epithelium.\nry7u | The hepatopancreas also releases an insulin-like factor in lobsters and probably other decapod crustaceans. This factor increases glycogenesis in lobster muscle but is not released in response to a rise in glucose in the haemolymph nor does it reduce haemolymph glucose levels.\n5mda | In some decapods, such as the marine Carcinus maenas and Cancer pagurus, and the freshwater crab Paratelphusa hydrodomous, calcium and phosphate are accumulated by the hepatopancreas during the pre-moult period and stored as calcium phosphate granules.\ni4li | Two point three The hindgut\nr8sm | Digestion is completed in several hours and indigestible matter passes into the peritrophic membrane of the midgut. The fecal pellet is contained in this tube, which is grasped by the rectal pads and extruded at intervals in lengths equal to that of the midgut. Infolding of the basal membrane in the hindgut epithelial cells as well as folding of the entire epithelium allow for stretching of the hindgut lining under fecal loading.\ncuin | The cells lining the short hindgut appear to be specialized for cation transport, but their specific functional role in nutrition has yet to be defined. Since the hindgut is lined with cuticle, it is unlikely to absorb digestive materials. It may be involved in water transport, but again its role must be limited due to the cuticular lining. The rectum is probably also the means by which the external medium is pumped into the midgut but, again, the function of this rectal pumping has not been firmly established.\nn1i7 | Three. Digestive enzymes\n0r5m | The pH of digestive fluids is acidic about pH five which favours the activities of the various enzymes involved in digestion. The shrimp stomach, which is covered in a chitin layer, does not secrete acid or enzymes, although its contents often show digestive enzyme activities, some of which may derive from the hepatopancreas and some from food animals.",
