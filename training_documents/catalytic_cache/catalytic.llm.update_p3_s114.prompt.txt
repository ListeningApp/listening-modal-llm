You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

7fqw | 3.1 Formation of carbon spheres
rhaz | The brown powder synthesized through hydrothermal carbon- ization of glucose are spherical particles. It is worth noting that the formation of carbon spheres is influenced by hydrothermal temperature, reaction time and the concentration of glucose. SEM observations indicated that when the hydrothermal temperature decreased from 200 ℃ to 180 ℃, the diameter of carbon spheres showed a decreased trend (Fig. S1a-d+). More- over, the particle size distributions in Fig. S1a-di demonstrated that the particle sizes of <LATEX>G _ { 1 } - 2 0 0 - 1 0</LATEX> and <LATEX>G _ { 1 } - 1 8 0 - 1 0</LATEX> were 490 nm and 235 nm accounted for a large percentage. Lower hydro- thermal temperature would lead to the formation of smaller carbon spheres (Fig. S1e and ft). By adjusting the parameters of the synthesis process, we could obtain carbon spheres with the calculated average particle diameter of ~190 nm <LATEX>\left( G _ { 0 . 5 } - 1 8 0 - 1 0 \right.</LATEX> However, no solid product of carbon spheres were formed except brown solutions in the case of lower hydrothermal temperature (140 ℃) even with a longer reaction time of 20 h. The brown solution without the formation of carbon spheres suggested that aromatic compounds and oligosaccharides were formed in the "polymerization" step, while none of the nuclei was generated and to be continued growing.25,26 To investigate the graphitization transformation process better, carbon spheres with a diameter <LATEX>o f \sim 1 9 0</LATEX> nm were chosen as the precursor.
wak1 | 3.2 Graphitization process
wtfz | The fabrication procedures of graphitic samples of FC-1-8 and FC-1-8-HCl through K2FeO4 activation and catalyst graphitiza- tion were illustrated in Fig. 1. Cheap and commercially available glucose was chosen as the carbon source to synthesize amor- phous carbon spheres through hydrothermal carbonization. The as-obtained carbon spheres were then mixed with <LATEX>\mathrm { K } _ { 2 } \mathrm { F e O } _ { 4 }</LATEX> providing activation agent KOH and <LATEX>\mathrm { F e } \left( \mathrm { O H } \right) _ { 3 }</LATEX> as eqn (2).
qy1i | <LATEX>4 K _ { 2 } F e O _ { 4 } + 1 0 H _ { 2 } O = 8 K O H + 4 F e \left( O H \right) _ { 3 } + 3 O _ { 2 }</LATEX> (2)
1k9e | In this step, KOH would react with carbon spheres and develop pores on the surface of samples. The graphitization transformation is as follows: the Fe species are transformed to <LATEX>\mathrm { F e } _ { 3 } O _ { 4 }</LATEX> when annealed from 400 ℃ to <LATEX>6 0 0 ^ { \circ } C _ { * } ^ { 2 7 , 2 8 }</LATEX> In the case of 700 ℃, <LATEX>\mathrm { F e } _ { 3 } O _ { 4 }</LATEX> is converted to metallic Fe as a result of the reduction of amorphous carbon by <LATEX>H _ { 2 }</LATEX> or CO produced during the pyrolysis process and when the temperature is further increased to 800 ℃, graphitized carbon is formed under the catalysis of Fe.29 Apart from the existence of metallic Fe, a portion of Fe transforms into well-crystallized Fe3C. It was reported that the metallic Fe and pyrolytic carbon lead to the formation of Fe3C.30,31 Therefore, the results verified that the FC- 1-8 sample was consisted of Fe3C/Fe and graphitic carbon. As displayed in Fig. <LATEX>2 a ,</LATEX> the diffraction peaks locating at 37.6°, 42.9º, 43.7º and 45.9° correspond to Fe3C with the standard PDF card of JCPDS no. 35-0772. Two diffraction peaks are detected at 44.6º and 65.0°, which belong to the (110) and (200) planes of Fe (JCPDS no. 06-0696). Furthermore, carbon in the whole process was partly oxidized to CO/CO2 and carbonate and as a result, the porous structure was obtained.32 Obviously, graphitic carbon could be formed when annealed at the temperature of 800 °C.
5bjs | To investigate the function of <LATEX>K _ { 2 } F e O _ { 4 } ,</LATEX> carbon spheres annealed without the treatment of <LATEX>\mathrm { K } _ { 2 } \mathrm { F e O } _ { 4 } \left( \mathrm { F C } - 0 - 8 \right)</LATEX> were studied for comparison. From the XRD pattern in Fig. 2a, two relatively broad peaks were existed in the pattern of FC-0-8, implying that the dominant component of the above was amorphous carbon. Validated by the XRD pattern of FC-1-8-HCl, Fe3C/Fe composites were removed successfully. According to the nitrogen adsorp- tion-desorption isotherms plotted in Fig. 2b, FC-1-8-HCl showed IV-type adsorption-desorption isotherm with H4-type hysteresis loop, indicating the presence of mesopores. The SSA of the obtained FC-0-8 is <LATEX>4 7 9 . 8 m ^ { 2 } g ^ { - 1 } ,</LATEX> while the chemical activation treatment with K2FeO4 developed more pores making it increased to <LATEX>5 4 5 . 5 m ^ { 2 } g ^ { - 1 }</LATEX> for FC-1-8. FC-1-8-HCl showed the largest SSA up to <LATEX>2 8 1 3 . 6 m ^ { 2 } g ^ { - }</LATEX> 1, resulting from the pores caused by the removal of Fe3C/Fe NPs. The pore size distribution in Fig. 2c revealed that the pore diameter of these samples was ~3 nm, suggesting these samples were rich in mesopores.
