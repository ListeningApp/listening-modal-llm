You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

cop0 | Results
lhkq | Between 20th March 2018 and 20th March 2019, Aid Access provided mifepristone and misoprostol by mail to <LATEX>4 5 ^ { 8 } 4</LATEX> people. Among these, 3,186 provided follow-up information for a follow-up rate of 70% (Figure 1). Of those who provided follow-up information, 2797 (88%) confirmed use of the medications and provided infor- mation on the outcome of their abortion, while 389 (12%) confirmed non-use of the medications. Reasons for non-use included spontaneous pregnancy loss (45%), accessing abortion care in a clinic (21%), decid- ing to continue the pregnancy (19%), shipping delays (6%), having self-managed using another method (3%), the pregnancy being a false alarm (3%); and experienc- ing symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy, for which they reported receiving clinical treatment (0.5%). An addi- tional 3% did not specify a reason for not using the med- ications.
82ju | The demographic and clinical characteristics of those who provided follow-up information vs. those who did not are shown in Table 1. Among those who provided follow-up, 94.9% reported being under 7 weeks preg- nant at the time of requesting the service. The majority (63.1%) were aged under 30. Virtually all (99.4%) felt OK about their decision to have an abortion and none
y2qo | had any contraindications to abortion medications. A greater proportion of those who provided follow-up were aged 20 or over (89.1% vs. <LATEX>8 5 . 4 ,</LATEX> <LATEX>\left. p < 0 . 0 I \right) ,</LATEX> already had children (58.1% vs. 48.4%, <LATEX>\left. p < 0 . 0 0 I \right) ,</LATEX> and had not received an ultrasound scan prior to their abor- tion (90.4% vs. 87. 6%, <LATEX>\left. p = 0 . 0 0 5 \right) .</LATEX> There were no signif- icant differences in any characteristic, including gestation, that might reasonably bias the follow-up group towards more favorable outcomes.
1piq | Among those who confirmed use of the medications <LATEX>\left( n = 2 , 7 9 7 \right) ,</LATEX> 2402 (86%) reported being under 10 weeks pregnant, while 395 (14%) reported being 10 weeks pregnant or more. Overall, 99.0% of all those who used the medications reported having ended their pregnan- cies (Table 2), and 96.4% reported a successful medica- tion abortion (i.e., ending their pregnancies with no surgical intervention). There was no significant differ- ence by gestation in the proportion reporting ending their pregnancies (99.1% vs. 98.2%, p=0.097), but those who were less than 10 weeks pregnant had a lower rate of surgical intervention compared to those who were 10 weeks or more (2.0% vs. 6.1%, <LATEX>\left. p < 0 . 0 0 I \right) .</LATEX> Overall, among the <LATEX>7 2</LATEX> people who reported receiving a procedure to help end their pregnancy, 54 received D&C, 12 received aspiration, and 6 did not specify pro- cedure type. No ectopic pregnancies were reported among those who confirmed use of the medications.
7fqw | Potentially serious adverse events were not common (Table 3). Overall, 29 people (1.0%) reported experienc- ing any serious adverse event. Of these, 18 people (0.6%) reported receiving a blood transfusion and 15 (0.5%) reported receiving IV antibiotics (4 people reported receiving both). No deaths were reported by family, friends, clinicians, the authorities, or the media. Rates of adverse events overall were more common among those who reported a gestation of 10 weeks or more as compared with those who were less than 10 weeks (2.3% vs. 0.8%, p=0.009).
rhaz | Among the 2797 people who provided follow-up information, 2268 (81%) reported on the acceptability of their self-management experience (Table 4). Almost
wak1 | all (98.4%) felt satisfied with the service, and 95.5% felt it was the right choice for them. Most (98.1%) felt they had enough information on how to use the medi- cations, and 93.4% felt they had enough information
wtfz | on what to expect from the process. Fewer (81%) felt that they had enough support from family or friends, and 61.8% had difficulty affording the full requested donation.
qy1i | Discussion
1k9e | We used a data set containing all available outcomes of self-managed medication abortions provided through online telemedicine, outside the formal healthcare sys- tem, in the U.S. for one year. We found that abortions self-managed using this model were highly effective, with reported success rates comparing favorably with medication abortions carried out up to 10 weeks within the formal U.S. healthcare setting.19 The reported preva- lence of serious adverse events was very low, and the users of service reported high levels of satisfaction.
5bjs | Our results offer the first insight into the outcomes of self-managed medication abortions provided using online telemedicine in the U.S. The high effectiveness rates and low prevalence of serious adverse events we found mirror findings from other countries where med- ication self-management is used.20-22 We note that although most people in our study did not receive an ultrasound, they reported awareness of the duration of their pregnancy at the time of medication use. These findings are in line with prior evidence suggesting that last menstrual period is an accurate method for deter- mining gestation in early pregnancy23 and WHO guide- lines, which clearly specifies that ultrasound is not a necessary pre-requisite for medication abortion.14
uodj | Our findings also add to evidence on the safety and effectiveness of self-managed medication abortion beyond 10 weeks. While rates of surgical intervention were higher among the small proportion in our study who used the medications after 10 weeks compared to those at 10 weeks or under, almost all were able to end their pregnancies and the rate of successful medication
