You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

xek3 | stock of their development efforts, and continue their struggle for development as nothing has changed.67 Likewise, two months after the Nobel Committee awarded the Nobel Peace Prize to Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed (in beginning of December 2019), neither President Isaias Afwerki nor any of his spokespeople had publicly commented upon the award or congratulated their 'brother in peace'.
bbpr | The absence of any institutionalisation of the peace declaration is obviously an increasing concern. Without this, considering the history of outbreak of war in 1998,68 the unpredictability of the process is glaring. Currently, the 'peace' and 'reconciliation' content of the formal agreement are concepts held hostage by the political elites in both countries, without any border-population input or influence. Similarly, the resecuritisation of the border restricts its permeability and the possi- bility of advancing reconciliation and renegotiation of borderlands' identities.
5zyf | Consolidating peace and reconciliation bottom-up?
9own | Notwithstanding the hobbled formal top-level negotiation process and the set-back of closing the border, informal people-to-people reconciliation continues. Border populations are reconnecting as individuals and families, neighbouring commun- ities, and even as local government administrators, and security forces on both sides of the border. Eritreans in the borderlands cross back and forth every day, although in dwindling numbers, for petty trade, to buy necessities, to visit friends and family, or to participate in religious or social ceremonies.
bqfb | Paradoxically, the peace rapprochement led to a huge surge in Eritrean refugees into Ethiopia, a trend which continued after the border crossing was closed. The opening of the border in September 2019 radically increased the flight of Eritrean refugees, as they no longer fear being shot by the Eritrean border patrols.69 Numbers from the spring of 2019 given by local authorities in northern Ethiopia indicates that about 250 Eritreans cross every day and register as refugees.7º In addition, a sizeable group cross over and settle in Tigray or elsewhere in Ethiopia without registering as refuges. Elsa (name altered) is a representative of this cat- egory. I met her in the border town of Zalambessa, where she stood in the doorway of her small guesthouse and restaurant. 'All I want is to start a business and estab- lish a future, without interference by the government', she explained.71 Elsa left her mother and father behind in her hometown of Senafe after the border between Eritrea and Ethiopia opened for free crossing in mid-September 2018. Her small business in Zalambessa is capitalising on the renewed cross-border traffic, as the town experiences an economic up-turn as its peace dividend. When asked if she has
wwdt | 75
mn1r | been back to Senafe, she looked puzzled and claimed: 'Why? Whatever should I do in Senafe when the situation is as it is in Eritrea? I feel at home here in Zalambessa now'.72
5vqw | Local Tigrayan authorities in Zalambessa, as well as zonal authorities in Adigrat, confirmed that they communicate with their local government counterparts in Eritrea on issues of mutual concern. Likewise, both the front line force commander and security head in Zalambessa also stated that they talk regularly with their Eritrean counterparts, in order to 'administer' the fragile situation on the ground for the betterment of the border populations on both sides. It is doubtful, however, whether this localised cross-border communication between public entities is chan- nelled through their respective capitals; this is a pragmatic approach adopted by state representatives on the ground, for various reasons and motivations. For instance, in lieu of a formal bilateral agreement regulating cross-border employ- ment and business activities, in order to support themselves, the Tigray regional government has allowed all Eritreans to establish businesses without any licence and under temporary tax exemption.73 This situation has arisen because the TPLF believes it is best for Eritrea's future if as many Eritreans as possible stay in Tigray. This will enable a quick return after the situation changes in Asmara; they consider that the dire demographic haemorrhage of the Eritrean population will constitute the key challenge to rebuilding the country after a change of government.74
meyw | Machinations and reconciliation: concluding remarks on the politics of peace
2e62 | Complicating the consolidation of a sustainable people-to-people reconciliation process is the increasingly politicised and polarised context within Ethiopia, where the government party EPRDF is de facto split, rendering the federal government incapacitated and unable to implement policy in several regions, in particular Tigray.75 As it seems clear that the peace rapprochement was entered into by President Isaias Afwerki due to TPLF's loss of power in Addis Ababa, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has kept the TPLF in the dark regarding the formal bilateral process.76 But, it is not Addis Ababa which controls the main border to Eritrea, but Mekelle. The tripartite elite power struggle between Asmara-Addis Ababa-Mekelle over defining the inter-state border and conditions on the ground, have thus a direct impact on grassroots people-to-people reconciliation.
75y3 | This is made explicitly in relation to the return of the Eritrean territories of Badme and Irob. The local populations in these two areas have articulated fear and
s2g2 | 76
q1q2 | insecurity in relation to the peace process and the possibility of displacement if their home areas are given to Eritrea (or 'coerced' to become Eritrean).77 A particular concern is expressed by the Irob minority group, whose homeland is nestled up against the Eritrean border, a part of which is granted to Eritrea according to EEBC's ruling. The local Irob administrator Nigussie Hagos explains:
cb7r | The decision would pose a big threat to the survival of the Irob people. We are not against the peace deal. But peace should not come at the expense of losing sovereignty. We are 100 percent Ethiopians. If our peoples are divided between two countries, our very survival would be in question.78
68xu | Abba Tuum, Irob's Catholic parish priest, insisted that the only way to maintain peace in the Irob borderlands would be for any border-delineation process to include local elders from both sides of the border who would use customary mecha- nisms of reconciliation to settle the demarcation.79 In this way, the EEBC decision, anchored in international law, would be translated to the ground through custom- ary law, and would thus obtain local legitimacy and respect.
hd35 | The temporary reopening of the border in September 2018 proved that the deep- rooted relationships between the people straddling the border are intact, even after twenty years of separation. It is thus doubtful that the renewed separation will recreate new enemy images. As the border peoples understand that the political conflict over the last two decades is an elite driven one, they are increasingly aware that, so too, is the formal politics of peace. It seems plausible that sustainable recon- ciliation in the Eritrean-Ethiopian borderlands would need to rely on grassroots- anchored processes, rather than politically motivated and irresolute formal peace declarations.
