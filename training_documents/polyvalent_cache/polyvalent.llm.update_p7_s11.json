        "content": "xh3i | General Bacteria and Phage Protocols and Biopanning. Bacteria strains were stored in fifty percent glycerol solution at negative eighty degrees Celsius. Bacteria were sown on LB plates containing five micrograms per milliliter of tetracycline and inoculated into fresh LB at least one day before experiments.\nsyiw | Phages were suspended in PBS solutions and stored at four degrees Celsius. Titration was performed using the protocol described by Łos et al. Briefly, immediately before usage two hundred microliters of bacteria culture was suspended in warm agar and split onto bottom agar containing x-gal and IPTG. Then, two point five microliters of subsequent ten-fold dilutions of the phage sample were dripped onto the bacteria lawn. Prepared plates were incubated overnight at thirty-seven degrees Celsius. Phage titer was calculated by multiplying the number of single dots by the dilution factor and the constant coefficient for volume correction and depicted in plaque-forming units per milliliter (pfu per mL). Amplification and purification of phages were performed according to well-established protocols with slight modifications.\nkg3t | Plate panning was performed regarding the general concept presented by Barbas et al. with some modifications. Polystyrene plates were precoated with TnT and incubated overnight (eighteen to twenty-four hours) in one hundred microliters of twenty micrograms per milliliter TnT solution in PBS at four degrees Celsius. Then, the wells were emptied and filled with one hundred microliters of zero point one percent BSA solution (in PBS) and incubated for two hours in the fridge. Later, they were washed four times with PBST zero point one percent (in the first panning round) and zero point five percent in the next two. For the first panning round, one hundred microliters of one hundred times diluted Ph.D.- twelve Phage Display Peptide Library was used; however, it was tried immediately before use, showing an accurate phage concentration of eighty-four times ten to the power of eight. After one hour of incubation on the shaker at room temperature, wells were washed four times using zero point one percent (in the first round) or zero point five percent (in further rounds) PBST. After washing, one hundred microliters of elution buffer (zero point two M glycine-HCl, pH two point two) was added, and after ten minutes it was collected. Ten microliters was used to titrate the output phase, while ninety microliters was directly transferred into the bacteria culture for amplification. Lysates (products of amplification and purification of phages) were titered and used for subsequent pannings or single clone isolation. This isolation was performed via whole-plate titration\nlvae | described by Łos et al., although the bottom agar contains x-gal/IPTG instead of antibiotics. Single clones (only blue dots) were picked up and placed in a standard amplification mixture.\no9sc | Peptide Structure Prediction and Interaction Modeling. Three-dimensional structures of peptides exposed on the N-terminus of pIII protein were generated using PEP-FOLD three-a part of the online Mobyle system generously provided by Institute Pasteur and Paris Diderot University. Peptides were analyzed with thirty N-terminal amino acids of pIII after cleavage of the signal sequence (fragment: twelve GGGAETVESCLAKPHTENSFTNVWKDDKTL- DRY thirty-five, sixty-one) in order to maximize mimicking of the local environment of the peptide. Human cardiac TnT N-terminal fragment two to fifty (SDIEEVVEEYEEEEQEEAAVEEEEDWREDEDEQEEAAEEDAEAEAETEE forty-five) without cleavaged Met was generated in the same manner.\n121u | Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay. ELISAs were performed in ninety-six-well polystyrene plates (Thermo Scientific, USA). Wells were precoated with the desired protein sixteen to twenty hours incubation of the protein suspension in PBS at four degrees Celsius. assays, one to five thousand dilution of HRP-antiM13pVIII monoclonal antibody conjugate was used. Signals were recorded using Synergy HTX Multi-Mode Reader by BioTek.\nzh03 | In the initial screening, plates were precoated with troponin T or BSA (negative control) by incubating one hundred microliters of one microgram per milliliter appropriate protein solution. Then plates were blocked with zero point one percent BSA for two hours at four degrees Celsius and washed four times with zero point one percent PBST. Every isolated phage clone solution (phages concentration ten to the power of ten pfu per mL, one hundred microliters) was incubated with TnT and BSA for one hour at three hundred fifty RPM at room temperature. Then wells were washed four times using zero point one percent PBST, one hundred microliters of HRP-antibody conjugate was added, and plates were incubated as previously. After one hour, plates were washed as before, and fifty microliters of TMB was added. After five minutes, the reaction was stopped by adding fifty microliters of two M sulfuric acid. Absorbance at four hundred fifty nanometers was read using a Synergy HTX Multi-Mode Reader (BioTek) plate reader.\n1mvw | The application of k-ELISA for measuring phage concentration was performed by precoating wells using zero point two five microgram per milliliter TnT (or BSA in the negative control). The next steps regarding washing were performed in the same way as described above, despite zero point zero one percent myoglobin being applied for blocking phages concentrations (range: zero point two times ten to the power of nine, four times ten to the power of nine, six times ten to the power of five, eight times ten to the power of nine pfu per mL) and HRP-conjugated antibody solutions were added in amounts of fifty microliters. Myoglobin was chosen as a blocking agent due to its small size (approximately seventeen kDa), globular shape, and low price. BSA as a widely used blocking agent was avoided because it was present in all panning rounds, and peptides were suspected of exhibiting affinity to BSA. The signal was recorded by reading absorbance at three hundred seventy nm in a kinetic experiment every seventy seconds for ten minutes.",
