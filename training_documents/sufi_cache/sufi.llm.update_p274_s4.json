        "content": "ph9z | How the Sufi goes about this programme, what he says and does, what he does not say or do, will depend upon local conditions, as you can see in the traditional literature. 'Sufism', as has been said by one of the ancient Sheikhs, 'was formerly imparted by signs alone'. This requires a learner who can read signs. Similarly, with the introduction of literature, experiences of one kind and another can be imparted, illustrated - and so on - by literature, or partially through the written and spoken word, as well as through conduct. Benefiting from this will depend upon whether the student is in alignment with the material. He generally is not, being too greedy for 'truth' and 'progress' to develop the basic calm and relative humility towards the materials to do more than 'consume' them, as\nmuji | emotional stimuli; which he could have done with anything.\nglmb | Sheikh Ibrahim Gazur-Ilahi, among the Sufi directors, has emphasised that when the Teacher has finished his own journey, he repeats it again and again, each time with one learner. This is referred to as the analogy of the seed being in the plant, and the plant in the seed.\nsaqe | The 'conduct teaching' of the Sufis has to be adapted to the students, and cannot be a mechanical thing, applied to all people in exactly the same way.\ne6o9 | Q: But, since this information is so generally available, and is contained in the works of the great Sufi teachers, why do more people not seek it?\nwgep | A: This has always been a fact. It is answered today as always, by the observation:\n71hf | 'The wise know because they have paid for their wisdom. You do not accept their counsel because it is offered for so much less than they have paid for it'.\nefpl | Conduct-teaching has many other dimensions, after the stage of showing people to themselves. One might quote it as equivalent to the situation referred to by Blacken, when he said: 'A first-class laboratory is one in which mediocre scientists can produce outstanding work.' The conduct-situation enables people who have some potentiality to excel themselves. In this kind of situation, too, people are encouraged to learn in the manner in which they can do so, not in the manner which they try to impose on the subject. In the scientific parallel again, Mackay says: 'We shall have to learn to refrain from doing things merely because we know how to do them.'\n01ri | Conduct-teaching is often reported in real and devised anecdotes. Mulla Nasrudin stories often show this characteristic: reflecting both the conduct of the wise and that of the stupid, in addition to their other and more internal dimensions.\n1lfn | One such story, designed to be used as a paradigm in life situations, is this:\n3lvh | THE MAN-VINE\n6ub3 | Some men were planting vines, and Nasrudin asked them what they were doing.\nn712 | 'Digging these in so that they will produce fruit'\nlxns | That is exactly what I would like,' said the Mulla 'so please plant me and I will bear fruit.'\n4afc | After as many objections as they could think of, the men were prevailed upon to do as Nasrudin asked.\npx1t | Not long afterwards they saw him walking about. One of them said:\nehz9 | We told you that you can't grow fruit by being planted like that.'\nqrj5 | 'You haven't proved it yet', said Nasrudin, 'for I only uprooted myself for a bit because I was cold-not because I'm not going to produce fruit'\nmwd5 | The Curriculum of a School\ngng6 | Q: Could you give us a view of the curriculum of a School, from 'inside the School' so to speak?\nfjnz | A: In our teaching, we must group correctly these elements: the pupils, the teacher and the circumstances of study. Only at the right time and place, with the teacher suitable to these, and with the right body of students, can our studies be said to be capable of coherent development.\n15hc | Does this sound difficult or unreasonable? Let us compare these requirements with an analogy of our needs: the ordinary educational institution.\nmkzd | If we are learning, say, physics, we must have a man skilled in physics; students who want to learn and who have capacity and some background for the study; and adequate laboratories and other facilities for the studies to take place.\nuhjq | A physics teacher could not make any real progress with a class of idiots, or people who primarily wanted power or fame or gain through physics. These factors would be getting in the way of the teaching. A class of brilliant students, faced with a man who knew no physics, or who only had a smattering, would make little progress. A good teacher, with a suitable student body, could do little unless the instruments and equipment, the building and so on, were available as and when needed.\n6sbj | If anything is strictly demanded by the teachers of the perpetual Higher Teaching, it is these requirements.\nd8m4 | Yet this principle, so well established in conventional studies of all kinds, is largely passed over and has fallen into disuse, among esotericists. Why? Because they have a primitive and unenlightened attitude towards teaching. Like an oaf who has just heard of physics or only seen some of its manifestations, the would-be student wants it all now. He does not care about the necessary\nx6o5 | presence of other students. He wants to skip the curriculum and he sees no connection between the building and the subject of physics. So he does not want a laboratory.\niw9a | Just observe what happens when people try to carry on learning or teaching without the correct grouping of the three essentials:\ndni7 | Would-be students always try to operate their studies with only one, or at the most two, of the three factors. Teachers try to teach those who are unsuitable, because of the difficulties of finding enough people to form a class. Students who have no teacher try to teach themselves. Transpose this into a group of people trying to learn physics, and you will see some of their problems. Others group themselves around the literature and methodology of older schools, trying to make the scrap material of someone else's physics laboratory work. They formalise rituals, become obsessed by principles and slogans, assign disproportionate importance to the elements which are only tools, but which they regard as a more significant heritage.\nuhfc | Anyone can think of several schools, cults, religions, systems of psychology or philosophy which fall into the above classifications.\nx4b2 | We must categorically affirm that it is impossible to increase human knowledge in the higher field by these methods. The statistical possibility of useful gains within a reasonable time is so remote as to be excluded from one's calculations.\npbg2 | Why, then, do people persist in raking over the embers and looking for truth when they have so little chance of finding it? Simply because they are using their conditioning propensity, not their capacity for higher perception, to try to follow the path. There is intellectual stimulus and emotional attraction in the mere effort to plumb the unknown. When the ordinary human mind encounters evidences of a higher state of being, or even when it conceives the possibility of them, it will invariably conclude that there is some possibility of progress for that mind without the application of the factors of teaching-teacher-students-time-and-place which are essentials.\n0oy0 | Man has few alternatives in his search for truth. He may rely\nlr84 | upon his unaided intellect, and gamble that he is capable of perceiving truth or even the way to truth. This is a poor, but an attractive, gamble. Or he can gamble upon the claims of an individual or institution which claims to have such a way. This gamble, too, is a poor one. Aside from a very few, men in general lack a sufficiently developed perception to tell them:\n0vq1 | One. Not to trust their own unaided mentation;\ngkya | Two. Whom or what to trust.",
