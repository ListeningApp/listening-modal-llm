You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

yeoh | 2021). While pure quartz remained always strongly water-wet (brine contact angles <50°) for all conditions tested, aged quartz samples were weakly water-wet (brine contact angles 50-70°) for most scenarios examined (Iglauer et al., 2021). Al-Yaseri et al. (2021) and Al-Yaseri et al. (2022) reported contact angles for the clay brine and shale brine system based on empirical correlations as a function of pressure and temperature. All clays showed water wetting (0 < 40°) under all experimental conditions and were shown to be conducive to capillary and/or residual trapping of the gas (Al- Yaseri and Jha, 2021). The shale's H2 sealing capacity was shown to decrease with increasing depth and TOC values, but remained at strongly water-wet conditions with contact angles of not more than 17° at highest pressure and TOC (Al-Yaseri et al., 2022). The above measured and estimated data show that rocks are highly water-wet (contact angle < 50) in the presence of H2 at most storage conditions. However, based on the hydrogen wetting behavior of aged quartz and aged mica, Iglauer (2022) and Ali et al. (2022) demonstrated that 0 may increase to 90° or more at greater depth (3,700 m for quartz; Iglauer et al., 2021), which sets a limit to hydrogen storage capacity below which hydrogen will percolate trough the cap rock. In practice however, limitations on the depth are questions of economics and depths greater than 1,200 m are uncommon in underground gas storage facilities (Foh et al., 1979; Sedlacek, 1999b). The optimum storage depth for hydrogen can be computed based on the sealing capacity of the cap rock and the density of hydrogen gas that was estimated to be at 1,100 m depth assuming average geothermal and hydrostatic gradients (Iglauer, 2022). In line with CO2 storage, a minimum depth of 800 m is recommended in order to avoid spoiling potable water resources (Sedlacek, 1999b; Chadwick et al., 2008).
b8hf | 3.4 Cushion gas requirements
hntf | The capacity of any gas reservoir consists of two components: cushion gas (also known as base gas), which is used to maintain the minimum reservoir pressure and hence desired production levels, and working gas, which refers to the portion of gas that can be withdrawn and used during a storage cycle. In underground gas storage the composition of the working and cushion gas is generally the same. The total amount of cushion gas required depends mainly on the type of storage, with pore storages requiring higher cushion gas shares than salt caverns. However, no general recommendations can be made because the proportion of cushion gas in pore storage facilities depends on many reservoir parameters, such as storage volume, permeability and porosity, reservoir geometry, depth and the resulting pressure and temperature conditions. It also depends on technical configurations, such as well distributions, shut-in periods between injection and production, and the respective injection and production rates. In Germany, for example, the cushion gas share in natural gas pore storage facilities active and inactive ranges from 21 to 93% (Table 2).
99fo | Unfortunately, there are no direct experiences with pure hydrogen in pore storages we can draw on, but numerical reservoir simulations demonstrate that aquifers and depleted hydrocarbon fields can be operated with reasonable hydrogen recovery rates of 78-93% (Pfeiffer and Bauer, 2015; Feldmann et al., 2016; Sáinz-García et al., 2017; Heinemann et al., 2021b; Kanaani et al., 2022). Simulations of saline aquifers show that the injected cushion gas can efficiently displace

hvhm | formation water from injection and production wells, creating the conditions for subsequent hydrogen injection and withdrawal with significant improvements in UHS performance (Sáinz-García et al., 2017; Heinemann et al., 2021b; Kanaani et al., 2022). This also results in a lower demand for cushion gas in deeper structures and reservoirs with higher permeabilities (Heinemann et al., 2021b). Since hydrogen in particular involves considerable upfront costs, alternative cushion gas compositions such as nitrogen, CO2 or natural gas have been discussed in the literature to cut costs and/or CO2 emissions (Foh et al., 1979; Pfeiffer and Bauer, 2015; Feldmann, et al., 2016; Kanaani et al., 2022; Rhouma et al., 2022). Hence, the possibility of mixing with an inert cushion gas that is present in the reservoir must be considered (Foh et al., 1979). Gas mixing depends on viscosity and density contrasts (see Figures 1, 2), and is governed by diffusion and dispersion (Tek, 1989; Feldmann et al., 2016). A process that is particularly important to consider when converting depleted hydrocarbon fields with high gas saturation and low reservoir pressures (Feldmann et al., 2016). However numerical simulations of depleted gas reservoirs indicate that undesired physical phenomena such as viscous fingering caused by mobility and density contrasts are of minor importance in gas saturated reservoirs (Feldmann et al., 2016). Numerical simulations in saline reservoirs with hydrogen and nitrogen as working and cushion gas, respectively, demonstrate likewise the overall feasibility, but stress the importance of optimized injections schemes as the volume-weighted average hydrogen fraction of the produced gas increased from 52% during the first cycle to 85% in the fourth cycle (Pfeiffer and Bauer, 2015). In a most recent study of aquifer storage and withdrawal capacity, Kanaani et al. (2022) demonstrated likewise the operational feasibility and indicated that methane outperforms CO2 and nitrogen in terms of hydrogen recovery. The general feasibility has also been demonstrated in converted town gas storages across Europe (Foh et al., 1979; Foh, 1991). At Beynes, for example, natural gas was being injected on one side of the reservoir from 1972 while town gas had been withdrawn from the other side of the reservoir, replacing all of the working and 40% of the cushion gas with natural gas (Foh et al., 1979; Foh, 1991). Despite the fact that 60% of town gas resided in the reservoir, only minimal mixing of gases occurred during conversion, and less than 1% of the withdrawn gas consisted of the original town gas after conversion was completed in 1973 (Foh, 1991). It follows that detailed reservoir models are required to draw accurate conclusions about the demand and cushion gas requirements for any pore storage system, despite its general feasibility.
863b | 3.5 Hydrogen solubility and losses
fj24 | The solubility of hydrogen in brine water depends on a number of factors, including temperature, pressure, and salinity, but it is generally lower compared to other gases such as CO2 or CH4 (e.g., Zivar et al., 2021). Hence, less loss due to dissolution is expected compared to other gases. Experimental and modelled data suggest that hydrogen solubility increases with increasing pressure, but decreases with increasing salinity resulting in less than 0.001 of mole fraction of hydrogen at storage conditions (Wiebe and Gaddy, 1934; Li et al., 2018; Chabab et al., 2020). This is important, because dissolved hydrogen may diffuse and leak out of the reservoir resulting in hydrogen loss. The rate of diffusion will likewise depend on a number of factors, including the temperature and pressure. Diffusion rates of hydrogen in brine water can be estimated

For this application, it is also useful to compare these properties of hydrogen with those of methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) (Figures 1, 2). All thermophysical properties of H2, CH4, and CO2 presented here were obtained from the NIST chemistry web book database (Lemmon et al., 2023) and are intended to serve as a reference for upcoming UHS systems.
v3r2 | One of the most notable thermophysical characteristics of hydrogen is its low density, which dictates that it must be compressed or liquefied for any practical application (Osman et al., 2021). At standard temperature (0℃ or 273.15 K) and pressure (0.1 MPa or 1 bar), the density of hydrogen is 0.08871 kg/m3 according to the equation of state for normal hydrogen (Leachman et al., 2009). Due to the low critical temperature (-240.005℃ or 33.145 K) and low critical pressure

(2009) (hydrogen), Setzmann and Wagner (1991) (methane), and Span and Wagner (1996) (carbon dioxide). The areas marked by black rectangles indicate the ranges of density ratios and dynamic viscosity ratios expected at the proposed optimal reservoir depths (see text).
xags | (1.2964 MPa or 12.964 bar) of hydrogen (Leachman et al., 2009), it would be stored in the gaseous phase in porous storage systems (Züttel, 2004). Hydrogen is a highly compressible gas, and its density increases significantly with increasing pressure and barely with increasing temperature (Figure 1A). Consequently, hydrogen storage efficiency increases with increasing reservoir depth. But, because CH4 (Setzmann and Wagner, 1991) and CO2 (Span and Wagner, 1996) is much denser than hydrogen (Figures 2A, C), storing hydrogen gas of the same mass requires higher pressure (Tarkowski et al., 2021) and less hydrogen can be stored in the same reservoir volume compared to CH4 and CO2 (e.g., Lanz et al., 2001; Lankof and Tarkowski, 2020; Zivar et al., 2021; Epelle et al., 2022). This underlines the importance of storage capacity in hydrogen storage. In this context, depleted hydrocarbon storage facilities represent a more interesting storage option compared to salt caverns and aquifers due to their large storage space and high availability (e.g., Reitenbach et al., 2015). Moreover, the large density difference between H2 and dense formation water and cushion gas (e.g., CH4) can cause a strong gravity segregation effect (Ide et al., 2007; Jamshidnezhad et al., 2010; Rossen et al., 2010; Han et al., 2016; Rabinovich and Cheng, 2020), resulting in the accumulation of a hydrogen cap beneath the cap rock (Ruith and Meiburg, 2000; Heinemann et al., 2021c; Muhammed et al., 2022), which could ensure that H2 will remain in the reservoir (Iglauer, 2022). Conversely, Osman et al. (2021) emphasized that an H2 plume is susceptible to formidable buoyancy forces, with the magnitude of said

(2017) suggests that water may ascend towards the production well under these conditions, making seasonal storage of hydrogen in porous storage systems challenging.
