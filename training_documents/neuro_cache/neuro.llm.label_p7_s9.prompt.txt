You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

ffx8 | A crucial aspect of this logic is that the patterns of acti- vation arising from the two strategies must actually be different. It is not enough to show that, relative to a base- line, in one task areas X-Y are activated, whereas in another task areas P-Q are activated. 'Activation' is a continuous variable, and sub-threshold activation is common. Thus, even though activation in an area might be significant in one task (relative to baseline), and not in another, there might be no difference between the two when they are directly compared. Thus, one must compare the tasks directly, not simply rely on visual comparisons of what was and was not over the threshold under separate conditions.
s6su | 3. WHEN ARE SPECIFIC TYPES OF INFORMATION PROCESSING USED?
y219 | One virtue of beginning by asking questions about how information processing is implemented in the brain is that the answers can later be used as a basis for asking and answering other types of questions. We can distinguish two broad classes of questions that can be asked about when specific processing is used. First, one can ask simply whether a given process or structure was drawn upon
06ht | 1290 S. M. Kosslyn Questions for neuroimaging
v3r2 | while subjects engaged a particular ability. Second, 'when' need not be a constant: one can ask how practice, fatigue or some other state can alter when a particular process or structure is used. We explore both classes of questions below.
nv42 | (a) Inferring processes from brain activation
xags | Two distinct types of logic of inference can be used to infer that a particular process or structure is used when subjects perform a specific task.
jc47 | (i) Inferring processing from the presence of activation
ko3c | It is commonplace in the discussion sections of neuro- imaging studies to see post-hoc interpretations of proces- sing based on the set of areas found to be activated. In the ideal case, if one knows which processes or structures are implemented in a given part of the brain, one can argue subsequently that activation in that area while subjects perform a particular task is prima facie evidence that these processes or structures were drawn upon while subjects performed that task. To the extent that a particular process or structure has been identified with a particular neuroanatomical locus, this logic of inference is defen- sible. For example, the function of area Ml is understood well enough to allow us to infer that if it is activated, then motor processes were present as one performed the task (assuming that it can be shown that the activation is not an artefact of the baseline comparison).
xek3 | For example, it is known, largely from animal research (see, for example, Checetto & Saper 1990), that the ante- rior insula is the major cortical recipient of input from the autonomic nervous system. We therefore asked whether visual mental images of strongly aversive pictures could induce such feedback from the body; it is well- known that mental images can engage the autonomic nervous system (see, for example, Lang et al. 1980). Kosslyn et al. (1996a) asked subjects to visualize either very aversive pictures (e.g. of a baby with a large tumour over one eye, or a battered body) or neutral pictures (e.g. of a truck, a lamp), mostly drawn from Lang's set (Lang et al. 1988). PET scanning was conducted while subjects visualized each picture and determined whether a state- ment was an appropriate description of it; the statements were selected to require imagery to evaluate, and thus to encourage subjects to visualize the pictures (e.g. 'the baby has a tumour over his left eye'). When rCBF in the aversive condition was compared with that in the neutral condition, additional activation was documented bilater- ally in the anterior insula, as expected. (Other areas, such as Area 17, were also activated, but this is not to the present point.) This led us to infer that images of aversive objects can engage the bodily structures that in turn feed back to activate this area.
bbpr | We can discover whether the structures or processes implemented in a particular area have a functional role in conferring an ability by studying the effects of disrupting that area. In this case, patients who had damage to areas that have no essential role in the ability of interest would still retain the ability (assuming that they are alert enough to be engaged in the tasks used to assess the ability); similarly, TMS delivered to the area would not disrupt this ability. In contrast, if an area does indeed underlie a particular ability, the ability should be
5zyf | Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B (1999)
9own | impaired after both damage to the area and temporary disruption of the area induced by TMS (Pascual-Leone et al. 1997; Kosslyn et al. 1999). However, without such data, there is no way to know whether any given area implements a structure of process that contributes to the performance of the task of interest.
bqfb | In addition, a problem with the logic of inferring proces- sing from activation is that a given part of the brain can implement more than one process. This could conceivably be true even for highly constrained sensory and motor cortices; we simply do not know enough to exclude the possibility of multiple roles for any piece of cortical real estate. Thus, the activation of a given brain area does not necessarily implicate specific processes that were previously found to activate it; some other process could in fact be at work. The finding of activation in a particular brain area during a particular task can therefore only be taken as either (i) the basis for the hypothesis that a specific process or structure is at work (to be tested, in part, by observing the effects of disrupting the area), or (ii) one piece of converging evidence for such an inference.
wwdt | (ii) Using variations in activation to predict performance
mn1r | A completely different logic of inference can be used to discover whether a specific process or structure contributes to how well one can make use of a specific ability. First, however, it is important to be clear on what question is being asked here. We are no longer asking whether a process or structure (implemented in an area) confers an ability. Instead, we are asking whether variations in the efficacy of a structure or process are related to variations in the performance of the relevant tasks. That is, we can divide processes and structures into two general types. The first type of processes or structures are not taxed by the task, to the extent that, if they func- tion at all, they function well enough to allow one to perform a class of tasks. The second type are the 'rate- limiting steps'. They are taxed when one draws on a particular ability; the more effectively they function, the better one will perform the relevant tasks. By analogy, keys on a keyboard are designed so that minimal strength is required to press them down; therefore, finger strength in excess of this amount is irrelevant (and hence finger strength would be analogous to the first type of process). However, the ease of typing a sequence of letters depends on their arrangement, and setting up motor commands to execute some sequences is difficult; thus, better ability to programme complex motor movements will lead to better performance on this task (this is a rate-limiting step).
5vqw | For example, in the task of Kosslyn et al. (1996b), subjects were asked to visualize, with eyes closed, capital letters. After 4s they heard a probe (such as 'straight side') and were to decide, as quickly and accurately as possible, whether the visualized letter had that property. Both response times and accuracy rates were recorded as the subjects performed the task while being PET-scanned. After both behavioural and rCBF data had been collected from 16 subjects, the rCBF values in each brain were normalized to the same mean. For each brain, we then measured deviations from the mean for each region of interest (ROI) found previously to be activated during visual imagery (as summarized in §2). These areas were previously interpreted as implementing the functions
meyw | outlined in figure 1. We next performed stepwise multiple regression analyses, using either response times or error rates as the dependent measure and ROI values as the independent measures. The error rates were very low and varied only slightly between subjects, so no significant correlations emerged, but the response times were of great interest. The rCBF values of three areas were entered into this equation, each accounting for significant amounts of variance in the response times. The first area was Area 17, which by itself was correlated at r =- 0.65 with response times. The other two areas were Area 19 (which we take to implement part of associative memory) and the posterior parietal lobe (which we take to be part of the spatial-properties-encoding system). The multiple R value was 0.93, which is remarkably high given how different measures of rCBF are from response times.
2e62 | Thus, the fact that variations in rCBF in those three areas contributed to variations in performance is evidence that those areas have a role in performing the task. (For comparable results regarding the role of the amygdala in encoding emotional memories see Cahill et al. (1996), and for comparable results regarding the role of the hippo- campus and related structures in episodic memory see Nyberg et al. (1996).)
75y3 | One unexpected finding in Kosslyn et al. (1996b) was that the correlation between parietal rCBF and response time was positive: the more blood flow there was, the more time was needed to respond; in contrast, the other two correlations were negative (the more blood flow, the less time needed to respond). This finding might suggest that people who performed the task relatively poorly might be using a different, less effective, strategy than those who performed it relatively well. Those who performed well seemed to rely on Area 17, which supports visual images of shapes, whereas those who performed poorly had relatively little rCBF in this area. Instead of relying on visual images, the subjects who performed poorly might have relied on spatial representations that are used to guide drawing the segments, and these repre- sentations were accessed via processes implemented in the parietal lobes.
s2g2 | A major virtue of this approach is that no subtractions or comparisons between tasks are necessary. One can design tasks so that there is a single 'rate-limiting' step, and simply correlate responses with rCBF values. However, one must have some prior reason for looking at particular ROIs. In addition, this approach will not allow one to identify all the structures and processes involved in performing a task. Furthermore, as our results should make apparent, it is not entirely clear how to interpret the direction of the correlation between rCBF and a measure of performance. Moreover, if people differ widely in their skill levels, the correlations might be even more difficult to interpret: low values of rCBF for some people might indicate that the process is not performed well, but low values for other people might indicate that they are so expert that only minimal processing is required. Again, results from this method must be viewed as only one more source of converging evidence.

cb7r | We have been considering questions to address when a particular process or structure is used. However, 'when'
68xu | Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B (1999)
hd35 | Questions for neuroimaging S. M. Kosslyn 1291
2zpk | need not be a constant, but can change depending on a variety of factors. Three such factors in particular seem worth consideration.
epu7 | (i) How does processing change with practice?
7od1 | Results from several laboratories have shown that prac- tice does not simply lower rCBF values in areas used when one is performing a given type of task. Rather, entirely new areas can begin to function as one becomes better at performing a task, and areas activated initially can decrease activity below the threshold of detection. For example, we recently performed a simple study (M. T. Menard, W. L. Thompson, P. I. Bentley, L. L. LeSueur, N. M. Alpert, S. M. Kosslyn and A. M. Galaburda, unpublished data) in which subjects were asked to read words aloud. They did this four times, with the particular words being used in each condition being counter- balanced over subjects. As expected, many areas are activated when one reads for the first time compared with the fourth time, but the reverse was also true: additional areas became activated by the fourth blocks of trials that were not activated initially (for comparable results, see Petersen et al. (1998) and Raichle et al. (1994)).
0bqy | In addition to investigating how processing changes with practice, one can ask how this change varies for different populations. For example, the reading-aloud study (M. T. Menard, W. L. Thompson, P. I. Bentley, L. L. LeSueur, N. M. Alpert, S. M. Kosslyn and A. M. Galaburda, unpublished data) compared practice in reading in normal populations and in dyslexics (who were age- and education-matched to the normal control subjects). We found again that some areas activated initially dropped out with practice and that different areas became evident. However, the particular areas were strikingly different from those noted in the controls, in both cases: initially and after practice.
b780 | Findings such as these are interesting only if they can be interpreted. The interpretation relies on answering questions of the sort that we considered in the first major section of this article. However, this need not be a one- way street. Observations about changes of the sort noted here can lead to hypotheses about what process or structure is implemented in specific areas, and these hypotheses can in turn be examined in ways described above. This 'golden feedback loop' seems more likely to occur if one comes armed with a set of questions from the outset, based on a theory, than if one simply performs neuroimaging while subjects perform a task and then interprets the results post hoc.
ccmb | (ii) How does processing change with context?
ma93 | We also can ask how processing changes in different contexts. Let us return to the Kosslyn et al. (1998) study of mental rotation, summarized above. In that paper, we collapsed over counterbalancing orders for the two types of stimuli, Shepard & Metzler (1971) shapes and drawings of hands. We later realized that there were ample subjects in each group (those receiving hands stimuli first and those receiving Shepard & Metzler stimuli first) for an analysis of each group separately. The most interesting finding here concerned the areas activated while subjects performed the Shepard & Metzler task. When the Shepard & Metzler task was the first one that the subjects

y7ea | received, we found that the inferior parietal and dorso- lateral prefrontal cortex were activated, as well as the right angular gyrus. However, when the subjects received this same task just after having performed the hands task, we found strikingly different results. Not only were over ten areas activated, but many of these areas had previously been found to be involved in motor control. Perhaps most strikingly, we found activation in the primary motor cortex itself, area Ml. When we looked only at the data for the Shepard & Metzler task performed after the hands task, the data were in many ways similar to those for the hands rotation task itself.
