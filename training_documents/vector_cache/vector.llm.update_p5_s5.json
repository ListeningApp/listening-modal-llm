        "content": "mn1r | Transducing substantia nigra dopamine neurons with genes related to human Parkinson's disease has been explored to provide valuable animal models of the disease. AAV carrying cDNA of human WT alpha-syn injected to the substantia nigra induces slowly progressing neurodegeneration and the presence of alpha-syn inclusions. These models have been used in mice and rats. A study using both human WT or mutant A53T alpha-syn carried in recombinant AAV-CBA (chicken beta-actin) injected into the substantia nigra of rats showed a loss of striatal TH fibre density and dopamine and degeneration of TH-positive cells in the substantia nigra. Furthermore, in animals with a significant loss of TH in the nigral area, severe behavioural deficits developed at twenty-four to twenty-seven weeks post-injection, as compared with GFP controls. Studies using WT human alpha-syn with AAV-6, AAV-5, and AAV-9 injected to the nigra have shown TH loss in the nigrostriatal system and motor deficits. In addition, recombinant AAV human WT alpha-syn injection to rats has resulted in the phosphorylation of endogenous alpha-syn in the substantia nigra area. However, the authors observed that alpha-syn phosphorylated at serine one hundred twenty-nine is not necessary for pathology in the dopamine system and deficits in motor behaviour and therefore, WT human alpha-syn is enough to cause dysfunction. For the mutant forms, AAV-5-S-129-D and S-129-A, AAV-2-A-53-T, and AAV-6-A-30-P have been tested in rats and compared to the WT form. A large study compared the model in mice, rats, and monkeys, wherein AAV-9 human mutant A53T alpha-syn was injected into the substantia nigra, and found that there was degeneration in the nigrostriatal areas in all species and motor deficits in rats, but interestingly aging did not exacerbate the loss or symptoms. A long-term study was performed with a variety of pathology and behavioural measures, in which the authors used AAV-7 carrying human WT or mutant (A53T) alpha-syn and injected it into the substantia nigra. The results showed that this mutant form was able to induce behavioural deficits on rotarod and cylinder tests, induce dopamine cell death in the substantia nigra, decrease dopamine release in the striatum, and also form insoluble aggregates. A recent study in rats using human WT alpha-syn with four and eight week time points did not show TH loss in the striatum at four weeks, but did show a mild loss of TH-positive neurons in the substantia nigra and decreased dopamine content at eight weeks after vector injections. While most of these studies do show some loss of TH and robust alpha-syn expression, which are important in modelling the disease, in some cases, AAV carrying GFP or other control results were not shown as a comparison. Additionally, many of these studies use enhancers for the transgene expression levels. It should also be noted that it is a mutant form of human alpha-syn in certain studies, not the WT, which demonstrates TH loss and motor deficits in the animals. In Table one we have summarized these studies, in which a GFP control was most often used as a comparison to the AAV-alpha-syn.\n5vqw | Laboratory Animal\nmeyw | In general, though some of the previous studies were able to recapitulate the disease, there is still large variability between and within studies, including our own findings. Additionally, without a control for a comparison of dopamine neuron loss in the substantia nigra, it is difficult to conclude that it is specifically the alpha-syn overexpression causing the damage. By optimizing the volumes, particle number and injection needle parameters to be similar as described, there is no reason why the number of successfully lesioned rats with AAV-alpha-syn could not be increased. However, proper controls need to be used for comparison and it is clear that caution should be applied when setting up the model.\n2e62 | Five.
