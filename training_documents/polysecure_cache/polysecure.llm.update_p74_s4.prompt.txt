You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).

Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021.

ij2y | Nonmonogamy can be a pressure cooker for growth. It is commonly and play- fully known in the nonmonogamous world that you shouldn't enter CNM unless you are ready to process, communicate, grow and then process, communicate and grow some more. This is because having multiple partners will expose all of your relationship baggage, your blind spots, shadows and shortcomings, and all the potential ways you've been asleep to social issues. Because of this, I've seen how nonmonogamy can actually become an accelerated path to growth, specifically when it comes to attachment, where it offers a path to healing that many people would not experience otherwise. When people are able to heal their previous at- tachment wounds, address any attachment changes that have occurred since open- ing up and create relationships that are founded on relational security instead of structural security, what previously felt impossible about CNM becomes possible, even celebratory.
w7j4 | Part Three
q8xw | In this next section we switch to a "how-to" approach to becoming more poly- secure. My hope is that almost anyone reading this, monogamous or nonmonog- amous, can walk away with concrete ways to further cultivate secure functioning in their relationships. I do the pre-filtering and translating for you so that you don't have to sift, sort through or try to tease apart the monogamous filter that is often applied to attachment literature. Even though attachment exists over the multiple levels of the human experience, this next section focuses on the levels of self and relationship. This is meant to offer you guidance and suggestions, but it is not a substitute for professional support that may be needed for yourself or with your partners.
1m55 | CHAPTER SEVEN THE FOUNDATIONS OF BEING POLYSECURE IN YOUR RELATIONSHIPS
2zaa | UP UNTIL THIS POINT I have predominantly used the umbrella term nonmonogamy when talking about people with multiple partners, but as we saw in Chapter Four, people who are nonmonogamous can be quite varied in the ways they practice hav- ing multiple partners. As we move further in the discussion of how to be poly- secure, I talk specifically about people who are practicing polyamory. Polyamory is commonly defined as being the practice of having romantic love-based relation- ships with more than one person, and we can add that it is also the form of non- monogamy where people have multiple romantic attachment figures. As previously mentioned, not all CNM relationships need to be attachment-based. We can have very fulfilling, meaningful, loving and significant relationships with people who we are either less entwined with, don't want to label or define or who we are not look- ing to actively build an attachment-based relationship with. Ideally, any type of rela- tionship, regardless of how involved or not, is ethical, respectful, has open com- munication and is considerate of everyone involved. But when we are in attach- ment-based relationships more is required, so the rest of this book will center on people who are (or want to be) in polyamorous attachment-based partnerships.
4iwf | DO WE WANT TO BE ATTACHMENT-BASED PARTNERS?
grmv | The antecedent to being polysecure with your partners is first getting clear about whether you want to be attachment figures for each other. Our attachment-based relationships take time and investment, and so when referring to attachment-based partners I am referring to a choice that we are making to intentionally cultivate and tend to the attachment-based needs within a particular relationship. Often, falling in love with someone or feeling attached to them does not feel like a choice we make, hence why we call it falling in love instead of stepping into love. Our attach- ment figures might be the people we feel levels of connection, compatibility or intensity with right from the start for reasons that we just can't explain, or they may
mrk0 | be the people with whom our romantic attachments have organically grown in po- tency and depth over time. However you come to be with the partners that you al- ready feel attached to or want to cultivate being more polysecure with, what is important is that at some point you are all clear that being attachment-based part- ners is what you want for the relationship.
bash | In monogamy, usually at some point people have the commitment conver- sation in hopes of better defining their relationship, but exactly what that means to each person and all of the assumptions and expectations that each person is car- rying are often left minimally discussed, if they are articulated at all. In non- monogamy, unspoken expectations and assumptions typically don't bode very well, and intentional discussions about exactly what we're doing and why we are to- gether are important for everyone involved to feel safe and secure. Since we are talking about attachment-based polyamorous relationships, we are talking about relationships in which you are committed to showing up for each other regularly, prioritizing each other (from choice, not obligation), actively cherishing each other, doing the work required to build a relationship and possibly even building a life to- gether (though having a life commitment is not a prerequisite for secure attach- ment). Your attachment-based relationships might be with the partners that you refer to as your primary partners, inner circle partners, nesting partners or anchor partners. You may or may not live with them or have children with them, and you definitely do not need to do either of those things to be polysecure. People who are solo poly and relationship anarchists can be in securely attached relationships. People who are married and live with their spouse can also have secure attach- ment- based relationships with their non-nesting partners when vetoes and pre- scriptive hierarchy are not at play. What matters here is that you have a shared vi- sion about the depth, breadth and level of involvement that you all want together, and that everyone is able to follow through with what you've agreed to.
xseo | For us to feel safe and secure in our relationships, we need to know that our partners want to be there for us and will be to the best of their ability, and so some level of commitment to being in a relationship together is important. Depending
3oxf | on what stage of relationship you are in, this might look like:
gvhw | . A commitment to staying in exploration of the relationship together, without specifically defining the future or integrating your lives.
4ta1 | . A commitment to building an official relationship that you want to have longevity and/or be more interwoven in.
jokf | . Commitment to building a life together where you are in it for the long haul.
x0bn | Commitment can be expressed in many ways. Traditionally it is solidified through marriage, owning property, having kids or wearing certain types of jewelry, but legal, domestic or ornamental undertakings are not the only ways to show dedi- cation. In a 2018 talk on solo polyamory at the Boulder Non-Monogamy Talk Se- ries, Kim Keane offered the following ways that people practicing nonmonogamy can demonstrate commitment to their partners:
049a | . Sharing intimate details (hopes, dreams, fears) and being vulnerable with each other.
ebc8 | . Introducing partners to people who are important to you.
idjw | · Helping your partners with moving, packing, homework, job hunting, shop- ping, etc.
6561 | . Having regular time together, both mundane and novel.
2hrf | . Making the person a priority. (I suggest defining what "being a priority" means to each of you.)
mpyx | · Planning trips together.
qlzy | . Being available to partners when they are sick or in need.
sa6v | · Collaborating on projects together.
gneb | · Having frequent communication.
1oqy | · Offering physical, logistical or emotional support (e.g. at doctor's appoint- ments or hospital visits or by helping with your partners' family, pets, car, children, taxes, etc.).
opno | Commitment Reflection Questions
0ahx | In each of your relationships that are already attachment-based, or for the
x5cc | relationships that you would like to become more attachment-based, discuss the following questions with your partners:
c7cg | . What does commitment mean to you?
fiyl | . What aspects of commitment are most important to you (e.g., structural, emotional or public)?
yz7j | . Why do we want to be attachment figures for each other?
