You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

rl4j | To study in detail why ADASTRA failed to capture ASBs found in other studies, we used the set of ASB SNPs identified by one of the most advanced methods for ASB calling, BaalChIP19. ASB event could be missed at the SNP calling stage, could fail to pass the read coverage thresholds, or fail to pass the significance threshold for FDR-corrected P value estimated against BAD. To assess the contribution of different stages of our pipeline to ASB calling sensitivity, we performed a stage-by-stage analysis of the underlying SNP set (see Fig. 3d). It turned out that the fraction of BaalChIP ASB SNPs recovered by ADASTRA was different for different cell types, with most of ASBs recovered for the cell types with the deepest sequencing coverage.
vz32 | On the one hand, the basic coverage filters significantly reduced the number of SNPs under consideration resulting in a major loss in the fraction of recovered ASBs. On the other hand, we did not observe critical effects from any of the subsequent stages. For all cell types, the number of BaalChIP ASB SNPs recovered by ADASTRA decreased monotonously, suggesting that there was no particular bottleneck defining the sensitivity of the whole pipeline except the basic coverage filters. As more sites were recovered for cell types with better coverage, one can predict that the difference between different ASB calling pipelines would decrease as soon as more ChIP-Seq data would become available for analysis.
ncb0 | In general, there is an overlap between ADASTRA ASBs and the existing data on regulatory SNPs, including sites of allele- specific DNA accessibility16 and reporter assay quantitative trait loci6 (Supplementary Fig. 5), but the vast majority of ADASTRA data are novel.
8mp0 | Given the diversity of assessed TFs, it became possible to systematically compare SNVs carrying TF ASBs and identify the pairs of TFs preferring to share ASBs (Supplementary Fig. 6). Indeed, hundreds of TF pairs are significantly enriched for common ASBs (one-tailed Fisher's exact test P value from 0.05 to 10-300 upon correction for multiple tested TF pairs with the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure). As a rule, shared ASBs were not related to interacting TFs (considering protein-protein interactions from STRING-db31). However, there was a systema- tic overlap between ASBs for chromatin-interacting epigenetic factors and related proteins, suggesting many of shared events are "passengers" in regions of allele-specific chromatin accessibility with TFs bound only to the accessible chromosome. Still, some interacting proteins (such as CTCF-RAD21) strongly prefer to share ASBs, and the same holds for particular composite elements of binding sites such as AR-FOXA132.
xjyk | Motif annotation is concordant with ASB calls. For TFs spe- cifically interacting with DNA, it is possible to perform compu- tational annotation of ASBs with TF-recognized sequence motifs33. When a strong binding site overlaps an ASB SNP and the alternating alleles directly change the key nucleotides in the TF-binding DNA sequence, this SNP likely relates to different TF-binding affinity to the sites at homologous chromosomes, which directly produce the ChIP-Seq allelic imbalance. We call such events "driver" ASBs to distinguish them from side effects of piggyback TF binding and chromosome-specific local chromatin accessibility, the examples of "passenger" ASBs. Motif annotation highlights the driver ASBs and allows comparing the observed ASB effect (the allelic imbalance) and the effect predicted by sequence analysis (the difference in binding specificity reflected in the motif prediction scores), providing an independent evaluation of the reliability of ASB calls.
mt0f | An ASB was considered as overlapping the TF motif occurrence if the TF position weight matrix (PWM) scored a hit with P≤ 0.0005 for any of the two alleles. The log ratio of P values corresponding to PWM hits at alternative alleles was used as an approximation of the TF affinity fold change (FC). Fig. 4a compares the ASB significance (X-axis, signed log10 FDR; the sign set positive for Alt-ASBs and negative for Ref-ASBs) with the log ratio of motif hits P values (Y-axis) for 218 TFs having at least 1 ASB within a motif hit. Predominantly, at heterozygous sites, alleles with more specific motif hits are covered with more ChIP- Seq reads, revealing the prevalence of motif-concordant ASB events (blue dots in Fig. 4a). Such concordance persists for more than 80% of SNVs with ASB allelic imbalance FDR < 5%, growing with decreasing ASB FDR and saturating at about 90% of SNVs (Fig. 4b). At 5% FDR, good motif concordance stands for many TFs, as illustrated by the top 10 TFs with the highest number of motif hits at ASBs (Fig. 4c). Importantly, even at larger FDR, there are more concordant than discordant ASBs.
awab | Yet, for ~10-20% of SNVs, the motif hit odds ratios are discordant with the allelic imbalance (corrected for BAD), that is, more reads are attracted to the weaker motif hit (red dots in Fig. 4a and red bars in Fig. 4c). We believe that in such cases the allelic imbalance arises from other contributors (allele-specific chromatin accessibility or indirect TF binding), which override the sequence-specific TF affinity. Also, we use the motif prediction scores as a proxy of the TF-binding affinity and it is possible that the observed limited discordance partly reflects the imperfectness of the utilized motif models.
ixcc | To quantify ASB allelic imbalance for BAD other than one, we defined the ASB effect size (ES) as follows (see "Methods" for details). For individual SNV (SNV in a single data set):
8p6h | ESRef = log2 (CRef / E (CRef ICAIt)) and ES Alt = 10g2 (CAlt/E(CAIt |CRef))
pmgl | Here CRef and CAlt are the read counts at the Ref and Alt alleles, and E is the expectation. For BAD = 1: ESRef = log2(CRef/CAIt).
90no | The aggregated ES of an ASB is calculated as a weighted mean of ES values for the same allele for SNVs aggregated at the same genome position over TFs or cell types, with weights equal to negative logarithms of individual P values, separately for each of the alleles.
