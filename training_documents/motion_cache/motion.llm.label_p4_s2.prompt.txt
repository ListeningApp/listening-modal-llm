You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

06yq | Microdosing with psychedelics to self-medicate for ADHD symptoms in adults: A naturalistic study

2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

ko3c | Fig. 2 Target and chaser spacecraft in the three-body system.
xek3 | where h = rx [i]M is the target-specific angular momentum with respect to the Moon, and h = |h||. The unit vectors î, j, and k in the rendezvous literature are generally referred to as V-bar, H-bar, and R-bar, respectively [3]. Note that the LVLH frame is defined with respect to the Moon, because the target is supposed to fly on lunar orbits, and vehicles incoming from the Moon surface or lower and higher orbits are expected to approach the target (as, for instance, is envisaged in the HLEPP [10]).
bbpr | With reference to Fig. 2, the chaser position with respect to the Moon is given by:
5zyf | (11)
9own | re=r+p
bqfb | where p is the relative position of the chaser with respect to the target. The time derivative of Eq. (11) in the inertial frame is:
wwdt | (12)
mn1r | where @yi is the angular velocity of L (i.e., of the target) with respect to I. Further derivation of Eq. (12) in I yields:
5vqw | (13)
meyw | Noting that [@yilz = [@yile, and introducing Eqs. (9) and (10) in Eq. (13), we obtain the nonlinear equations of relative motion (NERM) in the LVLH frame:
2e62 | - + (1 - µ) ||r + rem r + rem 3 ||r +p+rem r +p +rem
75y3 | μ lr + p 11 3 r +p r
s2g2 | (14)
q1q2 | The angular velocity of the LVLH frame with respect to the inertial frame can be computed by composition of angular velocity vectors:
cb7r | (15)
68xu | @l/i =@l/m +@m/i
hd35 | where @ym and @m/i are the angular velocities of £ with respect to M, and of M with respect to I, respectively.
2zpk | The LVLH angular acceleration with respect to I is given by: [@yile =[@y/ml] + [@mfile = [@ym] + [@m/ilM -@l/m X @m/i
epu7 | (16)
7od1 | 1325
0bqy | Equation (14), along with Eqs. (15) and (16), composes a set of nonlinear equations with time-varying parameters:
b780 | 1) r, @l/m, and [@]/m]c, which depend on the target motion around the Moon
ccmb | 2) Tem, @m/i, and [@ m/i], characteristics of the Earth-Moon system orbital motion
ma93 | Equation (14) exactly describes the relative motion in the LVLH frame in the restricted three-body problem, providing that no orbital perturbations act on the spacecraft (e.g., solar radiation pressure). The consideration of the restricted three-body problem provides the option to model the primary bodies in either an elliptic or circular orbit around each other, depending on the three-body system considered.
c6hh | In the following, the expressions of @l/m and [@1/m][ are derived, in order to complete the nonlinear description of the relative dynamics in the LVLH frame.
y7ea | B. LVLH Angular Velocity and Acceleration
nav4 | We now look for an analytical expression of the LVLH frame angular velocity and acceleration vectors with respect to the Moon frame, which exploits only kinematics relationships. To this end, the same considerations adopted in [21] are here used to find an expression for @ym. The angular acceleration [@ym]e is then obtained by differentiation.
gem8 | Consider the time derivatives of the LVLH frame unit vectors as seen in M:
e8nr | M ; LÂM = @1/m x 1, [k]M=@ym XẾ
k78w | Left vector multiplication of the previous expressions by the relative unit vector gives:
g9du | ›[ÎM={x(@|m × }) = @|m - (@)|m · })}
f682 | which can be summed up obtaining:
li1k | (17)
pbea | The time derivative of the unit vector k is:
ccpt | (18)
0fpw | Noting that r = - rk and [i]e = - rk, we can write:
dqn8 | r =- [r]·k =- ₼·k+(@|mxr)·k =- [^\·Î+@|m·(rxÎ) =- [r]M.k (19)
cop0 | Substitution of Eq. (19) into Eq. (18) gives:
lhkq | [ÂM = - (M ) + (2)M ) = - (MD)
82ju | (20)
y2qo | Note that [i]M . j = 0 since the target velocity as seen in M is perpendicular to h, by definition of the specific angular momentum. For the unit vector j we have the following time derivative:
1piq | LIM = - 1(h) M - hh)
7fqw | (21)
rhaz | According to the definition of j, we have that h = - hj. Hence, Eq. (21) simplifies as follows:
