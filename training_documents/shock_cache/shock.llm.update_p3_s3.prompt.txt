You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

htm9 | Impact on Hemodynamic Parameters and Cardiac Performance
8hul | Conventional descriptions of the agonist-receptor- effector interactions promulgated in traditional phar- macology teaching is primarily based on small studies from the 1950s to 1960s, using variable drug doses and indirect surrogate measurements of in-vivo recep- tor activity and downstream effects.25-27 In these early mechanistic studies, the observed physiologic effects of catecholamine administration (in healthy subjects) on blood pressure, total peripheral resistance, and heart rate were used to extrapolate specific agonist- receptor-effector biology. However, it is becoming

ym66 | increasingly evident that there is a far more dynamic and nuanced receptor-agonist interplay than previ- ously appreciated.28
l0a3 | This complex interaction has been assessed in pharmacodynamic studies in a sheep model where comparable doses of catecholamines (epinephrine, norepinphrine, and dopamine) were administered, and their doses titrated. Of note, all 3 drugs signifi- cantly and equally increased cardiac output, MAP, and right atrial pressure in a dose-dependent fash- ion.29 Similar observations have been made in clinical studies of CS, with the inotrope epinephrine being compared with the vasopressor noradrenaline and producing similar hemodynamic effects.30,31 These findings suggest that the arbitrary vasopressor and inotrope definitions for catecholamines, in particu- lar when the term "vasopressor" is used to describe
u8nw | predominantly peripheral arterial vasoconstrictive properties, do not necessarily reflect the true in vivo effects of these agents.
l2v9 | Myocardial Oxygen Consumption
afbe | Although the overarching purpose of vasopressors and inotropes in CS is to improve tissue oxygen deliv- ery, these agents also increase myocardial oxygen de- mand, which in the setting of a cardiomyocyte oxygen supply-demand mismatch can cause further injury and contractile dysfunction. The energetic requirements of the myocardium is primarily met through oxidative metabolic pathways with <5% of ATP derived from gly- colytic pathways.32 Basal metabolic requirements ac- count for 10% to 20% of the total myocardial oxygen requirements, with the remaining oxygen needs deter- mined by variables that include heart rate, contractility, and systolic wall tension.32 The relative contribution of these variables has been characterized through human and animal models, primarily using exercise to induce increased cardiac work. From these studies, heart rate has been shown to be the greatest contributor to myocardial oxygen consumption. Through augmenta- tion with pacing, it was found that 30% to 40% of the heart's metabolic needs were secondary to heart rate variation.32 However, this is likely an underestimate of the true impact of heart rate, due to pacing mediated reductions in end-diastolic and stroke volumes, with some estimates of heart rate variation accounting for up to 50% to 70% of myocardial oxygen demand.32,33 The contribution of contractility has been elegantly assessed through several animal and human studies, showing that increased myocardial contractility under physiological stress (exercise) accounts for 15% to 25% of the oxygen demand.32 In addition to factors that influence myocar- dial oxygen requirements, supply is principally governed by the coronary perfusion pressure gradient, perfusion time (which occurs predominantly during diastole and is reduced with increased heart rate), and coronary ar- tery vasomotor tone. 34 Therefore, the interplay between hemodynamic supports, cardiac filling pressures, heart rate variation, and coronary vasomotor tone has the po- tential to adversely influence myocardial oxygen supply- demand mismatch in the setting of CS.

s2v1 | the following receptors; alpha-adrenergic (aq), beta- adrenergic (ß, and ß2), and dopamine (D.) receptors.35 A comparison of the a- and -adrenergic receptor (AR) pharmacology on vascular smooth muscle and car- diac tissue is presented in Table 2 and the intracellular signaling effects of catecholamines, in addition to other vasoactive agents, are presented in Figures 1 and 2.
jkp9 | The direct cardiac effects of catecholamines are mediated through the G-protein-coupled ß,-AR, which comprise 80% of the ß-AR population within the left ventricle.36 ß .- AR stimulation augments cardiac output through increased cytosolic Ca2+ cycling and phos- phorylation of troponin I, leading to increased myocyte contractility, lusitropy (active relaxation), and positive chronotropy.37 The second body system affected by catecholamines is vascular smooth muscle. The a,-AR primarily modulates arteriolar smooth muscle tone.38 Activation of the a -- AR causes increased cytosolic cal- cium concentrations resulting in smooth muscle con- traction and an accompanying increase in systemic vascular resistance and MAP.38 Conversely, ß2-AR stim- ulation activates the inhibitory (Gi) signaling pathways in vascular smooth muscle, causing vasodilatation.39
z8tt | Norepinephrine, epinephrine, phenylephrine, and dopamine are potent vasopressors and have compa- rable effects in increasing MAP.28,40 However, phen- ylephrine's exclusive a -AR agonist activity renders it unable to improve cardiac output and therefore should be avoided as a first-line agent for hemodynamic support in CS. Unlike phenylephrine, norepinephrine, epinephrine, dobutamine, and dopamine (to a lesser extent) all augment cardiac output through stimulation of the myocyte ß,-AR. However, in contrast with dobu- tamine, dopamine, and epinephrine, norepinephrine has the capacity to improve cardiac output, without significantly increasing heart rate, and therefore may limit increases in myocardial oxygen consumption and potentially attenuate vasoactive medication related myocardial ischemia and injury.31,41,42
