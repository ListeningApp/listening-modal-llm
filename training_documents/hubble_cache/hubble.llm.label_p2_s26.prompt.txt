You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

ki8m | The observations directly measure the apparent magnitude m of a supernova and its redshift z. The apparent magnitude m of the supernova is related to the luminosity distance dL of the supernova through

ex5k | SNe Ia are always used as standard candles, and are believed to provide strongest constraints on the cosmological parameters. In the present analysis, we use recently released Union2 set of 557 SNe Ia from Supernova Cosmology Project (Amanullah et al. (2010). In this case, we define the x2 as
9d4o | X'SN (q, Ho) = i=1 Į(zi, q, Ho) - Hobs(zi)] Ơi
cjq2 | (12)
5esx | After performing a grid search in the entire paramet- ric space (q > -1 and Ho > 0), we find that the best fit values of the parameters are q = - 0.38 and Ho = 69.18 to- gether with x = 0.99. Again, the power-law cosmological model fitted with the 557 SNe Ia data confirms the cos- mic acceleration with q = - 0.38. The likelihood contours at 68.3% (inner contour), 95.4% (middle contour) and 99.73% (outer contour) confidence levels around the best fit values point (-0.38, 69.18) (indicated by star symbol) in the q - Ho plane are shown in Fig.2. The errors at lo level are derived as q = - 0.38+0.05 8-0.05 and Ho = 69.18+0.55 -0.54.
m5ka | 5 BEST-FITTING MODEL FROM THE JOINT TEST: H(Z)+SNE IA DATA
byu8 | In order to obtain tighter constraints on the model param- eters and to avoid degeneracy in the observational data, we combine H(z) and SNe Ia data. Since H(z) and SNe Ia data are obtained from independent cosmological probes, the to- tal likelihood is considered to be the product of separate likelihoods of the two probes. Therefore, we define

colo | 6 CONSTRAINTS FROM PRIMORDIAL NUCLEOSYNTHESIS
d6r4 | Before we find constraints on power-law cosmology param- eters from primordial big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN), it is helpful to reproduce the brief review of the BBN in stan- dard model given by Kaplinghat et al. (1999). The neutron- proton ratio <LATEX>n / p = \exp \left( - Q / T \right) ,</LATEX> where <LATEX>Q = 1 . 2 9 \mathrm { M e V }</LATEX> is the neutron-proton mass difference, at high temperatures <LATEX>T \gtrsim 1 \mathrm { M e V }</LATEX> is maintained by charged-current weak inter- actions among neutrons, protons, electrons, positrons and neutrinos. When the Universe is of order 1 s old, <LATEX>T \lesssim 1</LATEX> MeV, the <LATEX>n / p</LATEX> ratio "freezes out" due to the inequilibrium of weak interactions and free neutron decay with a lifetime of 887 s. At this stage the deuterium (D) produced due to

wcd0 | collision of neutrons and protons is rapidly photodissoci- ated by the cosmic background photons. This causes very low abundance of <LATEX>D</LATEX> and thus heavier nuclei are not formed at this epoch. Thus nucleosynthesis is delayed by this "pho- todissociation bottleneck". However, when the universe is ~ 3 minutes old, the temperature falls below ~ 80 keV, the deuterium bottleneck is broken. At this stage the nuclear reactions quickly burn out the remaining free neutrons into 4He and leave trace amounts of D, 3He and <LATEX>{ } ^ { 7 } \mathrm { L i }</LATEX> (Walker et al. 1991). A viable cosmological model must mimic the above scenario for proper synthesis of the light elements in the early Universe. In the following, we test the power-law cosmological model for primordial nucleosynthesis.
caos | In power-law cosmology the scale factor <LATEX>a \left( t \right)</LATEX> and the cosmic microwave background temperature <LATEX>T \left( t \right)</LATEX> are related through the relation:
qrvy | <LATEX>\frac { a } { a _ { 0 } } = \frac { T _ { 0 } } { \beta T } = \left( \frac { t } { t _ { 0 } } \right) ^ { \frac { 1 } { 1 + q } } ,</LATEX> (14)

In standard cosmology, the instantaneous <LATEX>e ^ { \pm }</LATEX> annihilation is assumed at <LATEX>T = m _ { e } .</LATEX> The heating due to this annihilation is accounted by <LATEX>\beta</LATEX> where <LATEX>\beta = 1</LATEX> for <LATEX>T < m _ { e }</LATEX> while <LATEX>\beta = \left( 1 1 / 4 \right) ^ { 1 / 3 }</LATEX> for

(2011) on the basis of 7 year data from WMAP and astrophysical data from other sources. Further, the model is assumed to have current temperature <LATEX>T _ { 0 } = 2 . 7 2 8 \mathrm { K } .</LATEX> The primordial nucleosynthesis requires that <LATEX>t \leq 8 8 7</LATEX> <LATEX>T \approx 8 0 \mathrm { k e V } .</LATEX> This puts the following constraints on <LATEX>q</LATEX> and
