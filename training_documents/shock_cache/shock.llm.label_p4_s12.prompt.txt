You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

uooz | Norepinephrine, epinephrine, phenylephrine, and dopamine are potent vasopressors and have compa- rable effects in increasing MAP.28,40 However, phen- ylephrine's exclusive a -AR agonist activity renders it unable to improve cardiac output and therefore should be avoided as a first-line agent for hemodynamic support in CS. Unlike phenylephrine, norepinephrine, epinephrine, dobutamine, and dopamine (to a lesser extent) all augment cardiac output through stimulation of the myocyte ß,-AR. However, in contrast with dobu- tamine, dopamine, and epinephrine, norepinephrine has the capacity to improve cardiac output, without significantly increasing heart rate, and therefore may limit increases in myocardial oxygen consumption and potentially attenuate vasoactive medication related myocardial ischemia and injury.31,41,42
pxbq | Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors
jfsr | PDE3 is an abundant enzyme in many tissues, includ- ing in cardiac myocytes and vascular smooth muscle. 43 PDE3's biological actions include the hydrolysis of CAMP.43 Therefore, inhibition of PDE3 through agents such as milrinone leads to increased cytosolic CAMP levels. Within cardiac tissue, elevated cAMP levels lead to increased inotropy, while vasodilation occurs within blood vessels. These effects serve to augment cardiac output, reduce afterload, and reduce systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance.44 The administration of milrinone, however, should be performed with caution in patients with severe renal impairment, as it is subject to renal elimination and runs the risk of toxic accumula- tion in this setting.

3g9w | Calcium Sensitizers
d09o | Calcium sensitizers are a relatively recently developed novel class of inodilators.45,46 Levosimendan, a rou- tinely used calcium sensitizer (not routinely available in the United States), has both peripheral vasodilatory ef- fects and enhances myocardial contractility, mediated through vascular smooth muscle potassium channel binding and cardiac myofilament calcium sensitization by calcium-dependent troponin C binding, respectively. Levosimendan has similar hemodynamic effects to that of the PDE3 inhibitor milrinone and interestingly has been shown to have significant PDE3 inhibiting actions as well.46 Furthermore, levosimendan has an active metabolite with a half-life of >80 hours, allowing the hemodynamic effects to persist following completion of the initial infusion.
ylhz | Arginine Vasopressin Antagonists
a3td | Arginine vasopressin (vasopressin), an endogenous nonapeptide hormone, exerts its cardiovascular effects through the activation of G-protein coupled receptors V1a (in smooth muscle) and V2 (in the renal collecting tu- bules) Activation of the Via receptor on vascular smooth muscle causes increased cytosolic Ca2+ and resulting vasoconstriction, and the V2 receptor activation leads to water retention via the distal convoluted tubule.47
ex5k | The use of vasopressin in the management of CS is principally mediated through a dose-dependent in- crease in systemic vascular resistance. It has a limited impact on other hemodynamic parameters including cardiac output and pulmonary capillary wedge pres- sure.48 Vasopressin may also have pleotropic effects that can ameliorate the underlying causes of the systemic in- flammatory response syndrome mediated vasoplegia by

byu8 | Methylene blue is a repurposed agent, previously used in the treatment of methemoglobinemia, but has re- cently generated interest for use in refractory vaso- plegic shock.52 In the setting of CS-related systemic inflammatory response syndrome, methylene blue's therapeutic effects are exerted through the inhibition of nitric oxide mediated cGMP production, resulting in increased smooth muscle vasoconstriction. Methylene blue should be used with caution in patients treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors as it may precipitate a serotonin syndrome and also in patients with known glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase de- ficiency due to the risk of developing hemolytic anemia.

Despite limited high-quality data, French, German, Austrian, and the European Society Cardiology guidelines addressing CS management endorse the use of norepinephrine or dobutamine as the first-line vasoactive medications in CS.16,19,57,58 In the United States, current guidelines re- main less definitive.

d6r4 | Heart Failure guidelines do not provide clear recom- mended first-line vasoactive medication, suggesting clinicians use agents that are readily available, easy to administer, and they are familiar.59 Furthermore, the American Heart Association's Scientific Statements on the contemporary management of CS recommends the use of dopamine or norepinephrine as first-line treatments, whereas the recently published guideline for the invasive management of AMI-CS suggests nor- epinephrine be used to support blood pressure in the initial stabilization period, unless further chronotropic support is required.1,60 These recommendations are summarized in Figure 3.

7wn9 | Stimulation of the a,-adrenergic or vasopressin-1 receptors causes activation of the Gq (G-protein) subunit, resulting in downstream stimulation of the phospholipase C signaling pathway. Phospholipase C in turn activates inositol 1, 4, 5-triphosphate (IP3) leading to Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), resulting in vasoconstriction. Conversely, ß2-receptor stimulation activates the inhibitory G-protein (Gi) subunit causing vasodilatation through increased cAMP (cyclic adenosine monophosphase) activation and resulting phospholamban-mediated Ca2+ uptake into the SR. Similarly, activation of the ATP-sensitive potassium channel causes potassium influx that hyperpolarizes voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels, reducing intracellular Ca2+ and vasomotor tone. AMP indicates adenosine monophosphate; DAG, diacylglycerol; PDE3, phosphodiesterase 3; and PLB, phospholamban.
wcd0 | Treatment of Cardiogenic Shock With Associated Hypotension
caos | The initial goal of therapy in patients with CS and as- sociated hypotension should be focused on the res- toration of perfusion to vital organs, achieved through augmenting MAP and cardiac output.2 End-organ blood flow is a direct correlate of MAP, and reduced systolic blood pressure in CS, in particular in the set- ting of AMI-CS, is independently associated with an increased risk of mortality.61
qrvy | The safety and efficacy of dopamine in CS has been called into question by the SOAP-II (Sepsis Occurrence in Acutely Ill Patients) trial.41 This study compared dopa- mine and norepinephrine as first-line therapies through a multicenter, ICU-based randomized controlled trial of 1679 patients with shock of all causes.41 Although there was no difference in the primary outcome of all-cause 28-day mortality in this cohort, dopamine was associated with increased arrhythmic events (n=207 [24.1%] versus n=102 [12.4%], P<0.001) and in a prespecified subgroup of 280 patients with CS there

Although these findings are hypothesis generating, in the absence of alternate data supporting the use of dopamine, we advocate that noradrenaline should be used in preference to dopamine in the hemodynamic support in patients with CS and hypotension.
yeoh | There is an emerging body of evidence to support the use of norepinephrine as the initial vasoactive agent for the management of CS with hypotension. OPTIMA CC (Epinephrine Versus Norepinephrine for Cardiogenic Shock After Acute Myocardial Infarction), a small pro- spective, double-blinded, randomized controlled study, sought to compare the hemodynamic effects and toler- ability of epinephrine with norepinephrine in AMI-CS.31 Despite recruiting a total of only 57 patients, there were several valuable insights gained from these data; (1) there were no differences observed in MAP, cardiac index, or stroke volume in patients treated with either epinephrine or norepinephrine; (2) comparable doses of both study drugs were required to achieve a target MAP of 70 mm Hg; (3) epinephrine treatment was associated
