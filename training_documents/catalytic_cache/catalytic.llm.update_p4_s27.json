        "content": "uodj | Raman spectra were conducted to characterize the graphitization degree. Typically, the band at one thousand three hundred fifty per centimeter, known as D-band, is assigned to defect sites or the disordered sp-two carbon. The G band at one thousand five hundred eighty per centimeter is corresponded to the in-plane vibrational mode of sp-two hybridized carbon. The intensity ratio of I subscript D over I subscript G values for FC-zero-eight, FC-one-eight and FC-one-eight-HCl are one point three zero, zero point nine nine and one point zero zero, respectively. Compared with FC-zero-eight, the lower I subscript D over I subscript G values of FC-one-eight and FC-one-eight-HCl indicated a relatively short-range order graphitic carbon because of the treatment of potassium ferrate. Furthermore, the X-ray photoelectron spectrum verified the existence of carbon, oxygen, and iron elements on the surface of FC-one-eight. The high-resolution spectra iron two P orbit showed two dominant peaks at seven hundred eleven point zero and seven hundred thirteen point one electron volts, which were indexed to the two P subscript three over two orbitals of iron two plus and iron three plus, respectively. The peaks located at a binding energy of seven hundred twenty-four point six electron volts, seven hundred twenty-six point four electron volts and seven hundred eighteen point five electron volts were assigned to iron two plus and iron three plus for the two P subscript one over two band, and a satellite.\n\nk16v | To evaluate the surface morphology and structure of the samples, SEM measurements of FC-zero-eight, FC-one-eight and FC-one-eight-HCl were conducted. After annealed in argon atmosphere at eight hundred degrees Celsius, the as-prepared carbon spheres (FC-zero-eight) became black and maintained a similar structure and the carbon spheres interconnected forming the three D network, which was favorable to electron transfer. Besides, FC-one-eight and FC-one-eight-HCl generally inherited their structure except for the rough surface of carbon spheres. Furthermore, a comparison of SEM images revealed that the average diameter of the FC-one-eight-HCl sample was a little bit smaller than that of FC-one-eight after the removal of iron carbide or iron nanoparticles. Convinced by the particle size distributions, as measured by a statistical method measuring the diameter of one hundred particles, the average size of FC-one-eight decreased from approximately four hundred fifty nanometers to approximately two hundred forty nanometers after being etched by HCl.\n\nb2lm | The TEM images of FC-zero-eight presented disordered carbon lattice fringes, suggesting the existence of amorphous carbon. As shown, the HRTEM of FC-one-eight was composed of graphitic carbon and iron nanoparticles. The lattice fringe with a spacing of zero point three four nanometers corresponded to the zero zero two plane of carbon and the lattice fringe calculated to be zero point two zero nanometers and zero point two four nanometers were assigned to the one zero one plane of iron and one one one plane of iron carbide, respectively. Obviously, the existence of metallic iron contributed to the formation of graphitic carbon. The corresponding elemental mappings of carbon and iron further verified that the rough surface of carbon spheres should be iron carbide or iron nanoparticles. Part of FC-one-eight-HCl nanoparticles showed irregular structure while the HRTEM images confirmed the existence of graphitic carbon.\n\nti7f | The whole process was economic and environmentally friendly without any toxic or hazardous materials input. FC-one-eight and FC-one-eight-HCl were expected to be excellent electrode materials. On the one hand, the partial graphitization with hierarchical porosity structure could offer large specific surface area value and electroactive sites. On the other hand, the graphitic carbon ensured conductivity of the sample.\n\noksu | Three point three. Electrochemical performance\n\nwtow | Electrochemical properties of the obtained carbon material were examined under a voltage window from negative one point two to negative zero point three volts at a scan rate of one hundred millivolts per second initially in a three-electrode configuration. As shown, the FC-one-eight electrode displayed a larger area than the other two samples, implying a larger capacitance value. A pair of explicit and symmetrical cathodic and anodic peaks can be observed in the CV curve of FC-one-eight, implying a kind of pseudocapacitive behavior. It was reported that iron carbide species can be oxidized to iron three oxide irreversibly in the potassium hydroxide electrolyte and result in the reversible redox reaction of the newly formed iron three oxide material as expressed by the following equation.\n\no22k | Iron three oxide plus four H two O plus two e superscript negative right arrow three iron hydroxide plus two OH.\n\nnwfz | Notably, the graphitic FC-one-eight-HCl displayed a much larger integral area than FC-zero-eight, which convincingly demonstrated excellent energy storage performance. In other words, carbon materials with higher graphitization degree exhibit superior Faraday capacitance. In detail, according to the GCD profiles,\n\nnvfy | the FC-one-eight and FC-one-eight-HCl electrodes can deliver the specific capacitance as high as four hundred twenty-eight point zero and two hundred forty-three point three farads per gram at one ampere per gram, whereas the specific capacitance of FC-zero-eight are only eighty-four point three farads per gram at one ampere per gram. The capacitance value of FC-one-eight outperforms most reported iron-based carbon materials in Table two.",
