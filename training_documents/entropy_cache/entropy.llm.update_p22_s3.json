        "content": "8u4f | The integral from negative infinity to infinity chi sub S of x d x where chi sub S of x is one for x in S and zero for x not in S. Indeed, people often get sloppy and say d x \"is\" Lebesgue measure, and I may do that too. By the way, Lebesgue measure is one where we cannot take script M to be the collection of all subsets of\n5bai | the set of real numbers. There is an extensive theory of measures. We will not need it here, but if you're interested, you can try a book like Halsey Royden's Real Analysis, where I learned the basics myself, or Terry Tao's An Introduction to Measure Theory, which has a legal free version online.\n2z5m | Here are some puzzles about measures.\n63p4 | Puzzle ten. Let X be any set and define script M to be the collection of all subsets of X. Show that there is a measure m from script M to open zero to infinity closed called counting measure such that for any S subset X, m of S is the number of elements of S, infinity if S is infinite.\nlvik | Puzzle eleven. Let X be any set and define script M as before. Suppose P is a probability distribution on X, meaning a function P from X to open zero to infinity closed with the sum over i in X P of i equals one. Show that there is a probability measure m from script M to open zero to infinity closed such that for any\n16a3 | S subset X, m of S equals the sum over i in S P of i. In this situation we usually write P of i as P sub i and call it the probability of the outcome i in X. For any S subset or equal to M we call m of S the probability of the event\n49ye | S. In the next puzzles X is any set, script M obeys the three rules for a collection of measurable subsets of X, and m from script M to open zero to infinity closed is a measure.\n850s | Puzzle twelve. Show that if S, T in script M then the union S union T is in\nyusd | script M. Puzzle thirteen. Show that if S, T in script M then the intersection S intersection T is in\nnoq3 | script M. Puzzle fourteen. Show that if S sub i in script M for i equals one, two, and so on then the intersection from i equals one to infinity S sub i is in script M. Puzzle fifteen. Show that if S, T in script M and S subset or equal to T then\nkdhu | m of S less than or equal to m of T. Puzzle sixteen. Show that if S sub i in script M for i equals one, two, and so on then\no8es | m of the union from i equals one to infinity S sub i less than or equal to the sum from i equals one to infinity m of S sub i. Puzzle seventeen. Show that if m is a probability measure and S in script M then\n2k63 | zero less than or equal to m of S less than or equal to one. One of the main uses of a measure m on a space X is that it lets us integrate certain functions f from X to the set of real numbers. Alas, not all functions! It's only reasonable to try to integrate measurable functions f from X to the set of real numbers, which have the property that if S subset or equal to the set of real numbers is measurable, its inverse image f inverse of S subset or equal to X is measurable. And even measurable functions can cause trouble, because when we try to integrate them we might get positive infinity, negative infinity, or something even worse. For example, what's\np1p2 | the integral from negative infinity to infinity x squared sine x d x? There's no good answer. We say a function f from X to the set of real numbers is integrable if it is measurable and its integral over X, defined in a certain way I won't explain here, gives a well-defined real number.\nmuok | Shannon Entropy: A First Taste\nqozi | When you learn an event of probability p has happened, the amount of information you get is negative log p.",
