        "content": "53fa | One source of error is the systematic error due to three different biases. As discussed in Proposition two point four, the finiteness of the integration time leads to some bias of order one over n t, which is typically smaller than the statistical error. Additionally, the fact that we consider n tends to zero leads to some bias of order n, as a consequence of Lemma two point two. Lastly, the time discretization of the continuous dynamics also leads to some time step bias.\nnnb3 | As discussed in Proposition two point four below, the statistical error is dictated by a central limit theorem, so the variance of the estimator O n t scales as one over n squared t. The simulation time required to estimate P one with a sufficient statistical accuracy therefore scales as t proportional to n to the negative two, leading to very long integration times t. Such long simulation times are often prohibitive in practical cases of interest. These results, and the tradeoffs to be considered, are discussed in more detail in Section two point three.\ns943 | Two point two point three. Application to mobility. The aim of this section is to illustrate the various previous results in the paradigmatic case of mobility. We consider the case where F belongs to real numbers to the power n is a constant force, and the state-space is X equals T to the d. We define the mobility for both overdamped Langevin and Langevin dynamics, and discuss how it is related to the self-diffusion by Einstein's relation.\no7zd | From a physical point of view, it is expected that a nonzero constant force in some given direction induces a response from the system. At steady-state, this response is represented by some nonzero flux, due to the fact that the forcing F is not the gradient of a periodic function. This nonzero flux depends both on the perturbation and on the observable R in question.\nthxo | For the Langevin dynamics two point eighteen, the perturbation nF is expected to induce a nonzero velocity in the direction F. The mobility is the proportionality constant between the externally applied force F and the observed average velocity in the direction F. Therefore, it is natural to consider the observable\nb67w | R(p) equals F transpose M to the negative one p.\nhoze | This gives us the following expression for the mobility, in view of two point twenty-six:\nhd71 | P one equals one over t integral d x R to the power n (F transpose M to the negative one p) f one forty.\neix9 | It can be rewritten using the Green-Kubo formula two point thirty-six and the expression two point thirty-seven of the conjugate response as\nh4p4 | P one equals B times the integral from zero to infinity of the expected value at zero of F transpose M to the negative one P t times F transpose M to the negative one p zero.\nasp2 | From this expression, it is easy to see that the mobility is related to the self-diffusion coefficient D F as\n8d1n | Two point thirty-nine P one equals B D F,\n559s | where\nrhb6 | D F equals the limit of t tends to positive infinity expected value of F transpose times Q t minus Q zero squared all over two t,\ndpdb | with\nlek9 | Q t equals Q zero plus the integral from zero to t of M to the negative one p s ds\ni22c | the unperiodized displacement. The formula two point thirty-nine for D F is known as Einstein's relation.\nofle | For overdamped Langevin dynamics two point eleven, there is no notion of velocities. The system is however expected to drift in the direction F. This can be quantified by how much the gradient part of the force changes in the direction F. Thus, it is natural to consider the following observable\nezbr | R(q) equals F transpose V V (q).\ntpiw | The mobility is then defined as the average projected force in the direction of the perturbation\ndgkq | P one equals the expected value of F transpose V f one forty.\nhxjr | EXTENDING LINEAR RESPONSE WITH SYNTHETIC FORCINGS\n2yv3 | For overdamped Langevin, the mobility is related to the self-diffusion D F through the following equality\nopoe | B D F equals the absolute value of F squared minus P one equals the absolute value of F squared minus B times the integral from zero to B of the expected value of F transpose V of q t F transpose V of zero,\nvr2v | where the second expression involves the Green-Kubo formula for the linear response of F transpose V V.\nm4jl | Two point three. Numerical Analysis for N.E.M.D. In this section, we perform error analysis on the estimator two point thirty-eight. We obtain bounds on the variance, then on the finite-time integration bias. Without loss of generality, we consider response functions of the form R equals H O R, i.e. functions with zero average with respect to the invariant measure of the reference dynamics. The estimator O n t defined in two point thirty-eight converges almost surely, as t tends to infinity to\n59hi | P n equals the integral of R y n equals P one plus O of n,\nua3p | Two point forty\n0a2t | where the last equality comes from Lemma two point two. However, O n t suffers both from a large asymptotic variance, of order o k o over n squared (with o k o the asymptotic variance for time averages of R computed with the reference dynamics), and a large finite-time sampling bias, of order one over n t. The aim of this section is to make precise the latter two statements.\nabow | Bounds on the statistical error. The scaling of the statistical error is quantified in the following result.\nqx6n | PROPOSITION two point four. Suppose that Assumptions one through four hold true. Fix R E S zero and n E R. Assume that X zero is similar to H init for some initial probability measure H init (d x) such that M init (K n) is less than positive infinity for any n greater than one. Then the estimator Q n t converges almost surely to P one n as t tends to positive infinity, and the following central limit theorem holds:\np2bm | V t times open parenthesis n t minus P one n close parenthesis as t tends to positive infinity in law converges to N (zero, zero K m).\ncxyx | Two point forty-one\nw0aw | Moreover, there exists O R zero such that for any n times x belongs to open parenthesis zero, positive infinity close parenthesis, there is C belongs to R plus (which depends on n times star and R) for which\nw41b | V n less than n times star , the integral from zero to infinity of R times two n minus R two zero minus R two zero is less than or equal to C n squared.\nvokd | Two point forty-two\nefir | This result shows that simulation times of order t proportional to n squared should be considered in order for the variance of the naive estimator two point thirty-eight to be of order one , and also for its bias to be of order n, i.e. of the same order of magnitude as the bias P one minus P one n arising from choosing n tends to zero. For completeness, the proof of two point forty-two is done at second-order, in order to determine the expression of the term o R zero characterizing the first-order variation of o R n with respect to n.\nvjhs | Proof. The central limit theorem two point forty-one holds by the results, since the Poisson equation minus L n R n equals H O R has a unique solution in H O B A n C L two of y for some integer n greater than or equal to one in view of two point five and two point six. Note that H O R n equals R n. To prove two point forty-two, we first write the asymptotic variance as\nrcio | Two point forty-three O R n equals two times the integral of R H O n U n.\n7qi5 | In view of Lemma two point five below, we introduce \"widetilde R equals negative backslash mathcal L subscript zero to the power of negative one backslash Pi subscript zero widetilde backslash mathcal L subscript phys widehat R subscript zero in mathscr S ,\" so that\n9f5r | Two point forty-four",
