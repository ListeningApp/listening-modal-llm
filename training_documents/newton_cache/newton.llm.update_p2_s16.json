        "content": "nv44 | Of course, the effectiveness of the projected gradient method relies heavily on the computational cost associated with computing P subscript upper Omega left parenthesis x right parenthesis. While this can be challenging for general convex sets, in the case of upper Omega equals upper Real positive to the power of d, it is simply given by left bracket upper P left parenthesis x right parenthesis right bracket ^ { i } equals x ^ { i }, if x ^ { i } greater than zero, and left bracket upper P left parenthesis x right parenthesis right bracket ^ { i } equals zero, otherwise. Note that, for notational simplicity, we omit the dependence of upper P on upper Omega in our context. Nonetheless, while the projected gradient method is a simple choice for solving (one), it shares the common drawbacks of first-order methods alluded to earlier, such as susceptibility to ill-conditioning.\nl6cw | Second-order Methods. By incorporating Hessian information, second-order methods hold the promise to alleviate many of the well-known deficiencies of first-order alternatives, such as they are typically better suited to ill-conditioned problems. For constrained problems, generic projected quasi-Newton methods involve iterations of the form x subscript k plus one equals x subscript k plus alpha subscript k p subscript k where\nz8po | p subscript k equals the argument of the minimum over x in upper Omega of the inner product of g subscript k and p plus the inner product of p and B subscript k p divided by two.
