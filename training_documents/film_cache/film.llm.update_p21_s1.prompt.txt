You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

7w7j | Conclusion
51vd | Neither of the above theoretical approaches can function as a thoroughgoing explanation of gender representation in art or cinema. In today's global film industry, new theoretical models might emerge that are better suited to aid our understanding of how gender representations work within and upon social and economic power relations. From today's perspective, we could probably find a handful of exceptions to the patriarchal modes of representation described above. Berger and Mulvey may seem a bit dated, but many of their insights still resonate with readers, and can be found and studied in the products of past eras, if not in our own. These are, of course, only theories, and summarised ones at that. But we will look in the following chapters at some of the ways in which the male gaze/male look and the power of patriarchal narratives have influenced cinema then and now.
baj1 | Chapter Summary
n1wo | · This book does not assume that a decontextualised evaluation of cinema is an adequate one. Sex is here examined not just as biological fact, but as a public concept, or set of ideas, about men, women, biology, the 'natural', the 'normal', the 'perverse', etc.
5bq3 | . Since films are human artifacts, film-makers cannot avoid relating their works to the social, political, historical and visual culture in which they are situated. Traditions, popular forms, trends and styles develop through the imitation and repetition of certain elements. These common modes of representation become conventional or generic.
ezla | · Although cinema generally attempts to imitate 'real life', it presents us with a constructed world, fabricated through a carefully selected set of representations. Students should be encouraged to interrogate the social functions of our stories and myths.
rsbu | · Discourse - Foucault introduced the idea that language, far from being neutral, creates meaning by the ways in which it is used, and in particular the ways that it is used to wield power. Discourse analysis allows students to recognise film language as a medium through which relationships of power between different groups are maintained, reinforced, exposed, subverted or re-negotiated.
magd | · Hegemony - Hegemonic discourses or ideologies are those that achieve ascendancy or domination within a global or international industry, economy or culture. Antonio Gramsci argued that control by one minority social/ political group or ideological system over its rivals need not involve force, since people can just as easily be lulled into compliance by a powerful set of messages, to which they consent in the belief that they are 'better off'.

1jyv | . Denotation is the 'common sense' definition or meaning of a word. Connotations, by contrast, are implicit or suggested meanings that are not a part of the literal meaning of a word. Students should be encouraged to reflect on the connotations of words like 'feminist' and 'director'. The word 'feminist' carries misleading connotations of womanhood, when this is not in fact part of the definition of the term. Similarly, the title 'director' has become a gendered term, associated with males. The film director's masculinity has become normalised or assumed.
olce | · As a medium of re-presentation, film does not merely record reality, but constructs an image of reality through the use of codes, myths, conventions and signs. Feminists argue that media representations of gender perpetuate and reinforce the values of patriarchal society.
erx1 | · The explicit message or interpretation is that which is consciously intended.
b3bt | · A film's implicit meanings are less stable, and may involve contested interpretations that go beyond the intention of the film-maker. These meanings are not literally written into the script, but they can be read out of its subtext. The subtext refers to the unstated message conveyed through the form of a book, film or picture.
0w8m | · Sexuality has to do with anatomical differences between women and men. Sex is a given. Gender, by contrast, refers to those socially constructed ideas about 'boys' and 'girls', and the ways in which society perceives the differences between the sexes.
vcu3 | . The stereotypical role of the female in the traditional Hollywood film has not been that of an agent. Women have played very little part in constructing public images of femininity. Women tend to imitate an idealised and eroticised male construction of what women 'should' be. 'Woman' comes to represent not one person of the female sex, but a stereotype, a category defined by men and in opposition to men. Feminist critics point out that cinematic representations of women are mediated through the eyes and desires of the male director.
hjzj | . John Berger's Ways of Seeing was one of the twentieth century's most influential books on art. Berger's insights provide much of the groundwork for later feminist theorists.
j79f | · Berger began by noting that the social presence of a woman is different in kind from that of a man. A woman is almost continually accompanied by her own image of herself. From earliest childhood, she has been taught and persuaded to survey herself continually. Her own sense of being in herself is supplanted by a sense of being appreciated as herself by another (male] spectator. The surveyor of women in herself is male.

cxqi | . Berger looks closely at the visual conventions that inform the typical European oil painting, and in particular the female nude. Berger notes the ways in which the paintings were intended to flatter the male spectator- owner, for whom they were made, turning the female nudes into objects of sight for his pleasure. As in the conventional European oil painting, women are today depicted in quite a different way than men - not because the feminine is different from the masculine - but because the 'ideal' spectator is always assumed to be male.
qfmx | · Laura Mulvey's 'Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema' appropriated psychoanalytic theory, particularly that of Freud and Lacan, to demonstrate the ways in which unconscious forces in patriarchal society have structured film form. Drawing on Freud's descriptions of scopophilia, Mulvey argued that this impulse could explain one of the central pleasures of the cinema.
rut3 | · Fetishistic scopophilia, says Mulvey, provides an avenue of escape for the male unconscious, which is threatened by the female figure insofar as it represents castration (the absence of a penis). By turning the female figure itself into a fetish, either through over-valuation or possessing her as an object of sight,' her appearance becomes reassuring rather than dangerous.
m3cp | · The other avenue of escape for the male unconscious, says Mulvey, is voyeurism - investigating the woman, penetrating her privacy, uncovering and demystifying her mystery. Cinematic spectatorship, by its very nature, plays on voyeuristic fantasies. The whole experience creates the illusion of a privileged perspective, from which the spectator can safely look in on a private world, while no one looks back at him.
mq4s | · Mulvey identifies three voyeuristic/scopophilic kinds of look associated with the cinema:
95el | a. The look of the camera and crew as they record the action.
a0a5 | b. The look between the characters on screen.
gocl | c. The look of the audience watching the film.
ob1z | · All three kinds of look are predominantly masculine or associated with the male.
m4cb | . Mulvey claims that pleasure in looking has been ordered along an active/ male and passive/female divide.
m61y | · Cinematic stimulation also produces narcissistic pleasures - the spectator identifies with the object seen. The spectator identifies with the main male protagonist, his screen surrogate, giving him a satisfying sense of omnipotence. Traditionally there are few instances of female characters actively driving the narrative and thus competing for the audience's
