Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document

  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

df3e | are reproduced to sub-percent accuracy, indicating the accuracy of the numerical solution to the LPA flow equa- tion, at least around the minimum of the effective poten- tial.
53eu | In addition to the static variance at equilibrium, the curvature of the effective potential around the minimum also determines the time dependence of correlations in equilibrium, quantified by the time dependent covariance or connected 2-point function

ry7u | Here, <LATEX>\lambda</LATEX> corresponds to <LATEX>V _ { , \chi \chi } |</LATEX> within the <LATEX>\mathrm { I } \mathrm { P A }</LATEX> but the solution to the WFR flow equation (96) for <LATEX>\zeta _ { , \chi }</LATEX> also con- tributes, providing a correction to <LATEX>\lambda</LATEX> according to (119).

r8sm | In Table. I we collect the values of <LATEX>\lambda</LATEX> obtained using the fRG under LPA & WFR for different <LATEX>\Upsilon</LATEX> values, and compare this directly to high accuracy numerical simu- lations of the Langevin equation (4). We can clearly see from Table. I that the LPA can have good agreement with the simulation value for simple potentials at high temperature but can deviate drastically as temperature is lowered. Inclusion of the WFR factor <LATEX>\zeta _ { x }</LATEX> reduces the deviation error from the value obtained in the simula- tions substantially to <LATEX>\sim 1</LATEX> for the simplest cases and order of magnitude agreement for the most complicated, low temperature systems.

In Fig. 7 (a) we can see that for <LATEX>\Upsilon = 3</LATEX> the WFR prediction closely matches the simulations offering signif- icant improvement over the LPA which closely matches the bare <LATEX>x ^ { 2 }</LATEX> potential. This indicates that even for highly non-trivial systems - where the computation of eigenval- ues for these potentials is a non-trivial exercise - that

sqxn | It is also worth pointing out that the simulated decay rate does not follow a pure exponential at all times in all cases. This can be best seen in the top plot of Fig. 6 (b) where the decay is initially close to the LPA, then the WFR decay before moving towards the eigen decay rate at late times. This sort of behaviour has been identified

kqmi | in similar systems in the early universe [46] where it was noticed that the smallest non-zero eigenvalue's spectral coefficient was sufficiently small that higher order eigen- values would dominate the decay at earlier times. As LPA matches the decay rate predicted by the Boltzmann distribution and WFR is closer to the decay predicted by E1. We discuss this further below.
g8rd | VII. RELAXATION TOWARDS EQUILIBRIUM
nns9 | In order to solve the equations of motion for the one point function x(t) and two point function G(t,t') we must first solve the PDEs for the LPA & WFR to obtain the dynamical effective potential V and the function U. We will use the solutions obtained in Section V in order to compute these parameters and then solve the appropriate Effective Equation of Motion (EEOM).
9uwy | A. The dynamical effective potentials
srly | In section IV we introduced the notion of the dynam- ical effective potential V given by equation (109) which together with (108) describes the evolution of the aver- age position, x. As the fRG guarantees that the fully effective potential V will be convex this implies that the dynamical effective potential V will also be either fully or extremely close to fully convex for LPA and WFR respectively thus greatly simplifying dynamical calcula- tions. In the previous section we emphasised how the fRG LPA effective potential gives us the Boltzmann equi- librium quantities such as equilibrium position and vari-

89ub | ance. What we would like to emphasise now however is that away from the minimum of the effective poten- tial the fRG gives us information that the near equilib- rium Boltzmann assumption does not. To be concrete, an approximate Gaussian Boltzmann distribution would assume that the potential is of the form:
dhle | VBoltz(x)= 4 . Vareq Υ (x - Xeq)2 (130)
2nib | where Xeq and Vareg are the equilibrium position and variance respectively. We show in Fig. 8 how this approx- imation can break down dramatically as one moves away from the equilibrium position suggesting that the fRG captures the far away from equilibrium dynamics well. In principle one could attempt to include higher order cumulants of the Boltzmann distribution such as skew- ness and kurtosis into an approximate effective poten- tial, however the relationship between these cumulants and higher derivatives of the effective potential is non- trivial and cumbersome to include. In any case it is not expected including these corrections would lead to signif- icant improvement away from equilibrium.
naev | B. Accelerated trajectories
7h0h | Having solved the appropriate flow equations to obtain the dynamical effective potentials we can now solve (108). Given the dynamical effective potential V it only takes a couple of seconds to obtain the full trajectory of x from some initial position Ci = Xi to the equilibrium position. For the polynomial potential we initialised the particle far away from the equilibrium position at x = 4. In Fig. 9 we show how the average position of the particle changes with time using direct simulation of the Langevin equation (4) over 50,000 runs, by numerically solving the

3pn1 | F-P equation (34) and as calculated by the evolution in the dynamical effective potentials V given using the LPA and WFR methods at Y = 10. All four trajectories agree to a very high precision.
wjuz | In Fig. 10 we plot the evolution of x(t) for the unequal LJ potential where the particle begins in the smaller well at x = - 1.878 and moves towards its equilibrium posi- tion. We see as before that the WFR trajectory closely matches the simulated trajectory offering significant im- provement over the LPA computation. Note that for this system it was impossible to get convergent numerics for the evolution of the F-P equation (34) This ability of the fRG to capture the non-trivial evolution of average po- sition is also shown in Fig. 11 for the x2 potential plus 6 bumps/dips which is a much more complex potential landscape at three different temperatures. Here the LPA trajectory offers improvement over the x2 "prediction" by converging to the correct equilibrium position and includ- ing WFR more closely matches the true simulated tra- jectory. Lowering the temperature generically decreases the accuracy of the fRG results. It is noteworthy that the fRG is able to reasonably capture these difficult dy- namics well in systems where the F-P solution is difficult to obtain.
3yxv | It is important to note the time advantage offered by the fRG. Solving the fRG flow equations is comparable in computation time to direct simulation while solving the F-P equation (34) takes longer than both. However the latter two methods obtain solutions that are only valid for a single initial condition. A huge advantage of the fRG is that once the dynamical effective potential V is obtained it is trivial to solve the EEOM (108) in a couple of seconds for any initial position whereas for both direct numerical simulation of (4) and solving the F-P equation (34) one has to start again from scratch.

For comparison the predicted evolution for the "bare" x2 potential is shown by the dotted red curve. The horizontal dotted line is the equilibrium value.
ywxn | C. Evolution of Var(x)
uxhs | For our accelerated trajectories we initialised the par- ticles at the exact same point every time. This means that at t = 0 the probability distribution of the particles had zero variance Var(x) = 0. Using this as our initial

onum | condition we solved numerically the EEOM for the vari- ance (116) , derived in appendix B. In Fig. 12 we show how the variance evolves with time for the polynomial potential for Y = 10. We can see that the LPA closely matches the numerical and F-P evolution until t = 0.5 before departing slightly although it still tends towards the correct equilibrium distribution.
3iir | In Fig. 13 we show how the variance evolves with time for an unequal LJ. As with the one-point function the F- P was unable to give sensible statistics however the LPA is able to very well match the early simulated trajectory even capturing the overshooting of the variance. The WFR on the other hand is better at capturing the late- time decay to equilibrium.
7a0a | Finally in Fig. 14 we show how the variance evolves for the x2 plus 6 gaussian bumps/dips potential at three different temperatures. As before, lowering the temper- ature decreases accuracy. In Fig. 14 (c) the fRG once again clearly captures the overshooting which is a fea- ture of the gaussian bumps' existence; the bare x2 evolu- tion does not capture this behaviour and overall describes the evolution poorly, converging to the wrong equilibrium variance. Again as before the LPA much better describes the early evolution while WFR more accurately describes late time evolution.
o1qp | D. Comparison with the spectral expansion
jrik | The above results for the change in the relative perfor- mance of LPA + WFR as temperature is lowered can be interpreted by resorting to the spectral expansion. In section II B we recalled how all observables can be computed in a standard way from the Schrödinger-like, Fokker-Planck equation (34) using an expansion in eigen- functions and eigenenergies. It is straightforward to show
