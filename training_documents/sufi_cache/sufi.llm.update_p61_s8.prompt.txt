You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

54ha | A DOG HAS PRECEDENCE
l0ba | Bayazid Bistami, walking through the streets with some of his followers, made an occasion to demonstrate the shortcomings of
lrx9 | such superficial assessments, as reported in Attar's Musibat-Nama, 'The Book of Calamity'.
cuje | A dog was walking towards them, and Bayazid made way for it. One of the disciples thought to himself that this must be wrong: Bayazid was a great saint, accompanied by students, allotted a high status, and a dog was after all only a dog.
hf27 | Bayazid perceived this man's feelings and explained.
jeod | The dog had seen them coming and had projected the thought to Bayazid that he must be sinful to have been created a dog, while this great man must be saintly because he was able to appear in such a resplendent and honoured form.
b4sp | Tt was because of this idea of that dog's,' said Bayazid, 'that I gave him precedence.'
oyus | Secrecy
hszm | Q: There seems to be no traditional psychology or similar study without a conception of secrets and secrecy. Why is this, and what is the nature of this secrecy?
a8y7 | A: Among the Sufis, the technical term 'secret' is applied to 'the innermost consciousness of man', and may be found authori- tatively rendered as such. It is common knowledge among people of traditional spiritual systems that there are differences in the significance and emphasis of the idea of the 'secret*, according to the condition of the person involved.
f5j1 | Here are some examples:
663c | STIMULATION
8ujr | (1) People who are seen to be strongly influenced by the idea of secrecy, and stimulated by it, thus automatically reveal them- selves as curiosity-mongers, and the Sufi, for instance, will know how to deal with such a person. It may well be that he has ruled himself out while he remains a mere anticipator of secrets.
50u2 | ENERGISING
7pc2 | (2) The idea of a 'secret', for those who can adopt a correct attitude towards it, can sometimes have an energising effect, be- cause for them it constitutes the discovery or attainment of some- thing which is prized and valuable. This point has been specifically emphasised by Ibn el-Arabi among the Sufis.
iy56 | PRIVACY
b0zn | (3) Secrecy has often been confused with privacy; privacy is needed to eliminate sources of interruption when people are con- centrating upon something.
vgh5 | RELATIVITY
j0y0 | (4) Secrecy can be the word applied to the fact that something is not ready to be revealed, or that it is 'hidden' from someone at a particular time for a good reason: and this reason may not be any more than effectiveness of operation, to ensure progress.
ktcv | Many things which are called 'secrets' are only things withheld from people until they can understand or effectively experience them.
e8zh | To clamour for 'secrets' or to do the equivalent (to want them unknowingly) is a characteristic of man, strongly marked in al- most all undertakings and stages of maturity, by no means con- fined to esoteric areas. If you narrow your conception of secrecy to a crude definition of something which is being kept from you, for instance, you do no more than show that you are unlikely to be flexible and sensitive enough to understand the 'secret' aspects of refined and subtle things. Many 'secrets' are best kept by the denial of any secret, or by people appearing, as Sufis often do, to be people of simplicity and ordinariness. The advantage of this to the Sufi is that it relieves him of the need to avoid or combat secret-seekers: they regard him as superficial or 'ordinary'.
rqcv | PENETRATION OF MEANING
hmde | One 'secret' of the Sufis is their method of making people aware of truths contained in experiences and also in literature, which are denied these people by the barriers which habit or subjective emotions raise up.
xqay | Saadi says, in his Bostan: 'The door of illumination is open to those for whom other doors are closed.' These doors are often those of intellectuality, of believing that one's own ideas will open doors, and doors to purely scholastic or merely systematic ap- proaches, without the insight which enables one to clear the mind of rubbish.
0h1s | THE SECRET OF THE SECRET
hdzg | The Sufi paradox: 'The secret of Sufism is that it has no secret at all' means that what is secret and hidden to those who are not
z5v5 | realised Sufis becomes understood and experienced to the Sufi, and therefore ceases to be termed a secret at all.
m4v9 | The word Sirr, generally translated as 'secret', stands in ac- cepted Sufi terminology for 'the innermost consciousness'. So that, if the innermost consciousness is not known to its possessor, it remains for him 'secret'. And, on the verbal level, where by definition consciousness cannot be experienced, only referred to, it remains for that reason 'secret', 'hidden'.
qwpz | One of the abilities of Sufis is that they can see through the outward show and self-deception of others, and are thus able to teach these prisoners of the secondary self to attain to the real 'secret', innermost consciousness, within.
hd4a | THE TURKISH MAIDEN
m7uf | Yusuf al-Razi illustrated this capacity to read minds, and also how others lack this and judge by appearances, in his famous story, found in Attar's Recital of the Friends.
q5qw | It is related that Hiri was once asked to look after a Turkish maiden by a Persian merchant who was going on a journey. Hiri became infatuated with this girl and decided that he must seek out his teacher, Abu-Hafs the Blacksmith. Abu-Hafs told him to travel to Raiyy, there to obtain the advice of the great Sufi Yusuf al-Razi.
o3yk | When he arrived in Raiyy and asked people there where the sage's dwelling was, they told him to avoid such a heretic and free- thinker, and so he went back to Nishapur. Reporting to Abu-Hafs, he was told to ignore the people's opinions of al-Razi, and seek him out again.
kulu | In spite of the almost unanimous urgings of the people of Raiyy, he made his way to where al-Razi sat. There he found the ancient, accompanied by a beautiful youth who was giving him a wine-cup.
195s | Scandalised, Hiri demanded an explanation of how such a reverend contemplative could behave in such a manner.
mgpm | But al-Razi explained that the youth was his son and the wine- cup contained only water, and had been abandoned by someone
ky35 | else. This was the reality of his state, which everyone imagined to be a life of dissolution.
96hq | But Hiri now wanted to know why the Sufi behaved in such a manner that people interpreted it as heretical.
9tvh | Al-Razi said: I do these things so that people may not bur- den me with Turkish maidens.'
ulcl | 'You Cant Teach by Correspondence'
84ys | I HAVE before me a packet of dehydrated onions.
1mjq | Let these dried onions stand for something which has been written down. They are neither the original experience (the onion) nor are they nothing at all. They possess a virtuality.
rplz | Add hot water, and this is absorbed by your dried material. After a few minutes, we have something which we know to have been dried onions, but which is not now the same. What we now have is 'reconstituted onion'.
27ge | We do not have whole onions, it is true. Neither do we have fresh onions. But we have something which will enable us to recognise fresh onions when we see and taste them. This is an advance upon dried onions.
jgcj | The original experience was fresh onions. The water was the addition made by the right circumstances of study. The result is edible, and this is a suitable substitute for fresh onions. It contains some nutrition, too.
