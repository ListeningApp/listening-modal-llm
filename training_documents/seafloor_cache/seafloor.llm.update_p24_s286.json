        "content": "lf1t | Method abbreviations refer to laboratory methods used by ActLabs: One G equals aqua regia Hg cold vapor flow injection technique, CS equals total sulfur by IR, FUS equals fusion, TD equals total digestion; ICP equals inductively coupled plasma, INAA equals instrumental neutron activation analysis, MS equals mass spectrometry. Mineral abbreviations: B-A equals basaltic-andesite, Cham equals chamosite, Corr equals corrensite, I/S equals illite/smectite, Mnt equals montmorillonite, Non equals nontronite, Pl equals plagioclase, Py equals pyrite.\ntze7 | In the original data, several analyses of Cu and Zn that were over limits were reanalyzed with a different method; averages shown here include both the TD-ICP and four acid ICP-OES data.\nryvv | MINERALIZATION AND ALTERATION OF THE TINAKULA SMS DEPOSIT\nzdrh | The enrichment factor (EF). The reconstructed composition (RC) of the altered sample was calculated for each element by multiplying its concentration in the altered sample (normalized to one hundred percent volatile free) by the EF. Finally, the mass change for each element in the sample was calculated by subtracting the precursor concentration of that element in the least altered sample from the RC. The largest mass changes are associated with moderate to intense alteration, generally increasing with depth. Mass changes for each assemblage are outlined below:\nosmo | Two. Nontronite plus corrensite alteration is associated with Si, Ca, and Na losses, Mg gains, no losses of Al or Fe (either conserved or gained), and no change in K.\n0b8v | Three. Illite/smectite plus pyrite alteration is associated with losses in Si, Mg, Na, and Ca and gains in both Fe (due to pyrite) and K.\nfucs | Four. Illite/smectite plus chamosite alteration is associated with Si and Na losses, K gains, and variable gains and losses in Fe and Mg (Mg losses where illite/smectite is more abundant than chamosite; Fe losses where illite/smectite and chamosite are equally abundant).\nyply | Five. Chamosite plus corrensite alteration is associated with Si and Na losses, Mg gains, Fe gains when chamosite is more abundant than corrensite and Fe losses when corrensite is more abundant, K gains when minor illite/smectite is\n75n5 | One. Montmorillonite/nontronite alteration is associated with Si and Na losses in smectite-rich samples, Ca loss in all samples, no gains in Al or Fe (either conserved or lost), and no change in K.\nec91 | A\nwul6 | Notes: G equals gain, L equals loss, zero equals no change.\n4rhy | MINERALIZATION AND ALTERATION OF THE TINAKULA SMS DEPOSIT\n092d | present, and no changes in K where no illite/smectite is present.\n94ul | Mass dilution effects caused by anhydrite and pyrite precipitation were partially mitigated through handpicking of individual altered clasts, avoiding veins and cement/infill. Despite this procedure, not all of these materials could be omitted, thus contributing CaO, Fe-two-O-three, and S, and accounting for some apparent loss of SiO-two. The main difference between the low-temperature alteration stage (dominated by illite/smectite plus pyrite) and the higher-temperature alteration stage (dominated by chamosite plus corrensite) is the mass change of MgO (higher in chamosite) and K-two-O (higher in illite/smectite), typical of VMS-style alteration in permeable volcaniclastic rocks.\n0vdu | Conditions of Alteration and Mineralization\na230 | The high permeability of the volcanic substrate at Tinakula has had a large impact on the composition, size, and morphology\ndvoe | of the seafloor mineralization and subseafloor alteration. The conditions of alteration and mineralization have been constrained in this study by fluid inclusion microthermometry, stable isotope data, and dating of the hydrothermal barite.\n677t | Fluid inclusion microthermometry\n5hk6 | Fluid inclusions were investigated in five samples of hydrothermally altered volcaniclastic rocks recovered in drill hole TKAD zero zero one between fourteen point eight and nineteen point three meters below seafloor. Details of the petrography and microthermometry are provided in Appendix Table A four. Fluid inclusions occur in three distinct paragenetic stages: early anhydrite in veins and rimming altered volcanic clasts, sphalerite at the margins of the early anhydrite veins in the deepest samples, and later infills of anhydrite and barite.\nviei | Primary and secondary inclusions in large (up to one point four millimeters), tabular anhydrite crystals are generally ten to twenty micrometers, reaching maximum diameters of sixty micrometers. All inclusions\nrk0j | are liquid dominated with one to ten volume percent vapor.\nc6x9 | Fractionation factors after Sheppard and Gilg, nineteen ninety-six; Savin and Lee, nineteen eighty-eight; and Buatier et al., nineteen ninety-five; initial and calculated for equilibrium temperature of two hundred forty degrees Celsius; hydrogen fractionation factor for chlorite-water after Marumo et al., nineteen eighty.\ng5at | Large crystals of barite (up to one millimeter), after anhydrite, contain mostly secondary inclusions, between four and forty micrometers in size and with a maximum of ten volume percent vapor. The inclusions in sphalerite (after anhydrite) include both pri-\nre3j | mary liquid-vapor inclusions up to fifty micrometers in diameter with\n6z45 | five to thirty volume percent vapor and groups of smaller sec-\n20af | ondary inclusions (less than ten micrometers) distributed along healed cracks. Two inclusions in sphalerite contained a dark solid\nhuae | phase (three to five volume percent) with a tabular habit, likely a sulfide mineral.\nrblh | Estimated trapping temperatures of primary fluid inclu-\ngl5i | sions in anhydrite reach two hundred ninety-five degrees Celsius with salinities close to that of\nx0yg | seawater (two point eight to three point eight weight percent NaCl equivalent). Inclusions in barite have\nmjt8 | slightly lower trapping temperatures (median two hundred eighteen degrees Celsius) with a\nhtcn | bimodal distribution from two hundred two degrees to two hundred twenty degrees Celsius and two hundred fifty-six degrees to two hundred sixty-six degrees Celsius\n86d4 | and salinities from two point eight to three point four weight percent NaCl equivalent. However, it is known that barite can stretch during\n6t1g | heating, so these homogenization temperatures may be biased toward higher values. Trap-\nm50n | ping temperatures of primary fluid inclusions in sphalerite are up to two hundred ninety-eight degrees Celsius with salinities of two point six to four point five weight percent NaCl\neztf | equivalent.\nbwsu | The highest inclusion trapping temperatures are only approximately ten degrees",
