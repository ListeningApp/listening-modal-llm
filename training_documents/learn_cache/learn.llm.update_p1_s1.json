We often act as if learning is a simple process of remembering ideas and information, but it isn't that easy. Even if we toss understanding into the mix, we still haven't captured the complex undertaking involved in human learning. While the bold research on the brain and its function has offered fresh insights, even that mechanical exploration hasn't fully captured what it means to learn deeply. For more than a century, people have pieced together insight into what takes place. Let's take a quick tour through some of the most important discoveries. In that excursion we will begin to understand the nature and power of the Super Courses that are transforming higher education and are even reshaping some corners of secondary and elementary schools.\nqrvy | Let's start with how our learning begins. When we are born, light, sound, touch, smell, and taste bombard our senses. They are our only contact with the outside world. We take that input and try to understand it, noticing patterns and building mental models of reality in the process. We then use those resulting models to understand any new sensory stimulations that come along later.\npn9j | Someone walks into a room, for example, and an electromagnetic field called light tickles the retina of that person's eyes. We label that sensation \"seeing,\" but it isn't the electromagnetic field alone that informs. Rather the individual takes the sensory input and wraps it around some already existing models and understands the room in terms of\n1pmc | those frameworks constructed years ago. The person already has a concept of tables and chairs, rugs and walls long before the light zings the eyeballs. Students hear a lecture or read a book and interpret the sounds and sights with some existing paradigm, comparing and contrasting the new information with what they already \"know.\" The memories that humans hold shape what they see, hear, and learn.\n5z6q | Thus, we understand the present in terms of some earlier experience, and that ability and habit serves us well. We can go somewhere we've never been and still make sense of the place. Otherwise, we'd live like Drew Barrymore's character in Fifty First Dates, always forced to start from scratch with each encounter. But that practice of depending on past experiences also proves to be our greatest challenge as learners and educators. Why? Because we often, especially in deep learning, want our students to build new models of reality, or at least have the capacity to question their existing ones. In the humanities we often say that educated people realize the problems they face in accepting whatever they may believe. Our friends in the sciences will sometimes go further and encourage their students to abandon certain models-say, that the earth is the center of the universe-and form new ones. Either way, we are asking people to do something quite unnatural. Indeed, when Sam Wineburg wrote about the phenomenon in his own field, he called his book Historical Thinking and Other Unnatural Acts. While his discipline asks people to use evidence from the past to understand a former time, many will rely only on the mental models they have constructed about their own world.\nyeoh | By the time students arrive in middle school, high school, and college, they have constructed thousands of models that will have more influence than anything a professor tells them. They may know nothing about a subject, but if they make any attempt to understand it, they will use something already constructed in their brains to do so. They will compare and contrast, looking for analogies and differences.\nb8hf | Even if their current ideas are faulty, however, people find it quite hard to abandon an existing concept and build a new one. We can even become emotionally attached to our mental models, afraid to give them up because the unknown is a little scary and any changes suggest that\nhntf | we didn't do such a hot job in the first place. But those difficulties don't always show up in standard assessments. A story we told in two thousand four, at the beginning of the second chapter of What the Best College Teachers Do, illustrates the point.\n99fo | In the mid nineteen-eighties two physicists at Arizona State University asked this important question. Does my introductory course change the way students understand motion. If it doesn't, you have two possibilities. Either they didn't need to study that material because they already understood it, or the course had failed them.\ny5r7 | To grasp learning in their classes, Ibrahim Abou Halloun and David Hestenes devised an instrument to measure someone's conception of physical motion. They called their invention a Force Concept Inventory and administered it to approximately six hundred students coming into four different sections of an introductory physics course. On the front end, they discovered that most students began their study with what the Arizona professors called a commonsense theory of motion, \"a cross between Aristotelian and fourteenth-century impetus ideas.\" Without going into the physics details, let's just say that if this were the primary way we understood motion today, we wouldn't be able to put a satellite in orbit or even build a highway around a curve without sending cars into a ditch.\nlrry | But that's before students took the course. Once they had done so, Halloun and Hestenes gave them the Force Concept Inventory again to see how much their understanding of motion had changed. Guess what. For the overwhelming majority of students, the shift was small if any. Even people who made high grades in the course often kept their original mental models. When the researchers approached some of the students with additional questions, many of those pupils refused to change their view, argued with the researchers, and engaged in all sorts of mental gymnastics to keep from confronting a challenge to some deeply held paradigms.\nhvhm | Those people had constructed a mental model of motion, using everyday experiences, and they refused to let go. But this attachment to existing paradigms doesn't happen just in physics. It occurs in history and every other field where people study because it is a human habit.\n863b | We will seldom rebuild major concepts unless we face repeated challenges to our current models. Merely telling a class that their existing ideas are wrong will not usually turn the trick. Students must enter a space where their paradigms do not work and care that those models come up short. People can then begin to grapple with those pregnant moments and build new ways of looking at the world. We call those experiences \"model failures.\" In the old days, we just called them \"intellectual challenges,\" but the new term better captures what happens. Our brains anticipate something because of the models they hold, but they get a surprise instead.\nfj24 | It's tough to get humans to pay attention when any paradigm doesn't work because we face too many breakdowns to notice all of them. The model failures must be bold and a little shocking. They should spark concern, but not too much. So the successful learning environments often jolt students just enough to trigger their interest without plunging them into a cycle of worry, despair, anxiety, and depression. That is a delicate matter that makes teaching more like the art of playing the violin than the science of mixing chemicals. The best teachers raise questions that challenge but do not threaten-or, at least, not too much. They intrigue and fascinate, perhaps serving some need to know. Surprise, love, and mystery often fuel the emotions that motivate deep learning and any conceptual shifts.\nuz3c | Many teachers can't raise those good questions, however, because they suffer from what we call the \"expert's curse.\" Think of it this way. As a scholar in your field, you are currently interested in certain questions because you were once intrigued with another inquiry. You took up that previous problem after battling with a still earlier query, and so forth, back up through your own intellectual journey that may have begun when you first asked your parents, \"Why?\"\n```",
