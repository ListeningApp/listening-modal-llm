In English, deviant stress sometimes seems to have no effect at all. Thus, Slowiaczek presented listeners with a sentence context and a stress pattern and asked them to judge a target word for acceptability; she found that the stress pattern information was often ignored, in that listeners responded \"yes\" to words which were semantically acceptable in the context but did not have the target stress pattern.",
