        "content": "axri | Commit to the Niche\niqve | I have a saying when coaching entrepreneurs on picking their target market \"Don't make me niche slap you.\"\no7st | Too often, a newer entrepreneur half-heartedly tries one offer in one market, doesn't make a million dollars, then mistakenly thinks \"this is a bad market.\" Most times that's not actually the case. They just haven't found a Grand Slam Offer yet to apply to that market.\njsfl | They think, I'll switch from helping dentists to helping chiropractors - that's it! When, in reality, both of those are normal markets and represent billions of dollars in revenue. Either would work, just not both. You must pick one. No one can serve two masters.\n0px6 | I have coined the term \"niche slap\" to remind entrepreneurs in my communities to commit once they pick. All businesses and, all markets, have unpleasant characteristics. The grass is never greener once you get to the other side. If you keep hopping from niche to niche, hoping that the market will solve your problems, you deserve to be niche slapped.\n9n3l | You must stick with whatever you pick long enough to have trial and error. You will fail. In fact, you will fail until you succeed. But you will fail far longer if you keep changing who you market to, because you must start over from the beginning each time. So, pick then commit.\n09gz | Riches Are In The Niches\npppg | The other reason to commit to the niche is because of how much more you will make.\nclpf | Simply put, niching down will make you far more money.\nish5 | Author Note - When To Broaden (Advice For Most People)\ngazp | For most, if you are under ten million dollars per year, niching down will make you more money. After that, it will depend on how narrow the niche is, or, what is called TAM (total addressable market). A business can really only grow to meet the total addressable market. That being said, for most people, getting to ten million dollars per year is already a top point four percent achievement (only one in two hundred fifty businesses achieve this). So for ninety-nine point six percent of readers below ten million dollars per year, it's almost always easier to serve fewer clients more narrowly. But if you want to go beyond that, you may (depending on the size of your TAM) have to broaden your audience by going up market, down market, or into an adjacent market where your existing services can provide value.\nospq | For context, many companies expanded to thirty million dollars plus per year serving a single niche: Chiropractors, Gyms, Plumbers, Solar, Roofers, Salon Owners, etc. If you are at one million dollars or three million dollars, thinking you have capped and must expand, you are wrong. You just need to be better.\nl6fu | When I truly grasped how much more profit I was leaving on the table, it changed my life. It was what took me from doing acquisition for anyone to teaching it to a specific avatar. In my instance, I decided on a microgym owner with one hundred members, a signed lease, at least one employee, and wanted to help clients lose weight. That's pretty specific compared to \"small business owners\" or \"anyone who will pay me\" which is common. And I was very specific. In that business (Gym Launch) - we turned down - and still do - anyone who is not that avatar. That means no personal trainers, no online coaches, etc.\n031c | Could I have helped them? Of course I could have. I mean heck, the majority of our portfolio is comprised of non-gym companies. But in order to maintain product focus, and high converting messaging, knowing exactly who the product was for was a game changer.\ngrg5 | It helped us know exactly who we were speaking to at all times. And exactly whose problems we were solving.\n0n4f | But simplicity and ease may not be enough to sway you, so let me illustrate why honing in on one niche will make you more money.\nwbhc | Reason: you can literally charge one hundred times more for the exact same product. Dan Kennedy was the first person to illustrate this for me, and I will do my best to pass on the torch to you in these pages.\nkqsp | Niching Product Pricing Example: Example\nhone | Dan Kennedy taught me this (and it changed my life forever). Let's say you sold a generic course on Time Management. Unless you were some massive time management guru with a compelling or unique story, it would be unlikely it would turn into anything significant. What do you think \"yet another\" time management course is valued at? nineteen dollars, twenty-nine dollars? Sure. Nothing to write home about. Let's just say nineteen dollars for illustration sake.\nsngr | ** Now we shall unleash the power of niche pricing in various stages on your product*\nojot | So let's imagine you make the product more specific, keeping the same principles, and call it \"Time Management For Sales Professionals.\" All of a sudden, this course is for a more specific type of person. We could tie their increase to even one more sale or one more deal and it would be worth more. But there are a lot of sales people. So this might be a ninety-nine dollar product. Neat, but we can do better.\nrg5s | So let's go down another level of niching and call our product .... \"Time Management for B2B Outbound Sales Reps.\" Following the same principles of specificity, now we know our sales people probably have very experienced deals and commissions. A single sale would easily net this salesman five hundred dollars (or more), so it would be easy to justify a four hundred ninety-nine dollar price tag. This is already a twenty-five times increase in price for almost an identical product. I could stop here, but I'm going to go one step further.\nyppk | Let's just niche down one last level .... \"Time Management for B2B Outbound Power Tools and Gardening Sales Reps.\" Boom.\net9b | Think about it for a second, if you were a power tools outbound sales rep, you would think to yourself \"This is made exactly for me\" and would happily fork over maybe one thousand dollars to two thousand dollars for a time management program that could help you achieve your goal.\n1svs | The actual pieces of the program may be the same as the generic nineteen dollar course, but since they have been applied, and the sales messaging could speak so much to this avatar, they will find it more compelling and get more value from it in a real way. This concept applies to anything you decide to do. You want to be 'the guy' who services 'this type of person' or solves 'this type of problem.' And even more niched 'I solve this type of problem for this specific type of person in this unique counter-intuitive way that reverses their deepest fear.\"\nizqt | That's why a fitness program for generic weight loss might be priced at only nineteen dollars while a fitness program designed and marketed only to shift nurses might be priced at one thousand nine hundred ninety-seven dollars .... (even though the core of the program is likely similar - eat less, move more).\nvub1 | End Result: The market matters. Your niche matters. And if you can sell the same product for one hundred times the price, should you?\nzfhy | I'll let you decide.\np9bw | Summary Points\n2l8i | The purpose of this chapter is to reinforce two things. First, don't pick a bad market. Normal markets are fine. Great markets are great. Second, once you pick, commit to it until you figure it out.\nlocx | If you try one hundred offers, I promise you will succeed. Most people never try anything. Others fail once, then give up. It takes resilience to succeed. Stop personalizing! It's not about you! If your offer doesn't work, it doesn't mean you suck. It means your offer sucks. Big difference. You only suck if you stop trying. So, try again. You'll never become world class if you stop after a failed attempt.",
