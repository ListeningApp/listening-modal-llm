        "content": "9vl6 | The isotopic composition of the sulfate minerals records predominantly seawater sulfate in pore spaces of the volcaniclastic rocks. Sulfide values are generally close to mid-ocean ridge basalt values but lower than those of typical arc lavas. This pattern may result from degassing of magmatic volatiles, which can produce hydrogen sulfide with low delta thirty-four S values from the disproportionation of sulfur dioxide. However, there is no evidence at Tinakula of significant volatile contributions that elsewhere produce advanced argillic alteration and very light sulfide sulfur with negative delta thirty-four S values and no evidence of bacterial sulfate reduction that would also produce negative delta thirty-four S values.\nc2fd | Timing of alteration and mineralization\njzvp | Results of radium two hundred twenty-six barite dating of hydrothermal barite are shown in Table seven and Figure twenty-four. The calculated ages indicate that hydrothermal venting has been ongoing for at least five thousand six hundred Â± two hundred forty years. Approximately sixty percent of the data yield ages between seven hundred ninety-two and two thousand three hundred sixty-nine years. Although there is no obvious spatial variation in the ages, the two oldest samples (greater than four thousand years, MA thirteen zero eleven and MA thirteen zero thirty) were collected from drill core, whereas younger samples were collected primarily from chimneys. Drilling at site D intersected two discrete oxidized intervals that are interpreted as paleoseafloor horizons. The upper paleoseafloor horizon displays lateral continuity over approximately twenty meters east-west and approximately twenty-five meters north-south, but the lower horizon was not recovered in drill hole TKAD zero thirty.\nf71y | MINERALIZATION AND ALTERATION OF THE TINAKULA SMS DEPOSIT\n31e1 | system appears to be in a waning phase of hydrothermal activity, with widespread late-stage precipitation of low-temperature amorphous silica and iron and manganese oxyhydroxides.\n40ry | Discussion and Conclusions\nd1j2 | Drilling of the Tinakula deposits has revealed widespread hydrothermal alteration within approximately ten meters of the seafloor in the highly permeable volcaniclastic substrate. The alteration assemblages reported here are consistent with a near-neutral or slightly acidic pH.

Variations in delta thirty-four S (V-CDT) values in minerals from chimneys at the Tinakula deposit: (A) chalcopyrite, (B) pyrite, (C) sphalerite (dark and light), and (D) anhydrite, gypsum, and barite. Rock types are shown on left. Composition of mid-ocean ridge basalt sulfur (delta thirty-four S equals negative zero point nine to negative zero point six - Labidi et al., two thousand twelve, two thousand fourteen), island-arc andesite sulfur (delta thirty-four S equals six point zero zero nine - Alt et al., nineteen ninety-three), and seawater sulfate (delta thirty-four S equals twenty-one point two four - Tostevin et al., two thousand fourteen) are shown by dashed lines.
