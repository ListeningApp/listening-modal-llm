You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

m4ju | Jimmy Page and his bandmates were not alone in rejecting whatever pigeonhole they were consigned to. Most rock musicians at some point have complained about industry or critical simplifications of their work, a protest which usually tends to enforce their reputations all the more. "You cannot classify anything," Plant avowed to Chuck Klosterman. "Classification is a killer." Most artists in any medium, indeed, will resist being slotted into some or other stereotype, saying that their work is only their self-expression and that any generalization will miss the personal subtleties they try to impart to it; yet the defense of artistic freedom on the part of the creator is about as predictable as the inclination to format and sort on the part of the spectator or listener. As Led Zeppelin's players sought to demonstrate that they had more to offer than the one-dimensional boogie of Grand Funk-Led Zeppelin III was an early example of this-professional and

km8w | The Zeppelin-as-heavy-metal controversy says more about the rapid evo- lution of rock 'n' roll aesthetics over twenty or thirty years than any objective parameters of what the music itself sounds like. Critic Chuck Eddy's Stairway to Hell compendium goes so far as to include Miles Davis's Live Evil as one of "The 500 Best Heavy Metal Albums in the Universe," in with records by Metallica, Guns N' Roses, and, inescapably, Led Zeppelin. The origins of the genre are usually traced back to the Steppenwolf song "Born to Be Wild" (1968), with its celebration of "heavy metal thunder," although other histories document the influences of Iron Butterfly, Vanilla Fudge, Cream, the Who, Jimi Hendrix, the Yardbirds, and the pioneering distorted guitar chords heard in the Kinks' "You Really Got Me" and "All Day and All of the Night" (both 1964). The very loud and sometimes deliberately primitive "acid rock" of the late 1960s, including the work of Blue Cheer, the Stooges, and the MC5 (Motor City 5), is also factored into some accounts. Of all the names linked to heavy metal's inception, it's notable that session man Jimmy Page played for two (the Kinks and the Who), was an official member of one (the Yardbirds), and that Led Zeppelin shared bills with two more (Iron Butterfly and Vanilla Fudge). Categorizing any music as heavy metal was perhaps no more than a convenient shorthand for fans and writers facing an expansive range of young people's pop music from 1965 onward-a way. to distinguish it from the sophisticated harmonies of the Beatles and the Beach Boys, the acoustic introspections of Bob Dylan and Donovan, the soulful grooves of James Brown and Marvin Gaye, the ebullient melodicism of the Supremes and the Four Tops, the country-flavored craft of Creedence Clearwater Revival and the Band, or the bubblegum confections of the Archies, the Monkees, or the Ohio Express.
wzno | The common denominators of heavy metal are distorted electric gui- tars, keening vocals, and a powerful rhythmic base, which would certainly encompass the typical Led Zeppelin tune. But the popular Zeppelin num- bers "Your Time Is Gonna Come," "Going to California," and "All My Love" can't qualify by these standards. Conversely, the Rolling Stones' "Gimme Shelter" meets the metal criteria, as do David Bowie's "Panic in Detroit"; Stevie Ray Vaughan's "Change It"; Funkadelic's "Mommy, What's a Funkadelic?"; Michael Jackson's "Beat It"; the Ramones' "Blitzkrieg Bop"; and Pantera's "Cemetery Gates." Heavy metal has changed over the decades, too: In 1971, it meant Alice Cooper and Mountain; in 1978 it meant Van Halen and UFO; by 1987 it was Exodus and Megadeth; in 1995 it was Nine Inch Nails and Marilyn Manson; by 2010 it was Converge, Mastodon, and

pxbq | Every Time I Die. Possibly the one constant in heavy metal is that most of its musicians are white males with very long hair.
jfsr | Where Led Zeppelin fits in with any of these, let alone with Motörhead, Kiss, Godflesh, Venom, Judas Priest, or Iron Maiden, is the crucial ques- tion. Each successive generation of heavy metal artists seemed to take one element of a prior group's material and emphasize it, such that every few years someone emerged who looked and sounded like a cartoon version of someone else: louder, darker, faster, and more debased, but no less deriva- tive. Who was Marilyn Manson if not Alice Cooper updated for the 1990s? Who did Guns N' Roses resemble more than a souped-up Aerosmith? In a mid-'70s Rolling Stone essay, Lester Bangs reduced Black Sabbath to a "sub-Zeppelin kozmic behemoth." The point is that, pace Page, Plant, and Jones, every heavy metal band from 1970 onward was consciously or uncon- sciously inspired by the Led Zeppelin of 1969-71. Rock author Charles

lq35 | Shaar Murray has written that Jimmy Page and Zeppelin "professionalized" the hard electric blues timbres explored more haphazardly by Cream or Jimi Hendrix, and if by this he means that Page patented the sonic for- mula for the group's loudest and most propulsive riffs ("Communication Breakdown," "How Many More Times," "Whole Lotta Love," "Heartbreaker," "Immigrant Song," "Black Dog," et al), then there is no question that the patent was copied by a great many performers, among them the certifiably metallic.
3g9w | In today's digitized, atomized music universe, the heavy metal appella- tion is largely obsolete, even after being broken up into subunits like death metal, speed metal, grindcore, and nu-metal. As with the "plagiarist" slur, calling Led Zeppelin a metal group is as indicative of the listener as the listened. To someone raised on the bright, catchy rock songs of the early British Invasion, Led Zeppelin was heavy metal; to a Deadhead, a New Waver, or a spandex-clad headbanger, they were hard rock; to rappers and hip-hoppers they might be an oldies act. Most remaining music retailers today find Led Zeppelin CDs between Lenny Kravitz and John Lennon in the mainstream "Rock / Pop" shelves, while their immediate followers and rivals Black Sabbath go in with Biohazard and Cannibal Corpse in the narrower "metal" aisle. In the family tree of rock genealogy, Led Zeppelin is at the root of several branches. Ultimately, Zeppelin began to transcend their characterization as a mere metal band only a few years into their active career and to an even greater degree thereafter, when critics and fans were forced to admit that their legacy had forever pervaded the whole field of rock 'n' roll.
d09o | Mama, Let Me Pump Your Gas: Led Zeppelin as Cock Rock
ylhz | One of the more heated Led Zeppelin debates stems from their lyrical and visual representations of male and female identities. The term cock rock emerged out of the feminist movement in the 1970s, as progressive and newly politicized women (and men) began to question the traditional gender roles portrayed everywhere from classic novels and paintings to television and pop music. During the Rolling Stones' 1972 North American tour, handmade flyers decrying the Stones' swaggering masculinity were distributed among concertgoers, as covered by writer Terry Southern: "If you are male," the broadsheets read, "this concert is yours. . . . The Stones are tough men-hard and powerful. They're the kind of men we're sup- posed to imitate, never crying, always strong, keeping women in their place (under our thumbs). In Vietnam, to save honor (which means preserving our manhood), our brothers have killed and raped millions of people in

ex5k | the name of this ideal. . . . We resent the image the Stones present to males as examples we should imitate. .. . " In 1978, British critics Simon Frith and Angela McRobbie's article "Rock and Sexuality" was published in the book On Record: Rock, Pop and the Written Word, where they named Mick Jagger, the Who's Roger Daltrey, and Zeppelin's Robert Plant as prime exponents of the style: "Cock rock performers are aggressive, dominating, and boastful, and they constantly seek to remind the audience of their prowess, their con- trol. .. . In these performances mikes and guitars are phallic symbols; the music is loud, rhythmically insistent, built around techniques of arousal and climax; the lyrics are assertive and arrogant, though the exact words are less significant than the vocal styles involved, the shouting and the screaming."
9d4o | As much as they embodied personas as long-haired, dope-smoking out- laws, male rock stars of the 1960s and 1970s were no advocates of Women's Liberation, and the cock rock charge was an important corrective to their supposedly "revolutionary" values. Many Led Zeppelin songs-"Dazed and Confused," "Your Time Is Gonna Come," "How Many More Times," "Heartbreaker," "Living Loving Maid (She's Just a Woman)," "The Lemon Song," "Since I've Been Loving You," "Black Dog," "Custard Pie," "Trampled Underfoot," and others-depict women as crudely and as chauvinistically as any leering hard-hat or patronizing business executive of the same time. Likewise, the sexual or martial boasting of "Good Times Bad Times," "Whole Lotta Love," "Ramble On," "Immigrant Song," and "No Quarter" cast the singer and his ensemble as conquering, untamable bad boys never to be tied down by any domestic conventions. Add to these the live perfor- mances of the band, their amplifiers cranked, their shirts open, and their pants bulging, and Led Zeppelin does seem like a prime example of cock rock at its hardest, loudest, and most offensive.
cjq2 | There are several reasons, if not excuses, for Zeppelin's macho exaggera- tions. Given that the band was an all-male act of individuals in their early to mid-twenties, of course there was bound to be a surfeit of testosterone flowing around onstage and in the studio. Many of their songs were taken directly or indirectly from blues or blues-rock antecedents, and the blues was rife with blaring declamations of male dominance and sexual power, Bo Diddley's "I'm a Man," Howlin' Wolf's "Back Door Man," B. B. King's "Ain't Nobody Home," Jimi Hendrix's "Stone Free," and Robert Johnson's "Traveling Riverside Blues" being only the most memorable examples. This posture itself was something of a façade, a way for otherwise poor and disenfranchised men to assert their authority over anyone at all, their wives and lovers often being the closest people they could turn to for validation. Blues-based music could reverse the received structures of male-female relationships, as it became the men who could sing of being done wrong by

byu8 | a cheating partner (e.g., "Your Time Is Gonna Come," "Black Dog"), or of being hopelessly, romantically in love with a woman who rejects their affec- tion ("Dazed and Confused," "The Lemon Song"), an appealing pretense for rock stars who were themselves usually doing the cheating and rejecting. In time the bluesy brag would degenerate into the bathroom-wall dreck of Bon Jovi's "You Give Love a Bad Name," Motley Crue's "Looks That Kill," and AC/DC's "Let Me Put My Love into You."
76b0 | The stark truth is that Led Zeppelin's cock rock-and that of most other rock 'n' roll bands of the period-was borne of the musicians' experiences in the real world of touring and giving shows. Male entertainers have always held special attractiveness to female followers, and the uninhibited years of the sexual revolution allowed them to take Dionysian advantage of this. Nubile young women came to their concerts, worked their way backstage, and convened at their hotels and barrooms; by Jimmy Page and Robert Plant especially, their attentions were taken for granted. Lyrics like those of "Living Loving Maid (She's Just a Woman)," though not deeply thought out, were accurate reflections of the players' feelings toward their most devoted admirers-the girls were at best disposable and at worst nuisances. Page's much-repeated remarks to journalist Ellen Sander in 1969 ("Girls come around and pose like starlets, teasing and acting haughty. . . . I haven't got time to deal with it") were, for better or worse, his summary of casual sex as an occupational hazard rather than an emotional commitment or personal responsibility. His approving reference to Aleister Crowley ("Crowley didn't have a very high opinion of women and I don't think he was wrong") is scarcely more sensitive. Writer and Zeppelin supporter Cameron Crowe, describing the real-life milieu that inspired his 2000 film Almost Famous, remembered how the 1970s rock 'n' rollers he covered regarded their female followers as "trinkets," and Bebe Buell, who had a fling with Page in 1974, overheard the guitarist say of her to Plant and Peter Grant, "She's not a coke whore," which other women around them presumably were. With such disdainful if not misogynistic impressions, it was inevitable that a jaded, imperial arrogance would seep into Led Zeppelin's music.
zxz6 | What the cock rock indictment significantly overlooks is that many women were Zeppelin fans, found the male musicians attractive, and responded to the sexual overtones of the songs as much as any boy or man buying the records or attending the concerts. Though Led Zeppelin had never been a teenybopper act of winsome youngsters like their contempo- raries the Osmonds or the Bay City Rollers, teenyboppers had older sisters and in time grew up themselves, and chaste fantasies of doe-eyed Donny or Woody evolved into more explicit ones of sweaty Robert or mysterious

vafm | Jimmy. Cock rock worked both ways: the performers expressed it (Mick Jagger rode an inflatable oversize phallus during the Rolling Stones' 1975 US tour), and both sexes in the audience encouraged it. Though there were probably many women put off by Led Zeppelin's overt machismo and crushing rhythms, preferring the sensitive tones of a James Taylor or a Van Morrison, or instead identifying with the lyrics of a Joni Mitchell or a Carole King, there were still plenty happy to find in Zeppelin a larger-than-life eroticism the musicians could not help but convey. For a term intended as a rebuke, Zeppelin's "cock rock" was sometimes exactly what listeners wanted to see and hear.
