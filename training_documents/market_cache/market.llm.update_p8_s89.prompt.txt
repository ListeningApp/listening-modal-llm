You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.

This generated an overall database of some 1790 records, with data stretching over some 17 years from 1972 to 1999. However, although the infor- mation dates as far back as the earliest pur- chases in the 1970s and includes records up to the late 1990s, in fact most people bought lots during the 1980s (see Table 1). The database includes information for all 15 of the sub-divisions included in the CRG pro- gramme, from which data for the following variables were extracted: the sub-division name; the purchase date (year); the price paid; from whom it was bought; and, whether or not the lot was sold with or
6d4s | without a Deed (a Contract for Deed usu- ally). As well as analysing the general trend for all records, we were also able to disaggre- gate data for a number of specific colonias- 4 of which had a good sample size (Table 2). These 4 colonias represent 64 per cent of all records in our usable CRG database.
mqah | Our first task in the analysis was to con- vert all data from nominal prices (i.e. unad- justed for inflation) into constant land prices using standard deflators.4 Due to occasional flaws detected in the CRG records, after cross-checking we omitted any case where there was uncertainty, or where there was missing information. This reduced the total number of cases from the original 1790 to a 'working database' comprising 1406 records that are shown in Table 1. These data are used to undertake the first phase of our land price analysis and, compared with other simi-
xxr8 | lar surveys, they represent a relatively large data-set (Jones and Ward, 1994; Ward et al. 2000). Not only is it relatively large, but we are confident that the information had been consistently and accurately collected and recorded.
rl4j | Real land prices were computed for each lot but, because lot size sometimes varied, it was important to calculate in unit-price terms, as the real cost per square foot. Al- though most people recalled how much they had paid, or the deal that was struck at the outset, there was less certainty about the exact size of their lots, so in each case this was cross-checked with the data at the CRG office which were based upon plat infor- mation and were known to be accurate. Also, in Starr County, we were greatly helped by the fact that most of the lots sold were of a uniform size-50 ×100 sq ft-which is small by colonia standards in Texas. This largely obviated any possible inaccuracies by having to rely solely upon the size as re- ported by respondent. Thus, from both the questionnaire survey and the CRG database, we had the nominal and real price paid for the lot, and the same for unit prices per square foot, all matched to the year of pur- chase. These form the basis for the following graphs. Moreover, in aggregate data presen- tations, wherever possible the 'trimmed' mean value was adopted since this automati- cally excludes the outliers that would distort the average and mislead the analysis.5 Thus, the median and trimmed mean values offer the most accurate picture of lot prices in any single year.
vz32 | Occasionally, nominal price data on lot prices were taken directly from the CRG
ncb0 | database (as were lot-size data since these were always more accurate than the self-esti- mates offered by respondents). The CRG data were checked against that provided by survey respondents in order to gauge accu- racy and consistency of the survey data and they proved a reasonably close match-es- pecially the medians-although the average lot price in the survey was almost $300 higher. Upon further investigation, it tran- spired that this was because some respon- dents had, in fact, purchased two adjacent lots, but considered the purchase as a single (larger) lot. Where this was known to be the case, the survey data were recalculated in order to reflect a single lot price, but just in case we have not caught all of those cases we occasionally prefer to use the median value (as in Table 3). Generally, though, we are comfortable using the survey data and we are confident that they are sufficiently accurate to warrant further analysis.
8mp0 | One assumption that we do make here is that, at the time of purchase, these were unimproved parcels of land-i.e. they did not have any dwelling on them. This was almost always the case, even though some lots have been resold (traspasos) and, in these cases, it was possible that they may have included a dwelling structure of some sort (although these would probably be excluded by using the trimmed mean). In addition, we were able to control for two variables in order to ex- clude lot sales that might have contained a dwelling structure: first to focus only upon those cases where the vendor was either Blas Chapa or Elías López since they never sold lots with structures; and, secondly, in the more recent cases that were likely to be
xjyk | traspasos, to exclude regular-sized lot sales costing more than $15 000 in real terms since this price was considerably over the odds and would indicate the presence of a dwelling. (Similarly, we excluded the extremely low reported prices, since these were probably misinformed prices placed on the record by CRG officials in those cases where the per- son had paid very little, or was receiving the lot through the CRG.)
mt0f | Most residents (72 per cent overall) de- clared that they had bought their lot from Blas Chapa and/or from Elías López. This has two important implications for our analy- sis: first, these would have been 'first-hand' buyers, as both men were the original devel- opers of these colonias and did not deal in anything other than unimproved lots; and, secondly, it meant that it was they who had set the asking price-according to their own criteria-rather than these being prices set in the (open) market-place (although one could assume that the two would be closely interre- lated), or by another private third-party indi- vidual. But other studies have shown that it is not uncommon for 'non-market' criteria to enter the equation particularly where the sale is made by a friend or relation of the devel- oper (Ward et al., 1993).
awab | Land Price Trends over Time
ixcc | In our first model of land-price changes over time, we calculated yearly real average land prices per square foot for the whole period covered in the CRG database. The mean and median real sq ft land prices range from 0.475¢ in 1983 to a high point of $1.296 in 1995 (see Table 1).6 Examining the curves in Figure 1, first for vacant lots and secondly for all lots combined, one can see that there is little difference between the two indicators: the same general trend is replicated in each curve. At first sight, 'real' prices appear to have been around the 0.70¢ per sq ft mark in the late 1970s through to 1982, dropping to 0.50¢ and then remaining flat for the remain- der of the decade, before rising steadily from 1991, rising sharply in 1993 through to 1995, and declining thereafter (see Figure 1).
