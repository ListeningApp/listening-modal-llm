        "content": "nv81 | People assume, like the Caliph, that they have something of value and that by giving some of it away they can gain something of even greater value. They tend, too, to offer not what they have to get rid of, but something which they can give because they want to.\npuv2 | Therein lies the genesis of trade, and a desirable thing it is, too - if confined to trade. Therein, too, lies the desire to prescribe one's own studies, one's own path: 'Ask a favour of me', as the Caliph put it.\n4jzq | But, as the Sufis never tire of saying, the Path has its own requirements, and the things which people want to do are likely to be those which will help them to continue in the way in which they are already set, rather than in a direction which will break through their limitations.\nz6ba | Because Sufi affairs do not seem to resemble the kind of organisation of studies familiar to most people, they imagine that they have to be carried out in a completely incoherent manner. It is worth listening to what Aftab-ud-Din Ahmad has to say about this, in his Introduction to a version of Gilani's Fuiuh al-Ghaib:\nqdnn | Sufism as a Science\nibdp | The word \"mysticism\" employed in English for Sufism has an elusive atmosphere about it, whereas tasaamif, Sufism, is a regular science with its set laws and a full scheme in detail. It is based on palpable experiences which can be reproduced, like in any other science, under set circumstances. Every pilgrim has to\nmav3 | pass through the same stages in his spiritual journey and these stages are readily recognizable by their detailed descriptions given unanimously by all masters. The landmarks and pitfalls are described in equally exhaustive particulars. Just as in any other course of study, there are methods in it to test the progress of the disciple and his merit. As in any other branch of knowledge, there are geniuses in this branch of study who create a stir in the world.\nq9zs | Garbled Message\n4ulw | Books and other methods of mass communication are used selectively by Sufi teachers. And there are cases where the message is garbled, so that they do not use certain versions of them at all. Some translations, for instance, contain ludicrous errors, even when made by experts. This sort of garbling can happen with anything, and only a human guide can put things to rights.\ntti1 | The News-Story\n0mm4 | The British Broadcasting Corporation, within hours of the death of King Faisal of Saudi Arabia, put out a recording of a highly emotional account of the assassination taken from the Saudi network. This, you would imagine, must be something on which one could rely. But there was only one problem about the BBC's version: it was in fact the final minute of the Czech language commentary on the Ali-Wepner fight in Cleveland, Ohio. Reading some 'Sufi' materials, they sound the same ...\nhonu | Saintliness\nd6ox | Q: Can you say something about saintliness and Sufi teachers?\n54cz | A: The people who are most anxious about finding, following, refuting or dealing in some way with Sufi teachers tend to be those least able to identify or locate them.\n4mh8 | This is because the searchers are usually looking for obsessional people who cannot help behaving in a way which announces, twenty-four hours a day, I am a spiritual man.\nk8sl | Those who lead ordinary lives, or who lack the trappings, are invisible to the anxious.\nqxma | But the reverse of this opinion is more likely to be the case. Those who signal by manner, impedimenta and otherwise that they are to be regarded as authorities are in fact usually the superficialists.\n8oor | The 'saintly' appearance is one of three things, in all branches of esoteric activity, Sufism included:\nn2qv | One. Imitation by superficialists.\nwf24 | Two. Adopted by indoctrination or obsession.\nfpz9 | Three. Affected as a temporary or superficial measure to signal to those who can perceive only this aspect.\nw61m | The task of the teacher and the student is to get beyond the appearance as soon and as completely as possible.\nkj2q | Service\na1at | It is on this subject that Saadi of Shiraz wrote the poem, in his Bostan, The Orchard:\nvxef | The Path is not other than the service of the people: It is not in the rosary, the prayer-rug and the dervish robe.\nhd01 | What a Saint Is and Does\nqdin | Saintliness, which superficialists identify with what are too often superficial actions and appearance, lies, as Saadi reminds us, in the service of the people. People who seek saintliness are only to be taken seriously if they are also concerned with human service.\n3nby | Saintship, being a saint, as Dr. A. E. Affifi rightly remarks, according to Sufi lore, does not mean holiness or piety, although such characteristics may accidentally be found in a saint. Any man is a saint if he possesses such a degree of gnosis, supreme knowledge, as would enable him to understand his exact relationship to God, Reality, of whom he is but a manifestation, and to realize his essential oneness with the One Reality. In other words, a man is a saint if he is what Ibnul Arabi calls a Perfect Man.\nfb2a | Knowledge and Behaviour\n24ma | Saintship is not in miracles, not in looking devout. The test is in knowledge. People ask: How can knowledge be as good as behaviour and belief? The Sufi answer is that without knowledge there is no certainty that behaviour is right, and no guarantee that belief is real. Real religion and real correct behaviour come through knowing what religion is and knowing what should or should not be done: not in accepting the local cultural norms without experience.\nh4om | Sufis have constantly maintained that knowledge accords with holiness and generally accepted behaviour: but not with the counterfeit of these which are all that mainly exist in the self-deceived good people.\ndviu | Saintliness, if by this we mean appearances, including supposed wonders or the effect which someone has on other people who conclude on this basis that he is a saint, is entirely subjective and cannot be called saintliness at all in the Sufi sense.\njaym | A Dog Has Precedence\n57yj | Bayazid Bistami, walking through the streets with some of his followers, made an occasion to demonstrate the shortcomings of\n4oqq | Sixty-one\n6pb5 | such superficial assessments, as reported in Attar's Musibat-Nama, The Book of Calamity.\nmkpt | A dog was walking towards them, and Bayazid made way for it. One of the disciples thought to himself that this must be wrong: Bayazid was a great saint, accompanied by students, allotted a high status, and a dog was after all only a dog.\nbdm4 | Bayazid perceived this man's feelings and explained.\nm0nn | The dog had seen them coming and had projected the thought to Bayazid that he must be sinful to have been created a dog, while this great man must be saintly because he was able to appear in such a resplendent and honored form.\nnw58 | It was because of this idea of that dog's, said Bayazid, that I gave him precedence.\nqz79 | Secrecy\niq1p | Q: There seems to be no traditional psychology or similar study without a conception of secrets and secrecy. Why is this, and what is the nature of this secrecy?\nyl4z | A: Among the Sufis, the technical term 'secret' is applied to 'the innermost consciousness of man', and may be found authoritatively rendered as such. It is common knowledge among people of traditional spiritual systems that there are differences in the significance and emphasis of the idea of the 'secret', according to the condition of the person involved.\nexkl | Here are some examples:\n1bvo | Stimulation",
