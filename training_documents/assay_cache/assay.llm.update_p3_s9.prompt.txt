You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

sc5y | One respiratory specimen (a minimum of 4ml) and one stool specimen (a minimum of 3gm) were collected per child. Xpert was performed at JUMC Laboratory from respiratory speci- mens as part of the routine practice at the medical center, whereas TB culture and stool Xpert were performed at Jimma University Mycobacterium Research Center (JUMRC) for the research purposes.
0yab | The respiratory samples were collected as per the standard of care. The treating physician collected single gastric aspirate or expectorated sputum. Gastric aspirate samples were col- lected early in the morning through nasogastric tube following an overnight fasting and tested by Xpert and LJ culture. Expectorated sputum instead of gastric aspirate was used in the patients who were able to produce sputum.
w95z | Respiratory specimens were divided into two parts; the first part was diluted (2:1v/v) with Xpert sample reagent, followed by vigorous shaking and incubation at room temperature for 15 minutes. Then, 2ml of liquefied specimen was aspirated using sterile pipette provided with Xpert kit and added to Xpert cartridge and loaded in to the GeneXpert instrument to run the test. The results were reported to the treating physicians as soon as possible for participants' management.

dqlg | The second part of respiratory specimen was neutralized with phosphate buffered solution (PBS) immediately after collection and stored at 4-8 ℃ for 2-3 days until processing for cul- ture. Equal volume of N-acetyl-L-Cysteine and 4% sodium hydroxide solution were added to the 50ml specimen tube. After mixing on the vortex, the sample tube was left standing for 20 minutes at room temperature for liquefaction and decontamination. Then, sterile PBS (pH6.8) was added up to 45ml to neutralize the alkaline solution, followed by centrifugation at 3000g for 15 minutes. After discarding the supernatant, the pellet was re-suspended in 2ml PBS and two drops of the resulting diluted deposit was inoculated on the slants of LJ medium.
p6pq | Stool specimen (approximately 3-5g) was collected in a wide mouthed specimen collection jar on spot or submitted the following day and was stored at -20℃ until processed as described previously [10]. Stool Xpert was performed by single step, centrifuge-free stool processing pro- tocol adapted from KNCV TB foundation [10]. Briefly, 1 g of thawed stool was transferred to 50ml falcon tube using wooden applicator stick; 8ml of sample reagent was poured in the sam- ple tube and mixed very well, and left undisturbed for 20 minutes at room temperature. The supernatant was carefully aspirated and added to Xpert cartridge using sterile pipette.
zse6 | Diagnostic classification for analysis
p2n3 | Children were classified into three categories based on their clinical, radiological, and labora- tory results. (i) "Confirmed TB" :- child has symptoms suggestive of TB and TB disease is con- firmed microbiologically (positive gastric aspirate Xpert and/or culture); (ii) "Unconfirmed TB" :- child has at least 2 of the following: symptoms suggestive of TB, chest radiograph consis- tent with TB, or documented exposure to MTB and positive response to ATT but TB disease is not confirmed microbiologically (negative gastric aspirate Xpert and/or culture); (iii) "Unlikely TB" :- no criteria for "Unconfirmed TB" was met and TB is not confirmed microbio- logically (negative gastric aspirate Xpert and/or culture). CRS is defined as either confirmed TB or unconfirmed TB in the definition of TB and cases that met "unlikely TB" criteria were classified as not TB.
ohh7 | Data analysis
vbni | Data were entered in Epidata version 3.3 and analyzed using SPSS software package version 20. The Xpert sensitivity, specificity, positive, and negative predictive values and their 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were calculated using the following as one of the reference stan- dards: i) LJ culture alone; ii) LJ culture and/or Xpert (confirmed TB); and iii) composite refer- ence standard (CRS) (confirmed TB and Unconfirmed TB). Differences and similarities between the two methods (stool Xpert versus gastric aspirate Xpert) was determined based on the 95%CI. Non-over lapping 95% CIs indicated a difference between the two methods (stool Xpert versus gastric aspirate Xpert) and vice versa.
