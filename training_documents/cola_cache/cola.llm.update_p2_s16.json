The expression level of androgen receptor mRNA was determined using qRT-PCR. The level of every group was assessed by the two-A A C T method and normalized to beta-actin of CG on day zero. Each sample was executed in triplicate.\nwwdt | Western blot analysis of androgen receptor protein in testes\nmn1r | Western blot was performed so as to evaluate the expression levels of androgen receptor protein in testis tissues after Pepsi-Cola and Coca-Cola treatment. Summarily, the polyvinylidene fluoride membranes were incubated with Anti-AR antibody and beta-actin polyclonal antibodies at four degrees Celsius overnight, before being exposed to the appropriate secondary antibody for one hour. Monoclonal antibody of mouse anti-beta-actin was used as a control. The integrated optical densities of image bands were determined using Quantity One software. Expression of AR protein was measured as grey value ratio between target band and beta-actin band. The negative control was set without primary antibody.\n5vqw | Carbonated beverages effects on androgen receptor in mice\nmeyw | Statistical analyses\n2e62 | All variables of three groups complied with the assumptions for a one-way A N O V A using S P S S version twenty point zero. Then, Tukey's post-hoc tests were done to compare pairwise differences after significant differences were identified. Significance level was\n75y3 | The testes weights of PEP-two, COC-one and COC- two were significantly increased on day fifteen as compared to PEP-one and CG. The outcomes demonstrated a high dose of Pepsi-Cola or Coca-Cola could promote testis growth and development.\ns2g2 | Data in Table two showed that TLD values of four experimental groups were elevated as compared to CG on days ten and fifteen. TLDs of COC- two and PEP-two were significantly greater than that of CG. On day fifteen, TTD values of COC- two and PEP- two were also larger than that of CG, COC-one and PEP-one groups. The results indicated that higher doses of Pepsi-Cola and Coca-Cola could enhance the testis longitudinal and transverse diameter, and then they promoted testis growth of mice.\nq1q2 | As shown in Figure one A, the concentrations of serum testosterone in all mice were enhanced after the Pepsi-Cola and Coca-Cola treatment. Serum testosterone\ncb7r | concentration of PEP-two was higher than that of other four groups. On days ten and fifteen, there were significant differences between PEP- two and CG. Serum testosterone concentration of COC- two was also higher than that of CG. The outcomes indicated that high doses of Pepsi-Cola and Coca-Cola could improve testosterone secretion of male mice.\n68xu | Data in Figure one B showed that the serum concentrations of epidermal growth factor of treatment groups were slightly increased as compared to CG on days ten and fifteen. EGF concentrations of PEP- two and COC- two were significantly higher than CG on day fifteen,. The results demonstrated a high dose of Pepsi-Cola and Coca-Cola could raise EGF activity.\nhd35 | Expression levels of AR mRNAs in mouse testes were detected using qRT-PCR so as to assess the effects on AR mRNAs. As shown in Figure two, expressions of AR mRNAs in four treatment groups were increased. On day fifteen, increments of COC-one, COC-two, PEP-one and PEP-two mice were sixty point eighteen percent, sixty-seven point twenty-six percent, sixty-five point ninety-three percent and seventy-eight point seventy-six percent on the bases of the CG level. Pepsi-Cola and Coca-Cola could enhance expressions of AR mRNAs in the testes of mice.\n2zpk | Expression levels of androgen receptor proteins in CBs-treated mice were increased in comparison with CG. On day fifteen, AR proteins levels of PEP-two and COC-two mice were increased as compared to CG. A high concentration of Pepsi-Cola and Coca-Cola could accelerate expressions of AR protein in the testes of mice.\nepu7 | DISCUSSION\n7od1 | Currently, carbonated beverages, are daily consumed by many people worldwide. CBs have been a deleterious key factor along with their consumption increase. The overweight, obesity, diabetes and endocrine disorders are associated with massive consumption of CBs. CBs harmfully affect reproduction functions. A survey of twenty-five hundred men indicated that the sperms\n0bqy | quantity was reduced by thirty percent after men drank one liter cola beverage every day as compared to those without drinking any carbonated soft drink. The oxidants and additives in CBs result in proteins oxidation, cell damages and reduce sperm motility.\nb780 | In our study, we found that testes masses of PEP- two, COC- one and COC- two groups were increased in comparison with PEP- one and CG on day fifteen. The testes longitudinal and transverse diameters become larger as compared to CG. Our initial experiments demonstrated that Pepsi-Cola and Coca-Cola could reduce ovarian weight, inhibited the development of follicles and oocytes. Pepsi-Cola and Coca-Cola obviously reduced pregnancy rate and fetus numbers of female mice, such affected reproduction behaviors\nccmb | of female mice. Our results revealed serum EGF contents of COC-two and PEP-two were higher than that of CG. These findings demonstrated high doses of Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola could enhance EGF activity and testosterone secretion. These are in agreement with our previous study in rabbits. However, the effects have to be deeply studied. Its mechanisms also have to be further explained in other mammals in the future.\nma93 | Androgen and its receptor affect the development of normal prostate and prostate cancer. In the present study, we investigated the effects of Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola on androgen receptor expression levels in the mouse testes. The findings indicated AR mRNA and protein levels of the CBs- treated mice were strikingly increased when compared\n```",
