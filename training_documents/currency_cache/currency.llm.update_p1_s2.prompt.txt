You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

vp1d | LOCAL CURRENCY: POLICY BARRIERS AND SUPPORT
r8to | Abstract
wajy | Local currency holds promise for relieving poverty while enhancing social capital and helping communities meet goals. In spite of this, governmental policies have created barriers to its full success. This paper examines local currency from a community development perspective, reviews the policy environment in the United States, and identifies policy changes that can support local currencies. Four major types of local currency-proxy, fiat, local exchange trading systems, and time banks-are described. Federal policy barriers in the U.S. Constitution, statutes, and tax regulations as well as state prohibitions to local currency are examined.
ao6z | Introduction
q0m5 | Throughout American history, local communities have promoted the wellbeing of their members by developing and utilizing economic, social, environmental, and human capital (Hallsmith & Lietaer, 2011). Local governments and community-based organizations engage in community development to provide economic opportunities, safe environments, education, and social support (Fisher, 2005; Preston, 1991; Vargas-Hernández & Noruzi, 2010). Two important community development approaches are people-centered and bottom-up (Kang, 2011). People- centered community development emphasizes local control and self-efficacy. Bottom-up community development arises from the citizens and is based on local resources and perspectives. These approaches allow communities to tailor initiatives to their visions and values.
yhdc | In impoverished locales, one of the major challenges of community development is the lack of financial resources (Community Development Foundation, 2010; Weyers & van den Berg, 2006). To the frustration of concerned citizens, there may be resources available in the community-underemployed individuals with available time, vacant lots that could become

61c4 | community gardens, yoga classes with room for more students-yet there is not enough money to engage this capacity (Eisenstein, 2011; Hallsmith & Lietaer, 2011). Vacant lots stay vacant, classes stand empty, and human potential remains underutilized. A study of community development corporations (CDCs) in Detroit, Michigan, (Silverman, 2003) found they faced difficulty funding their initiatives. Many of the CDCs reported that available grant funding did not match the true needs of their communities. Instead, the CDCs molded their missions to meet funders' visions; this "top-down nature of the grant process" (p. 2743) precluded CDCs from setting their own community-based agendas, impeding people-centered and bottom-up approaches to community development.
kesh | Since 2011, federal funding for many community programs such as tutoring, job training, education, and meals for elderly citizens has been cut (Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013; Budget Control Act of 2011; Liberto, 2013; Matthews, 2013). The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development reduced spending on Community Development Block Grants, which are designed to encourage citizen participation and improve low- to moderate-income communities, from $4.45 billion in 2010 to $2.798 in 2014 (U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, n.d.). Even public libraries are experiencing lean times, requiring cuts to collections, staff, and hours of operation (Hoffman, Bertot & Davis, 2012). Though much of the funding for social services still originates from the federal government, increased responsibility is being placed in the hands of local communities. However, smaller geographies are often at the mercy on the national and global economy and have limited influence on their own economic wellbeing (Eisenstein, 2011; Hallsmith & Lietaer, 2011).
d8t0 | A people-centered, bottom-up tool that has the potential to give local communities more control over their development efforts is local currency (Hallsmith & Lietaer, 2011). Described

eeeo | in detail below, local currency can take a variety of forms and operates in conjunction with the national currency. Local currencies have existed in the United States since colonial times (Solomon, 1996b) and recent decades have seen a resurgence in their use. In 1991, the Ithaca HOURS printed currency was introduced in Ithaca, NY (Raddon, 2003). Since then, over 200 local currency systems have started in the United States (Collom, 2011). Though touted as way to reduce poverty and empower individuals and communities, local currencies are often inhibited from fully flourishing by governmental policies. This paper examines local currencies from a community development perspective, reviews the policy environment in the United States, and identifies policy changes that can support local currencies and their promise for community development and poverty reduction.
qukw | Local Currency as a Community Development Tool
0hrs | Local currencies are a form of complementary currency that operate in conjunction with national legal tender and are not intended to supplant it, but to complement it. From airline mileage points (Hallsmith & Lietaer, 2011) to the online currency Bitcoin (Nakamoto, 2008), complementary currencies facilitate the exchange of goods or services. Local currencies are a specialized type designed as a public good in geographic areas to help promote community goals for cultural, human, social, and economic capital and infrastructure (Hallsmith & Lietaer, 2011).
r8pf | Like community gardens and alternative financing, local currency is a part of a re- localization movement and aspires "to increase exchange activity at the local level and support all of the positive cultural and social outcomes of greater local employment, mutual self-help and cooperation" (Raddon, 2003, p. 43). Local currencies are crafted to reflect the unique characteristics of a community because backing a currency with local goods or services promotes those products. For example, a community currency in Philadelphia bases its currency creation

yc87 | The literature indicates that local currency helps develop social and human capital (Hallsmith & Lietaer, 2011; Williams, 1997). Local currency has been shown to build relationships and increase social support (Graugaard, 2012; Jacob, Brinkerhoff, Jovic, & Wheatley, 2004; Nakazato & Hiramoto, 2012), increase community pride (Graugaard, 2012; Jacob et al., 2004; Raddon, 2003), help people develop new skills (Jacob et al., 2004), and enhance personal growth, wellbeing, and mental health (Graugaard, 2012; Lasker et al, 2011; Letcher & Perlow, 2009; Richey, 2007). Promoters of local currencies also see them as a way to improve economic conditions and resiliency, support community values, empower communities and citizens to meet specialized as well as basic needs, and assist economically marginalized citizens (Collom, 2005; Hallsmith & Lietaer, 2011; Seyfang, 2002). Economic resiliency and monetary theory suggests community currencies have the potential to make a significant economic impact (Graugaard, 2012; Hallsmith & Lietaer, 2011). Research has shown modest, though important, economic effects including increased local wealth, improved business infrastructure and local economy, and altered spending patterns (Graugaard, 2012; Solomon, 1996b; Williams, 1997). Nonetheless, scholars concur that in the present policy environment, local currencies face barriers to increasing their economic impact beyond a small to moderate scale (Eisenstein, 2011; Hallsmith & Lietaer, 2011; Schroeder, Miyazaki, & Fare, 2011; Solomon, 1996b).
