Hinojar et al. found significantly elevated values of ECV in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy than in patients with hypertension. Additionally, patients with amyloidosis have drastically higher levels of ECV than patients with HCM and HHD (Figure Four). The degree of ECV values and subsequently the extent of fibrosis varies in different hypertensive heart disease phenotypes, being more expressed in patients with pronounced left ventricular hypertrophy. Higher ECV value, increased native T1, and associated reduction in peak systolic circumferential strain, and early diastolic strain rate, are the most significant findings, as presented by Kuruvilla et al. These patients have\n06ht | an increased risk of coronary artery disease and are more susceptible to developing heart failure, as well as conduction arrhythmias, especially atrial fibrillation. In certain rare clinical scenarios, two different conditions can exist. In these circumstances, it is important to properly estimate the underlying pathophysiological mechanism that dominates the patient's current clinical condition to enable proper follow-up and forehand therapy.\nv3r2 | The most important limitations in measuring ECV by cardiac magnetic resonance are subtle differences between normal patients and patients with hypertensive heart disease. This may limit the clinical usage of T1 mapping and ECV in discovering diffuse myocardial fibrosis, but it is undoubtedly an important imaging modality if applied technically correctly.\nnv42 | Eight. The Role of Cardiac Magnetic Resonance in the Estimation of Coronary Microvascular Dysfunction\nxags | In patients with hypertensive heart disease, several structural alterations develop in the coronary microvasculature. Increased medial thickness, reduced maximal cross-sectional area of pre-arterioles and arterioles, and decreased vascular density are the key pathophysiological mechanisms of impaired microcirculatory function. These changes, together with endothelial dysfunction, are the main contributors to the decreased coronary flow reserve in patients with hypertensive heart disease, even in the absence of significant epicardial vessel changes. The combination of microvascular ischemia and myocardial fibrosis is involved in the development of ventricular arrhythmias and increased risk of sudden cardiac death. It has been recently reported that the proportion of sudden cardiac deaths attributable to hypertensive heart disease in the absence of epicardial coronary artery disease has increased. Cardiac magnetic resonance can provide a comprehensive assessment of both epicardial and microvascular coronary circulation through stress perfusion test. Among non-invasive diagnostic modalities, cardiac magnetic resonance has the highest sensitivity and specificity in detecting coronary microvascular dysfunction. Although the qualitative assessment has low sensitivity and specificity, novel quantitative modalities can estimate coronary microvascular dysfunction with much higher accuracy. Perfusion mapping relies on artificial intelligence to obtain perfusion maps, generating conventional images to each image pixel encoding myocardial blood flow, both segmentally and globally. Global myocardial blood flow is calculated automatically\njc47 | as an average of all pixels, while myocardial perfusion reserve presents the ratio of stress to rest myocardial blood flow. Subendocardial myocardial perfusion reserve has the highest specificity and sensitivity in detecting coronary microvascular dysfunction. It is already shown that patients with impaired coronary microcirculation have a higher incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events. Microvascular dysfunction can be a distinctive subclinical marker of end-organ damage and heart failure in patients with hypertension. In patients with impaired coronary microcirculation in the setting of hypertension, diastolic parameters, global longitudinal strain, and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide were independently associated with the degree of impaired myocardial perfusion reserve. It is important to note that these results were obtained in patients without reduced left ventricular ejection fraction or flow-limiting epicardial coronary stenoses. This is why coronary microvascular dysfunction must be investigated in every patient with hypertension and chest pain not associated with obstructive coronary artery disease.\nko3c | Nine. Advantages of Cardiac Magnetic Resonance in Following the Effects of Anti-Hypertensive Treatment\nxek3 | The possibilities of cardiac magnetic resonance to provide anatomical, physiological, and functional data are of great importance in following the effects of treatment in patients with hypertension. Certain CMR studies have provided enough evidence of the positive role of anti-hypertensive drugs, mainly in terms of left ventricle hypertrophy reduction and changes in cardiac functional parameters. Recent technical and software improvements in myocardial tissue characterization enabled a more prevalent use of cardiac magnetic resonance in the studies following the effects of both pharmacological and interventional treatment modalities. Regarding interventional techniques, the advantages of sympathetic renal denervation in the treatment of resistant hypertension have been reported in several cardiac magnetic resonance follow-up studies. Schmidt et al. reported a significant reduction in left ventricular mass and septal wall thickness, while Tahir et al. observed improvements in left ventricular global strain and diastolic function after the renal denervation procedure. Mahfoud et al. registered a reduction in the left ventricular mass index, improvement in LV ejection fraction, and circumferential strain. Aside from observing the positive effects of renal denervation on LV mass reduction, diastolic, and systolic function improvement, the impact of this procedure on myocardial fibrosis is still under investigation. However, a study by Doltra et al. demonstrated a significant decrease in ECV value six months after the procedure, independently of blood pressure reduction. This result is not predominantly due to the reversion of myocyte hypertrophy, but also as a result of a reduction in collagen content. The positive effects in terms of a long-standing clinical benefit are yet to be determined.\nbbpr | Numerous studies have evaluated the prognostic value of cardiac magnetic resonance in patients with hypertensive heart disease. Hypertensive heart disease is primarily characterized by left ventricular hypertrophy, left atrial dilatation, myocardial fibrosis, diastolic before systolic dysfunction, and increased incidence of coronary artery disease, both epicardial and microvascular. A comprehensive evaluation of myocardial hypertrophy also allows a proper follow-up of patients on antihypertensive therapy, as the regression of LVH with antihypertensive treatment reduces the risk of stroke, myocardial infarction, and all-cause mortality. Morphological and functional changes of the myocardium can be followed through every stage of hypertensive heart disease, even in the subclinical phase, which is important to prevent further complications and development of heart failure with both preserved and reduced ejection fraction. Myocardial strain abnormalities, important in the early detection of myocardial damage, were observed in the majority of the patients. This is significant as it was shown that global longitudinal strain and its deterioration are associated with major adverse cardiovascular events even in patients with asymptomatic hypertensive heart disease. Left atrial enlargement is a common finding in patients with HHD and is an independent factor.\n```",
