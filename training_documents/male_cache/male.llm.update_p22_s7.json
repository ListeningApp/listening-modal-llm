According to Clermont, one member of a pair of type Ad spermatogonia divides to give rise to a pair of new type Ad cells, while the other member of the original pair of Ad divides to yield a pair of more differentiated type Ap spermatogonia. Thus, it is thought that the type Ad spermatogonia not only serve as a precursor for type Ap, but also eventually serve as the ancestor (i.e., stem cell) of a later generation of sperm.\n7a0a | ii) The type Ap spermatogonia divides by mitosis to give rise to two type B spermatogonia, a subset of which further divide to produce the preleptotene spermatocytes that enter meiosis.\no1qp | b) Meiotic Phase (Summarized here)\njrik | i) The diploid type B spermatogonia, which are also diploid (i.e., two N) in terms of DNA content and chromosome number, divide by mitosis to give rise to a new generation of cells: the primary spermatocytes.\nxv78 | Four point twenty-three\nsdks | ii) The primary spermatocytes initially have double the amount of DNA (i.e., tetraploid or four N) but remain diploid in terms of chromosome number.\ny8fb | iii) The primary spermatocytes then go through the preleptotene, leptotene, zygotene, and pachytene steps of the long prophase of the first maturation division of meiosis.\n521q | iv) Following a short diplotene phase, the primary spermatocytes complete the first maturation division through metaphase, anaphase, and telophase to give rise to secondary spermatocytes (which are haploid, but contain two N amount of DNA since they are double-stranded chromosomes).\nyogo | v) The secondary spermatocytes then quickly proceed through the second maturation division of meiosis to yield haploid spermatids containing one N amount of DNA.\n2285 | Four point twenty-four\nys0g | Seven) Spermiogenesis is the process of differentiation of the round spermatid to undergo morphological changes to develop an acrosome and flagella and to undergo nuclear condensation and extrusion of the cytoplasm.\n7zvp | a) Round Spermatids: As the spermatid matures it elongates, develops a tail or flagellum, and assumes a configuration similar to that of the mature spermatozoon. Very few spermatozoa are present in histological sections of the testis because as soon as they mature, the sperm are released into the seminiferous tubular lumen and rapidly flow out to the rete testis. The spermatid contains a prominent round nucleus, a Golgi apparatus, a set of centrioles, and numerous mitochondria. These organelles, with the aid of the Sertoli cell, will undergo architectural changes that will transform the spermatid into the mature spermatozoon.\nww6u | i) During the first stage of spermiogenesis, large acrosomal vesicles are elaborated by the Golgi apparatus. Other than the nucleus, the acrosomal vesicle soon becomes the most prominent cytoplasmic inclusion within the spermatid. The acrosomal vesicle migrates to one pole of the nucleus, and the centrioles move to the opposite end of the nucleus. The acrosomal vesicle will eventually become the acrosomal cap of the sperm. The molecular controls of this process involve the proper functioning of a large number of different proteins at every stage of acrosome biosynthesis. When one of these proteins described\nhpi6 | Four point twenty-five\n4uhb | in Figure thirteen are dysfunctional, teratozoospermia occurs, specifically round-headed sperm or globozoospermia due to the absence of the acrosome or acrosome atrophy or displacement.\nepyi | ii). Nuclear condensation: Surprisingly little research has been performed to fully understand the events required for the elongation and condensation of the spermatid nucleus. The acroplaxome, which consists of a bent plate and marginal ring encircling the spermatid nucleus, is key in this process. It serves to anchor the developing acrosome to the spermatid nucleus. The manchette also plays an important role in this process. The manchette surrounds the elongating spermatid head and is only present at the time of spermatid head shaping and tail formation. It is composed of a perinuclear ring and an attached fringe of microtubules. In humans it is proposed that the apical portion of the sperm head is driven by the actions of the acroplaxome and F-actin hoops located within the Sertoli cell, together with the transient manchette. The microtubules of the manchette are nucleated from the centrioles (located more caudally) and attached to the perinuclear ring to form a grass-like structure required for nuclear shaping. Proper sperm chromatin remodeling during spermiogenesis is of key importance. Herein the chromatin remodeling involves the replacement of histones by histone variants, hyperacetylation, by transient DNA strand breaks with associated DNA repair and replacement of the histones by the transition proteins, and finally by the highly basic protamines. The condensed chromatin of the elongating spermatid are transcriptionally inactive, as is the chromatin in the mature sperm.\ny51p | iii). Flagellar Formation: One of the centrioles begins to elongate to form the core of the flagellum. As the centriole elongates, it begins to push the cytoplasm away from the nucleus. The centriole continues to extend out away from the nucleus to form the flagellum, and in the process, it constantly pulls most of the cytoplasmic inclusions away from the nucleus. The inactive centriole (proximal centriole) remains intact and will be present in the neckpiece of the mature sperm. As the cytoplasm spreads away from the nucleus and acrosomal cap, the mitochondria are sequestered at the base of the flagellum. The acrosomal region of the head will soon be devoid of any cytoplasmic inclusions. Excess cytoplasm, which now resides primarily in the area of the neckpiece, is cast off and phagocytized by the Sertoli cell. A remnant of the cytoplasm, the cytoplasmic droplet, is sometimes seen on sperm during the semen analysis, and an excess of these droplets may indicate immature sperm in the ejaculate.\n```",
