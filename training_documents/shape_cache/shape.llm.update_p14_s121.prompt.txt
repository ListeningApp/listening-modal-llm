You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

0x0s | Our finding's implications are vital because clothing academics and ergonomics researchers are using the FFIT as the theoretical basis of their body shape ana- lysis. Nevertheless, this paper proves that the FFIT's measurement definition and classification methodolo- gies are limited as the FFIT uses Hip and Waist defini- tions that deviate from measurements defined in standards and in product development. The FFIT pro- vides a foundational approach to body shape classifi- cation by key circumferences. Nevertheless, FFIT is prone to variability in application, where two practi- tioners can classify the same body into different shapes. We support this through replacing the FFIT's Hip definition with an anatomically correct Hip defin- ition - as the SizeUK Measurement Extraction Protocol (SizeUK 2002) uses, producing different body shape classifications while still within the FFIT's loose
4exe | measurement definitions. Practitioners' use of FFIT is not necessarily flawed if the same measurement defi- nitions are used within comparisons - as with Yim Lee et al. (2007). Instead, problems arise when a practi- tioner unknowingly uses different measurements in their work to that of the research they are comparing their results against. Nevertheless, few publications uti- lising FFIT provide sufficient specificity to allow practi- tioners to avoid such potential error. Ergonomists, academics, and garment construction practitioners must give further critical consideration to the reliabil- ity and suitability of all comparative research reliant upon body shape - especially the FFIT - within their work.
0myz | This paper shows that a person's shoulder-to-shoul- der (horizontal) measurement cannot be inferred from the FFIT body shape alone. As shoulders are one of the critical measurement zones for some upper-body cloth- ing (Beazley and Bond 2003; Aldrich 2015), FFIT cannot describe a body's form that is entirely suitable to gar- ment selection, as with fashion retail's virtual fit/gar- ment size prediction tools (Januszkiewicz et al. 2017). There is, therefore, a need to develop more complex body shape identification systems that include shoulder measurement and addresses the needs for standardisa- tion to avoid classification changes because of small discrepancies in measurement location.
xh3i | Conclusion
syiw | We set out to assess the stability of FFIT's body classi- fication system for ergonomists, garment construction practitioners, and scientific researchers. In these fields, practitioners often classify measurements by name, meaning definitions can be challenging to ascertain. In pursuing this aim, we prove that slight differences in measurement placement definition1 lead to differ- ent shape classifications of the same body. Because two practitioners can use two different sets of meas- urements sharing the same name, but with slight dif- ferences in definitions within the FFIT's tool, the FFIT body shape classification can lead to inconsistent con- clusions. FFIT can reduce, or remove, this inconsistency by publishing their measurement placement defini- tions in a non-equivocal and replicable format.
kg3t | Relating body shape to garment construction, hori- zontal shoulder measurements - one of the critical measurement zones for some upper-body clothing (Beazley and Bond 2003; Aldrich 2015) - only exhibits a medium association with body shape classifications.
lvae | A higher level of association with the torso measure- ments used to establish body shape by FFIT would have provided an opportunity to use the FFIT system to predict the torso's broader morphology, including the shoulder region. This indicates a need for any reli- able and authoritative body classification system to include a wider variety of shoulder anthropometry.
o9sc | The FFIT applied without consistent use of the same definitions is limited. Further research is needed to achieve a reliable and appropriate body classifica- tion system for scientific research or garment con- struction. The results provide a detailed examination of the variable approaches to defining body measure- ment and how these affect results. It highlights the need for researchers from all fields to work together to agree on more standardised approaches to anthropometric and ergonomic practices.
121u | Our finding's mean clothing ergonomics academics and garment construction practitioners must question the authority of their practice that depends upon sys- tems that have loose measurement definitions - like FFIT. They must seek to ensure measurement definitions are consistent, even when names are the same. We must, therefore, rethink and build on the last decade of progress in nationality-based body shape comparisons, body shape-based health estimations, and consumer self-perception that have drawn from the FFIT. Systems like FFIT would benefit from defining measurements by averaging over regions, reducing the influence of local- ised changes. Such systems could lead to more stable body shape classification systems. Researchers may have exposed between-study differences in body shape classi- fication, but the researchers' interpretation of the FFIT's measurement placement may drive the differences, instead of genuine population body shape differences.
zh03 | Ergonomics academics and garment construction practitioners need a more reliable and repeatable body classification system than currently exists. Including shoulder anthropometrics into a new body classification system should, if produced through rigor- ous empirical methods, create a system with direct application in clothing's development and construc- tion processes. Then, maybe even online fashion retail's virtual try-on systems can meaningfully utilise body shape and 3 D Body Scanning.
1mvw | Limitations and further research
6d4s | This paper raises important questions about how ergo- nomists, garment construction practitioners, and researchers categorises body forms and how the field must consider body shape in the future.
mqah | While we prove that slight differences in measure- ment placement definition lead to different shape classifications of the same body, our investigation is limited to the FFIT and its relevant measurements. Exploring a more comprehensive range of body cat- egorisation systems with a broader range of alterna- tive measurement definitions will determine the generalisability of our findings outside of the FFIT.
xxr8 | Our research does not develop a new - more appropriate - body shape classification system. We, instead, set out clear arguments for any development in body shape classification to include unequivocal measurement definitions, apply to garmentʼs construction practices, and include the body's add- itional regions aligning to contemporary ISO stand- ards. Our work with FFIT has inspired the need for empirical investigation to define those shapes' measurements, algorithm, and classification needs. To propose a system without such rigour would be inappropriate.
rl4j | Future classification systems must provide a higher degree of specificity with a lower degree of alternative interpretation for measurement location and collection compared to the FFIT. Such work must use sophisti- cated computational analysis that may have been unavailable to Simmons, Istook, and Devarajan (2004a; 2004b) - who used elementary logic. Our results have begun this process by showing such a new body shape classification system should include shoulder circumferences. Nevertheless, more complex additional measurements than the FFIT, and this paper, considers - such as pitch, slope length, and front-to-back depth - may lead to more appropriate body classifications for ergonomists, garment construction practitioners, and researchers to work with a higher level of preci- sion. Other body anthropology, such as the breast, should be included as body classification has, historic- ally, focussed on the female form.
