        "content": "9f7o | one hundred eighty-four neuroproteasome. We fail to detect cytosolic proteins such as Actin in our surface\n5n75 | one hundred eighty-five fraction, validating our surface-labeling approach, and fail to observe FLAG expression in twenty S-\n3ljd | one hundred eighty-six FLAG mice without Cre. By blotting using an antibody which detects six of the seven\n2oqd | one hundred eighty-seven alpha subunits of the twenty S proteasome including a seven, the subunit coded for by Psma3, we can\nc4uf | one hundred eighty-eight clearly distinguish the modified a seven subunit overlaying with the FLAG signal, denoting\ngmje | one hundred eighty-nine modification of the endogenous protein. Next, we used surface biotinylation to assess if\na8px | one hundred ninety our transgenic system was functional in primary cultures. Primary neurons from twenty S-FLAG mice\nuz6l | one hundred ninety-one were cultured and transduced with AAVs to express Cre recombinase at days in vitro (DIV) two\nxaka | one hundred ninety-two and then processed for surface biotinylation at day in vitro fourteen. We did not detect FLAG\np46y | one hundred ninety-three without AAVs to express Cre, supporting our conclusion that the twenty S-FLAG transgene is\nwaardet | one hundred ninety-four inducible and not leaky.\n4rcq | One hundred ninety-five.\nzie9 | One hundred ninety-six. Next, we purified FLAG-neuroproteasomes to determine their composition. First, we prepared\nqx9z | one hundred ninety-seven plasma membranes from twenty S-FLAG/Baf fifty-three b-Cre brains and then gently extracted membrane\notrq | one hundred ninety-eight proteins. We find our membrane preparations were enriched in membrane proteins such as\nule8 | one hundred ninety-nine GluR1 and depleted of cytosolic proteins like Actin. We affinity isolated FLAG-\n6yp6 | two hundred neuroproteasomes from the membrane fraction as well as cytosolic FLAG-proteasomes and\nqx7g | two hundred one subjected both to quantitative tandem mass tag-based mass spectrometry analysis. As expected,\n17ou | two hundred two we find common signatures of twenty S subunits between both cytosolic proteasomes and\nl7mi | two hundred three neuroproteasomes and a significant depletion of nineteen S subunits in the neuroproteasome isolations.\nodfd | two hundred four This is consistent with a lack of cytosolic subunits in our membrane preparations and validates our previous findings. We identified sixty-four proteins enriched in the neuroproteasome isolations\nzlby | two hundred five\nk37v | two hundred seven glycoprotein, which we previously described, and a surprising and strong enrichment\n77oz | two hundred eight of ApoE and the ApoE receptor Lrp1. We do not observe other ApoE receptors, such as ApoER2, VLDLR, and LDLR in this analysis. We first validated these proteomic data by affinity isolating FLAG-neuroproteasomes as well as cytosolic FLAG-\naw8u | Two hundred nine.\nktnk | Two hundred ten.\nqiri | two hundred eleven proteasomes and then immunoblotting these samples. Here, we validate our proteomic data by also identifying robust co-purification of ApoE and Lrp1 with the FLAG-neuroproteasome.\naapk | Two hundred twelve.\nb3dl | Two hundred thirteen.\n30p1 | Two hundred fourteen.\njp3l | two hundred fifteen ApoE isoforms differentially modulate neuroproteasome surface localization in vivo\n2pzg | Two hundred sixteen.\nqeue | two hundred seventeen ApoE can be expressed as one of three isoforms in human, ApoE4, ApoE3, and ApoE2, each of\ntwo hundred eighteen which differs by only one or two residues. We next tested whether ApoE isoforms could\n77jl | two hundred nineteen differentially modulate neuroproteasome localization and function. We obtained human ApoE\na9ul | two hundred twenty isoform knock-in mice, where the entire coding region for the Apoe gene was replaced with\n9jxp | two hundred twenty-one a cassette encoding the three human Apoe loci, generating a fully humanized ApoE protein.\nejzi | two hundred twenty-two These mice therefore only express the ApoE2, ApoE3, or ApoE4 isoforms. hApoE-KI mice were\nlgbb | two hundred twenty-three perfused and then hippocampus and primary motor cortex were microdissected and\nhdy5 | two hundred twenty-four subjected to surface biotinylation and immunoblotting. We chose a limited survey of regions\nrlsz | two hundred twenty-five based on their differential susceptibility to accumulate pathological hallmarks of AD\nwf16 | two hundred twenty-six hippocampus greater than primary motor cortex. We found a strong reduction of neuroproteasome surface\nsyuf | two hundred twenty-seven localization in the hippocampus of ApoE4-KI mice, compared to ApoE3-KIs or ApoE2-KIs,\nn8b1 | two hundred twenty-eight measured by surface signal of twenty S subunit beta five. We observe a significant difference\nwurf | two hundred twenty-nine between ApoE3 male and female mice, where female ApoE3 mice have fifty percent fewer surface-\nv7s4 | two hundred thirty localized neuroproteasomes than male ApoE3 mice in hippocampus. We find this\nyg3g | two hundred thirty-one noteworthy in the context of the extensive literature on the influence of biological sex on AD\n7fo3 | two hundred thirty-two pathogenesis. When we monitor neuroproteasome localization in the primary motor cortex from the\nmwxk | two hundred thirty-three hApoE-KI mice, we find that neuroproteasome surface localization in ApoE4-KIs is reduced\novs7 | two hundred thirty-four compared to ApoE2-KIs and we observe a trend, but no significant change in ApoE4-KI\n0dyv | two hundred thirty-five compared to ApoE3-KI. These data may be attributable to differences in ApoE\nsl16 | two hundred thirty-six expression in different brain regions, a dimension which we have not systematically investigated.\nlrz1 | Two hundred thirty-seven.\nku5c | Two hundred thirty-eight.\n3z35 | Two hundred thirty-nine. Given the region-specific effect of ApoE isoforms on neuroproteasome expression in vivo, we\n0xdu | two hundred forty approached the effect of ApoE isoforms and ApoE receptors in a more defined and tractable\nbpdv | two hundred forty-one primary neuronal culture system. Lrp1 was the only ApoE receptor that we identified in our neuroproteasome IP/MS dataset and we also found ApoE isoform-dependent modulation of Lrp1\nb0xd | Two hundred forty-two.\ne106 | Two hundred forty-three levels. Instead of testing the role for Lrp1 specifically, we tested the role for ApoE\nmh8r | two hundred forty-four receptors in modulating neuroproteasome localization using the well-established pan-ApoE\nud3i | two hundred forty-five receptor antagonist Receptor-associated protein. We chose this strategy because\ntwo hundred forty-six Lrp1 knockouts still contain small amounts of Lrp1 remaining in sporadic sets of neurons and\n8qfv | two hundred forty-seven because of detrimental effects on neuronal health following Lrp1 knockdown. We used a\niers | two hundred forty-eight variant of RAP which contains a stabilizing mutation to protect against pH-induced\ntwo hundred forty-nine denaturation and maintains a higher percentage of internalized Lrp1, and presumably other ApoE\nz6h3 | two hundred fifty receptors as well. We incubated primary neurons with purified stable RAP and\nqe1n | two hundred fifty-one measured surface protein levels using surface biotinylation and immunoblotting. We find that stable RAP rapidly decreases the surface localization of Lrp1, as expected. We also\nuaiu | Two hundred fifty-two.\nbesh | two hundred fifty-three find that stable RAP reduces surface localization of neuroproteasomes. These data\ntwo hundred fifty-four served as the first demonstration that ApoE receptors, such as Lrp1, can regulate\nz6fn | two hundred fifty-five neuroproteasome localization.\nc7zf | Two hundred fifty-six.\niwkf | two hundred fifty-seven ApoE is a lipoprotein, and in the brain is thought to be released by glia in the lipid-bound\n4jzo | two hundred fifty-eight form. We therefore next leveraged the primary culture system to determine\ni5zo | two hundred fifty-nine whether extracellular ApoE could modulate neuroproteasome localization and if the lipidation of\ntwo hundred sixty ApoE was important for this modulation. We generated primary neurons from either twenty S-FLAG\nwe91 | two hundred sixty-one transgenic animals or wild-type animals and conducted imaging and biochemical experiments to\n3h4l | two hundred sixty-two measure neuroproteasome localization. We conjugated recombinant ApoE isoforms with a\nmy5y | two hundred sixty-three mixture of POPC and Cholesterol and purified ApoE lipoproteins, referred to as\ntwo hundred sixty-four ApoE2, E3, and E4. These lipoproteins were validated by SEC and negative stain EM.",
