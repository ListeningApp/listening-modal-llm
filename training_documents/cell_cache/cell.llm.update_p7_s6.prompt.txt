You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).

y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

uodj | In mice, transcripts of most of pluripotency factors are present in the blastocyst, which is consistent with the origin of ESCs (Fig. D). About a half of the factors are expressed maternally while the other half appear in early embryos. Among Pou5f1, Sox2, and Nanog, whose homologs constitute the maternal foundation of ZGA in zebrafish [88], only Pou5f1 is expressed maternally, whereas Sox2 is transiently expressed at the 2-cell stage and then again in blastocysts. Klf4 is one of the few pluripotency factors strongly expressed during major ZGA in mice. Nanog is first expressed in 2-cell embryos and its transcripts accumulate until the blastocyst stage. Taken together, the mouse model suggests that a fraction of the core pluripotency factors is provided maternally to initi- ate a reprogramming transcription factor cascade that forms the core pluripotency network controlling the pluripotent state of inner mass cells.
k16v | However, when performing a similar expression analysis in bovine or human embryos, striking differences in terms of tem- poral/stage expression of pluripotency factors emerge (Fig. D). This high variability implies that the core pluripotency network during early mammalian development could be established in mul- tiple ways. Also, this evolving variability in maternal and zygotic appearance of pluripotency factors could contribute to reproduc- tive barriers emerging during speciation. One could envision that maternally provided pluripotency transcription factors initiating the core pluripotency network formation (and genome activation in general) in a defined sequence would fail to activate the genome in another species. Such a post-zygotic reproductive barrier would be a more cos-effective solution than hybrid sterility. In any case, the mammalian core pluripotency circuitry appears linked to ances- tral vertebrate ZGA, but in mammals it evolved into a pluripotency program in inner cell mass cells upon their separation from extra- embryonic lineages.
b2lm | If the core pluripotency circuitry makes a minor contribution to mammalian zygotic transcription programs, can other contributory factors be defined? An important insight into the murine zygotic transcription programs comes from detailed analysis of ESCs. As mentioned above, a small fraction (~1%) of ESCs express an LTR retrotransposon mouse endogenous retrovirus type L (MuERV-L) [83]. MuERV retrotransposons [89,90] are transiently expressed during ZGA where they comprise a significant fraction of mRNAs [58,91]. This minor ESC population expressing MuERV-L sequences has unique characteristics in terms of gene expression and totipo- tency which is normally found in blastomeres of the 2-cell zygote [83]. This finding suggests that the pluripotent potential of ESCs does not only stochastically fluctuate "forward" towards differen- tiation, but also "back" towards a totipotent state [83] and that "totipotency" indeed might exist as an expression program driven by a defined set of transcription factors.
ti7f | Whether MuERV-L is an active player in this fluctuation and whether it is a unique feature of the mouse model is an open question. MuERV-L engagement in transcription in 2-cell zygotes appears primarily a consequence of MuERV-L survival strategy. Retrotransposon expansion in the genome requires retro- transposition to occur during the germline cycle. Consequently, retrotransposons sequences adapt such that they would be rec- ognized and transcriptionally activated during the germline cycle. Accordingly, MuERV-L LTRs evolved to recruit transcription factors initiating gene expression in zygotes. Consequently, as MuERV- L had been spreading through the mouse genome, it would be distributing zygotic genome activation platforms that could be recruited for novel functions during ZGA. In fact, many LTRs of the ERVL retrotransposon family to contributed to the separation of maternal and zygotic programs in mammals [92]. Studies of transcriptional control of reveal factors/mechanisms contributing to murine <LATEX>Z G A \left[ 9 3 - 9 7 \right] .</LATEX> One of the remarkable MuERV-L regulators is a double homeobox gene Dux4, which has been recently implicated in ZGA [70-72]. Dux4 becomes transiently expressed during minor ZGA[65] and, as an intron-less gene local- ized in a tandemly duplicated locus, is the primary candidate for a transcription factor involved in ZGA. Dux4 also fits into the model that the earliest transcribed genes are short and newly evolved [98].
oksu | 9. Conclusions
wtow | Mammalian OET is characterized by relatively long transition between the maternal and zygotic gene expression which involves only a small number of cleavages a zygote. This likely reflects the need to produce a totipotent early embryo, which undergoes separation of extraembryonic and embryonic lineages. There is a variable timing of the major ZGA; the early onset in mice seems to be a derived character while blastomeres of other mammals undergo several cleavages before the major ZGA. Advances in high throughput methods have been providing a comprehensive picture of gene expression and, lately, also chromatin dynamics during OET. However, there is a number of issues that still need to be addressed. Of a particular interest are determination of variable and consti- tutive parts of genome reprogramming and identification of the set of maternally provided transcription factors, which would be sufficient to drive OET. Also of interest are mechanisms assuring that transcription factors driving the maternal and zygotic tran- scription do not interfere as well as events that lead to the early genome activation during evolution of mice. Improved understand- ing of molecular mechanisms underlying OET will translate into more efficient manipulation of a cell-fate, which is of fundamental importance for biotechnology and medicine.
