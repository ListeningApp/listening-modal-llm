Firstly, most arguments pertaining to the wrongness or badness of species extinctions are not primarily concerned with 'species' as such. Rather, the matter of moral concern, such as the locus or source of value, is often located somewhere else: in the nonhuman individuals involved, in people's relationship to particular species or landscapes, in biodiversity including variability within species and between ecosystems and so on, which reflects that there is more of moral relevance to the ethics of extinction than merely the numerical loss of species and their respective intrinsic or instrumental value. Views on the moral wrongness of anthropogenic extinctions result also, amongst other things, from underlying premises of what constitutes an appropriate human-nature relationship, which is why the current anthropogenic mass extinction event is of significant moral concern.\n```",
