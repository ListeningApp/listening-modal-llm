Those with higher satisfaction were more responsive to the situational factors than those with lower satisfaction. This unexpected finding suggests the need to review the assumptions behind our hypotheses.\nys0g | High satisfaction implies high plasticity. We had assumed that those with high satisfaction with the group were fulfilling their values, in part, through the group and that this would cause them to be more attached to the group. We expected that their attachment to and dependence on the group for continued satisfaction would cause them to engage in voice regardless of contextual factors. That is, we did not expect voice to vary significantly across situations for highly satisfied individuals. The pattern illustrated by the plots in Figures three and four, however,\n7zvp | reveals that the favorability of group conditions (i.e., small or self-managed groups) had a strong influence on the voice behavior of highly satisfied individuals. Highly satisfied individuals in large or traditionally-managed groups engaged in the same amount of voice as those who were less satisfied. However, when highly satisfied individuals were in small or self-managed groups, they engaged in more voice than those who were less satisfied. Kahn's research on \"personal engagement\" provides one possible explanation for this finding.\nww6u | When individuals feel their work situation has meaningfulness (perceiving a positive return on their physical, cognitive, or emotional energy), they tend to become personally engaged in their work. That is, they more fully employ themselves in terms of harnessing their physical, cognitive, and emotional energy so that they are more mindful and cognitively vigilant during task performance. Perhaps, in contrast to our initial thinking, satisfied individuals' attachment to the group increased their personal engagement. Perhaps their dependence on the group for continuing satisfaction made them particularly sensitive to contextual information that might bear on the group's well-being. In the context of the present study, favorable conditions based on group size and style of management may convey information to those strongly attached to the group regarding means of dealing with the group's issues. That is, relative to large or traditionally-managed groups, the ambient and discretionary stimuli in small or self-managed groups may signal that it is desirable, appropriate, and/or at least acceptable to engage in challenging or controversial behavior for the benefit of the group.\nhpi6 | Low satisfaction implies low plasticity. We had also expected that individuals with lower satisfaction with the group would be less attached and less dependent on the\n4uhb | group for fulfilling their needs. Accordingly, we had expected them to be less self-determined and more influenced by situational factors. Instead, our data demonstrated that the voice of those who were less satisfied varied less as a function of situational factors than the voice of those who were more satisfied. The lower responsiveness of less satisfied individuals to the contextual factors can also be explained in terms of Kahn's research.\nepyi | When individuals do not perceive positive returns on their physical, cognitive, or emotional effort, they may withdraw from their work role. Such personal \"disengagement\" entails an absence of physical, cognitive, and emotional energies directed toward the task. Personal disengagement implies behavior that is automatic, detached, and effortless. Personally disengaged individuals are \"cognitively unvigilant\" and therefore, less responsive to situational stimuli. To the extent that individuals with low satisfaction do not perceive positive returns from their energies, they are likely to be personally disengaged and, thus, should be less responsive to situational factors such as group size and style of management.\ny51p | The research on positive affectivity provides a similar explanation for the lower situational responsiveness of less satisfied individuals. Positive affectivity is the global tendency to experience positive emotions and moods. It indicates the extent to which individuals are \"positively engaged in the world around them.\" Perhaps those with low satisfaction (like those with low positive affectivity) are \"disengaged\" from their environment and, thus, less responsive to situational characteristics. We note that although positive affectivity refers to a global personality trait, satisfaction with the group reflects an individual's general attitude toward an object (the group). Thus, whereas low positive affectivity relates to disengagement from the environment in general, low satisfaction with the group relates to disengagement within a particular group.\nx95m | Overall, our results suggest that voice will be highest when personal factors (high self-esteem or high satisfaction) are combined with favorable situational factors (small group size or self-management). Although the above provides a plausible explanation for our unexpected findings, the logic is post hoc and accordingly should be examined in future research.\nyfum | Significant Control Variables\nppx4 | In addition to the nature of the satisfaction-context interactions, we were also surprised by the relatively large amount of variance explained by the control variables. In retrospect, however, several of these relationships could have been predicted in advance and perhaps even included as a priori hypotheses. The sex differences\nqf11 | literature, for example, suggests that males tend to participate more in groups than females, especially in task-related as opposed to socio-emotional behaviors. This literature also suggests that males tend to initiate communications and provide their opinions, whereas females tend to be more reactive and strive for consensus. Finally, this literature suggests that females may have less influence than males in mixed-sex groups; thus, females may have lower confidence that they will be \"heard\" above members of the traditional majority. We note that a similar argument could be made for a relationship between ethnicity and voice. Overall, therefore, the literature suggests that males and Whites would tend to engage in more voice than females and non-Whites.\n8oqt | The relationship between education and job status and voice could have also been predicted a priori. Education imparts general knowledge that translates into a greater ability to recognize problems or opportunities and to offer a greater number of possible solutions. Education may also increase an individual's confidence that he or she possesses the skills and knowledge necessary in order to make suggestions at work. Thus, it is probable that those who possess more knowledge and confidence will be more likely to engage in voice. Job status reflects access to information and the freedom one has regarding behavior on the job. The more status, the more information and latitude one has regarding acceptable job behaviors. Suggestions that \"buck-the-system\" or challenge the status-quo may require such latitude. In addition, higher job status may provide a sense of power as well as a sense of responsibility for outcomes that facilitate expression of voice. This is different for individuals in low-level jobs who may have less access to information, fewer degrees of freedom regarding their behavior at work, and who may feel less responsible for group outcomes.",
