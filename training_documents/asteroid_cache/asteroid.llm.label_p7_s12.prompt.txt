You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

d5bi | (1) The initial magmatic crystallization (4.56 Ga) and subsequent thermal metamorphism occurred prior to 4.5 Ga. The U-Pb ages of the various eucrite zircons reveal the timing of the ubiquitous thermal metamorphism of the initial basaltic crust of Vesta to be 4.55 Ga at a metamorphic temperature of ~900℃ (lizuka et al., 2015). After an intensive initial differ- entiation at 4.56 Ga, the magmatism on Vesta lasted until 4.53 Ga, according to the Hf-W records of unbrecciated eucrite zir- con (Roszjar et al., 2016). In addition, the asteroid may have suffered a large basin-forming collision at this stage (Hopkins et al., 2015; Kennedy et al., 2019). The U-Pb, and Hf-W studies of mesosiderite zircons also provide a high-temperature re- heating age of 4.53 Ga (Haba et al., 2017, 2019; Koike et al., 2017) that is attributed to a catastrophic collision.
ba4l | (2) After this early event 1, the asteroid experienced moderate col- lisions prior to 4.15 Ga. At this stage, none of the earlier zircon crystals were remelted or recrystallized and the crystals' U-Pb and Hf-W chronologies remained closed. Instead, the impacts were recorded by the U-Pb systems in phosphates (this study; Liao and Hsu, 2017; Zhou et al., 2011) and silicates (Galer and Lugmair, 1996; Tera et al., 1997) in several brecciated eucrites. The reheating temperature likely exceeded their closure tem- peratures (~590-1000℃) and rapidly quenched. Some regions may have exceeded the basalt melting point and formed the

Compiled chronological data (the U-Pb systems in zircon, silicates, phosphates, the Hf-W system in zircon, and the K-Ar system in whole rock or plagioclase) of basaltic eucrites compared to those of cumulate eucrites and mesosiderites. Our data are depicted by the red-filled symbols. Literature data are from Ireland and Bukovanska (1992), Ireland and Wlotzka (1992), Bukovanska and Ireland (1993), Misawa et al. (2005), Zhou et al. (2013), Iizuka et al. (2015), Haba et al. (2017, 2019) for the U-Pb in zircon; Srinivasan et al. (2007), Roszjar et al. (2016), Koike et al.

06ht | (3) Later collisions occurred at ~3.9-3.5 Ga. These events were recorded only by the 40 Ar-39 Ar ages, where the reheating tem- perature may have slightly exceeded the K-Ar closure tem- perature <LATEX>\left( \sim 2 5 0 ^ { \circ } C - 5 0 0 ^ { \circ } C \right.</LATEX> Table S3). Theoretical calculations indicate that such moderate reheating can be achieved by low- velocity (i.e., slower than the typical relative speed of aster- oidal bodies) mild collisions. The absence of a U-Pb record (for either phosphates or silicates) at ~3.9 Ga suggests that these later collisions were much weaker than the earlier ones.
v3r2 | The multiple moderate collisions prior to 4.15 Ga (event 2) could be attributed to the start of the LHB (Liao and Hsu, 2017; Zhou et al., 2011), even though some data in Fig. 5 are significantly earlier than the 40 Ar-39 Ar ages. Conversely, event 2 can be ex- plained as an "end-tail" of the cataclysmic collisions at the earlier
nv42 | stage of >4.5 Ga (event 1). Such "end-tail" collisions significantly decreased by ~3.9 Ga (event 3), when only weak (or low-velocity) impacts occurred. This interpretation matches the recent theoreti- cal models of an early bombardment (≥4.5 Ga) and a subsequent monotonic decrease in impacts in the inner solar system (Mojzsis et al., 2019; Brasser et al., 2020). Even though the number of key chronological data is still small, this is an important piece of ev- idence for the early collisional history of the inner solar system. Future studies of other asteroidal materials are expected to help reconstruct the whole history.
xags | 6. Conclusions
jc47 | NanoSIMS U-Pb dating was conducted on apatite and merril- lite minerals in three brecciated basaltic eucrites (Juvinas, Camel Donga, and Stannern) and two unbrecciated basaltic achondrites (Agoult and Ibitira). The weighted mean model <LATEX>2 0 7 p b ^ { * } / ^ { 2 0 6 } p b ^ { * }</LATEX> age of the Agoult apatite was determined to be <LATEX>4 5 2 4 . 8 \pm 9 . 6 M a ,</LATEX> sig- nificantly younger than its zircon age (4555 Ma) and older than the

xek3 | <LATEX>4 0 \quad A r - 3 9 \quad A r</LATEX> age of its plagioclase (4496 Ma). This is consistent with a previous interpretation (Iizuka et al., 2015, 2019) that Agoult recorded ubiquitous high-temperature metamorphism of the ini- tial crust of Vesta. The <LATEX>{ } ^ { 2 0 7 } \mathrm { P b } ^ { * } / ^ { 2 0 6 } \mathrm { P b } ^ { * }</LATEX> age of the Ibitira merrillite is <LATEX>4 5 5 2 . 0 \pm 8 . 7 \mathrm { M a } ,</LATEX> consistent with the other chronometers in this meteorite. Conversely, the model <LATEX>2 0 7 p b ^ { * } / 2 0 6 p b ^ { * }</LATEX> ages of the Juvinas phosphates recorded two distinct events at <LATEX>4 5 1 6 . 9 \pm 1 0 . 4</LATEX> Ma (the weighted mean value for apatite) and <LATEX>4 1 5 0 . 3 \pm 1 1 . 6 \mathrm { M a }</LATEX> (merril- lite). The earlier age reflects either crustal metamorphism or an in- dependent impact at ~4520 Ma. The later age reveals the presence of a moderate collisional reheating event at 4150 Ma. This timing is identical to the <LATEX>2 0 7 p b ^ { * } / 2 0 6 p b ^ { * }</LATEX> of the Stannern apatite and merrillite at <LATEX>4 1 4 3 . 0 \pm 1 2 . 5</LATEX> Ma. For the Camel Donga apatite, the model <LATEX>2 0 7 p b ^ { * } / 2 ^ { 2 0 6 } P b ^ { * }</LATEX> ages present a mean value of <LATEX>4 4 9 1 . 4 \pm 1 3 . 5</LATEX> Ma with one exceptionally disturbed value of ~4370 Ma. Appar- ently, these brecciated eucrites indicate the presence of multiple collisional events during the period of ~4.4-4.15 Ga. By combin- ing our chronological dataset with data from the literature, the thermal and metamorphic history of Vesta's crust can be described as follows: (1) Initial magmatic processes occurred during the pe- riod of <LATEX>4 . 5 6 - 4 . 5 \quad G a .</LATEX> Cataclysmic collision(s) also occurred during this stage. (2) The asteroid subsequently experienced multiple col- lisions during the period of <LATEX>\sim 4 . 4 - 4 . 1 5 \quad G a ,</LATEX> which were recorded by the U-Pb systems in apatite, merrillite and some silicates, but not by the U-Pb system in zircons. The reheating temperature ex- ceeded the apatite U-Pb closure temperature <LATEX>\left( \sim 5 9 0 - 1 , 0 0 0 ^ { \circ } C \right.</LATEX> and likely reached locally the basalt melting point locally. (3) Later col- <LATEX>l i s i o n s \quad a t \sim 3 . 9 - 3 . 5 \quad G a</LATEX> were recorded only by the K-Ar system. The reheating temperature was likely <LATEX>\leq 5 0 0 ^ { \circ } C ,</LATEX> which can be achieved through weak impacts. The records on Vesta are well explained by a scenario with early asteroidal bombardments tonic decrease of the bombardment rate <LATEX>\geq 4 . 5 \text { Ga to } \sim 4 . 1</LATEX> Ga, rather than by the conventional LHB
