You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

qy1i | reduction in other seizures. Comparing the outcomes between anterior callosotomy and complete callosotomy (including a one or two stage complete callosotomy), ex- tent of disconnection did not significantly affect drop at- tack control (considering a 50% and an 80% cutoff, and using the chi-squared test). For "other seizure types," a complete callosotomy was significantly associated with a better outcome when compared to anterior callosotomy using the 50% cutoff <LATEX>\left( p = . 0 1 3 \right)</LATEX> but not using the 80% cutoff.
1k9e | Outcomes of drop attack control following CC were compared to VNS outcomes according to degree of sei- zure reduction categories: < 50%, between 50% and 80%, and >80%. To verify that sufficient time had elapsed since placing VNS, we focused on patients with 1-2-year fol- low-up after VNS (prior to CC, <LATEX>\left. n = 2 7 \right) ,</LATEX> and patients with >2years follow-up after VNS (prior to CC, <LATEX>\left. n = 6 0 \right) .</LATEX> Using the Fisher exact test, the degree of drop attack reduction following CC was not significantly correlated to the degree of reduction after VNS <LATEX>\left( p = . 6 7 6 \right.</LATEX> for 1-2 years, and <LATEX>p = . 2 6 6</LATEX> for <LATEX>> 2 \quad y e a r s</LATEX> following the VNS before CC).
5bjs | In addition to the 10 cases undergoing completion of the posterior CC, 10 patients underwent additional sur- geries: frontal lobectomy <LATEX>\left( n = 1 \right) ,</LATEX> responsive neurostimu- lation system (RNS) concurrently with the completion of CC <LATEX>\left( n = 1 \right) ,</LATEX> and deep brain stimulation to the centrome- dian (CM) nucleus of the thalamus <LATEX>\left( n = 8 , \right.</LATEX> three of which had an RNS to the CM nucleus).
uodj | 4 DISCUSSION -
k16v | We report here that in children with LGS who fail to achieve seizure control after VNS, CC has an added value, significantly improving seizure control. This is true for drop (tonic and atonic) seizures and other seizure phenotypes. CC-related morbidity was low, and complete CC was asso- ciated with higher seizure reduction rates than partial CC.
b2lm | Prior studies have reported the greater value of CC over VNS as a primary treatment for children with LGS,
ti7f | especially for atonic seizures.499 However, other studies have found similar effectiveness for both treatments.5,9,10 Additionally, VNS seems more cost-effective 1 year after surgery and is associated with fewer complications.4,10,11 However, this study did not evaluate long-term cost-effec- tiveness (considering the need for VNS battery replace- ment), which may prove CC is more cost-effective. When both options (CC and VNS) are available, many families will opt for VNS first.7 Reasons include avoidance of brain surgery, especially because the treatment is pallia- tive and not curative. This is based mainly on the fear of callosotomy-associated risks, including vascular injury, supplementary motor area syndrome, akinetic mutism, disconnection syndrome, and other risks (infection, hy- drocephalus, wound-related, and others).
oksu | Data are limited regarding secondary treatments (CC following VNS or VNS following CC). Hong et al. reported that half of the patients who underwent CC following VNS reported >50% seizure reduction, with seven of nine patients experiencing total elimination of drop seizures.12 Guillamon et al.13 reported a small case series of three patients treated with CC following VNS in severe drug-resistant epilepsy. They reported up to 98% decrease in total seizure frequency following CC. In another small series of seven cases, Arya et al.14 reported all patients were free of drop attacks, with a 34.7% decrease in total daily seizure frequency at a mean follow-up of 2.6 years. The results of the current series concur with these publications, with approximately 80% having >50% reduction in drop attacks, and 60% having >50% reduction in other seizure types.
wtow | Katagiri et al.15 evaluated 10 children who underwent VNS following failed CC, the reverse of our approach. Six of 10 (60%) patients had ≥50% seizure reduction for all residual seizure types after VNS, and 77.8% showed total resolution of drop seizures.
o22k | CC may be performed via various approaches, includ- ing interhemispheric, endoscopic-assisted (also done via the interhemispheric route), and LITT. 16-18 LITT approach is minimally invasive, associated with shorter hospitaliza- tion and fewer complications, and has similar outcomes to the open approaches.19 However, LITT is not widely avail- able, and may not be suitable for all corpus callosal anat- omy. Open CC, on the other hand, is a widely performed surgery. The microsurgical technique is common to other commonly performed procedures, and is associated with low morbidity if done by experienced surgeons.
nwfz | There is a long-lasting debate regarding the optimal extent of callosotomy between anterior, complete, and posterior callosotomy.4,20-22- The basis for this debate is the potential for disconnection syndrome.23 However, most children with LGS have profound intellectual disability at baseline, and the balance between seizure control (with
nvfy | its positive impact on the quality of life) and the risk of potential disconnection syndrome often favor the goal of seizure control.
mror | This study aim was not to compare CC to VNS as a primary treatment, but to show that VNS failure does not predict the failure of CC, and that CC as the secondary treatment can have a significant benefit.
