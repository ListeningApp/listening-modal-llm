He replaced the probability distribution p by a so-called density matrix p, and the integral by a trace.\nf3g2 | Later Shannon invented information theory, and a formula for the entropy of a probability distribution on a set (often a finite set). This is often called 'Shannon entropy'. It's just a special case of Gibbs' formula for entropy in classical statistical mechanics, but without Boltzmann's constant.\nzlrt | Later still, Kolmogorov invented a formula for the entropy of a specific string of symbols. It's just the length of the shortest program, written in bits, that prints out this string. It depends on the computer language, but not too much.\n8szg | There's a network of results connecting all these five concepts of entropy. I will first explain Shannon entropy, then entropy in classical statistical mechanics, and then entropy in thermodynamics. While this is the reverse of the historical order, it's the easiest way to go.\nhh47 | I will not explain entropy in quantum statistical mechanics: for that I would feel compelled to teach you quantum mechanics first. Nor will I explain algorithmic entropy.\nadpv | FROM PROBABILITY TO INFORMATION\nsy8a | How much information do you get when you learn an event of probability P has happened? It's\n11zj | Negative log P where we can use any base for the logarithm, usually E or two.\ndza1 | Example: Suppose I flip three coins that you know are fair. I tell you the outcome: \"heads, tails, heads\". That's an event of probability one over two to the power of three, so the information you get is\n5gil | Negative log of one over two to the power of three equals three log two or \"three bits\" for short, since log two of information is called a bit.\nn91l | Here is the simplest link between probability and information: when you learn that an event of probability P has happened, how much information do you get? We say it's negative log P. We take a logarithm so that when you multiply probabilities, information adds. The minus sign makes information come out positive.\niknb | Beware: when I write 'log' I don't necessarily mean the logarithm base ten. I mean that you can use whatever base for the logarithm you want; this choice is like a choice of units. Whatever base B you decide to use, I'll call log base B two a 'bit'. For example, if I flip a single coin that you know is fair, and you see that it comes up heads, you learn of an event that's of probability one over two, so the amount of information you learn is\n3ohm | Negative log base B of one over two equals log base B two. That's one bit! Of course if you use base B equals two then this logarithm actually equals one, which is nice.\nenn6 | To understand the concept of information it helps to do some puzzles.\nvoir | Puzzle one. First I flip two fair coins and tell you the outcome. Then I flip three more and tell you the outcome. How much information did you get?\nbxm5 | Puzzle two. I roll a fair six-sided die and tell you the outcome. Approximately how much information do you get, using logarithms base two?\n6cnd | Puzzle three. When you flip seven fair coins and tell me the outcome, how much information do I get?\nz41z | Puzzle four. Every day I eat either a cheese sandwich, a salad, or some fried rice for lunch- each with equal probability. I tell you what I had for lunch today. Approximately how many bits of information do you get?\nk1hn | Puzzle five. I have a trick coin that always lands heads up. You know this. I flip it five times and tell you the outcome. How much information do you receive?\n853d | Puzzle six. I have a trick coin that always lands heads up. You believe it's a fair coin. I flip it five times and tell you the outcome. How much information do you receive?\npx3f | Puzzle seven. I have a trick coin that always lands with the same face up. You know this, but you don't know which face always comes up. I flip it five times and tell you the outcome. How much information do you receive?\n28wa | These puzzles raise some questions about the nature of probability, like: is it sub- jective or objective? People like to argue about those questions. But once we get a probability P, we can convert it to information by computing negative log P.\n1jce | UNITS OF INFORMATION\njfbn | An event of probability one over two carries one bit of information. An event of probability one over E carries one nat of information. An event of probability one over three carries one trit of information. An event of probability one over four carries one crumb of information. An event of probability one over ten carries one hartley of information. An event of probability one over sixteen carries one nibble of information. An event of probability one over two hundred fifty-six carries one byte of information. An event of probability one over two to the power of eight one nine two carries one kilobyte of information.\ncn1a | There are many units of information. Using information equals negative log P we can relate these to probabilities. For example if you see a number in base ten, and each digit shows up with probability one over ten, the amount of information you get from each digit is one â€˜hartley'.\n0j5u | How many bits are in a hartley? Remember: no matter what base you use, I call log ten a hartley and log two a bit. There are log ten over log two bits in a hartley. This number has the same value no matter what base you use for your logarithms! If you use base two, it's\nu6dp | Log base two ten over log base two two equals log base two ten approximately three point three two. So a hartley is about three point three two bits.\nhnb4 | If you flip eight fair coins and tell me what answers you got, I've learned of an event that has probability one over two to the power of eight equals one over two hundred fifty-six. We say I've received a 'byte' of information. This equals eight bits of information. Similarly, if you flip one thousand twenty-four times eight fair coins and tell me the outcome, I receive a kilobyte of information.\n```",
