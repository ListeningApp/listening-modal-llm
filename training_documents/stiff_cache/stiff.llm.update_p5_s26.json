It has been found that the stress dependency of Quiou sand is larger than that of Toyoura and Ticino sands. In particular, the friction angle of Quiou sand decreases rapidly with an increase in the confining pressure. This is because the crushability of Quiou sand is higher than that of other sands. Therefore, the n-value of Quiou sand decreased for\n121u | eight sub A is greater than zero point zero five percent.
