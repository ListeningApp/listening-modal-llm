You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

tb74 | In addition to narcissism and paranoia, other patterns help to understand MacArthur's conduct on the eve of the fiasco. One was his constant unrealistic optimism concerning the balance of forces prior to the breakout of war, and disregard of his Asian enemies. In 1939, he doubted if "an enemy could concentrate superior forces at any vital Philippine area" and estimated that a Japanese blockade would be "practically unfeasible without the tacit agreement of the other nations surrounding the Pacific." On the eve of the attack on Pearl Harbor, he was certain that war would not start before spring. When it started, he defined the Japanese blockade on the Philippines as a "paper blockade." When the Korean War started, he was contemptuous of the fighting capabilities of the KPA, and despite their initial military achievements did not change his mind, believing that if he could put the First Cav Division into Korea, "those fellows scuddle up to the Manchurian border so quick, you would see no more of them."232
8l69 | The same pattern, considered by Halberstam as his worst professional sin, 3 dominated his strategic thinking in November 1950. Despite the reports by this stage that massive Chinese forces had deployed in Korea, and even though the CPVF soldiers proved their military effectiveness in the First Campaign, MacArthur avoided taking this factor into account when ordering the Eighth Army and the X Corps to rush to the Yalu. When assessing the four options that were available to China, he ruled out the option of full intervention because of fundamental Chinese military 4 weaknesses.234 Ridgway believed that "with the
1jyv | p. 175
olce | prize within his grasp, holding tight to his conviction that Red China was a paper tiger, MacArthur had simply closed his ears to all counsel save his own."235
erx1 | MacArthur's excessive optimism was influenced by prejudice, mirror imaging, and a belief in American air superiority as a panacea. As Halberstam emphasized, MacArthur was familiar with the traditional Chinese army of the pre-WWII era but showed no interest in the new army that Mao had built over the intervening years. Since he was certain that he knew "the mind of the Oriental," he refused to absorb that the PLA commanders and soldiers were very different from the ineffective militaries of the East that he had previously known. The PLA learned to meet its technological inferiority by primitive yet effective means, such as night movement by foot, emphasis on camouflage, and minimal use of wireless traffic. MacArthur knew nothing about it and, accordingly, he estimated that the Communist forces were "grossly overrated."236

0w8m | MacArthur's disregard of the Chinese enemy, and his inner circle's support for that attitude, explains his decision to advance northward despite the CPVF threat. But it does not suffice to explain the pressure he exerted on his subordinates, primarily Walker, to reach the Yalu as fast as possible. Here, MacArthur's record shows that exerting this kind of pressure was a pattern of his military leadership style. It was vividly seen in the Papuan Campaign, his first as the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in the Southwest Pacific area:
vcu3 | He sent order from his headquarters in Brisbane and later Port Moresby, to officers on the fighting front, often by-passing the chain of command. His dissatisfaction with the speed of the advance resulted in pressure on the Australian senior commanders, who on more than one occasion replaced lower ranked generals and brigadiers in order to satisfy the need for a quick success.
hjzj | American generals were also dismissed, and replaced by men who were more willing or able to achieve a quick finish to the fighting. MacArthur attempted to gain victory in Papua before his rivals, the Navy, could beat the Japanese in Guadalcanal in the Solomon Group.
j79f | The fighting in Papua had created disproportionate losses in dead and injured and the reason lay in MacArthur private problems. He had suffered ignominy after his Philippines loss, had marred the proud legacy of his father, 4 had abandoned his men, had enemies in the American government and armed forces, and needed to prove that he was still worthy of commanding an army.237
6tbv | During the Korean War, this pattern repeated itself twice. First, it manifested in MacArthur's urge to occupy Seoul by September 25, precisely three months after the North Korean invasion had started. Practically, the pressure to meet this date was exerted by Almond, who like MacArthur in the Papuan campaign, intervened directly in the fighting, bypassing Gen. Smith, the commander of the First Marines Division that was occupying the city. From Smith's perspective, "Almond was risking his Marines unnecessarily for a couple of extra lines in the newspapers back home because that was what his commander wanted." Smith himself, Walker and the JCS estimated that a wiser strategy was for the X Corps to cut off Seoul and advance eastward to meet the Eighth Army, thus capturing the remains of the KPA.239
xb13 | The second case of unnecessary pressure was prior to the "home-by-Christmas offensive." Its main target was Walker. One of the clearest indications for the effect it had on him was his October 26 letter to MacArthur, which explained why, in light of the CPVF counterattack, he had to stop his advance to the Yalu. Knowing MacArthur's reputation for replacing officers whom he deemed insufficient achievers, the letter explained the halt in an apologetic tone and assured MacArthur that the attack would continue: "There has never been and there is now no intention for this Army to take up or remain on a passive perimeter or any other type of defense. Every effort is being made to retain an adequate bridgehead to facilitate the resumption of the attack as soon as conditions permit."240

rut3 | By fall 1950, MacArthur reached a status that no one-not even the US president or the JCS-could oppose. Recall that MacArthur was only fired after the military defeat that had made him far weaker politically. Combined with his political ambition and his mistaken estimation of the magnitude of the Chinese threat, the combination of his character and status accounts for much of the explanation for the catastrophic outcome of the "home by Christmas offensive."
m3cp | Willoughby is the person most identified with the intelligence fiasco of November 1950 and, as Haynes argued, "The most important person to influence intelligence assessments" in the FEC and in Washington.24 Indeed, no matter what MacArthur's role was, every war plan is based on intelligence, and the US war plan to reach the Yalu was no exception. In this case, the operational plan was completely faulty because it was based on a completely mistaken intelligence picture. Willoughby was the man who personally prepared and provided it, and it was mistaken not because of lack of relevant information. The opposite is true:
mq4s | Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/book/2783/chapter/143303125 by Harvard University Library user on 05 September 2023
95el | By the end of the first week of November 1950, the FEC G-2 had enough data to identify the Chinese order of battle in North Korea and should have been able to determine that the Chinese Communists had fully committed to entering the Korean War. Rhetoric from the communist leadership in Beijing mirrored the political indoctrination and guidance given to the lowest ranking Chinese soldiers captured by the United Nations forces. One common theme stands clear: the bulk of the Chinese Communist Army deployed in Manchuria since July, 1950, had entered Korea in order to defeat the Americans before they could reach the Manchurian border.242
a0a5 | Despite his personal responsibility for one of the worst intelligence failures in American military history, Willoughby's personality and the role he played in facilitating the fiasco have not received the attention they deserved until recently. Even now, only sketchy details about him are available, and although they provide some insight into relevant key elements of his personality, they do not suffice to give us a full explanation.
gocl | Willoughby's family background is unclear. According to his official biography, he was born in 1892 under the name Adolf Tscheppe-Weidenbach, to a German Baron from Baden and an American mother, Emma Willoughby of Baltimore, Maryland. But the German weekly Der Spiegel, which investigated his ancestry in 1950, found out that there was no registry for such a birth in 1892, and that Willoughby was probably born as an illegitimate child to a German rope maker and a German mother.24 He came to the 4 United States and became an American citizen in 1910, and the same year enlisted in the army as Adolf Charles Weidenbach-the family name of his alleged rope maker father.24 He later Americanized his name to Willoughby. It is possible, then, that Willoughby fabricated a family background and, if this indeed was the case, it fit well with certain patterns of his behavior.
ob1z | According to Willoughby's official biography, in 1914, following studies at Heidelberg, the Sorbonne, and Pennsylvania College at Gettysburg, he received his bachelor of arts degree and continued his master's studies at the University of Kansas at Lawrence. Given that he left Germany at the age of eighteen, and that students were not enlisted in Heidelberg before the age of nineteen, the validity of this account is dubious as well.245 The same year he started a military career, first as a commissioned Volunteer (Reserve) officer and, then as a career infantry officer. Between mid-1917 and late 1918 he served as an aviator (flying combat missions in France) and then returned to the Infantry. Until 1940, when he joined MacArthur's headquarters in the Philippines as a supply officer, he served, among others, as a military attaché to Venezuela, Colombia, and Ecuador and at various staff schools as an instructor and lecturer. He wrote a number of books on history and military studies, and built a scholarly reputation in these fields.246
m4cb | Although Willoughby adopted an American name, his Teutonic accent, his tendency to use a monocle, his natty custom-tailored uniforms, and his aloofness made him somewhat of an anomaly among his American peers. For many of his colleagues, he was the personification of "the old-school Prussian army officer,"247 "more of von Stroheim than von Rundstedt" type.248 Even within MacArthur's ultraconservative inner
m61y | p. 179 circle, Willoughby 4 was noted for his pro-fascist inclination.24" He was an admirer of Fascist Spain and regarded Francisco Franco as "the second greatest military commander in the world."25 This inclination led MacArthur to call him "my lovable fascist,"251 but his more common nicknames for him were "Sir Charles" and "the count."

2gnm | MacArthur's relations with Willoughby, the only "Bataan Boy" that remained with him until the end of his military career in 1951, were complex. Willoughby admired MacArthur and saw him, even before they met, as the greatest military leader in US history. It is quite probable that his "doglike devotion" to his boss was not a product of sycophancy, as many believed, but of a sincere admiration. MacArthur, for his share, respected his G-2's intellect, shared with him a love of military history, allowed him unrestricted access, and was as "fanatically loyal" to him as he was to other officers from his inner circle.25 MacArthur trusted his G-2 with nonprofessional tasks as well. In 1944, when a group of conservative republican politicians considered nominating him to run for president against Roosevelt, Willoughby acted as the liaison between Senator Arthur Vandenberg and the general. In June, he was sent by MacArthur to Washington to discuss the issue with Vandenberg and other prominent republicans.253
emgw | When it came to Willoughby's service as MacArthur's G-2, the picture is less clear. By one testimony, MacArthur thought that he was "[t]he finest G-2 officer he had encountered in his fifty-odd years of service. "254 At the same time, in 1943, he paid almost no attention to "what Willoughby told him" and no operation was called off or mounted because of his intelligence, though, as the quality of intelligence improved in 1944, he paid it more attention.25 Probably the best definition for the relationship between the two was given by Drea, who wrote in his excellent study on MacArthur and intelligence in the Pacific war that Willoughby "served MacArthur unquestioningly, and in exchange MacArthur tolerated Willoughby's uneven intelligence appreciations throughout the Pacific War." Summing up MacArthur's attitude toward his G-2, he noted that 4 MacArthur "accepted Willoughby's loyalty but never confused it with exceptional competence."256
xaqt | p. 180
5rcb | Willoughby's professional record after becoming MacArthur's G-2 was a mixed bag, too. Within a short period of time (June-September, 1942), he succeeded, despite having no prior experience, in building an effective intelligence system made of three sections: a geographical and terrain section that produced the necessary information for MacArthur's operations in an unfamiliar territory; a translation and interpretation section that collected and produced information from Japanese POWs; and a Humint section that was used for collection and clandestine operations.25 The Sigint unit (Central Bureau) was outside his perimeter of responsibility and was established and directed by Spencer B. Akin. Willoughby was even excluded from seeing some of its products. 258
524j | Willoughby's record as an estimator, which is more relevant for our subject, was less bright. By Campbell's analysis, he "made nine badly flawed estimates in the Pacific War, which he later tried to cover up, whereas he was correct in only four key estimates."2" No wonder then that Willoughby's colleagues thought that he had "the best hindsight of any intelligence officer in the army," or that he was "a better historian than an intelligence officer."260
xd3m | While Willoughby's record as an intelligence estimator in WWII was dubious, three tendencies that he exhibited during his service are relevant to understand his mistakes in November 1950. The first was his tendency toward centralism, as evidenced by his attempts to gain organizational monopoly over the intelligence process and his practice of personally handling the process of making intelligence estimates. Shortly after becoming MacArthur's G-2, he dismissed Australian intelligence summaries (which proved to
