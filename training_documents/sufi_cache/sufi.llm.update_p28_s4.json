        "content": "heua | It is no accident that Sufis find that they can connect most constructively with people who are well integrated into the world, as well as having higher aims, and that those who adopt a sensible attitude towards society and life as generally known can usually absorb Sufi teachings very well indeed.\ng2u7 | You started your question with the matter of the visibility of study institutions. But the world itself, as well as special attitudes, properly understood, constitute the Sufi school. Remember the words of Maghribi, who said to a monkish individual: \"What you are seeking in your retreat I see clearly in every road and alleyway.\"\n5l9k | It is no use adding external things, say observances, to the life of someone who is carrying on too many unproductive observances. It is hopeless to add ideas to minds already too full of ideas. Study institutions may become visible when the head is more emptied of imaginings.\n5zaz | SAADI AND THE MAN WITH A FULL HEAD\npc7u | Saadi has a tale about a man, whose head was full of imagined knowledge and arrogance as a result, who went to visit Koshyar, from a great distance. Koshyar taught him nothing, saying: \"You may think yourself wise, but nothing can be put into a full pot.\"\n5554 | If you are full of pretence, Saadi continues, you are in fact empty. Become empty of fruitless ideas, he teaches, so that you may come and fill with higher perceptions, and understand real meaning.\nbijr | There is a widespread notion in non-traditional societies such as the current Western one, that their scientific base causes the people to think, for some reason, in a way different from that of \"ancient\" or \"Eastern\" peoples. Anthropologists, interestingly enough, have pointed out that human thinking habits are everywhere very similar, and that the models and assumptions used by, say, the Africans of old and the Europeans and Americans are not at all different. The fact that this expert information has not filtered down to general knowledge is in itself an indication of the contention of, for example, R. Horton, who commented on the unexamined assumptions of Western and African people thus:\ni2gp | \"The Western layman's ground for accepting the models propounded by the scientist is often no different from the young African villager's ground for accepting the models propounded by one of his elders. In both cases the propounders are deferred to as the accredited agents of tradition. As for the rules which\nxq5u | guide scientists themselves in the acceptance or rejection of models, these seldom become part of the intellectual equipment of members of the wider population. For all the apparent up-to-dateness of the content of his worldview, the modern Western layman is rarely more open or scientific in his outlook than is the traditional African villager.\"\nkbyk | Knowledge of yourself may involve, if we are learning at the present time, a knowledge of the way of thinking of your society, and to realize that you are probably its product, and that this knowledge can be attained in fact by such anthropological and psychological observations made by the Sufis in the course of their teaching how to assume new and more promising extra perspectives.\nuulj | This involves knowing more through knowing oneself; knowing oneself through knowing how one thinks about others; and \"seeing yourself with other eyes than your own\"—all ways of applying the lessons which so far in the West are mainly only being pointed out, and are not linked with attempts to further one's perceptions of what lies beyond familiar consciousness.\ne3k9 | The statement \"He who knows himself, knows his Lord\" means, among other things, that self-deception prevents knowledge. The question asks about how to attain knowledge of oneself. The first self about which to attain knowledge is the secondary, essentially false, self which stands in the way, however useful it may be for many daily transactions. It must be set aside, made something which can be used or not used, not something which uses you.\n5biw | The way in which this is done is by self-observation: registering how and when this self is operating, and how it deceives. A man once remarked, in the hearing of the Sufi ancient Junaid of Baghdad that at that time it had become difficult to find brothers.\nn108 | HOW TO FIND YOUR BROTHERS\nnyac | Junaid instantly identified the one-sidedness of this attitude. \"If you seek a brother to share your burden, brothers are in truth hard to find. But if you are in search of someone whose own burden you will yourself share, there is no scarcity of such brothers,\" he said.\n2cn1 | ANSARI ON LOOKING AT YOURSELF\nc3m1 | You want to be able to evaluate institutions of the Sufis. You want to gain knowledge of yourself. You can do the former when you have done the latter. Sheikh Abdullah Ansari, of Herat, in common with all classical Sufi teachers, insists that you must see yourself other than with your own eye, that is to say, apart from your present way of looking at things, or your fixation with this secondary self will only increase in strength and blot out objective understanding.\n9yo6 | ANALOGY OF THE GARDENER\nkiqm | Until you can see yourself clearly and constantly for what you are really like, you have to rely upon the assessment of a teacher: the gardener of Rumi's comparison:\n6n7u | \"A gardener going into an orchard looks at the trees. He knows that this one is a date, that one a fig, the other a pomegranate, a pear, or an apple. To do this, he does not have to see the fruit, only the trees.\"\ncodw | DIFFICULTIES\nsuvf | Q: What are the difficulties in the way of transmitting knowledge today in the West?\npsc6 | A: Very little different in essence, though different in appearance, from the difficulties at all times. To understand this you have to obtain some perspective.\nm69t | If, in the Middle Ages in Western Europe, you had preached, say, hygiene, what would have happened to you? You would have been seen as heretical, for a start—because only infidels washed. You would have been castigated by reputable people for assuming that you were better than they were, because you washed and they didn't. If you taught about microbes, would you have got away with it? If you used their mass media, you would have been accused of immodesty and worse; if you tried to set up your own, you would be accused of sinister intentions or worse ...\nylr1 | And equally important, who would listen to you? The freaks, the occultists, the failures who were out to find a shortcut to success ... Not the people who were to become the authorities on hygiene ... Much preliminary groundwork would have to be done, explaining assumptions, proving that bias was not reality, living down unwarranted mud-slinging.\n7xmx | RISE ABOVE YOUR OWN BARRIER\nspty | The great Sufi poet Hafiz says, and how rightly, that the difficulties are within people, for they imagine things which are really irrelevant to be important in this search: \"You yourself are your own barrier—rise from within it.\"\nfosi | THE PRIEST AND THE PUBLIC\ntsuw | People mistake information for knowledge, and one indication for another. This is mainly because they generally do not know what they want, and often think that they want something when they do not. This difficulty besets all kinds of activities in the West.\nl0hr | I have recently been talking to the priest in charge of a church in a new town development. He had carried out a careful poll of what his new parishioners wanted, what kinds of sermons, how they are to be delivered, what subjects they were interested in. This all took him several months. In the end, he had a picture of what was required and he provided the themes, treatment, and atmosphere which the people had asked for.",
