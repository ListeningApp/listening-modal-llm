You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

8r5j | ABSTRACT
2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

bg6v | www.it-ebooks.info
ek18 | 4. In the General tab, we can perform the following operations, as shown in the preceding screenshot:
hdkt | ° Select from list (A): This uses either a custom list of values, or all the values.
yyzt | ° The search box (B): We can search for a text string that is present in a dimension member.
7lvc | ° Checkboxes (C): Click on the checkboxes next to the dimensions that we want to keep or exclude.
rt7z | ° The filter (D): This sets the filter to show fewer values, which means that it shows the values that are automatically limited by the selections of other filters, and it doesn't show all the discrete values in the field.
wpui | ° All or None (E): You can select All or None, as required.
23tt | ° Exclude (F): This excludes the values that we have selected. If you are excluding values, be careful when exposing the filter to users. They might need some extra instructions about what the exclusion means and how to use it.
v3cv | ° Summary (G): This shows a summary of your selection.
o6hl | ° Reset (H): This resets all values.
pv9r | ° OK, Cancel, and Apply (I): Click on Apply and then on the OK button to filter and set worksheet.
3ujw | 5. In our example, we selected all the values and then deselected Aggregates.
ekyb | 6. Then, we clicked on OK.
09tz | The pill for Region (which is blue because it's a discrete field) is now in the Filters shelf. When you go back to the dashboard, you can add it to the worksheet.
ncf7 | The other Filter tabs allow you to further specify the members that you want to retain or exclude in the analysis. You can perform the following operations:
qd2c | 1. Establish the conditions that need to be met
in7g | 2. Use formulas to determine the members that you want to include
1sn7 | 3. Include the top or bottom members by a certain metric
bcxr | This works particularly well in graphs other than maps because users are often only concerned with the best and worst performers.

p6cq | Adding Quick Filters to a dashboard
99rc | If your worksheet is already on the dashboard, the new filter will not appear there automatically. The dashboard is laid out in a vertical column for the most part, and we do not have filters on it. Its top looks like the following screenshot:
n6d5 | We want to add the Region Quick Filter to the dashboard and then apply it to the other worksheets on the dashboard. When we add a filter (or a legend) to a dashboard that we have arranged very specifically, Tableau Public will automatically add a vertical layout container on the far right. Don't be alarmed by this. You can move filters and legends to the locations you want them to be in.
1kke | If a field is already a part of a visualization that is on a dashboard because it is one of the fields that is being displayed on the Detail or Tooltip shelves, you can add it to the dashboard by clicking on the Context menu for the visualization and then selecting it from the list of the Quick Filter options.
zp0n | In the next few exercises, we will discuss the following topics:
f9ca | . Adding the Region Quick Filter to the dashboard
yidf | . Formatting it to be a drop-down list
ysbk | . Setting it to show only the relevant values
1cv5 | . Applying it to all the worksheets on the dashboard
cst3 | . Moving it so that it's in the same container as that of the title of the dashboard
w2ec | [153 ]

bovo | In order to add and modify the Quick Filter, perform the following steps:
atnz | 1. Select the map worksheet on the dashboard by either clicking on the ocean in the map, or selecting it from the list of worksheets in the Dashboard menu to the left of the dashboard.
85ak | 2. Click on the Context menu.
gk8u | 3. Hover the pointer of the mouse over the Quick Filters and click on Region, as shown in the following screenshot:
dyg8 | 4. The Region filter will appear in a Vertical Layout Container to the far right of the dashboard. We'll move it later. It's important to be mindful of unused white space.
qoea | 5. Now, we will change the format of the quick filter. There are many options, and we want the most compact one, which is a multi-select drop-down list. Click on the Context menu of the filter and change it to show Multiple Values (Dropdown).
ed2n | 6. There are many other modifications that we can make by clicking on the Context menu of the filter. Click on the Context menu again.
3xp7 | 7. Click on Only Relevant Values so that it shows only the Regions that meet the conditions of the other filters.
2hce | 8. Apply it to the other worksheets on the dashboard that are using the same data source. From the Context menu, click on Apply to Worksheets.
12p5 | 9. In the Apply Filter to the Worksheets [Region] dialog box, click on All on Dashboard, as shown in the following screenshot, and then click on OK. Keep in mind that this only applies Quick Filters to worksheets using the same data source:
s4t5 | [ 154 ]
7ojm | www.it-ebooks.info
x0cv | Chapter 8
d5cm | The other modifications that you can make from the Context menu of the filter and which add polish and specificity to your dashboard, are as follows:
cojo | . Applying Quick Filters to worksheets allows authors to select the sheets to which the filter applies, where all the worksheets are using the same data source
lsvc | . Formatting Quick Filters gives authors control over the font faces and styles used in the title and the list of values
lfgp | . Customizing Quick Filters can remove or show the All option
y6yk | · Showing, hiding, or editing the title can prompt users to take action
477w | . Changing the display of the filter, whether it's radio buttons for short lists or multiple value drop-down lists for longer lists, enables authors to select the best format for both the data and consumers
u0zj | · Showing relevant values, also known as cascading filters, is a great way of simplifying the filtering experience for consumers so that selections in a filter determine the contents of another
lfp7 | Formatting the filter box so that it has a floating or fixed width is another feature that gives authors control over the appearance of worksheet.

um9m | Moving the Quick Filter
q90z | The quick filter is still present in the vertical container to the right that Tableau Public automatically created for it. If you have several Quick Filters and Legends, it's perfectly fine to leave them in the container. Just be conscious of how you are using white space.
0w4e | We plan to add a parameter later, but for now, we want to put this quick filter next to the title for the dashboard. The title is in a horizontal layout container already, which means that we can put other objects next to it.
0nu4 | 1. In order to drag the Quick Filter into the same horizontal layout container with the title, select the Quick Filter by clicking on it.
0x8p | 2. Hover the pointer of the mouse over the center of the Quick Filter. You can click on the area with the white hashes, which is outlined by a red box, as shown in the following screenshot:
a8ov | 3. When you get the white crosshair mouse, click on it and drag the filter into the horizontal layout container shared by the title for the dashboard. You will know that it is in the right place when the right border of the container has a shadow, as shown in following screenshot, and emphasized by the red box, as shown in the preceding screenshot:
32hh | 4. Note that the Vertical Layout Container has disappeared on its own.
0ow0 | 5. Change the filter values and see how the dashboard display changes.

e271 | Filtering across Data sources with parameters
lmdg | Although the Quick Filter can be applied to the worksheets using its data source, it can't be applied to worksheets using other data sources. In order to filter multiple data sources with one list, we need either a reference table or a parameter.
5gqf | While you can use parameters for many important functions, such as determining which worksheets appear on a dashboard, there are some disadvantages:
yg2b | · Only one value can be selected at a time
kftl | . The list of values for static parameters, and they need to be maintained manually
wulb | . Parameters are related to the Data sources through the use of calculated fields, which can be complicated to maintain
le9r | In the next few exercises, we will accomplish several tasks via the creation of three parameters. We will create parameters that integrate with calculated fields to:
34uj | · Show a single year in one graph and a range of years in another graph
u3ij | . Filter across multiple Data sources
x0aw | . Allow users to select the detail that needs to be explored
rx1a | There are a couple of key concepts about parameters that you should keep in mind as we go through this chapter:
agnr | 1. Each parameter is unique to a workbook and not to a Data source.
t1o7 | L You can copy parameters from one workbook notes to another without issues because they are not dependent on data sources.
2830 | 1
q9nf | 2. Each parameter has a name, data type, format, and value.

33ef | Chapter 8
xfue | The first task that we need to accomplish by creating a parameter involves using a Year filter for the dashboard. Two of the visualizations, namely the map and the line graph, have a Time dimension. We want to create a filter from which users can select the year. When a user selects a year, the map will be filtered to show only that year, but the line graph will show five years on either side of dashboard.
pmnr | In order to build this functionality, we will need to create three new elements. The descriptions of these elements are as follows:
7ce8 | . The Year parameter: This has a data type of INT and a range of values
qrtv | . A Calculated field: This will be used as a filter on the map so that the year that we are showing in the map matches the selection from the parameter
a7z0 | . A Second Calculated field: This will be used as a filter on the line graph that allows five years on either side of the selected year
7dsi | Let's create a Year parameter by performing the following steps:
iax1 | 1. Create a new parameter by clicking on the Context menu in the Data window or by right-clicking on the white space in the Data window and selecting Create Parameter.
61w7 | 2. Give the parameter a name that represents what you want users to do. Ensure that the name does not match any of the field names in your data source. Otherwise, this will cause issues.
nllv | 3. We named our parameter Select a Year.
bsru | 4. Select the data type of the parameter. When you are using a parameter in a Calculated field, you can convert it to different types. We want ours to be a string because Year is a string field in the Data source.
7ylr | 5. If we had selected a different type of field, we would have had to format it accordingly. One of the reasons why we left it as a string is that we won't be running the risk of displaying improperly formatted values.

85iv | 6. Select List for the Allowable values, as shown in the following screenshot:
k7w0 | 7. You have the option of populating the list from your own list of values or from one of the fields in either of the two Data sources.

j541 | The parameter lists are not updated dynamically from the fields.
z4rd | notes
0ivu | 8. Click on the Add from Field button and then select the Year field.
oxnd | 1
44ku | You only see fields of the same data type as a parameter. If there were multiple data sources in the workbook, you would see the others as well.

06l7 | Chapter 8
o1mq | 9. Now, the list of values matches that of the source field from the Data source. But from the bottom of the list of values, remove the years after 2008 because the data collected for these years is not complete. You can do this by hovering the pointer of the mouse over the row and clicking on the X that appears to the right of a values, as shown in the following screenshot:
ielb | 10. Also, keep in mind that Tableau is case-sensitive, which means that the contents of the parameter list must match the contents of the field list.
llcu | 11. The final parameter has been set to a default of 2008, as shown in the following screenshot:
4vdi | [ 161 ]
kl0p | www.it-ebooks.info
czi9 | Using parameters as Filters
a3sj | You now have a parameter that you can use to filter certain fields. In the following steps, we will create two new calculated fields-the first will filter the map to show only the Year selected, and the second will filter the line graph to show five years on either side of the Year selected:
fhkc | 1. On the map's worksheet, the first task is to create a new Calculated field called Map Year Filter.
5hcr | 2. The formula is simple; it is Boolean expression, and it tells Tableau Public that we want only the Year values that map the parameter selection, as shown in the following screenshot:
em55 | 3. Remove the filter on the Year field, which is a blue pill on the Filters shelf.
8x5q | 4. Drag this new field from the Dimensions pane to the Filters shelf and select True.
wv87 | 5. Apply this filter to the Region KPIs worksheet.
97h8 | 6. Right-click on the Select a Year parameter, which is below the Measures in the Data window, and show the parameter control.
cj29 | Next, we will create a Calculated field for the line graph that filters to show five years on either side of the parameter.

hi3b | www.it-ebooks.info
3my4 | Chapter 8
wizx | Open the worksheet with the line graph, perform the following steps to create a Calculated field:
7kbg | 1. Create a new Calculated field and name it Year + -.
8wpy | 2. In the following screenshot, we used a formula to convert both the parameter and field to integers so that we can perform mathematical functions on them. If you want to, you can create another parameter to allow users to input the number of years that they would like to see on either side and then replace the instances of 5 with it:
lev6 | 3. Click on OK.
cnqv | 4. Add this new field from the Measures pane to the Filters shelf and select True. Now, we will return to the dashboard and continue making modifications. The first thing that we want to do is show the parameter.
848r | 5. From the Context menu for the map worksheets on the dashboard, click on Parameters and then click on the Select a Year parameter.
o1ho | 6. The parameter automatically appears next to the Region Quick Filter. It would look better if the two were stacked. So, add a Vertical Layout Container to the Horizontal Container with the header and filter, and then move the Filter and parameter into it.
gd2a | 7. Add an extra 100 pixels of height to the dashboard.

ud13 | Modifying titles
aoj8 | We can modify the header of the dashboard to reflect the selection of a year as well. The title is hard-coded to identify CO2 emissions from 2008, but if we select a different year from the parameter, such as 2005, then we need to ensure that the title is updated.
1std | We can add the parameter to the title by performing the following steps:
m2cm | 1. Double-click on the title.
2syo | 2. Delete the hard-coded reference to 2008.
dxsw | 3. Click on the Insert button.
ba75 | 4. Select the parameter that we want to add, as shown in the following screenshot:
sod4 | Since this title is actually a text object on the dashboard and not a specific worksheet title, we cannot insert field values, but we can insert parameters. It's always a good idea to make it very obvious what your user is looking at so that they don't run the risk of assuming the wrong thing.
