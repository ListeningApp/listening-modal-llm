You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

z5n9 | A: This is the easiest of all questions to answer. You could probably have seen that yourself if you had phrased it differently. For the benefit of those who cannot answer it:
8a2y | The origin is in the observation of the initial austerities, etc., visibly practised by the devout. Because they have no information as to the purpose, stage of development or nature of procedure of such an individual, outward observers imagine that this must auto- matically represent the essential and invariable behaviour of the 'illuminate' (and his random spectators who are in a mimetic mood).
d8cx | It is as if an unthinking person were to see the arm-waving of a railway signalman in training and extrapolate from that the belief that
ddro | *All railwaymen must at all times, or to become experts, wave their arms;
v3lu | and
ogxy | *If the man at this level does this, the top man must do it, and perhaps if he does, twice as auspiciously.
7i6d | Malobservation, facile assumptions, mechanical reproduction of activities based on incomplete data, in any area of human activity or learning spells failure, not success. If you doubt this, test it. Plenty of organisations bear these marks.
w7sa | So, in order to correct basic mistakes we must be able to con- ceive that there might be mistakes. When this is done, further mistakes and useless procedures may be avoided.
y91y | In place of becoming a consumer of emotional stimuli, while concurrently imagining that one is experiencing spirituality, the student must be prepared to attempt those things which are pre-
53a1 | scribed for him. Both practice and test in the Sufi way are real ones. Those which centre upon appearance and fads are false ones. One such test, for those who have developed a taste for absurd- ities, is to adopt and maintain a normal life.
p032 | GOD WAS DEAD
5ts2 | Among the Sufis there is a story, related by Attar, of a dervish who applied to enter a monastery wearing black. When he was asked-by Ibn Khafif, who died about 1,000 years ago-why he was in mourning, he answered that his 'God was dead'. The people there expelled him forty times before they absorbed the fact that his 'god' - that which he had worshipped - had been bis secondary self, the conditioned personality.
gomt | Husain ibn Mansur, asked by someone 'Who is a Sufi?' answered: 'The one whose Essence is single'.
ni7z | Random Exercises
p68u | Q: Some groups of Sufis and others carry out frequent and regular exercises, 'dances', and all sorts of activities in which everyone takes part. Why do you say that one should not do the things which have brought others into high spiritual states?
kxq9 | A: First, please note that there are always plenty of people who carry out automatic processes, and they are always glad to get others to join them. If you know of any, and you want to join them, you will be likely to do so. If you do, you can make your own test of whether this is the best way of going about things. In other words, why are you here if you can get these things else- where?
6aag | Secondly, assuming that you are here because you want first to compare what we say with what other people say, I can only repeat that what suits one person at one time does not inevitably suit another.
luhe | LANGUAGE OF BIRDS
bhf8 | There is a story which preserves this by analogy. A worthy man once prayed that he might know the language of the birds. One day when he was sitting quietly under a certain tree with a birds' nest in it, he realised that he could follow the meaning of their chirruping. One bird was telling another that the king's son was ill, and that human beings were so stupid that nobody knew that by giving him lemon-water he would be saved. The man immedi- ately went to the royal Court, where he found that the young prince was indeed ill, and his life was despaired of. He prescribed lemon-water, and the prince recovered. The king ordered that the 'doctor' be rewarded with as much gold as he wanted.
ue9y | Now this worthy man had a friend who was very unworthy indeed, and he confided to him the way in which he had become rich. So the unworthy man prayed that he might be able to
u01l | understand the language of the birds, as he wanted to become rich like his friend. The faculty developed in him. Sitting under a tree, he heard the birds talking. They said: "Under this tree is sitting an unworthy man, who wants our secrets. We shall let him have one of them. It is that at this very moment a ravenous tiger, whom we have called from the jungle to eat him up, is advancing upon him.'
7fuj | As he stood up to run, the unworthy man was seized by the tiger and devoured.
9j6k | Why should one not do the things which have brought others into high spiritual states, the questioner asks. If one were a machine, and if all people and situations were alike, if people were pieces of wood to be shaped: of course one should neglect all the manifold attendant circumstances and apply exercises randomly ...
azkg | This question implies that everything is always the same. Reflec- tion might well have told our questioner otherwise, if he had but turned the question around, so as to use his own thinking capa- cities. By turning the matter over in one's mind, the question might become:
tkwl | 'Under what circumstances would it be true that random exercises should not be carried out, or mechanical imitation should be shunned?'
o4qt | One very good reason not to 'steal' exercises and apply them randomly (which means without insight and knowledge) is that this can have the same sort of effect, in its own sphere, as other, more familiar, forms of 'theft.' Sometimes this - as in the example I am now going to give you - carries its own penalty.
a0vw | Here is the parallel, and, humorous though it may be from one point of view (you should laugh at it and look for the additional dimension of instruction) it is a good equivalence of what can happen to people who adopt metaphysical things and then wonder what has happened to them: or why nothing has happened:
y259 | WHAT HE STOLE
xueh | A newspaper [The London Daily Telegraph, 27 October 1976, p. 17, column 4] reports that a housebreaker stole a local coun- cillor's cheque book and identification pass and used them in shops.
9v46 | His intention was to get money and goods. What did he get?
rqly | His defence lawyer explained in Court. In every single one of the nine shops which he visited, identifying himself as the coun- cillor, he was assailed by complaints about the public services. 'At one stage, to get out of a shop, he even left his telephone number for a lady shop assistant to contact him about the transfer of a house.'
73dx | He was found guilty of forgery and housebreaking: but the disparity between his expectation and the reality was due to the fact that he made assumptions about what would be likely to happen if he did certain things: and his ignorance was his undoing.
npd9 | If people know about the effects of these exercises, they do not need to ask such questions as we have here. If they do not, it cannot be explained to them better than through an allegory such as this, taken from real life.
qn13 | I like the headline to the account. It is: 'The thief who stole another man's burden.'
xpix | IF IN DOUBT, HAVE THEM OUT
mye5 | Random exercises are more likely than not to have the effect which taking Mulla Nasrudin's advice would have had, in this example of his wisdom:
50ll | 'Nasrudin, you are a man of experience,' said a philosopher; 'Have you heard of a cure for aching eyes? I read a lot, and mine are giving me trouble.'
