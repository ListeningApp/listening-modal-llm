You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

8u4f | <LATEX>\int _ { - \infty } ^ { \infty } \chi _ { S } \left( x \right) d x</LATEX> where <LATEX>\chi _ { S } \left( x \right)</LATEX> is 1 for <LATEX>x \in S</LATEX> and 0 for <LATEX>x \notin S .</LATEX> Indeed, people often get sloppy and say <LATEX>d x</LATEX> 'is' Lebesgue measure, and I may do that too. By the way, Lebesgue measure is one where we cannot take <LATEX>\mathcal{M}</LATEX> to be the collection of all subsets of
5bai | <LATEX>\mathbb{R} .</LATEX> There is an extensive theory of measures. We will not need it here, but if you're interested, you can try a book like Halsey Royden's Real Analysis, where I learned the basics myself, or Terry Tao's <LATEX>A n</LATEX> Introduction to Measure <LATEX>T h e o r y ,</LATEX> which has a legal free version online.
2z5m | Here are some puzzles about measures.
63p4 | Puzzle 10. Let <LATEX>X</LATEX> be any set and define <LATEX>\mathcal{M}</LATEX> to be the collection of all subsets of <LATEX>X .</LATEX> Show that there is a measure <LATEX>m : \mathcal{M} \rightarrow \left[ 0 , \infty \right]</LATEX> called counting measure such that for any <LATEX>S \subset X ,</LATEX> <LATEX>m \left( S \right)</LATEX> is the number of elements of <LATEX>S ,</LATEX> <LATEX>\infty</LATEX> <LATEX>S</LATEX> is infinite.
lvik | Puzzle 11. Let <LATEX>X</LATEX> be any set and define <LATEX>\mathcal{M}</LATEX> as before. Suppose <LATEX>p \quad i s \quad a \quad p r o b a b i l i t y</LATEX> distribution on <LATEX>X ,</LATEX> meaning a function <LATEX>p : X \rightarrow \left[ 0 , \infty \right)</LATEX> with <LATEX>\sum _ { i \in X } p \left( i \right) = 1 .</LATEX> Show that there is a probability measure <LATEX>m : \mathcal{M} \rightarrow \left[ 0 , \infty \right]</LATEX> such that for any
16a3 | <LATEX>S \subset X ,</LATEX> <LATEX>m \left( S \right) = \sum _ { i \in S } p \left( i \right) .</LATEX> In this situation we usually write <LATEX>p \left( i \right)</LATEX> as <LATEX>p _ { i }</LATEX> and call it the probability of the outcome <LATEX>i \in X .</LATEX> For any <LATEX>S \subseteq M</LATEX> we call <LATEX>m \left( S \right)</LATEX> the probability of the event
49ye | <LATEX>S .</LATEX> In the next puzzles <LATEX>X</LATEX> is any set, <LATEX>\mathcal{M}</LATEX> obeys the three rules for a collection of mea- surable subsets of <LATEX>X ,</LATEX> and <LATEX>m : \mathcal{M} \rightarrow \left[ 0 , \infty \right]</LATEX> is a measure.

yusd | <LATEX>\mathcal{M} .</LATEX> Puzzle 13. Show that if <LATEX>S ,</LATEX> <LATEX>T \in \mathcal{M}</LATEX> then the intersection <LATEX>S \cap T</LATEX> is in
noq3 | <LATEX>\mathcal{M} .</LATEX> Puzzle 14. Show that if <LATEX>S _ { i } \in \mathcal{M}</LATEX> for <LATEX>i = 1 , 2 , \ldots .</LATEX> then the intersection <LATEX>\bigcap _ { i = 1 } ^ { \infty } S _ { i }</LATEX> is in <LATEX>\mathcal{M} .</LATEX> Puzzle 15. Show that if <LATEX>S ,</LATEX> <LATEX>T \in \mathcal{M}</LATEX> and <LATEX>S \subseteq T</LATEX> then
kdhu | <LATEX>m \left( S \right) \leq m \left( T \right) .</LATEX> Puzzle 16. Show that if <LATEX>S _ { i } \in \mathcal{M}</LATEX> for <LATEX>i = 1 , 2 , \ldots .</LATEX> then
o8es | <LATEX>m \left( \bigcup _ { i = 1 } ^ { \infty } S _ { i } \right) \leq \sum _ { i = 1 } ^ { \infty } m \left( S _ { i } \right) .</LATEX> Puzzle 17. Show that if <LATEX>m</LATEX> is a probability measure and <LATEX>S \in \mathcal{M}</LATEX> then
2k63 | <LATEX>0 \leq m \left( S \right) \leq 1 .</LATEX> One of the main uses of a measure <LATEX>m</LATEX> on a space <LATEX>X</LATEX> is that it lets us integrate certain functions <LATEX>f : X \rightarrow \mathbb{R} .</LATEX> Alas, not all functions! It's only reasonable to try to integrate measurable functions <LATEX>f : X \rightarrow \mathbb{R} ,</LATEX> which have the property that if <LATEX>S \subseteq \mathbb{R}</LATEX> is measurable, its inverse image <LATEX>f ^ { - 1 } \left( S \right) \subseteq X</LATEX> is measurable. And even measurable functions can cause trouble, because when we try to integrate them we might get <LATEX>+ \infty ,</LATEX> <LATEX>- \infty ,</LATEX> or something even worse. For example, what's
p1p2 | <LATEX>\int _ { - \infty } ^ { \infty } x ^ { 2 } \sin x d x ?</LATEX> There's no good answer. We say a function <LATEX>f : X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}</LATEX> is integrable if it is measurable and its integral over <LATEX>X ,</LATEX> defined in a certain way I won't explain here, gives a well-defined real number.
