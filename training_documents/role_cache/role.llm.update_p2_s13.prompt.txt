You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.

These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

8uji | Pattern of flesh firmness and crispness at harvest and post-harvest
df3e | Regarding the changes in flesh firmness and crispness during cold storage, three extremity dynamics were distinctly observed. Type I: acceptable flesh firmness (7.0 kg/cm2) or crispness (0.7 kg/cm2) lost already at harvest. Type II: acceptable flesh firmness or crispness maintained until the sixth month after a rapid softening during the first month of cold storage. Type III: acceptable flesh firmness or crispness maintained after the sixth months of cold storage with constantly slow softening rate (Figure 1c,d). Ethylene production in type I hybrids was higher than that in types II and III during cold storage, whereas type III hybrids produced lowest level of ethylene (Figure 1e,f). These suggested that low ethylene emission was associated with flesh firmness and crispness retainability.
53eu | QTL identification using BSA-seq
a5u1 | By the three segregant bulks from the three phenotype types of flesh firmness retainability (Figure S3a), 10, 5 and 17 significant QTLs for flesh firmness retainability were identified from bulk pairs of type III vs. type I, type III vs. type II, and type II vs. type I, respectively. These QTLs were located on chromosomes 3, 11, 12, 15, 16 and 17 (Figure S4a,b,c; Table S2). Of these QTLs, F-F03.2
ry7u | and F-H03.1 overlapped at 28.5-29.8 Mb of chromosome 3, while F-Z16.1, F-F16.1, F-H16.1 and F-H16.2 overlapped at 38.4- 39.5 Mb of chromosome 16 (Figure S5a,b; Table S2). From the three bulks of flesh crispness retainability (Figure S3b), 8, 11, and 11 QTLs were mapped from bulk pairs of type III vs. type I, type II vs. type I, and type III vs. type II, respectively. These QTLs were

Similarly, C- F16.1, C-H16.1 and C-H16.3 overlapped at 38.4-39.5 Mb of chromosome 16 (Figure S5a,b; Table S2). In addition, several QTLs for flesh firmness retainability on chromosome 3 and 16
r8sm | overlapped with those for flesh crispness retainability, such as F-F03.2/F-H03.1/C-H03.1/C-F03.2/C-F03.3 at 28.4-29.8 Mb of chromosome 3 (Figure S5a,b; Table S2). The overlap of these QTLs indicated the genetic linkage between flesh firmness and crispness retainability.

As expected, a clear transcriptomic signature of both the flesh firmness type I and the flesh crispness type I hybrids was the 2.18- to 56.19-fold high expression of cell wall degradation-related genes. These genes included MdBGL (MD00G1075400 and MD11G1023900), MdBGAL (MD15G1220900 and MD15G1221000) and MdBGLU (MD03G1215300) (Figure S6a,b; Tables S4 and S5). On the contrary, the expression of four cell wall-associated genes was significantly higher (2.26- to 9.10-fold difference) in flesh crispness retainable type III and type II hybrids than in crispness unretainable type I hybrids, that is MdPGIP12 (MD05G1002900), MdGLCAT14B (MD02G1033100), MdGWD1 (MD16G1097800) and a cellulolyase gene (MD17G1249600) (Figure S6b; Tables S4 and S5).
