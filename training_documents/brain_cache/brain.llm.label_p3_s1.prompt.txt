You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

gy8c | 2.3. Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire
y4mj | The Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ; Baer et al., 2006) is a 39-item scale to measure five factors of mindfulness: Observing (attending to or noticing internal and external stimuli, such as sensations, emotions, cognitions, sights, sounds, and smells), describ- ing (noting or mentally labeling these stimuli with words), acting with awareness (attending to one's current actions, as opposed to behaving automatically or absent-mindedly), non-judging of inner experience (refraining from evaluation of one's sensations, cognitions, and emotions) and non-reactivity to inner experience (allowing thoughts and feeling to come and go, without attention getting caught up in them). Responses to the items are given on a 5-point Likert-type scale <LATEX>\left( 1 = \mathrm { n e v e r } \right.</LATEX> or very rarely true, <LATEX>5 = \mathrm { v e r y }</LATEX> often or always true). The five subscales have shown adequate to good internal consistency (Baer et al., 2006). Usable data from both time-points were obtained from 14 MBSR and 14 control participants.
vpgq | 2.4. MRI data collection and analysis
ousl | All participants were scanned at the Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging in Charlestown, MA. MBSR participants were scanned during the 2 weeks before (Pre) and after (Post) participation in the program. Control participants were also scanned twice, approximately 2 months apart. There was an average time of 56.25 days (S.D .: 4.5 days) in between scanning sessions for the MBSR group and 65.67 days (S.D .: 11.22 days) for the control group. High-resolution MRI data were acquired with a Siemens Magnetom Avanto 1.5 T scanner with standard head coil. Data sets of the whole brain were collected using a T1 weighted MPRAGE-sequence, consisting of 128 sagittal slices <LATEX>\left( 1 . 0 \times 1 . 0 \times 1 . 3 m m \right. ,</LATEX> <LATEX>\mathrm { T I } = 1 0 0 0 \mathrm { m s }</LATEX> <LATEX>T E = 3 . 3 9 \quad m s ;</LATEX> <LATEX>\left. T R = 2 7 3 0 \quad m s \right) .</LATEX> Image analysis was performed with voxel-based morphometry (VBM) tools within the Statistical Para- metric Mapping (SPM5) neuroimaging statistical software (Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, London, www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/ spm/software/spm5/) based in MATLAB 7.1, release 14 (Mathworks Inc., Natick, MA, USA), using default settings unless otherwise specified. VBM permits an automated voxel-wise whole brain statistical comparison of MRI scan (Ashburner and Friston, 2000). Images were manually aligned to the anterior commissure and then segmented into gray and white matter in native space (i.e., before normalization, using the 'Native Space' segmentation option imple- mented in SPM5). For each individual, the (unmodulated) gray matter segmentations of the Pre and Post images were spatially registered. Normalization parameters were calculated for the <LATEX>P r e</LATEX> scan and were applied to both time-points (trilinear interpolation, <LATEX>\left. 2 \times 2 \times 2 m m \right) ,</LATEX> to make sure that regional differences between the images were not removed by scan-specific spatial normalization (Driemeyer et al., 2008; Ilg et al., 2008). Images were smoothed using an 8-mm full width at half maximum Isotropic Gaussian Kernel.
m4ju | We computed exploratory whole brain analyses as well as region of interest (ROI) analyses. The ROI contained the bilateral hippocampi and bilateral insulae and was created using the WFU Pickatlas software (Maldjian et al., 2003) and based on the parcellation of Tzourio-Mazoyer et al. (2002). A paired t-test within the MBSR group was first performed in SPM5, in order to identify those brain regions with significantly increased gray matter concentration following participation in the MBSR program. Since our ROI analysis was spatially focused, we chose to correct for multiple comparisons within the ROI (bilateral hippocampi and insulae) using the voxel- wise method implemented in SPM5. Given the very large number of voxels in the whole brain analysis, a voxel-wise method for
a0mb | preventing false positives seemed too conservative and leads to a substantial loss of statistical power (Forman et al., 1995; Friston et al., 1996). We therefore chose to use a cluster-wise method for the exploratory whole brain analysis and corrected for multiple compar- isons across the entire brain using the method implemented in SPM5 (Friston et al., 1994). In order to exceed the threshold of <LATEX>P < 0 . 0 5 ,</LATEX> clusters had to exceed a size of 250 voxels. Statistical parametric maps were initially thresholded with <LATEX>P = 0 . 0 1 ,</LATEX> uncorrected. P- <LATEX>\mathrm { v a l u e s } < 0 . 0 5 ,</LATEX> corrected for multiple comparisons, were considered significant for both the exploratory whole brain analysis as well as the ROI analysis.
ki8m | Following the paired <LATEX>t</LATEX> t-test within the MBSR group, follow-up tests were then conducted within the identified regions to test for significance compared with the control group. Values from the identified clusters were extracted for each person and each time- point using the Marsbar toolbox (Brett et al., 2002). A repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was then performed for each cluster in the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS), with group (MBSR and control group) as the between-subjects factor and time-point (Pre and Post) as the within-subjects factor. Since groups were not identical in age and gender, these variables were controlled by entering them as nuisance variables.
km8w | 3. Results
wzno | 3.1. Amount of mindfulness practice
xagm | MBSR participants reported spending an average of 22.6 h (S.D .: 6.3 h) engaged in formal homework exercises over the 8-week course (average =27 min per day). In detail, the amount of body scan practice ranged between 335 and 1002 min (mean: 699 min, S.D .: 217 min), yoga between 103 and 775 min (mean: 327 min, S.D .: 194 min), and sitting meditation between 0 and 755 min (mean: 332 min, S.D .: 211 min). The three measures were not significantly correlated with each other: body scan and yoga: <LATEX>r = - \quad 0 . 0 4 2 ,</LATEX> <LATEX>P = 0 . 8 7 ;</LATEX> body scan and sitting: <LATEX>r = - \quad 0 . 2 6 ,</LATEX> <LATEX>P = 0 . 3 3 ;</LATEX> yoga and sitting:

uooz | Repeated measures ANOVAs confirmed significant group-by-time interactions for three of the five mindfulness subscales (acting with awareness: <LATEX>F \left( 1 , 2 6 \right) = 1 6 . 8 7 ,</LATEX> <LATEX>P < 0 . 0 0 1 ;</LATEX> observing: <LATEX>F \left( 1 , 2 6 \right) = 7 . 0 9 ,</LATEX> <LATEX>P = 0 . 0 1 3 ;</LATEX> non-judging: <LATEX>F \left( 1 , 2 6 \right) = 4 . 6 1 ,</LATEX> <LATEX>P = 0 . 0 4 1 ;</LATEX> describing: <LATEX>F</LATEX> <LATEX>\left( 1 , 2 6 \right) = 1 . 9 5 ,</LATEX> <LATEX>P = 0 . 1 7 5 ;</LATEX> non-reactivity: <LATEX>F \left( 1 , 2 6 \right) = 2 . 7 9 ,</LATEX> <LATEX>\left. P = 0 . 1 0 7 \right) .</LATEX> Paired t-tests confirmed significant increases in the MBSR group (acting with awareness: <LATEX>t \left( 1 3 \right) = 3 . 6 6 5 ,</LATEX> <LATEX>P = 0 . 0 0 3 ;</LATEX> observing: <LATEX>t \left( 1 3 \right) = 4 . 2 1 8 ,</LATEX> <LATEX>P = 0 . 0 0 1 ;</LATEX> non-judging: t <LATEX>\left( 1 3 \right) = 3 . 5 8 0 ,</LATEX> <LATEX>\left. P = 0 . 0 0 3 \right) ,</LATEX> but not the control group (observing: <LATEX>t \left( 1 3 \right) = - \quad 0 . 6 9 8 ,</LATEX> <LATEX>P = 0 . 4 9 8 ;</LATEX> acting with awareness: <LATEX>t</LATEX> <LATEX>\left( 1 3 \right) = -</LATEX> <LATEX>1 . 9 9 1 , P = 0 . 0 6 8 ;</LATEX> non-judging: <LATEX>t \left( 1 3 \right) = 0 . 6 5 7 ,</LATEX> <LATEX>P = 0 . 5 2 3 ;</LATEX> two- tailed). That is, MBSR participants significantly increased their mindfulness scores on these three scales.
pxbq | 3.3. Gray matter changes in a priori regions of interest
jfsr | The paired t-test within the MBSR group identified a small cluster in the left hippocampus with (peak voxel MNI coordinates <LATEX>x , y , z : - \quad 3 6 , - 3 4 , - 8 ; t \left( 1 5 \right) = 6 . 8 9 ;</LATEX> voxel level <LATEX>P = 0 . 0 1 4 ,</LATEX> corrected for multiple comparisons with FWE correction; cluster size <LATEX>k = 3 0 ;</LATEX> Fig. 1). The averaged gray matter concentration within this cluster was then extracted for each individual at each time-point using the Marsbar toolbox and further analyses were performed in SPSS. A repeated measures ANOVA (two groups <LATEX>5 \times</LATEX> two time-points; age and gender as nuisance variables) showed a significant groupxtime interaction (F (1,29) =4.92; <LATEX>\left. P = 0 . 0 3 5 \right) .</LATEX> There was no difference in gray matter concentration within this cluster between the two groups at the Pre time-point (2-

P = 0 . 7 3 6 \right) .</LATEX> Pre to Post changes in the other regions of interest were not significant, and changes in the a priori regions were also not correlated with the amount of mindfulness homework practice or with changes in the FFMQ. Furthermore, we performed a paired t-test within the control group in SPM5 and applied the same thresholds. No significant voxels were associated with increase or decrease in gray matter concentration from Pre to Post in the control group. To summarize, analyses of gray matter concentration changes in the ROI analysis supported significant increases in the left hippocampus in the MBSR group, confirming that structural changes in this region are detectable within 8 weeks following the participation in this mind- fulness training program.

ylhz | Exploratory analysis of the entire brain (paired <LATEX>t</LATEX> t-test in SPM5) revealed four clusters with significantly greater gray matter concentration at the Post compared with the Pre time-point in the MBSR group (Table 2). One cluster was located in the posterior
