You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

3g9w | It is difficult, for me, to look out at "emerging practice" when "current practice" remains nebulous. As an educator, I see students of all ages who are unfamiliar with OT and its role. If OT practice in "emerging practice" helps identify the role of OT for all involved parties, let the research begin!
d09o | Equally important was the deliberation about the greater risk to the profession from the development of emerging practice. One participant questioned, "Are we making a big mistake professionally as we decide to move away from [the] medical model towards a more social work/social justice model-what will we gain [or] lose? Immediately and [for the] long term."
ylhz | Rewards and Challenges of Emerging Practice
a3td | All 174 participants were asked to identify the rewards and challenges of emerging practice; 163 (93.7%) valid responses were received. Re- sponses to the question were organized into themes that were inclusive of all comments provided by the participants. Participants identified mul- tiple rewards and benefits to emerging practice. The narrative analysis resulted in the following themes: (a) rewards for the profession, (b) re- wards for clients, and (c) rewards for individual practitioners as shown in Table 3.
ex5k | The rewards of emerging practice for the profession and its clients were many; however, the theme of individual rewards for the occupa- tional therapy practitioner yielded the greatest number of responses. En- gagement in emerging practice offered distinct benefits to the therapist,

5esx | TABLE 3. Thematic Findings: Rewards and Challenges of Emerging Practice
m5ka | both tangible and intangible. Financial benefits stem primarily from work- ing outside the third-party reimbursement system that tightly regulates the provision of services. One respondent identified a reward as "getting paid for more than just actual 'face time' with clients." Other financial gains were related to career opportunities resulting from the develop- ment of emerging practices. Nonmonetary rewards stemmed from facil- itating student growth and development in emerging practice roles and collaboration with community members. One respondent described this further:
byu8 | Seeing real change. Disengaging from the belief that we provide the change. Learning that change comes from partnership and community and then finding deep pleasure in connecting with that community. Letting ourselves off the professional hook. Instead of pushing the medical mountain we can swim in the river of community-knowing that our efforts are complimented by those we work with.
76b0 | Nineteen respondents identified those in emerging practice as pioneers, trailblazers, or innovators who follow their passion to create new cutting- edge practice niches for the profession. Respondents elaborated by describ- ing the elements for success in these endeavors to include persuasiveness, leadership, and innovation.
zxz6 | The themes associated with the challenges of emerging practice pre- sented a number of facets. By far, the most frequently identified concerns and barriers associated with emerging practice were funding and reim- bursement for services. If third-party payers reimburse for services in emerging practice settings, reimbursement rates are often lower than for services provided within medical facilities. Additionally, obtaining reim- bursement was perceived to be an "uphill battle" with greater justification and skillful documentation often required from therapists for their services. Developing and implementing effective marketing programs was a strategy identified to obtain payment for services.
xnth | The challenge associated with identifying and protecting the profes- sion's appropriate domain and scope of practice included the concern from other health professionals that the services provided by the occupational therapists were similar or duplicative to their own. Respondents related this concern, in part, to a general lack of understanding about the value of occupational therapy services, thereby requiring continuous efforts to educate other professionals, families, and community members. The con- cern for the occupational therapy domain of practice also related to an incompatibility with professional regulatory and licensure issues. One ex- ample of this perceived incompatibility was the struggle with maintaining the continuing education requirements for state practice acts as well as gaining the specific knowledge and skills required for emerging practice. Additionally, the definitions of occupational therapy services delineated in practice acts may be too narrow in focus thereby creating potential ethical and legal implications. One practitioner described these challenges as:
vafm | Other OTs "don't get it" and when OT regulatory agencies don't rec- ognize the practice as "real" OT, there are problems with maintaining licensure. In my practice [rehabilitation counselor and disability case manager], maintaining my OT license is required for maintaining the other certification required for my current practice. Since most of the continuing education relevant to my practice is not accepted for my state's OT licensure renewal (although most of the OT-specific contin- uing education I take is recognized by my other certifications-they are a lot more open-minded), I need to spend a lot of money and take
2zmw | Holmes and Scaffa
bf9k | time off for continuing education that has no practical application value for me.
otkr | In addressing the role of occupational therapy educational programs and student participation, participants articulated the concern for academic preparation, student supervision, and ongoing mentoring at emerging prac- tice settings where occupational therapists are not available on a full-time basis. A final challenge for the profession is to conduct and disseminate research on emerging practice that provides evidence of its efficacy in a timely manner.
ibgs | Much as reimbursement for services was perceived as a barrier to emerg- ing practice for the profession, financial concerns of the individual therapist contributed to the challenges of emerging practice. In particular, the salary and benefits offered in emerging settings, particularly community organi- zations with limited funding, often cannot match those of positions held by occupational therapists in health care settings. A number of identified challenges related to the effort and perseverance to develop new practices. A respondent cautioned, "It usually takes a long time to 'find' your 'niche' and to develop your role to a point where you feel you are making a dif- ference." The final broad theme of challenge to the individual practitioner was one of professional isolation. The drawbacks to being an innovator and practicing autonomously can include a lack of professional support networks, role models, and mentors.
colo | Survey Respondents in Emerging Practice
d6r4 | Fifty-seven respondents identified themselves as providing occupational therapy or occupational therapy-related services in an emerging practice setting or role. The services provided and populations served were very diverse and often specialized in nature. Numerous reported services- including low vision, driver evaluation and training, ergonomic evaluation and consultation, and health promotion and lifestyle redesign services-are often identified as emerging practice in the profession's literature. Other reported services included assistive technology services, home evaluation and modification, caregiver education, psychosocial, and pediatric services. The populations receiving services from the respondents in emerging roles or settings were individuals of all ages as well as specialized populations including children with chronic disabilities, prospective international adop- tive children, students of all ages, at-risk youth, pregnant teens and teen mothers, well elderly, older adults in subsidized or public housing, and low income or at-risk elderly. Table 4 presents the number of years respondents

7wn9 | DISCUSSION
wcd0 | The survey results represent findings of occupational therapists from diverse backgrounds, professional roles, and experiences. As a pilot study, the results cannot be generalized to represent the perspective of all occu- pational therapists. However, two broad areas of discussion are relevant. First, the respondents held wide-ranging views about the nature and scope of emerging practice and its current and future role within the profes- sion. Without a common definition of emerging practice, the descriptions of emerging practice, as well as the practice settings and services identi- fied by the survey respondents, were wide ranging. Many of the settings and roles reflect those identified within the professional literature and by AOTA's Centennial Vision (2003). The most common descriptor of emerg- ing practice was nontraditional, and this term held multiple meanings for the respondents. Community-based settings and services were identified as offering the opportunity to provide services that are occupation-based, holistic, and congruent with the philosophical roots and values of the profession. However, these and other descriptions of emerging practice confirmed therapists perceived emerging opportunities for services very
caos | Holmes and Scaffa
qrvy | broadly, and the differentiation between emerging or established occupa- tional therapy practices was not always evident.
pn9j | Philosophically, some respondents viewed the term emerging practice as a misnomer. Emerging practice was perceived as a resurgence of pre- vious roles and practice settings or a natural evolution in the profession rather than a new phenomenon within the profession. Among the divergent views about emerging practice, participants questioned whether emerging practice is potentially detrimental to the profession and its future. While some respondents thought it to be a critical element of the profession's transformation from the medical model to community-based practices and alternative models of service delivery (Baum, 2000; Scaffa, 2001), others suggested it serves to further confuse occupational therapy practitioners, other professionals, and the public about the profession's identity and scope of practice. This dichotomy of opinions appears to characterize Bruhn's (1993) description of the "boundary dilemma" (p. 26) within the profession regarding the expansion of practice beyond the medical and rehabilitation environments. The study results indicate there is a degree of uncertainty about whether the profession's domain of practice should include the de- livery of services outside the health care arena.
1pmc | Are the views of emerging practice and its role within the profession held by the study participants significant and representative of the profession at large? One possible answer may be found in the theory of paradigm shifts. According to Kuhn (1996), paradigm shifts follow a predictable process within a profession. During the preparadigm stage, proposed changes to the common values and practices of a profession are discussed among its mem- bers. As a new paradigm emerges, unsettlement and change often leads to a period of crisis until the new paradigm is adopted. If the profession of occupational therapy is indeed undergoing a paradigm shift to its third paradigm (Kielhofner, 2004) with a return to a focus on the occupational nature of humans and occupation-based practice (Baum, 2000; Gilfoyle, 1984; Grady, 1990; Jacobs, 2002a, 2002b), then perhaps the perceptions, opinions, and questions about emerging practice are inherent within the transition of paradigms. As Kielhofner observed, a paradigm shift repre- sents a crises within a profession because its "members find it unsettling to abandon the way of thinking and doing that the paradigm provides. In everyday language, we might say that a paradigm shift represents a change of both mind and heart" (p. 29). Emerging practice, as described by the small sample in this study, could be viewed as a component of the paradigm shift within the profession.
5z6q | Second, emerging practice presents opportunities for professional growth and satisfaction as well as significant barriers to its advancement.
yeoh | The many rewards and challenges of emerging practice are both intrinsic and extrinsic in nature. Respondents provided multiple examples of the opportunities emerging practice offers for professional growth and satis- faction including demonstrating the value of the profession and seeing the positive results of their work with clients. As well, for many practitioners, being on the forefront of a practice area provided welcome opportunities for creativity, independence, and collaboration with other professionals, service providers, and community members.
b8hf | At the same time, the challenges experienced in emerging practice ap- pear to be formidable. The results indicate a common barrier is obtaining funding for services in settings in which third-party reimbursement is un- available. Additionally, occupational therapy practitioners often need to acquire skills in marketing, business management, and program develop- ment, which necessitate a commitment of time and financial resources. Participants also identified the issues of professional regulation, scope of practice, professional isolation, and a lack of sufficient evidence-based research as significant challenges to establishing and maintaining a suc- cessful emerging practice. Similar obstacles have been noted by other oc- cupational therapy practitioners seeking to provide services in new areas of practice (Brownson, 1998; Jacobs, 2002b; Loukas, 2000). While acknowl- edging the challenges associated with developing innovative services in community settings, Loukas offered five models to guide therapists in es- tablishing opportunities for clients to improve occupational performance in "real-life environments" (p. 3) based on successful examples within the profession across a variety of settings. The diversity of these service de- livery models present opportunities for therapists to identify one that best matches the need of the clients to be served with the knowledge and skills of the practitioner.
hntf | Implications
99fo | Continuing professional dialogue and the development of a position paper on emerging practice by AOTA may assist practitioners and aca- demicians alike in reaching consensus about the fundamental issues re- lated to the role of emerging practice within the profession, its required competencies, and future course. Ultimately, the continuance and growth of emerging practice will depend on thoughtful decisions and the ongoing support of the profession's members.
y5r7 | While the participants in the current study addressed the value found in mentoring occupational therapy students in emerging practices, the limited

863b | number of occupational therapists in emerging practice settings has impli- cations for preparing occupational therapy graduates for future practice. In a recent study of Level I fieldwork, Johnson, Koenig, Piersol, Santalucia, and Wachter-Schultz (2006) linked the increasing frequency of supervision by nonoccupational therapy personnel to an increasing number of emerg- ing practice settings. Among the health professions, a shared concern for the preparation and support of clinical/fieldwork educators or preceptors who supervise students in clinical and community settings is contribut- ing to the development of new program and curricular models (Marriott et al., 2005; Turnock, Moran, Scammell, Mallik, & Mulholland, 2005). As well, a variety of models for student supervision in practice settings are being implemented and evaluated. Collaborative (more than one student per supervisor), interdisciplinary (supervision provided by a professional outside of a student's discipline), and multiple mentoring (two or more students mentored by two or more clinicians) are three models applied to fieldwork experiences (Bartholomai & Fitzgerald, 2007; Strohschein, Hagler, & May, 2002). Continued development of supervision models and strategies will be necessary to educate and support occupational ther- apy and nonoccupational therapy personnel alike to meet the supervi- sory and mentoring needs of occupational therapy students for emerging practice.
fj24 | Greater information dissemination about emerging practice activities and outcomes through electronic and other media could address the sense of isolation voiced by practitioners in this study. More frequent topic- specific articles in the professional literature could assist the profession in further understanding the new directions in practice and models of service delivery. While the AOTA SISs and associated quarterly newslet- ters address a breadth of practice areas, a specific SIS for emerging or community-based practices may allow therapists to more easily network and collaborate about issues specific to developing and delivering services in those practice settings.
uz3c | Regulatory bodies and policy makers are in the position to facilitate or impede emerging practice and its future development through state practice acts that define and regulate the scope of occupational therapy practice. As such, members of regulatory boards, state professional associations, and agencies should be key participants in the decisions that will shape the future role of emerging practice.
d5bi | Finally, the study results clearly articulated the need for the pro- fession and its members to support and conduct timely research to document the efficacy of occupational therapy services in emerging practice. The research findings would add to the body of evidence
