You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

u15r | Mechanism of eosinophil-mediated killing of helminth parasites
lq35 | The mechanism by which eosinophil-mediated protec- tion against helminth infection occurs is incompletely understood, but in most cases it appears to involve anti- body-induced release, complement-induced release, or both of toxic granule proteins and reactive oxygen inter-

a3td | mediates by activated eosinophils. Interestingly, evi- dence suggests that there might be significant differences in the susceptibility to and mechanisms of eosinophil- mediated killing between different life-cycle stages of the same parasite. 54,55 Unlike protozoa, helminths are too big to be engulfed by phagocytes and can only be killed by these cells when the latter have been activated by products of the adaptive immune response.
ex5k | Eosinophils, which frequently accumulate in tissues soon after worm invasion, might also play a role in innate defense against this type of parasitic pathogen. For example, L3 larvae of S stercoralis are killed within 72 hours when implanted in chambers in susceptible mice, 45,47 with eosinophils being prominent among the cells infiltrating the chambers. Larval attrition is greatly reduced when worms are transferred instead into IL- 5-deficient mice. This rapid and nonspecific eosinophilic response might be a barrier-limiting mechanism active against the invasion of many tissue-dwelling helminths.
9d4o | EOSINOPHILS AND PATHOGENESIS
cjq2 | Eosinophils have also been implicated in the pathogen- esis of helminth infection (Table III). Similarities between the sequelae of hypereosinophilic syndrome, a syndrome characterized by extremely high levels of eosinophilia and eosinophil-mediated end-organ damage,56 and the pathologic consequences of infection with helminths, including loiasis and lymphatic filariasis57,58 and toxo- cariasis,59 suggest a primary role for eosinophils in the pathogenesis of these infections. The association between the severity of clinical manifestations and the degree of eosinophil activation, as exemplified by increased eosinophil responsiveness to platelet-activating factor in patients with sowda, a hyperreactive form of onchocerci- asis associated with severe dermal pathology,60 provides additional indirect support for this hypothesis.
5esx | Although eosinophils can cause tissue damage through a number of different mechanisms, including direct cellu- lar cytotoxicity, physical damage caused by tissue infil- tration (space occupying), and thromboembolic phenom- ena caused by eosinophil-induced hypercoagulability,56 it

zxz6 | is the release of eosinophil granule proteins and other cytotoxic substances that has been best correlated with helminth-induced tissue damage. Eosinophil cationic pro- teins (including major basic protein, eosinophil cationic protein, and eosinophil-derived neurotoxin) are toxic to various normal tissues and cells both in vitro and in vivo.7,61,62 Other potentially toxic inflammatory media- tors that are released by activated eosinophils include leukotrienes,63 platelet-activating factor,64 reactive oxy- gen species,65 and lysosomal hydrolases.62 These media- tors not only damage the parasite and surrounding tissues (reactive oxygen intermediates66,67 and hydrolases) but play a role in the perpetuation of the local immune response (platelet-activating factor and leukotrienes).
xnth | Serum and urine levels of eosinophil granule proteins provide an indirect measure of degranulation in the tissues and are markedly increased in many helminth-infected patients.68 Furthermore, deposition of eosinophil granule proteins in the affected tissues of patients with helminth infection has also been described.69,70 One of the charac- teristics of the posttreatment reaction in onchocerciasis is an increase in blood and tissue levels of eosinophils and eosinophil granule proteins that is temporally related to the onset of symptomatology71,72 and preceded by an increase in serum levels of IL-5.73 Although localization of eosinophils and their products in the skin is most pro- nounced at sites of microfilarial degeneration,71 which is consistent with the hypothesis that eosinophil-mediated parasite killing plays a major role in pathogenesis, the pos- sibility that recruitment of eosinophils occurs secondarily in response to parasite death cannot be excluded.
vafm | More direct evidence that eosinophils contribute to the pathogenesis of helminth infection comes from animal models. Eosinophilic infiltration of the cornea and con- junctival tissue, a characteristic component of onchocer- cal sclerosing keratitis in human subjects, occurs within 72 hours of intrastromal injection of sensitized mice with onchocercal antigens.74 Attenuation of both the eosinophil response and ocular inflammation is observed in IL-4 knockout mice on a C57BL/6 background,74 whereas eosinophil infiltration and corneal opacification is increased in mice treated with IL-12 at the time of corneal sensitization to onchocercal antigens despite decreased local expression of TH2 cytokines, including IL-5.75 The presence of eosinophil infiltration in a TH1 environment could be accounted for by a marked increase in corneal chemokines, including RANTES and eotaxin.75 Taken together, these data suggest that eosinophils, rather than the cytokine milieu, are the cru- cial factor in the development of onchocercal keratitis.
2zmw | Although it seems clear that eosinophils play a role in some models of helminth-induced pathology, they do not appear to be essential to the development of pathologic sequelae in all cases. Liver granulomas in schistosomia- sis typically contain a high percentage of activated eosinophils, the major source of TH2-associated cytokines in the granuloma milieu.76 Despite this, anti- IL-5-treated mice infected with schistosomiasis produce normal-sized granulomas, despite the absence of
bf9k | eosinophils.77 Similarly, lung infiltrates in N brasilien- sis-infected mice treated with anti-IL-5 differ from those of N brasiliensis-infected control mice in the absence of eosinophils but not in size or number of lesions. 10 Final- ly, in contrast to the attenuation of ocular disease observed in IL-4-/- C57BL/6J mice, corneal opacifica- tion is exacerbated in sensitized IL-4-/- BALB/cJ, STAT6-/- BALB/cJ, and IL-5-/- C57BL/6J78,79 mice after intrastromal injection of onchocercal antigen and is accompanied by increased tissue infiltration by neu- trophils (but not eosinophils).79 Whether these findings reflect a true lack of involvement of eosinophils in the pathologic sequelae of natural infection with these para- sites or the induction of alternative mechanisms of patho- genesis in the setting of dysregulation of the cytokine milieu remains to be elucidated.
otkr | CONCLUSIONS
ibgs | Much has been learned about the biology of the eosinophil80 and its role in the pathogenesis of allergic,81 gastrointestinal,82 and hypereosinophilic disorders83 since its discovery in 1879. The importance of its role in parasitic infections remains a large question, despite the plethora of studies in animals and human populations. Although we wait for unequivocal evidence for the salutary role of the eosinophil in helminth infections, we are left still with strong epidemiologic support for the eosinophil's benefit. Although unsatisfying as a conclusion, we must endeavor to elucidate its role more definitively if we consider the bil- lions of persons worldwide infected with these multicellu- lar and elusive parasitic organisms.
