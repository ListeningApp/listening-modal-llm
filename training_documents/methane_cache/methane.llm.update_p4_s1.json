        "content": "p6pq | Biochemistry\nzse6 | subunit from Nitrosocaldus yellowstonii AMO, indicating conservation of this site over the broad pMMO/AMO superfamily. However, in this structure, the copper ion is involved in a crystal lattice contact, and the N-terminal histidine ligand is disordered. In the M. capsulatus (Bath) pmoB subunit, an additional copper ion is present at the interface of the two cupredoxin domains, coordinated by His forty-eight and His seventy-two. The His forty-eight ligand is not conserved in other pMMO sequences, and the site is not observed in the other pMMO structures.\np2n3 | Several lines of evidence suggest that the crystallographically modeled dicopper center is the active site of pMMO. First, the ligands to the dicopper center are conserved in almost all methanotroph pmoB sequences as well as in homologous subunits from all members of the pMMO/AMO superfamily. The only exceptions are a few pmoB sequences from methane- oxidizing Verrucomicrobia. These sequences are evolutionarily distant, and it is possible that their extreme growth environments, pH zero point eight to five and twenty-two to eighty-eight degrees Celsius, require a different type of active site. Second, metal loading of apo membrane-bound pMMO only results in methane oxidation after addition of two to three copper equivalents per one hundred kilodalton alpha beta gamma pMMO protomer, consistent with an active site requiring more than one copper. Third and most important, a recombinant soluble fragment of the M. capsulatus (Bath) pmoB subunit, spmoB, can oxidize methane to methanol in the presence of copper, and this activity is abolished upon mutagenesis of two or all three of the ligands to the dicopper site. Consistent with this model, mutagenesis of the ligand equivalent to His one hundred thirty-nine in a homologous Mycobacterium NBB four hydrocarbon mono-oxygenase, HMO, that oxidizes C two to C four alkanes reduces activity significantly. However, in that enzyme, approximately twenty percent residual activity is retained, perhaps due to copper binding by the other ligands, as has been observed for spmoB.\nohh7 | Current Topic\nvbni | Both copper one and copper two are routinely detected in pMMO by X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and all samples of pMMO exhibit an electron paramagnetic resonance, EPR, spectroscopic signal attributable to a type two copper two site. Correlation of EPR signals with specific crystallographic copper sites in M. capsulatus (Bath) pMMO has been facilitated by comparative analysis of pMMO and the spmoB proteins. EPR and metal analysis using pMMO and spmoB variants that disrupt the monocopper, H forty-eight N, H seventy-two A, dicopper, H thirty-three, one hundred thirty-seven, one hundred thirty-nine A, or both copper, H forty-eight N_H thirty-three, seventy, one hundred thirty-seven, one hundred thirty-nine A, sites indicate the presence of a valence localized, mixed valence copper one copper two center at the dicopper site and a copper one ion at the monocopper site. The location of the copper two is proposed to be valence scrambled between the two copper binding sites with one copper coordinated by His one hundred thirty-seven and His one hundred thirty-nine, and one coordinated by His thirty-three and the N-terminal amino group. No water or hydroxide ligands to the copper two ion are detected.\ndgcw | An additional metal binding site is present in the pmoC subunit of pMMO. This site can bind zinc or copper, and the metal ion is coordinated by residues Asp one hundred fifty-six, His one hundred sixty, and His one hundred seventy-three, M. capsulatus (Bath) numbering. Recent metal binding studies using pMMOs from M. capsulatus (Bath) and Methylocystis sp. str. Rockwell suggest that zinc binding at this site partially inhibits activity, perhaps by interfering with proton transfer, and that this site is likely unoccupied by metal ions in vivo. Interestingly, a structure of Methylocystis sp. str. Rockwell pMMO soaked in zinc reveals a fourth ligand to this site, Glu two hundred one, Glu two hundred twenty-eight using M. capsulatus (Bath) numbering, which derives from a loop region of pmoC that is disordered in all previous structures. This region spanning pmoC residues two hundred to two hundred twenty-three, Methylocystis sp. str. Rockwell numbering, contains many strictly invariant residues, including Glu two hundred eleven, Phe two hundred thirteen, His two hundred eighteen, Phe two hundred twenty-one, and Val two hundred twenty-two, Glu two hundred thirty-eight, Phe two hundred forty, His two hundred forty-five, Phe two hundred forty-eight, and Val two hundred forty-nine using M.\ngvwz | Biochemistry\nsk5m | capsulatus (Bath) numbering. The potential importance of this pmoC region is underscored by mutagenesis studies of the Mycobacterium NBB four HMO in which individual mutations in the residues corresponding to ligands Asp one hundred fifty-six, His one hundred sixty, and His one hundred seventy-three, M. capsulatus (Bath) numbering, completely abrogated hydrocarbon oxidation activity. Replacement of the residue equivalent to Asp one hundred sixty-six, M. capsulatus (Bath) numbering, also abolished activity, which is interesting because this residue is located on a flexible loop that points away from the metal binding site in the pMMO structures.\nqws8 | SUBSTRATE BINDING AND REACTIVITY\n877u | Soluble MMO. In most studies, the activity of sMMO has been determined by measuring the epoxidation of propylene. This assay was preferred historically because the product, propylene oxide, is not further oxidized by methanotroph cells and extracts. For M. capsulatus (Bath) sMMO, the turnover number for methane is in the range of zero point two to one point zero per second at forty-five degrees Celsius and that for propylene is approximately zero point seven per second. The Km values for\nrzhj | methane and propylene are zero point ninety-four and two M, respectively, and the Km value for oxygen is approximately sixteen micromolar with both substrates. For M. trichosporium OB three B sMMO, turnover numbers of three point seven per second and four point four per second at thirty degrees Celsius have been reported for methane and propylene, respectively, and the Km for methane is approximately twelve micromolar. The whole cell M. trichosporium OB three B sMMO turnover number is at least three point five per second.\nbfax | sMMO can oxidize a wide range of hydrocarbons, including carbon one to carbon eight n-alkanes, alkenes, and larger substrates such as benzene, styrene, naphthalene, ethylbenzene, and cyclohexane. In addition, sMMO oxidizes various halogenated\nf2y8 | Current Topic\no7qm | hydrocarbons, including pollutants such as trichloroethylene. Crystallographic data indicate that substrates and products can occupy a chain of hydrophobic cavities, denoted cavities one to three, in the alpha subunit of MMOH.",
