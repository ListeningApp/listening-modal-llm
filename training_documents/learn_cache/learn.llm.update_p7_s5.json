        "content": "a3td | All the learning we have discussed involves memory. But people are most likely to remember what they have used and maybe invented, not what they have had drilled into their heads. Marshall and Albert began learning French in the sixth grade, but six weeks into the fall semester, Albert's parents moved to Paris, taking the young boy and his sister with them. By the time he graduated from high school, Marshall had taken six years of French, memorizing vocabulary and usually acing the exams. His parents drilled him, using all the sophisticated procedures of spaced repetition. It doesn't take much imagination or insight, however, to guess which one of the two boys read, spoke, and wrote French with almost perfect fluency when they met for a reunion right before going off to college, and which one struggled to keep up with the chatter. People learn deeply by doing in authentic situations.\nex5k | Students are more likely to remember what they understand. When we comprehend we make rich associations between ideas and information, and the network of connections we lay down in our brains\n9d4o | enhances our memories. If through speculation, someone has invented a solution, that person can more easily recall its steps and why you should take those steps than if the person had picked up the solution from watching someone else perform the process.\ncjq2 | To engage in the difficult business of learning deeply people often need help. This is a tricky matter because it doesn't mean simply providing them with \"correct answers.\" That's largely what traditional lectures do. Rather students require assistance in constructing insights and inventing ways to solve problems. Maybe the help comes as a question that sparks thought and understanding, rather than as an explanation. Students need an opportunity to try, fail, and receive feedback. Novice learners who have recently struggled with the same problems can often provide the best assistance to the absolute beginner. Those novice learners remember the tough parts while experts have forgotten the potholes along the route. The scholar often uses shortcuts in thinking while the neophyte may need to think through every step. But students also need far more than intellectual assistance. Emotional help is often crucial, not simply because humans harbor anxiety and misgivings, but also because struggling with deeply held paradigms can prove traumatic.\n5esx | If learners must meet new standards, they may require assistance in understanding them and practice in applying the criteria to their own work. To remain motivated, people need to believe that their work will matter and that it will have lasting consequences for themselves and perhaps for others, and that the standards will be applied honestly and fairly. That process begins with clearly defined standards and lots of practice in comprehending the criteria.\nm5ka | Going Bad\nbyu8 | What can go wrong beyond those pitfalls we've already mentioned? Let's explore threats that emerge from a couple of strong social forces. You may have noticed that we've made no mention of \"intelligence\" as a factor in learning, even though many traditional educators have relied almost exclusively on that concept to explain who succeeds and who\n76b0 | comes up short. \"It doesn't matter what I do in class,\" a math professor in the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences at New York University once told us. \"The gifted students will get it, and the weak ones won't.\" This genius theory of education pervades schools on all levels, but it doesn't set well with everyone, or with some important research on human development.\nzxz6 | When Carol Dweck finished her doctorate in psychology at Yale in nineteen seventy-two, she had one burning question on her mind. Why do some people melt in the face of failure while others zip right through adversity, even using it to improve their work? \"I grew up in an era that worshipped IQ\" she told her campus newspaper recently, \"and thought that it largely determined your future. My sixth grade teacher even seated us around the room in IQ order.\" After more than forty years of research, the Lewis and Virginia Eaton Professor of Psychology at Stanford University has found that people's conception of intelligence has more influence than does anything you might measure as an IQ. \"If you believe your intelligence is just a fixed trait,\" Dweck explained, you're likely to develop a sense of helplessness. If you think you don't know and can't learn, you're not apt to try something. But that feeling of helplessness can also emerge among people who think they are smart and also believe human brains can't grow.\nxnth | Imagine a kid who has heard all his life, \"You're really brilliant.\" He may then build his whole self-image around being a genius. Soon he may grow afraid to try anything new for fear he will fail and prove he's not so sharp after all. In contrast, \"if you think your talents, abilities and intelligence can grow\" then \"you want to jump in and develop them,\" Dweck summarized. That can make a huge difference in someone's learning.\nvafm | Thus, people who believe their intelligence is fixed for life often have difficulty embracing failure. They tend to recoil from their mistakes rather than learning from them. If a teacher tries to put them in a situation where their mental models do not work (creating a \"model failure\"), they resist and learn little because they cannot stand to fail. Meanwhile, students flourish with challenges to their thinking if they believe intelligence can grow.\n2zmw | Fortunately, Dweck and her colleagues have found that fixed and growth mindsets, as she calls them, come from conditioning, not from any innate qualities of someone's brain or personality. They can change. In a series of powerful experiments, she and her colleagues discovered certain experiences that cause children to develop one mindset or another. People who hear a steady stream of person praise (\"how smart you are\"), for example, often grow a fixed view of intelligence and a feeling of helplessness, while those who encounter task-oriented feedback (\"you must have worked hard on this\") build a strong growth mindset. In her research, Dweck found that students with the fixed view gave up easily, sometimes complaining that they were \"not a math person\" (or \"writing person\"), and growing easily bored with school, especially if they failed. Furthermore, and this is probably the most disturbing result, their abilities actually decline in the face of failure. Meanwhile, students with growth perspectives sail right through adversity and often deliberately seek hard challenges.\nbf9k | None of this means we've discovered a magic cure. We continue to face enormous problems in changing anyone's mindset, especially as people grow older. Yet some of the Super Courses we will explore have devised some innovative approaches with promising results. They deserve additional trials and careful research to find out what works and what doesn't.\notkr | Stereotype Threat\nibgs | Joshua Aronson and Claude Steele found different social forces shaping learning outcomes. If you are a member of a group about which there is a popular negative stereotype, that common belief can influence your performance in school and elsewhere even if you personally reject it. Obviously, if you accept the negative idea that \"people like you\" can't do something, you will give up easily. Failure will become a self-fulfilling prophecy. But you don't have to accept the negative stereotype for it to affect you. On a subconscious level it may simply bother you that others think of you in terms of that popular image, even if you never internalize a sense of inferiority. In a silent and unspoken dash to exonerate yourself\ncolo | and others, tensions grow. Nervousness increases, and your academic performance tanks.\nd6r4 | Margaret Shih knew that research but asked a brand new question. We have lots of stereotypes in our culture, she noticed. Some positive. Others more negative. Many people believe, she pointed out, that women can't do higher mathematics as well as men can. At the same time, many Americans also think that people of Asian descent possess some kind of \"math superiority\" gene. But what about Asian American women? Which stereotype, negative or positive, will influence their performance?",
