This ends the proof of the lemma.\ndqlg | Now, we consider a function rho in script C sub zero infinity of negative one to one such that zero is less than or equal to rho of tau is less than or equal to one, the absolute value of rho prime of tau is less than or equal to two. In the weak formulation eleven we take as test function G of t, x equals rho of t minus t sub n Psi of x, where Psi is a function lying in script D of closure of Omega and n fixed. We obtain after the change of variables\np6pq | s equals t minus t sub n one over one plus alpha squared times the integral from negative one to one the integral over Omega of partial t m sub n of s, x minus alpha m sub n of s, x times partial t m sub n of s, x.

In order to pass to the limit, we bound each term of the above formulation. For example, for the last term we have",
