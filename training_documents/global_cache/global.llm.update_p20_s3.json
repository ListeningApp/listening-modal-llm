        "content": "xh3i | As their points of departure, macro-perspectives of this sort operate with large-scale comparisons of societies or, more typically, whole civilizations. In most older world histories, interactions and exchange between these enormous building blocks were not ignored, but the main focus was on the different trajectories of the civilizations, whose dynamics were primarily depicted as generated from within. These parallel histories were then linked by increasing diffusion from centers of power to the periphery. In the modern period, this diffusion typically assumed the form of a transfer from the West to \"the rest.\" A Eurocentric bias has thus been a rather common feature of world histories for a long time, as the title of William McNeill's influential book, The Rise of the West, made no attempt to conceal.\nsyiw | Features of global history\nkg3t | The older world histories typically employed a methodology that combined comparisons of separate civilizations with a\nlvae | search for links between them, the latter explained by processes of diffusion. The thinking behind these histories crossed theoretical and ideological divides-ranging from modernization theory to Marxism and to narratives of civilization-but the mix of comparison and diffusion was remarkably constant. By contrast, the keyword most immediately associated with the term \"global\" has been \"connections.\" A whole cascade of related terms-\"exchange\" and \"intercourse,\" \"links\" and \"entanglements,\" \"networks\" and \"flows\"-are mustered to convey the fluidity and volatility with which interactions take place across borders. In lieu of a rather stubborn reliance on macro-comparisons, global histories have elevated mobility to the throne.\no9sc | This is why most shorthand definitions of global history have confined themselves to the happy marriage of comparisons and connections, taking the best of what traditional world history had to offer and combining it with a sensitivity for the more flexible and fluid dimensions of historical change. \"Global connections and comparisons\" greet us from the cover page of C. A. Bayly's seminal Birth of the Modern World, and the shibboleth that connections cum comparison are \"the stock-in-trade of global history\" is reiterated in virtually all attempts to define what is specific about the approach.\n121u | And indeed, a focus on transfers and interactions is a crucial ingredient of all recent attempts to understand the global past. The mobility of goods, the migration and travel of people, the transfer of ideas and institutions: all these processes are the stuff that has helped produce the globalized world in which we live, and they are the privileged objects of study of many global historians. As we will see below, however, connections alone are not sufficient to explain the originality of the approach; connections need to be embedded in processes of\nzh03 | structural transformation, and this on a global scale. Before we come to this point, I will first sketch a set of methodological choices that are recurrent features of current global history, beyond its emphasis on connections. They will be only briefly outlined here, as most of the issues are taken up at greater length in subsequent chapters.\n1mvw | First, global historians are not concerned with macro-perspectives alone. Many seek to situate concrete historical issues and phenomena within broader, potentially global contexts. The emergence of the notion of \"culture\" in eighteen eighties Bengal is, accordingly, as legitimate a subject of global history inquiry as the full planetary history of the entire nineteenth century. Second, global histories experiment with alternative notions of space. They typically do not take political or cultural units-nation-states, empires, civilizations-as their points of departure. Instead, they pose analytical questions and go wherever their questioning leads them-across the Bay of Bengal, to nodal points in a network, to religious and ethnic diasporas, and so forth.\n6d4s | This implies, third, that global histories are inherently relational. This means that a historical unit-a civilization, a nation, a family-does not develop in isolation, but can only be understood through its interactions with others. In fact, many groups only jelled into seemingly fixed units as a response to exchange and circulation. Attention to the relationality of the past also challenges long-accepted interpretations of the history of the world as the \"rise of the West\" and the \"European miracle.\" Many older world history texts locate the driving force of world history in Europe and chronicle the spread of European achievements to the rest of the world: world history as a one-way street. By contrast, recent studies stress the constitutive role played by interactions between regions and\nmqah | nations, as well as between Europe and the non-European world, in the development of modern societies. Development in Europe and the West cannot be explained from within, as an autonomous process, but must be seen, at least in part, as the product of various processes of exchange.\nxxr8 | Fourth, as a discipline within the humanities, global history forms part of the larger \"spatial turn.\" One consequence is that the relations of constellations in space to other locations become more important. Global historians pay particular attention to the way individuals and societies interact with others-and less on endogenous change. As a result, spatial metaphors-such as territoriality, geopolitics, circulation, and networks-tend to replace an older temporal vocabulary of development, time lag, and backwardness. This also implies a rejection of the teleologies of modernization theory; i.e., a criticism of the notion that societies are transformed, as it were, from within, and that the direction of social change-from tradition to modernity, for example-is predetermined.\nrl4j | A direct outcome of this is emphasis on the synchronicity of historical events. This is the fifth point. To be sure, global historians by no means ignore the issue of continuities or path dependencies. As C. A. Bayly and others have argued, globalization in the modern age built on trajectories influenced by earlier patterns of entanglement. However, by dissociating from the long-term perspectives typical of the history of civilizations and by not privileging conventional notions of continuity, many global historians suggest that greater precedence be given to simultaneity. As is immediately clear from the examples of the Arab Spring revolts, synchronous constellations and external forces are often as important drivers of social change as long prehistories and traditions.\nvz32 | Sixth, and crucially, many global histories are self-reflective on the issue of Eurocentrism. This is one of the defining features that set this approach apart from most older variants of world history writing. We will take up this issue in more detail below (chapter eight). In practical terms, it generally means that greater emphasis is placed on area-studies expertise in history departments than was typical in the past. It also implies, seventh, that the positionality of thinking about the global past is explicitly recognized. Historians may write about the entire planet, but they do so from a particular place, and their narratives will partly be colored by the dynamics of that location. Looking back, it is obvious that a world history written in late sixteenth-century Mexico City would be wildly different from one written in Istanbul. But even today, the \"world\" may appear very different when viewed from Accra, Quito, or Harvard Yard.\nncb0 | Integration and structured transformation\n8mp0 | The final point, to which we now turn, concerns the notion of integration. This is a crucial aspect, so we will dwell on it at some length. To focus on global integration is a methodological choice that distinguishes global history from other approaches that operate on large scales. There are two important aspects to this choice: global history perspectives go beyond mere studies of connectedness by examining large-scale structured integration; and global historians pursue the problem of causation up to the global level.\nxjyk | To begin with the first point: Many world/global historians content themselves with studying interactions and connections.",
