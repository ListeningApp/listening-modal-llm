        "content": "imia | The Sufi usage of Hafiz's works is not at all the same as the ordinary translator's or reader's. I have noted elsewhere that, although it has been translated many times and quoted many thousands of times, there is hardly a correct rendition of the very first couplet of Rumi's major classical Sufi work, The Masnavi.\npyjv | We could give hundreds of examples. In fact, let us just open the Gulistan (Rose Garden) of Saadi and look at a passage and see what we find. Here is a passage; it runs in Persian:\no6yq | Kasani ki yazdan-parasti kunand/Bi-awazi dulab masti kunand. One English translation gives the meaning, literally enough, as:\n0st0 | Those who are God-worshippers\nwr2z | Become drunken (even) at the sound of a water-wheel.\nzeae | How, the word dulab (water-wheel), also means, figuratively, 'deceit' in Persian.\n0qnf | Saadi is saying, therefore:\ntnrn | One. That people who worship the divine (yazdan) go into a state of intoxication even at the sound of a water-wheel. This can mean, in this context, either that they can be so conditioned [in the case, of course, of superficialists] that anything will throw them into what they regard as a religious state, or else that anything might remind [rightly-attuned mystics] of Divinity;\nshab | Two. Either type of person just referred to can be diverted into his or her state (imagined or real) by deceit.\n3r7z | So, instead of having the unexceptionable but fragmentary translation 'Anything will throw the religious into an ecstasy', we find a whole range of meanings open up as we look at the words and their alternative significations, including:\nvai3 | One. Fixation upon the Divine can lead to becoming intoxicated by it, by the sound made by an inanimate object not intended to elicit such a reaction;\n71vz | Two. People who have fixated upon the Divine may revert to the intoxication [which may or may not be a veridical mystical experience] by a rhythmic sound;\n6ti3 | Three. Genuine mystical experiences can be invoked in the devout by rhythmic methods;\nyn4n | Four. Experiences thought to be mystical can be elicited in people who have [genuinely or otherwise] engaged in divine worship by deceit(s).\nmpo2 | This kind of multiple meaning abounds in Persian poetry. The Sufi has to be able to keep all the alternative possibilities of meaning in mind, so as to be able to look at the whole range of possible significances of human experience which ordinary people compress into a far smaller range of understanding.\na9pu | Some Characteristics of Sufi Literature\n53dl | Q: We find, in your book The Sufis, some illuminating material on Sufi literature. Could you say something more on this subject, to help in its study?\nmfu6 | A: Nothing betrays the superficial or the uninformed student, when it comes to study and presentation of formerly current texts, like the use made by such people of literature.\n47qk | To be entirely specific, we must point out that those who are primarily litterateurs and academic workers have a manner of study and an appreciation of literature which corresponds only with the outer husk of Sufi literature.\nmywk | People are reluctant to admit this possibility, partly because so much of the Sufi literature is a part of the classical literary heritage: they think that it must be susceptible only to study for its derivations, variety, elegance, vocabulary and so on.\na4u9 | To say that all this superb material contains something which its self-styled greatest supporters do not perceive is asking for their outraged condemnation. But, as this happens to be true, we are obliged to say it. Whether they like it or not, Sufi literature was not written for certain pedants, for orientalists, or even, often, for the generation of today. There is the husk for all to see. The kernel may be garnered by those who, first, know which is the husk; and also how to reach the kernel.\nrn4d | Viewed from this 'instrumental' usage of literature, the activities of memorising passages, selecting parts which appeal to one, comparing editions and manuscripts, seeking emotional or intellectual stimulus - all this is a different field from the inner functional one represented in this literature.\nugaa | Let it not be denied that such masters as Rumi have baldly stated this fact. Nobody takes any notice-they go on studying Rumi. The result is that they imbibe the teaching material together\nrtcb | with the antidote, corrective or protective material in which it is enshrouded. The only effect is cultural, in the anthropologist's sense of the word.\nffpl | From the Sufic point of view, such people are of course completely entitled to their level of appreciation. The seriousness of the situation becomes evident when they teach others, people who are capable of greater understanding, to treat the materials in the same relatively shallow manner as they do themselves.\nlshs | It is at this point that we have something to say and much to do.\n72bh | Such trained individuals, we find, have their scope of 'being' attenuated, their perceptions (in the Sufic sense) dwarfed. They sometimes become conditioned to certain stimuli, they develop what can be alarming tendencies of a doctrinaire or academic nature.\n5mf3 | Here are a few characteristics of Sufi literature:\n58az | One. Some books, some passages, are intended to be read in a certain order.\n05xw | Two. Some books and passages have to be read under specific environmental conditions.\nngod | Three. Some have to be read aloud, some silently, some alone, some in company.\npn6t | Four. Some are only vehicles for illustrations or other content generally regarded as extraneous or secondary to the text.\nzfpn | Five. Some are of limited use or ephemeral function, being addressed to communities in certain places, at certain stages of development, or for a limited time.\nxm3x | Six. Some forms have concealed meanings which yield coherent but misleading meanings, safety-devices to ward off tamperers.\nrigs | Seven. Some are interlarded with material deliberately designed to confuse or sidetrack those who are not properly instructed, for their own protection.\nemnt | Eight. Some books contain a completely different potential, and they are communicators through another means than the writing contained in them. They are not designed primarily to be read at all.\njkft | Nine-Sufi literature is a part of a carefully worked out plan. Its abuse leads to nothing of permanent value.\n4sh0 | Sufi teachings, and sometimes keys to it, are sometimes embedded in quite other material, not recognisable as Sufi at all to the uninitiated. Many of these teachings are really meditation-themes. They have a deep function almost unknown to pedestrian conventionalists, enthusiasts, imitators or the occultist.\nihy8 | Many people familiarise themselves with the classics, or any Sufi literature which they can obtain, thinking that they will benefit by doing this. Many again think that they have really benefitted. But since the frequency or pattern upon which the studies are planned cannot be penetrated by such people, they do not gain the nutritional and developmental content of the materials.\n9bwj | Even the sheer familiarisation with Sufi materials, for the purpose of future development, must at some point take place in accordance with the school pattern, itself based upon the 'great design' which unlocks the treasures of this extraordinary storehouse.\nrip8 | No form of selectivity, no A to Z treatment of study, no mere immersing of oneself in 'Sufi thought', no participation in Sufi exercises or rituals, can, if carried out arbitrarily (and by this we mean without the direction of those who know the pattern) none of this can yield the deep Sufic content.\nw2ef | People may think that they have gained something. But this is characteristic of the adherents of each and every school, system, religion and so on. What they have gained is much more superficial than they imagine.",
