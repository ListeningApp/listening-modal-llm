You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

vbni | SNV and ASB annotation
dgcw | Genomic annotation. To annotate SNVs according to their genomic location (Fig. 3c), we started with mapping SNVs to FANTOM5 enhancers and promoters62. The remaining SNVs were annotated with ChIPseeker63 with a hierarchical assignment of the following categories: promoter (≤1 kb), promoter

qws8 | (1-2 kb), promoter (2-3 kb), 5'UTR, 3'UTR, Exon, Intron, Downstream, Inter- genic. For clarity, promoter (≤1 kb) and 5'UTR categories were both tagged as "promoter"; promoter (1-2 kb) and promoter (2-3 kb) were both tagged as "upstream."
877u | Sequence motif analysis of ASBs. For TF ASBs, we annotated the corresponding SNVs with sequence motif hits of the respective TFs. To this end, we used models from HOCOMOCO v11 core collection64 and SPRY-SARUS65 for motif finding. The top-scoring motif hit was taken considering both Ref and Alt alleles, and, at this fixed position, the "motif FC" was calculated as the log2-ratio of motif <LATEX>P</LATEX> values at the reference and alternative variants so that the positive FC corresponded to the preference of the alternative allele.
rzhj | To analyze the ASB motif concordance (Fig. 4), we considered the ASB SNVs (min(FDRRef <LATEX>\left. F D R _ { A l t } \right) \leq 0 . 0 5</LATEX> that overlapped the predicted TF-binding site: (min (motif <LATEX>P \quad v a l u e R e f</LATEX> motif <LATEX>\left. P \text { value } _ { A ! t } \right) \leq 0 . 0 0 0 5 ,</LATEX> and had |FC| ≥ 2. We defined the motif concordance/discordance as a match/mismatch of the signs of FC and
bfax | <LATEX>\Delta \mathrm { F D R } = \log _ { 1 0 } \left( \mathrm { F D R } _ { \mathrm { A l t } } \right) - \log _ { 1 0 } \left( \mathrm { F D R } _ { \mathrm { R e f } } \right) .</LATEX> Annotation of ASBs with phenotype associations. To assess enrichment of ASBs within phenotype-associated SNPs, we used the data from four different SNP- phenotype associations databases, namely: (1) NHGRI-EBI GWAS catalog36, release 8/27/2019 with EFO mappings66 used to group phenotypes by their parent terms for Supplementary Fig. 9; (2) ClinVar catalog37, release 9/05/2019 (entries with "likely pathogenic," "pathogenic," or "risk factor" clinical significance); (3) PheWAS catalog38; (4) BROAD fine-mapping catalog of causal autoimmune dis- ease variants39. All entries were systematized in the form of triples <dbSNP ID, phenotype, database>. Next, the entries were annotated with the TF- or cell type- ASB data.
f2y8 | To evaluate TF-phenotype associations in detail, we used NHGRI-EBI GWAS catalog and the following pipeline:
o7qm | (1) We filtered out TFs with less than two candidate ASBs, and phenotypes associated with less than two SNPs, resulting in 765 TFs and 2688 phenotypes suitable for the analysis. For each TF, we considered all SNPs with candidate ASBs passing the coverage thresholds.
d52l | (2) For each pair of a TF and a phenotype, we calculated the odds ratio and the <LATEX>P</LATEX> value of the one-tailed Fisher's exact test on SNPs with candidate ASBs considering two binary features: whether the SNP is associated with the phenotype, and whether the SNP is included in ASB candidates of the particular TF. The superset of SNPs was collected independently for each TF by gathering SNPs with candidate ASBs for all TFs but only from LD blocks42 containing either TF-specific SNPs or phenotype-associated SNPs. The P values were then FDR corrected for multiple tested TFs separately for each phenotype.
qlbb | Analysis of eQTLs and eQTL target genes. To analyze an overlap between ASBs and eQTLs, we used significant <variant, gene> pairs from GTEx41 (release V8).
nhsg | To evaluate ASB-driven eQTL target genes' associations with medical phenotypes, a one-tailed Fisher's exact test was performed on the enrichment of protein-coding genes of medical relevance (6026 genes found linked with entries with "pathogenic," "likely pathogenic," or "risk factor" clinical significance in Clin Var catalog37) among eQTL target genes of ASB SNPs (16,865 protein-coding genes according to GTEx), considering all human protein-coding genes from GENCODE67 (v35, 19,929 gene symbols) as the background set.
hy0l | ASB prediction with machine learning. In our work, we used a standard software implementation of the random forest model from the scikit-learn package. The number of estimators was set to 500 and the other parameters were defaults. Three feature types were used (Supplementary Table 4): allele-specific chromatin DNase accessibility, synthetic data from neurons from the last layer of the DeepSEA11, and HOCOMOCO motif predictions obtained with SPRY-SARUS65. As a global set of SNVs, we used 231,355 dbSNP IDs overlapping between ADASTRA and Maurano

0b39 | et al.16 data, which provided allele-specific DNase accessibility. For the general model, we used SNVs with ASBs for any of TFs or in any of cell types as members of the positive class, and the remaining set of candidate SNVs as members of the negative class. For TF- and cell type-specific assessment, we defined ASB and non- ASB SNVs for a particular TF or in a particular cell type as the positive and negative class, respectively.
