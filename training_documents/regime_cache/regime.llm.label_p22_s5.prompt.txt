You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

ywn2 | (1) First-order differential operators Lextra = GTVr, with G: X > Rd such that div(Gyo) = 0. The latter condition ensures that (3.2) is satisfied since Lextra = - GTV. r;
a63r | (2) Second-order differential operators of the form Lextra = - 0* dzi or more gen- erally -ot Dijoxi for some (nonnegative) function Dij: X -> R+. In the case Cextra = - Ox Ox;, the operator is self-adjoint, i.e. Cextra = L'extra, so that (3.2) is easily seen to hold. For Lextra = - Og Dijoxi, it holds that Lextra = - Og Dijox;, which also satisfies (3.2).
dqvj | (3) First-order differential operators with nontrivial zero order parts, such as Lextra = 0* = Ox U - Oxi for yo(x) = e-U(x). Through some abuse of nota- tion, we use dr U to denote the multiplication operator by the function dz. U. These operators satisfy Lextra = 0x., so that (3.2) holds.
r17u | The class of extra forcings outlined in items (1) and (2) can be easily implemented and realized in Monte-Carlo simulations. Implementing forcings of the form described in item (3), however, requires some extra work to take care of the multiplication operator, as we now discuss.
3c47 | We denote the class of extra forcings described in item (3) as Feynman-Kac forcings, as sampling the dynamics requires the use of the Feynman-Kac formula due to the nontrivial zero order term. Consider the general dynamics (2.1) with generator (2.2), as presented in Section 2.1.1. Suppose that the dynamics has a unique invariant probability measure with density yo(x) = e-U(x). The perturbed dynamics with generator Ln,a = Lo + n ([phys + a Cextra), with Cextra = {TV* for some & E Rd, can be sampled by evolving the SDE
g345 | dXt =(b(Xt) +nF(Xt) -na§) dt + o(Xt) dWt,
svhz | and weighting trajectories with the Feynman-Kac weight
oaen | (3.4) Wt = exp (na ) {"VU (X3) ds).
5u67 | In practice, this is done by evolving multiple replicas of the system with indepen- dent Brownian motions, and using resampling strategies to prevent the weights from degenerating (see for instance [35] and [30, Chapter 6]).
dvms | From an analytical point of view, items (1) and (2) fit in the framework of Section 2. Item (3), however, does not directly fit in the framework of Section 2. This is due to the fact that the steady-state measure of the dynamics with genera- tor Ln, a = Lo + n([phys + @[extra) is not a probability measure in general. This is
qrd3 | EXTENDING LINEAR RESPONSE WITH SYNTHETIC FORCINGS
rxrg | the case only if the weights (3.4) are renormalized. At the level of generators, this amounts to shifting the spectrum of Ln,a by An,a, where An,a is the nonzero real principal eigenvalue of the operator Ln,& (see [16, 15] and references therein). The magnitude of An,& can be made precise in terms of a and n for n small, and turns out to be of order O(n2) for n small, as formally derived in Appendix A.
tf43 | Of course, by linearity, one can consider linear combinations of these extra forc- ings. In the next two sections, we give specific examples of each of the three classes of extra forcings discussed here for both overdamped and underdamped Langevin dynamics.
fcco | 3.2.2. Overdamped Langevin dynamics. We start by outlining some ex- amples of synthetic forcings for the overdamped Langevin dynamics introduced in Section 2.1.2. We consider successively the distinct classes of extra forcings following the general presentation of Section 3.2.1.
8uji | Example 3.1 (Divergence-free vector field). We consider a first-order differ- ential operator
df3e | (3.5) Čextra = GTV,
53eu | where G: X -> Rd is such that
a5u1 | (3.6) div (G(q)e-BV(q)) = 0.
ry7u | The resulting dynamics with the addition of (3.5) is
5mda | dqt = [-VV(q) +nF(qt) +anG(qt)] dt + V 2 dWt.
i4li | β
r8sm | Condition (3.6) can be rewritten as div(G) = BGVV. This equality is satisfied when G is both divergence-free and orthogonal to VV, which is the situation considered in [41]. For instance, in any dimension d > 2, with A an arbitrary anti-symmetric matrix, one possible choice for G is
cuin | G = AVV.
n1i7 | As in [10], this can be generalized to G = &'(V)AVV, where ¢: R -> R is some smooth, compactly supported function. More generally, any divergence-free vector field in dimension d can be written as G = VU1 X ... x VUa-1, where Ui are scalar functions [2], a form which was used in [41]. Thus, more generally, G satisfies (3.6) if and only if it is of the form
0r5m | (3.7) G = (VU1 X ... X VUa-1) eBV.
ne2o | For the one-dimensional dynamics, the only divergence-free vector field is G(q) = eBV(q). Of course, drifts such as (3.7) may not be used as such in the dynamics when the position space is unbounded, as it is not clear whether the dynamics is well- posed because of the factor e and when it is, whether it admits a unique invariant probability measure. Moreover, Assumption 4 may not hold.
sqxn | Example 3.2 (Modifying the fluctuation-dissipation relation). One possi- ble choice for extra perturbations involving second-order derivatives is
6pmo | (3.8) Čextra = - 8-1VýVa = 8-14q - VVTVq.
195r | 24
kqmi | R. SPACEK AND G. STOLTZ
g8rd | Ln, a = Co + n (Cphys + a Čextra) = (1 + an) Co + n[phys.
nns9 | The dynamics associated with Ln,Q reads
9uwy | dqt =[-(1+an)VV(qt) +nF(qt)] dt + 1 2(1+ an) β
srly | dWt.
dl6i | This amounts to increasing the magnitude of the terms involved in the fluctuation- dissipation as n increases when Q > 0. Note that, in order for this perturbation to be admissible, we require that 1 + an > 0.
89ub | More generally, one could consider extra forcings of the form -V*D(q)V for some D: X -> Rdxd with values in the space of symmetric matrix, possibly with D constant.
dhle | Example 3.3 (Feynman-Kac forcing). This choice, although it showcases great promise and potential in extending the linear regime, as we will demonstrate in Sections 4.2 and 4.3, is not practical to be simulated by a single long realization of the dynamics as the weights degenerate, rendering the simulation inefficient. Its general form is
2nib | (3.9) Čextra = {TV* = >SiOg, i=1 d
naev | for some vector & E Rd. The generator Lo + 7(Lphys + QLextra) is the sum of first and second-order differential operators and a weight &TVV. Its stochastic representation corresponds to evolving the SDE
7h0h | dqt = (-VV(qt) +nF(qt) - ang) dt + 1 2 β dWt,
a64c | and using the Feynman-Kac formula (3.4) for the weight involving TVV.
gi7n | 3.2.3. Langevin dynamics. We now outline some examples for Langevin dy- namics, presented in Section 2.1.3. Since this dynamics evolves two variables, namely positions q and momenta p, we can in theory use both differential operators Vq and Vp to construct our synthetic forcings. This leads to additional options for each class of extra forcings.
3pn1 | Example 3.4 (Divergence-free vector field). The extra perturbation can be chosen as a first-order differential operator of the form
wjuz | (3.10) Čextra = GTV = G{ V q + G2 Vp,
3yxv | where G1, G2 are such that
d8zj | divq(G170) + divp(G270) =0.
ywxn | A perturbation of similar form to (3.10) has been used and studied in [9]. For in- stance, in any dimension d > 2, a natural choice is G = AVH, or more gener- ally G = &'(H)AVH, where A is an antisymmetric matrix. Typical choices include

ed6e | 25
6qqm | the symplectic matrix
onum | -I 0 0 I ,
3iir | (3.11)
7a0a | or, more generally, linear combinations of matrices of the form
o1qp | A = -BT 0 B
jrik | 0 or A1 0 0 ,
xv78 | A2
sdks | with A1, A2 antisymmetric. In all these expressions, A1, A2 and B can be functions of (q,p). The choice (3.10) leads to the generator
y8fb | (Čextra4) (q, p) = G1(q,p)TVq+G2(q,p)}Vp,
521q | and the dynamics
yogo | dqt = M-1pt dt + anG1(qt, Pt) dt,
2285 | dpt = - VV(qt) dt + n(F(qt) +@G2(qt, Pt)) dt - YM-1pt dt + VB 27 dWt.
ys0g | When G = JVH with J the symplectic matrix, the extra perturbation corresponds to rescaling the Hamiltonian part of the dynamics, which is equivalent, up to a time rescaling, to changing the strength of the fluctuation-dissipation.
7zvp | Example 3.5 (Modified fluctuation-dissipation). We first consider an op- erator that is second-order in p. A simple choice for the extra forcing is Lextra = -B-1 *
ww6u | Ln, a = Cham + (y + an) CFD + Cphys.
hpi6 | For this forcing to be admissible, we require that 1 +on > 0. The dynamics associated with Ln,a reads
4uhb | dqt = M-1pt dt,
epyi | dpt = - VV(qt) dt + nF(qt) dt - (y + an) M-1pt dt + 2(y + an) β dWt.
y51p | The effect of the extra forcing is to rescale the strength of the fluctuation-dissipation, either increasing it when an > 0, or reducing it when an < 0. More generally, one can scale this forcing by a function of q, i.e. consider Lextra = - a(q) * 2 with a(q): X -> R. One can also extend this form to matrix-valued diffusions of the form *D(q,p)Vp.
x95m | We can similarly consider a second-order forcing in q. One possible choice for the generator is then Lextra = - B-1V q 7q. Here, we require that on > 0. The associated dynamics is
yfum | dqt = M-1pt dt - anVV (qt) dt + 1 + V201 B .
ppx4 | dpt = (-VV(qt) dt + nF(qt)) dt - YM-1pt dt + V 27 · dWt,
qf11 | β
8oqt | 26
6zah | R. SPACEK AND G. STOLTZ
4v5o | where Bt is a standard d-dimensional Brownian motion independent of Wt. One can also generalize this choice by scaling it by a function of p, leading to the more general choice -b(p) VVq, or introduce a matrix-valued diffusion and consider VD(q, p)V q.
ha9e | Additionally, one could consider a mixed-term forcing, such as -B-1V q p or -- Vg. However, since the diffusion matrix must be symmetric and positive- definite, this prevents us from considering these mixed forcings without adding also a contribution -- 1Vq. Upon writing Ln,a as the sum of a first-order differential operator and Do: V2, we require that Da be symmetric positive, so that one can simulate the associated SDE upon taking the square root of Do, with
xrnt | Da = Do + QĎ, Do = Y 0 Id 0 0 ,
c8ra | where D denotes the diffusion associated with the extra forcings.
p1l0 | Example 3.6 (Feynman-Kac forcing). One possible form of the general forcing in item (3) of Section 3.2.1 is the following, for two functions §1 : Rd -> R and §2 : X -> R:
1i8b | Čextra = {1 (p)TV* + 52(q) TV+
5sfj | The associated dynamics reads
vk4h | dqt = M-1pt dt - an§1 (pt) dt,
nsm3 | dpt = - VV (qt) dt + n(F(qt) - a§2(qt)) dt - YM-1pt dt + V 27 β dWt,
jdfw | whose trajectories are reweighted using the Feynman-Kac weight involving §1 (Ps)TVV (qs)+ §2(qs)TM-1ps in the integral (3.4).
uc9r | 3.3. Choosing the magnitude of the forcing. The synthetic forcing is com- prised of a physical forcing and an extra one, which translates into a perturba- tion Lphys + QLextra at the level of generators. We discuss here how to choose the magnitude o of the extra forcing in order to optimize it in terms of the linear response.
l0ap | Recall from Section 2.2.1 that, for small values of n, we can think of the response as a polynomial in 7:
x815 | ra(n) = En, (R) = np1(a) + n2 p2(a) + · + nn-1 pn-1(a) + O(n).
epbj | In practice, we want to choose a such that the contribution from nonlinear terms is minimized. There are two main approaches to choosing such an optimal a, by (i) canceling the second-order response, or (ii) bounding the relative error with respect to the linear regime. We next discuss both options.
nmn2 | Canceling the second-order response. A first approach to reduce the nonlinear response is to cancel the second-order term 02, as this is the dominant part of the nonlinear bias when n is small. The second-order response is characterized by f2 in (2.25), which reads here
g3tm | (3.12) f2(a) = (Lo1)*(Čphys + @Čextra)*(Lo1)*S = f2,phys + @f2,extra,
tfra | where we decomposed the second-order perturbation of the invariant measure into its physical and synthetic parts. Since f2 is linear in a, the value of a for which p2 is
5lm9 | EXTENDING LINEAR RESPONSE WITH SYNTHETIC FORCINGS

us5v | cancelled is easily obtained from the definition of the second-order response. Indeed,
