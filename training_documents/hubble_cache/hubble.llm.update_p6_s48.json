Thus, the power-law cosmology mimics the Lambda Cold Dark Matter model at Q equals negative one. We obtain the evolutionary S minus R and Q minus R trajectories for the power-law cosmology as shown in Figure six for the values of Q in the range negative one is less than or equal to Q less than zero point five. The black dot in the left panel at the coordinates zero, one represents the location of flat Lambda Cold Dark Matter model while the black dot in the right panel shows the location of the de Sitter point at the coordinates negative one, one. The star symbol in both panels corresponds to the best fit model based on hatch Z plus S N E I A. It is interesting to note that the Lambda Cold Dark Matter statefinder pair zero, one or equivalently the de Sitter point at negative one, one is an attractor in power-law\nzse6 | Constraints on power-law cosmology\np2n3 | Now we find the constraints on the statefinders of power-law cosmology from hatch Z, S N E I A and Big Bang Nucleosynthesis observations. The hatch Z data constrain the statefinders as R equals negative zero point zero nine plus or minus zero point zero four, and S equals zero point fifty-eight plus or minus zero point zero four while the S N E I A data constraints on statefinders are R tilde equals negative zero point zero nine plus or minus zero point zero three and S equals zero point forty-one plus or minus zero point zero three. The joint test of hatch Z and S N E I A data puts the following constraints on statefinders: R equals negative zero point eleven plus or minus zero point zero two. S equals zero point forty-four plus or minus zero point zero three. The errors in the above values are at one sigma level. The primordial nucleosynthesis restricts R greater than or approximately equal to one point seventy-six and S is greater than or equal to one point fifteen. We observe that the best fit values of statefinders R and S predicted by observational hatch Z and S N E I A data are in conflict with the ones estimated by Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, as expected.\nohh7 | Eight.
