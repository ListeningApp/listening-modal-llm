        "content": "b7cq | Deuterium Isotope Effects. Studies of the reaction of deuterated derivatives of one with mono-oxygenase from methylosinus capsulatus Bath failed to reveal any intermolecular isotope effect. Both individual and competitive reactions with the undeuterated and trideuterated derivatives yielded values of K sub H over K sub D observed of approximately one point zero and in good agreement with one another, considering the error limits. It is important to note that the ratio of undeuterated and trideuterated phenols observed in the competition experiment was one point one. When combined with the ratio of zero point eight nine for the undeuterated and dideuterated alcohols one a, this result shows that the overall rates of oxidation of the undeuterated and trideuterated substrates were equal. Thus, there was essentially no kinetic discrimination for substrates by the enzyme, and this behavior suggests that carbon-hydrogen bond breaking is not rate-limiting in the overall hydroxylation reaction. Such a result is consistent with some but not all previous studies of mono-oxygenase hydroxylation reactions using deuterated substrates.\n\n0b39 | Given that the overall oxidation rates of one-do and one-d three were the same, the product distributions should be considered in more detail. If oxidation of each of the enantiomers of substrate one could have occurred at either the methyl group or the aromatic ring, and if rotation can occur in the active site, then a kinetic isotope effect should have been observed in the oxidations of the undeuterated and trideuterated probes, with substantially more phenol product being formed in the latter case. This result is clearly predicted from the intramolecular kinetic isotope effects that were found, vide infra. That such was not the case reinforces our speculation that products one a and one c arise mainly from different enantiomers of the probe.\n\nqecd | In contrast to the lack of an intermolecular isotope effect, a significant intramolecular isotope effect of approximately five point one statistically corrected was observed in oxidations of both the mono- and dideuterated probes one. In each case, the observed isotope effects are equal to the primary kinetic isotope effects K sub H over K sub D divided by a secondary kinetic isotope effect that results from the fact that in both cases an additional deuterium atom remains bound after oxidation of a carbon-hydrogen bond. The data do not permit an extraction of the secondary kinetic isotope effect, but it is clear that the K sub H over K sub D observed ratio signals a substantial carbon-hydrogen bond stretching component in the transition state of the rate-limiting step in the oxidation reaction. The value of K sub H over K sub D observed equals five point one may be compared with the intramolecular isotope effect of seven point eight observed in the oxidation of probe one with pseudomonas oleovorans mono-oxygenase. Recently, a value of K sub H over K sub D equals four point two plus or minus zero point two was reported for mono-oxygenase from methylosinus trichosporium O B three b with the substrates S and R carbon one dash two H carbon one dash three H ethane, in good agreement with the present results. Cytochrome P- four fifty dependent enzymes oxidize a number of substrates with intramolecular isotope effects of seven to fourteen. Intramolecular isotope effects for hydrogen atom abstractions by the reactive tert-butoxy radical studied at temperatures in the vicinity of twenty-five degrees Celsius range from one point two to five point four, and isotope effects for hydrogen abstractions by less reactive peroxy radicals are greater.\n\n1o7p | Mechanistic Considerations: Formation of the Dioxygen-Activated Diiron Center. Scheme two outlines a reasonable working hypothesis for the catalytic mechanism of mono-oxygenase. Substrate first binds to the complete system, which contains all three protein components. Addition of N A D H then effects a two-electron reduction of the hydroxylase from the oxidized Fe two plus two F e three plus to the fully reduced Fe two plus two F e two plus form, bypassing the inactive Fe two plus two F e three plus state. The fully reduced hydroxylase next reacts with dioxygen in a two-electron step to form a diiron three peroxide complex which, either itself or upon transformation via two more electron transfer steps at the diiron center, is sufficiently activated to attack the hydrocarbon substrate. The nature of this transformed species, if it exists, is currently unknown, but it could involve a high-valent iron oxo moiety, by analogy with that proposed for cytochrome P- four fifty. The second iron atom in the mono-oxygenase hydroxylase active site would stabilize such a unit through redox charge delocalization, as shown in Scheme three, in much the same fashion that cytochrome P- four fifty is thought to facilitate the formation of a high-valent iron oxo species through oxidation of the porphyrin ring to a pi-cation radical. Alternatively, the internal two-electron transfer step could produce an active site radical R prime, such as the hydroxyl radical or a ligand-based radical involving an amino acid residue, and an iron four center that would again be stabilized by tautomerization and electron transfer involving the other iron atom, Scheme three. Although there is presently no direct evidence for such a radical species in the mono-oxygenase hydroxylase active site, the combination of a redox-active metal with a protein-derived radical to effect oxygen-activated redox transformations is known in the related iron enzyme ribonucleotide reductase, in the heme peroxidase prostaglandin H synthase,\n\ncp13 | and in the copper enzyme galactose oxidase. A third possibility is that the diiron three peroxide unit itself might be sufficiently activated to carry out the hydroxylation reaction. As depicted in Scheme three, the peroxide ligand might perhaps be coordinated to the diiron three unit in an eta two, eta two fashion, analogous to the binding mode thought to be important in dicopper enzymes that transport or activate dioxygen, for example, hemocyanin and tyrosinase. Other modes of peroxide binding to one or both iron atoms are possible, as indicated in Chart two. Several important model studies have provided spectroscopic evidence for the existence of diiron three peroxides; related species, including a high-valent iron oxo intermediate, have been implicated in hydroxylation and epoxidation reactions. None has yet been structurally characterized, however.\n\nbgre | Once the activated iron center, whatever it may be, is discharged, product is released with concomitant formation of the diiron three form of the hydroxylase that enters another cycle in the catalysis, Scheme two. A peroxide shunt, analogous to that found in the P- four fifty enzyme, has been reported for the methylosinus trichosporium O B three b mono-oxygenase and confirmed by us in the present work. As indicated in Scheme two, the use of hydrogen peroxide permits hydroxylation reactions to occur in the absence of the coupling and reductase proteins. Addition of hydrogen peroxide to hydroxylase isolated from the methylosinus capsulatus Bath organism, however, displays only five to ten percent of the activity measured with the complete, three-protein system.",
