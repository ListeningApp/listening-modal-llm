You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

pk06 | The study of DNA, mRNA and proteins is broadly denoted as geno- mics, transcriptomics, and proteomics respectively. The genetic blue- print of a cell is explored using genomics, which looks at the DNA of individuals and helps us to investigate the presence or absence of certain genes (Gibson, 2015; Vogel and Motulsky, 1997). Transcriptomics studies the transcribed genetic material and examines the genes which

caos | are actively expressed and provides information about what is happening at the cellular level (Milward et al., 2016). Proteomics helps in characterising the information flow happening within the cell and the organism in the form of protein pathways and their networks (Wu et al., 2014).
qrvy | Although metabolomics, lipidomics, and glycomics do not form part of the central dogma analysis (Cobb, 2017), they still provide an invaluable amount of information regarding the metabolites, lipids and glycans (synthesised by the proteome via biosynthetic pathways) (Barh et al., 2011). These substances are the intermediate products of a cell's information flow and therefore are considered to be excellent indicators of the cell's activity. Similar to single-genome studies, metagenomics is used to sequence genetic information from environmental samples without the requirement of isolating individual species (Hugenholtz and Tyson, 2008).
pn9j | All measured omics data can be used as a biomarker which helps us to understand and analyse the underlying characteristics and complex- ities of biological systems (Alberts et al., 2008). Table 1 shows some of the important omics used to study biological systems (Handelsman et al., 1998; Kuska, 1998; Lindon et al., 2011; "Proteomics, transcriptomics,", 1999; Vasta and Ahmed, 2008; Wang et al., 2016; Wilkins and Appel, 2007). All of them are part of the same pipeline of biological informa- tion, whose output depends on the different inputs and regulation. As shown in Table 1, each of these omics can be measured using specialised high-throughput technologies (for example microarray (Bumgarner, 2013) and mass spectrometry (Glaves et al., 2014) for genomics and
1pmc | Table 4 The commonly used ML algorithms and their attributes. The rank [1 - Low, 2 -Medium, 3 - High, 4 - Very High] denoted to attributes is pragmatically assigned based on available literature (Amancio et al., 2014; Barredo Arrieta et al., 2020; de Andrade et al., 2020; Lorena et al., 2011; Rashidi et al., 2019; Sakr et al., 2017).
5z6q | metabolomics respectively). The table also includes a list of recent re- views on each of these omics. High-throughput generated omics data (Lightbody et al., 2019) has played a pivotal role in developing precision medicine biomarkers for diseases such as Alzheimer's (Hampel et al., 2017; Hampel et al., 2016; Kovacs, 2016), diabetes (Capobianco, 2017; McCarthy, 2017; Mutie et al., 2017), cancer (Borad and LoRusso, 2017; Senft et al., 2017), hypertension (Barnes et al., 2016; Dominiczak et al., 2017), cardiovascular (Costantino et al., 2017) and chronic respiratory diseases (Agache and Rogozea, 2017; Hanania and Diamant, 2017). Recently, these omics have also been integrated for COVID-19 studies (Barh et al., 2020; Overmyer et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020). Many other specialised omics have also emerged such as pharmacogenomics (Wang, 2010), methylomics (Liu et al., 2013), interactomics (Luck et al., 2017) and radiomics (Lambin et al., 2017; Wong et al., 2016).
yeoh | Overall, these omics provide a complete picture of cell biology and related cellular function (Cox, 2009). This provided the impetus for the development of various software mechanisms which can offer a pre- diction of a particular phenotype while using the available next- generation multi-omics data (Ritchie et al., 2015). Furthermore, they can be utilised to develop materials and devices which be used for diagnostic and preventive purpose at the molecular level while targeting molecules with greater accuracy (Giovanni Martinelli et al., 2015).
b8hf | 2.2. Machine learning
hntf | Classical statistical modelling has always been the de facto standard choice for health data analysis and its interpretation. In recent years, with the increasing availability of affordable computing power and high-throughput omics data and the success of artificial intelligence technology in various fields, the use of ML has become popular in health sciences (Lee and Yoon, 2017; Clifton et al., 2015; Hung, 2019; Barnett- Itzhaki et al., 2020; Kirchebner et al., 2020). ML can be used to mine information hidden in the experimental data. In contrast, a conventional statistics-based model is usually developed using statistical assumptions and draws an inference about a population from a given dataset (Bzdok, 2017).
99fo | The objective of ML methods is to acquire knowledge from historic or

lrry | present-day data and utilise that understanding to make forecasts or choices for unidentified forthcoming data measures (Gammerman, 2010; Obermeyer and Emanuel, 2016). To assist beginners in the ML domain, a glossary of learning approaches covered in this review (Table 2), standard ML terminology (Table 3) and commonly used ML algorithms (Table 4) are provided. The basic foundations of ML and its uses have been extensively covered in the literature (Bishop, 2006).
hvhm | ML is employed in a wide range of scenarios, where designing and programming explicit algorithms with optimal results is challenging, such as email filtering (Dada et al., 2019), hand-written optical char- acter recognition (Memon et al., 2020), and computer vision (O'Mahony et al., 2020). Also, it has been deployed for self-driving cars (Badue et al., 2021), cyber-security (Handa et al., 2019), automated assistants such as 'Siri', websites that recommend items based on the purchasing decisions of other people and novel solutions to some of the challenging problems of the real world (Watt et al., 2020).
863b | Deep learning has emerged in recent years as the leading class of ML algorithms. It uses neural networks composed of hidden layers per- forming different operations to find complex representations of data. It has pushed the performance of classifiers beyond that of traditional ML algorithms, especially in scenarios involving large-scale datasets with high dimensionality. On the other hand, it is very computationally intensive, requiring high-throughput or high-performance hardware, and lacks explainability (transparency) in feature selection (black-box approach), in the sense that it is difficult to extract from the network the features that the network has found as mainly responsible for the task, e. g. classification (LeCun et al., 2015). However, in the context of multi- omic integration, deep learning offers an exciting opportunity.

d5bi | different keyword and searching across all databases2. Although the use of ML in medical science can be dated back to the 1970s (Davenport and Kalakota, 2019), more rapid growth is evident in the past 10 years. Moreover, publications based on 'multi-omics integration' and 'multi- omics and machine learning' have started to emerge in the last 5 years and have gained popularity in the precision and computational medicine domain. Although deep learning is widely popular in other related do- mains (such as medical imaging (Erickson et al., 2017) and clinical natural language processing (Wu et al., 2020)), the interest has been more limited for multi-omics analysis (Tan et al., 2020b). This is because multi-omics studies are challenging to deploy as they require specialised high-throughput omic infrastructure (as highlighted earlier in section 2). This fact is reinforced by the evidence that most of the current literature employs deep learning on large-scale multi-omics datasets from open sources such as TCGA3, CCLE4 and GDSC5 for cancer prog- nosis (Poirion et al., 2018; Seal et al., 2020; Tong et al., 2020; Lee et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020) and anti-cancer drug response (Sharifi-Noghabi et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019; Deng et al., 2020).
ba4l | 3. Challenges in multi-omics analysis using machine learning
ffx8 | The use of ML to analyse high-throughput generated multi-omic data poses key unique challenges. They can be summarised as follows.
s6su | 3.1. Heterogeneity, sparsity and outliers
y219 | Multi-omic data from different high-throughput sources are usually
06ht | Biotechnology Advances 49 (2021) 107739
v3r2 | heterogeneous (Bersanelli et al., 2016). For example, transcriptomics and proteomics use different normalisation and scaling techniques before omics analysis. This leads to different dynamic ranges and data distribution. Also, some omics are more prone to generating sparse data (e.g. in the case of metabolomics, some values might be below the limit of detection and hence assigned null value (Antonelli et al., 2019)) than others. Therefore, imputation (Liew et al., 2011) and outlier detection (Vivian et al., 2020) should be considered for each omic separately, before planning their integration.
nv42 | 3.2. Class imbalance and overfitting
xags | In disease classification, certain disease classes are rarer than others which can cause a class imbalance in the multi-omics dataset (Haas et al., 2017). For example, primary hypertension is the most common form of hypertension with 95% prevalence while endocrine hyperten- sion occurs in only 5% (Rimoldi et al., 2014). The ML model trained using an imbalanced dataset may be overfitted i.e. high accuracy for training data but underperformance for unseen test data. Therefore, to classify these two types of hypertension one of the following approaches can be used: 1) Collect more data if possible, or 2) consider using weighted or normalised metrics to measure the ML performance (such as F1-Score or Kappa (Jeni et al., 2013)), or 3) consider over or under- sampling the under or over-represented class respectively, or 4) consider synthetic sample generation (such as SMOTE (Chawla et al., 2002) or ADASYN (Haibo He et al., 2008)) for the under-represented class. Similarly, techniques such as regularisation, bagging, hyper- parameter tuning and cross-validation can be used to balance bias- variance trade-off (Lee, 2010). Any of the above approaches can be used, depending on data and problem, to overcome the class imbalance and overfitting problems.
jc47 | 3.3. More features than data (p >> n)
ko3c | Most multi-omics datasets suffer from the classical 'curse of dimen- sionality' problem, i.e. having much fewer observation samples (n) than
xek3 | multi-omics features (p) (Misra et al., 2019). The resulting high- dimensional space often contains correlated features which are redun- dant and can mislead the algorithm training (James et al., 2017). The dimensional space of the data can be reduced by employing dimen- sionality reduction techniques such as feature extraction and feature se- lection. Feature extraction refers here to techniques computing a subset of representative features which summarise the original dataset and its dimensions6. These features are functions of the original ones, for instance, PCA (principal component analysis) (Jolliffe, 2002), LDA (linear discriminant analysis) (Martinez and Kak, 2001) and MDS (multidi- mensional scaling) (Young and Hamer, 1987). On the other hand, feature selection finds a subset of the original features that maximise the accuracy of a predictive model (Guyon and Elisseeff, 2003). It can be based on prior knowledge i.e. evident from known literature or based on a database such as a Biofilter (Bush et al., 2009). Formally, feature se- lection methods can be classed as filter (Information gain (Roobaert et al., 2006), ReliefF (Beretta and Santaniello, 2011), Chi-square sta- tistics (Lee et al., 2011)), wrapper (Recursive feature elimination (Guyon et al., 2002), Sequential feature selection (Pudil et al., 1994)) and embedded (such as LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) (Zou, 2006)) techniques. Xu et al.(Xu et al., 2019b) and Stańczyk (Stańczyk and Jain, 2015) provide an excellent resource for understanding and exploring the use of different dimensionality reduc- tion techniques in the generic ML domain. Meng (Meng et al., 2016b) offers a review of these methods from the perspective of multi-omics data analysis.
bbpr | 3.4. Computation and storage cost
5zyf | The use of ML for multi-omics analysis comes with computational and data storage cost (Herrmann et al., 2020). Most ML algorithms require high computation power and large volumes of storage capacity to save the logs, results and analysis. In recent years, ML models can be deployed on dedicated graphics processing units (Schmidhuber, 2015) and cloud computing platforms (Armbrust et al., 2010) such as Amazon EC2 ("Amazon EC2,", 2021), Microsoft Azure ("Cloud Computing Ser- vices | Microsoft Azure,", 2021a) and Google Cloud Platform ("Cloud Computing Services,", 2021b). The related costs should be considered well in advance before planning an ML-based multi-omics workflow.
