You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

The basic hypothesis is of a random pattern in each case. We may compare the performance of the two measures by using their equivalent <LATEX>\mathrm { z }</LATEX> values of the approximate normal distribution.

dqn8 | TABLE 2 Standard Normal Variates for <LATEX>G \left( d \right)</LATEX> and <LATEX>I \left( d \right)</LATEX> under Varying Circumstances for a Specified d Value
cop0 | The juxtaposition of high values next to lows provides the high negative covari- ance needed for the strong negative spatial autocorrelation <LATEX>\mathrm { Z } \left( I \right) ,</LATEX> but it is the multiplicative effect of high values near lows that has the negative effect on
lhkq | <LATEX>Z \left( G \right) .</LATEX> Table 2 gives some idea of the values of <LATEX>Z \left( G \right)</LATEX> and <LATEX>Z \left( I \right)</LATEX> under various circum- stances. The differences result from each statistic's structure. As shown in the examples above, if high values within <LATEX>d</LATEX> of other high values dominate the pattern, then the summation of the products of neighboring values is high, with resulting high positive <LATEX>Z \left( G \right)</LATEX> values. If low values within <LATEX>d</LATEX> of low values dominate, then the sum of the product of the xs is low resulting in strong negative <LATEX>Z \left( G \right)</LATEX> values. In the Moran's case, both when high values are within <LATEX>d</LATEX> of other high values and low values are within <LATEX>d</LATEX> of other low values, positive covariance is high, with resulting high <LATEX>Z \left( I \right)</LATEX> values.
82ju | Any test for spatial association should use both types of statistics. Sums of products and covariances are two different aspects of pattern. Both reflect the dependence structure in spatial patterns. The <LATEX>\bar { I } \left( d \right)</LATEX> statistic has its peculiar weak- ness in not being able to discriminate between patterns that have high values dominant within <LATEX>d</LATEX> or low values dominant. Both statistics have difficulty discern- ing a random pattern from one in which there is little deviation from the mean.
y2qo | If a study requires that <LATEX>I \left( d \right)</LATEX> or <LATEX>G \left( d \right)</LATEX> values be traced over time, there are advantages to using both statistics to explore the processes thought to be respon- sible for changes in association among regions. If data values increase or decrease at the same rate, that is, if they increase or decrease in proportion to their already existing size, Moran's I changes while <LATEX>G \left( d \right)</LATEX> remains the same. On the other hand, if all <LATEX>x</LATEX> values increase or decrease by the same amount, <LATEX>G \left( d \right)</LATEX> changes but <LATEX>I \left( d \right)</LATEX> remains the same.
1piq | It must be remembered that <LATEX>G \left( d \right)</LATEX> is based on a variable that is positive and has a natural origin. Thus, for example, it is inappropriate to use <LATEX>\mathrm { G } \left( d \right)</LATEX> to study resid- uals from regression. Also, for both <LATEX>I \left( d \right)</LATEX> and <LATEX>G \left( d \right)</LATEX> one must recognize that trans- formations of the variable <LATEX>X</LATEX> result in different values for the test statistic.
