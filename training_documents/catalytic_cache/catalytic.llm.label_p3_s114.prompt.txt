You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

8r5j | ABSTRACT
2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

d6r4 | 3.1 Formation of carbon spheres
9mrz | The brown powder synthesized through hydrothermal carbon- ization of glucose are spherical particles. It is worth noting that the formation of carbon spheres is influenced by hydrothermal temperature, reaction time and the concentration of glucose. SEM observations indicated that when the hydrothermal temperature decreased from 200 ℃ to 180 ℃, the diameter of carbon spheres showed a decreased trend (Fig. S1a-d+). More- over, the particle size distributions in Fig. S1a-di demonstrated that the particle sizes of <LATEX>G _ { 1 } - 2 0 0 - 1 0</LATEX> and <LATEX>G _ { 1 } - 1 8 0 - 1 0</LATEX> were 490 nm and 235 nm accounted for a large percentage. Lower hydro- thermal temperature would lead to the formation of smaller carbon spheres (Fig. S1e and ft). By adjusting the parameters of the synthesis process, we could obtain carbon spheres with the calculated average particle diameter of ~190 nm <LATEX>\left( G _ { 0 . 5 } - 1 8 0 - 1 0 \right.</LATEX> However, no solid product of carbon spheres were formed except brown solutions in the case of lower hydrothermal temperature (140 ℃) even with a longer reaction time of 20 h. The brown solution without the formation of carbon spheres suggested that aromatic compounds and oligosaccharides were formed in the "polymerization" step, while none of the nuclei was generated and to be continued growing.25,26 To investigate the graphitization transformation process better, carbon spheres with a diameter <LATEX>o f \sim 1 9 0</LATEX> nm were chosen as the precursor.
pk06 | 3.2 Graphitization process
7wn9 | The fabrication procedures of graphitic samples of FC-1-8 and FC-1-8-HCl through K2FeO4 activation and catalyst graphitiza- tion were illustrated in Fig. 1. Cheap and commercially available glucose was chosen as the carbon source to synthesize amor- phous carbon spheres through hydrothermal carbonization. The as-obtained carbon spheres were then mixed with <LATEX>\mathrm { K } _ { 2 } \mathrm { F e O } _ { 4 }</LATEX> providing activation agent KOH and <LATEX>\mathrm { F e } \left( \mathrm { O H } \right) _ { 3 }</LATEX> as eqn (2).

pn9j | In this step, KOH would react with carbon spheres and develop pores on the surface of samples. The graphitization transformation is as follows: the Fe species are transformed to <LATEX>\mathrm { F e } _ { 3 } O _ { 4 }</LATEX> when annealed from 400 ℃ to <LATEX>6 0 0 ^ { \circ } C _ { * } ^ { 2 7 , 2 8 }</LATEX> In the case of 700 ℃, <LATEX>\mathrm { F e } _ { 3 } O _ { 4 }</LATEX> is converted to metallic Fe as a result of the reduction of amorphous carbon by <LATEX>H _ { 2 }</LATEX> or CO produced during the pyrolysis process and when the temperature is further increased to 800 ℃, graphitized carbon is formed under the catalysis of Fe.29 Apart from the existence of metallic Fe, a portion of Fe transforms into well-crystallized Fe3C. It was reported that the metallic Fe and pyrolytic carbon lead to the formation of Fe3C.30,31 Therefore, the results verified that the FC- 1-8 sample was consisted of Fe3C/Fe and graphitic carbon. As displayed in Fig. <LATEX>2 a ,</LATEX> the diffraction peaks locating at 37.6°, 42.9º, 43.7º and 45.9° correspond to Fe3C with the standard PDF card of JCPDS no. 35-0772. Two diffraction peaks are detected at 44.6º and 65.0°, which belong to the (110) and (200) planes of Fe (JCPDS no. 06-0696). Furthermore, carbon in the whole process was partly oxidized to CO/CO2 and carbonate and as a result, the porous structure was obtained.32 Obviously, graphitic carbon could be formed when annealed at the temperature of 800 °C.
1pmc | To investigate the function of <LATEX>K _ { 2 } F e O _ { 4 } ,</LATEX> carbon spheres annealed without the treatment of <LATEX>\mathrm { K } _ { 2 } \mathrm { F e O } _ { 4 } \left( \mathrm { F C } - 0 - 8 \right)</LATEX> were studied for comparison. From the XRD pattern in Fig. 2a, two relatively broad peaks were existed in the pattern of FC-0-8, implying that the dominant component of the above was amorphous carbon. Validated by the XRD pattern of FC-1-8-HCl, Fe3C/Fe composites were removed successfully. According to the nitrogen adsorp- tion-desorption isotherms plotted in Fig. 2b, FC-1-8-HCl showed IV-type adsorption-desorption isotherm with H4-type hysteresis loop, indicating the presence of mesopores. The SSA of the obtained FC-0-8 is <LATEX>4 7 9 . 8 m ^ { 2 } g ^ { - 1 } ,</LATEX> while the chemical activation treatment with K2FeO4 developed more pores making it increased to <LATEX>5 4 5 . 5 m ^ { 2 } g ^ { - 1 }</LATEX> for FC-1-8. FC-1-8-HCl showed the largest SSA up to <LATEX>2 8 1 3 . 6 m ^ { 2 } g ^ { - }</LATEX> 1, resulting from the pores caused by the removal of Fe3C/Fe NPs. The pore size distribution in Fig. 2c revealed that the pore diameter of these samples was ~3 nm, suggesting these samples were rich in mesopores.
5z6q | Raman spectra were conducted to characterize the graphitiza- tion degree. Typically, the band at 1350 cm-1, known as D-band, is assigned to defect sites or the disordered sp2 carbon. The G band at 1580 cm-1 is corresponded to the in-plane vibrational mode of sp2 hybridized carbon.33 The intensity ratio of <LATEX>I _ { \mathrm { D } } / I _ { \mathrm { G } }</LATEX> values for FC- 0-8, FC-1-8 and FC-1-8-HCl are 1.30, 0.99 and 1.00, respectively (Fig. 2d). Compared with FC-0-8, the lower <LATEX>I _ { \mathrm { D } } / I _ { \mathrm { G } }</LATEX> values of FC-1-8 and FC-1-8-HCl indicated a relatively short-range order graphitic carbon because of the treatment of K2FeO4. Furthermore, the <LATEX>\mathrm { X }</LATEX> ray photoelectron spectrum verified the existence of C, O and Fe elements in the surface of FC-1-8 (as illustrated in Fig. 2e).32 The high-resolution spectra Fe 2p orbit showed two dominant peaks at 711.0 and 713.1 eV, which were indexed to the <LATEX>2 \mathrm { p } _ { 3 / 2 }</LATEX> orbitals of <LATEX>F e ^ { 2 + }</LATEX> and <LATEX>\mathrm { F e } ^ { 3 ^ { 4 } } ,</LATEX> respectively (Fig. 2f). The peaks located at a binding energy of 724.6 eV, 726.4 eV and 718.5 eV were assigned to <LATEX>\mathrm { F e } ^ { 2 }</LATEX> and <LATEX>\mathrm { F e } ^ { 3 + }</LATEX> for the <LATEX>2 p _ { 1 / 2 }</LATEX> band, and a satellite.34

lrry | To evaluate the surface morphology and structure of the samples, SEM measurements of FC-0-8, FC-1-8 and FC-1-8-HCl were conducted (Fig. 3). After annealed in <LATEX>\mathrm { A r }</LATEX> atmosphere at 800 ℃, the as-prepared carbon spheres (FC-0-8) became black and maintained a similar structure and the carbon spheres interconnected forming the 3D network, which was favorable to electron transfer. Besides, FC-1-8 and FC-1-8-HCl generally inherited their structure except for the rough surface of carbon spheres. Furthermore, a comparison of SEM images revealed that the average diameter of the FC-1-8-HCl sample was a little bit smaller than that of FC-1-8 after the removal of Fe3C/Fe NPs. Convinced by the particle size distributions (Fig. S2+), as measured by a statistical method measuring the diameter of 100 particles, the average size of FC-1-8 decreased from ~450 nm to <LATEX>\sim 2 4 0</LATEX> nm after being etched by HCl.
hvhm | The TEM images of FC-0-8 presented disordered carbon lattice fringes (Fig. 4a-c), suggesting the existence of amorphous carbon. As shown in Fig. 4d-f, the HRTEM of FC-1-8 was composed of graphitic carbon and Fe NPs. The lattice fringe with a spacing of 0.34 nm corresponded to the (002) plane of carbon and the lattice fringe calculated to be 0.20 nm and 0.24 nm were assigned to the (101) plane of Fe and (111) plane of Fe3C, respectively. Obviously, the existence of metallic Fe contributed to the formation of graphitic carbon. The corresponding elemental mappings of C and Fe further verified that the rough surface of carbon spheres should be Fe3C/Fe NPs (Fig. 4g-i). Part of FC-1-8-HCl NPs showed irregular structure while the HRTEM images in Fig. 41 confirmed the existence of graphitic carbon.
863b | The whole process was economic and environmentally friendly without any toxic or hazardous materials input. FC-1-8 and FC-1-8-HCl were expected to be excellent electrode mate- rials. On the one hand, the partial graphitization with hierar- chical porosity structure could offer large SSA value and electroactive sites. On the other hand, the graphitic carbon ensured conductivity of the sample.
fj24 | 3.3 Electrochemical performance
uz3c | Electrochemical properties of the obtained carbon material were examined under a voltage window from -1.2 to -0.3 V at a scan rate of 100 mV s-1 initially in a three-electrode configuration. As shown in Fig. 5a, the FC-1-8 electrode displayed a larger area than the other two samples, implying a larger capacitance value. A pair of explicit and symmetrical cathodic and anodic peaks can be observed in the CV curve of FC-1-8, implying a kind of pseudo- capacitive behavior. It was reported that Fe3C species can be oxidized to <LATEX>\mathrm { F e } _ { 3 } O _ { 4 }</LATEX> irreversibly in the KOH electrolyte and result in the reversible redox reaction of the newly formed Fe3O4 material as expressed by the following eqn (3).21

ba4l | Notably, the graphitic FC-1-8-HCl displayed a much larger integral area than FC-0-8, which convincingly demonstrated excellent energy storage performance. In other words, carbon materials with higher graphitization degree exhibit superior Faraday capacitance. In detail, according to the GCD profiles,
