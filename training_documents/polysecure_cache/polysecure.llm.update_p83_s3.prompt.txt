You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

cusa | . In your relationships, discuss how available you want to be to each other (i.e., to what extent or at what frequency), be clear about what you can gener- ally offer and follow through regarding time, attention and forms of com- munication.
yrit | As best as you can, clearly communicate when you will be unavailable, whether that is times during the day, specific days of the week, standing dates with certain partners, trips, holidays, etc. When we can't be available to our partners, the next best thing for both of our attachment systems is to tell them when we will be out of reach and when we will be back. If you can't be immediately available to one of your partners, the next best thing you can do is let them know when you can, so that they know what to expect.
xwzi | E: EXPRESSED DELIGHT
7rjv | The next thing that you can do to nurture more polysecurity with your partners is offer expressed delight. Brown and Elliot describe expressed delight as one of the
daj4 | foundational elements of secure attachment.70 When a parent shows pleasure not just in the things that their child does, but in who their child is, a positive sense of self and healthy self-esteem are fostered in the child. As adults, expressed delight is also needed to promote secure attachment and a healthy sense of self within the relationship. When our partners are able to articulate the ways that we are special and valuable to them, our interpersonal self-worth is supported. When we express the ways that we appreciate and are grateful for our partners, we create a culture of positivity in our relationships that allows mutual vulnerability, authenticity and joy to flourish. We can express the delight we have for our partners through our words, our actions, our touch, as well as just the look in our eyes. Diane Poole Heller and her colleagues use the term beam gleam (also known as the attachment gaze) to refer to the nonverbal expression of warmth, kindness and love that radiates from our eyes, letting our partners know that they are special to us.
dt0u | In nonmonogamy, expressed delight is imperative. The paradigm shift from the monogamous mindset of I am with you because you are the only one for me to the nonmonogamous view that / am with you because you are special and unique, but not the only one, can be difficult to grasp. Even when people don't want to be, the hang- over of monogamous thinking often leaves people feeling competitive with their metamours and/or doubtful as to why their partners would want to be with them if they don't have the specific qualities, circumstances, sexual interests or physical at- tributes that other partners have. Even when people have a healthy sense of self and esteem, they still need positive feedback as to why their partners cherish them and choose to be with them, especially when, theoretically, they can choose to be with many others. There is nothing wrong with needing to hear why you are wanted and valued by your partners and it is important for you to be able to communicate to your partners why they specifically matter to you. Experiencing expressed delight and knowing the ways you are precious in your partners' lives can be an important resource to lean on when feeling jealous or threatened by a metamour or potential new partners. Instead of spinning out into doubt and fear, being able to recall the ways your partners experience you as special, even irreplaceable, can soothe the
iroe | anxious mind and allow for more compersion to arise.
m9bf | Questions to Consider
44d4 | . How do you already show expressed delight for your partners?
5rgr | . Would your partners like more or different expressed delight from you? How can you provide this?
a1gl | . How do your partners let you know that you are unique, special and precious to them?
vxin | . Are there additional or different ways that you would like to experience ex- pressed delight from your partners?
vj4s | . Are there certain situations (e.g., before or after your partner is out on a date with someone else) that expressed delight is more or less supportive to you and/or your partners?
x4c3 | Things to Try and to Experiment With
jhyp | . Let your partner know in spoken and/or written word how they enrich your life.
1dwr | · Let your partner know in spoken and/or written word how unique and special they are to you.
0acx | . Let your partner know in spoken and/or written word the specific things that you love and appreciate about them. These should be based on who they are versus the things that they do for you.
9ejb | . If you are less of a verbal type, make a meal, do a dance, create a piece of art or do something fitting to your style that is effective at intentionally repre- senting and expressing to your partners how unique and precious they are to you.
3dzn | . After spending time with a partner, let them know the things you enjoyed about your time together and what specific things they did that were mean- ingful to you. You can do this either right when you are saying goodbye, as you are going to bed together or within a few hours or days after you were to- gether.
tnh4 | . With your partners, take on a gratitude practice where you set aside a regular time to each appreciate the ways in which they've been supportive or shown up that have been meaningful to each of you. You can share something your partner did that you are grateful for at the end of each day, or you can set aside a few minutes once a week to share your gratitude from the week.
cn2s | . Flash your partner the eyesl You'd be surprised what just three seconds of the attachment gaze/beam gleam can do to fortify your attachment bond. When in a new relationship with someone, we rarely have to remind our- selves of this because everything in our body is easily oozing that this person is the eighth wonder of the world to us, but bringing this back in our longer- term relationships can support feeling that spark again. Seeing our partners giving the attachment gaze to other people might be painful when we are no longer in new relationship energy with that partner. Try intentionally sending the beam gleam to your partners and you will be pleasantly surprised at what it can do to feed each other's attachment systems and strengthen your con- nection.
seh0 | A: ATTUNEMENT
l0vz | Our attachment bonds are emotional bonds, and being able to emotionally tune into and connect with our partners is at the core of feeling safe and secure to- gether. Attunement is a state of resonance with our partners and the act of turning towards them in an attempt to understand the fullness of their perspective and experience. Attuning to a partner does not mean that you have to agree with them and take on their experience as your own, but it does mean that you are willing to join them in their internal emotional world and their inner state of mind in order to empathize with what they are going through. Attunement is meeting your partner with curiosity, wanting to understand their feelings and needs. It is the feeling of being seen, understood and "gotten" by the other. As children, it is through being attuned to by our attachment figures, by having them mirror and match our experi- ences and help us make sense of our inner experiences, that we are able to then
ko4g | develop the ability to identify our own thoughts and emotions and subsequently self-regulate these emotional and mental states. As adults we still need to be met and understood in order to best regulate ourselves. It is through being connected with others, and through feeling held, understood and supported by others that we are able to tolerate and regulate our own emotional responses.
