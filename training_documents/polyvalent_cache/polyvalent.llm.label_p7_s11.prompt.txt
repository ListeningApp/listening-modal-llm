You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,

82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

0bqy | General Bacteria and Phage Protocols and Bio- panning. Bacteria strains were stored in 50% glycerol solution at -80 ℃. Bacteria were sown on LB plates containing 5 µg/ mL of tetracycline and inoculated into fresh LB at least one day before experiments.
b780 | Phages were suspended in PBS solutions and stored at 4 ℃. Titration was performed using the protocol described by Łos et al.59 Briefly, immediately before usage 200 µL of bacteria culture was suspended in warm agar and split onto bottom agar containing x-gal and IPTG. Then, 2.5 µL of subsequent 10-fold dilutions of the phage sample were dripped onto the bacteria lawn. Prepared plates were incubated overnight at 37 °C. Phage titer was calculated by multiplying the number of single dots by the dilution factor and the constant coefficient for volume correction and depicted in plaque-forming units per milliliter (pfu/mL). Amplification and purification of phages were performed according to well-established protocols with slight modifications.35
ccmb | Plate panning was performed regarding the general concept presented by Barbas et al. with some modifications. Polystyrene plates were precoated with TnT and incubated overnight (18-24 h) in 100 µL of 20 µg/mL TnT solution in PBS at 4 ℃. Then, the wells were emptied and filled with 100 <LATEX>\mu \mathrm { I }</LATEX> of 0.1% BSA solution (in PBS) and incubated for 2 h in the fridge. Later, they were washed four times with PBST 0.1% (in the first panning round) and 0.5% in the next two. For the first panning round, 100 <LATEX>\mu \mathrm { L }</LATEX> of 100x diluted Ph.D .- 12 Phage Display Peptide Library was used; however, it was tried immediately before use, showing an accurate phage concen- tration of <LATEX>8 . 4 \times 1 0 ^ { 8 } .</LATEX> After 1 h of incubation on the shaker at room temperature, wells were washed four times using 0.1% (in the first round) or 0.5% (in further rounds) PBST. After washing, 100 µL of elution buffer (0.2 M glycine- HCl, pH 2.2) was added, and after 10 min it was collected. 10 <LATEX>\mu \mathrm { L }</LATEX> was used to titrate the output phase, while 90 µL was directly transferred into the bacteria culture for amplification. Lysates (products of amplification and purification of phages) were titered and used for subsequent pannings or single clone isolation. This isolation was performed via whole-plate titration

nav4 | Peptide Structure Prediction and Interaction Model- ing. Three-dimensional structures of peptides exposed on the N-terminus of pIII protein were generated using PEP- FOLD3-a part of the online Mobyle system generously provided by Institute Pasteur and Paris Diderot Univer- sity.9-41 Peptides were analyzed with 30 N-terminal amino acids of pIII after cleavage of the signal sequence (fragment: (X)12GGGAETVESCLAKPHTENSFTNVWKDDKTL- <LATEX>D R Y ^ { 3 5 , 6 1 }</LATEX> in order to maximize mimicking of the local environment of the peptide. Human cardiac TnT N-terminal fragment 2-50 (SDIEEVVEEYEEEEQEEAAVEEEED- WREDEDEQEEAAEEDAEAEAETEE45) without cleavaged Met was generated in the same manner.
gem8 | Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay. ELISAs were performed in 96-well polystyrene plates (Thermo Scientific, USA). Wells were precoated with the desired protein 16- 20 h incubation of the protein suspension in PBS <LATEX>t 4 ^ { \circ } C .</LATEX> assays, 1:5000 dilution of HRP-antiM13pVIII monoclonal antibody conjugate was used. Signals were recorded using Synergy HTX Multi-Mode Reader by BioTek.
e8nr | In the initial screening, plates were precoated with troponin T or BSA (negative control) by incubating 100 <LATEX>\mu \mathrm { L }</LATEX> of 1 µg/mL appropriate protein solution. Then plates were blocked with 0.1% BSA for 2 h at 4 ℃ and washed 4 times with 0.1% PBST. Every isolated phage clone solution (phages concentration <LATEX>1 0 ^ { 1 0 }</LATEX> pfu/mL, 100 µL) was incubated with TnT and BSA for 1 h at 350 rpm at room temperature. Then wells were washed 4 times using 0.1% PBST, 100 <LATEX>\mu</LATEX> of HRP-antibody conjugate was added, and plates were incubated as previously. After 1 h, plates were washed as before, and 50 µL of TMB was added. After 5 min, the reaction was stopped by adding 50 µL of 2 M sulfuric acid. Absorbance at 450 nm was read using a Synergy HTX Multi-Mode Reader (BioTek) plate reader.
k78w | The application of k-ELISA for measuring phage concen- tration was performed by precoating wells using 0.25 <LATEX>\mu g / m I</LATEX> TnT (or BSA in the negative control). The next steps regarding washing were performed in the same way as described above, despite 0.01% myoglobin being applied for blocking phages concentrations (range: <LATEX>0 . 2 \times 1 0 ^ { 9 } ,</LATEX> <LATEX>4 \times 1 0 ^ { 9 } ,</LATEX> <LATEX>6 \times</LATEX> <LATEX>1 0 ^ { 5 } ,</LATEX> <LATEX>\left. 8 \times 1 0 ^ { 9 } \text { pfu/mL } \right)</LATEX> and HRP-conj. Antibody solutions were added in amounts of 50 µL. Myoglobin was chosen as a blocking agent due to its small size (approximately 17 kDa), globular shape, and low price. BSA as a widely used blocking agent was avoided because it was present in all panning rounds, and peptides were suspected of exhibiting affinity to BSA. The signal was recorded by reading absorbance at 370 nm in a kinetic experiment every 70 s for 10 min.
g9du | The dissociation constant was calculated using k-ELISA, according to the procedure first described by Friguet.2 Phages <LATEX>\left( \sim 1 0 ^ { 1 0 } \right.</LATEX> pfu/mL corresponding to about 16 pM) were preincubated with different concentrations of TnT from 0 to 4 ng/ml (which corresponds to 108 pM). Next, mixtures were transferred into wells precoated with 0.25 µg/mL TnT (or BSA). Further steps were performed in the same manner as for phage concentration measuring experiments.
