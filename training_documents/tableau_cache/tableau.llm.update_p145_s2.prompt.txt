You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

dz0a | The following are the three types of LOD calculations:
q510 | . FIXED: This computes a value for the dimension that you specify
v1pm | · INCLUDE: This computes at a dimensional level and is not included in the visualization itself
4egp | · EXCLUDE: This excludes a dimension that is a part of the visualization
y2bg | LOD has a big caveat. While you can perform table calculations on them and create aggregations and functions within them, you cannot include table calculations in them.
a06d | A FIXED LOD calculation
78t1 | Each LOD calculation has the following three features that are different from those that we have discussed before:
hww6 | . The LOD expression type: In this case, the LOD expression type is FIXED
hd24 | . The Dimension on which the calculation is operating (you can add dimension levels, which should be arranged in the increasing order of granularity by separating them with a comma): In this case, it is Region
zbcg | . The Aggregation: In this case, it is COUNTD([Country Name])
jvtd | Note that the entire expression is enclosed in curly braces, as shown in the following screenshot. The LOD calculations are the only instances in Tableau Public where you will use curly braces:
08yy | This field provides us with the unique number of countries in each region, even though 80 percent of these countries are filtered out. This provides great context.
1d45 | In the following example, we will discuss:
d6qk | 1. Add this field, which is a measure, to the Rows shelf to the right of Country.
3y4w | 2. Then, click on its Context menu and select Discrete instead of continuous so that it becomes a dimension.
6shd | Chapter 6
r2xm | 3. Drag the field so that it's to the right of Region and to the left of Country, as shown in the following screenshot:
yosi | This visualization shows us the bottom 20 percent of the 53 countries in Africa in the data set. It would be even more helpful to know what the overall access to improved water sources is in each region and not just by country.
qnky | The following are a few issues that we need to overcome with virtualization:
ynfn | . The data is not necessarily set up for this.
5bgy | . The granularity of the data is at the country level, and we only know the percentage in each country that has access to clean water. We don't know the discrete number.
i4fl | . We do not have the totals by region. We need to determine the overall number of people with access to clean drinking water, and then we need to divide this number by the population of each region.
1tgm | The INCLUDE and nested LOD calculations
9jcg | In the following example, we will show you how to solve some problem by using an INCLUDE LOD calculation nested within a FIXED LOD calculation, and each will be aggregated. This is an issue that most people have had to solve by using data sources with different levels of aggregation, which takes a lot of time to develop and render in Tableau Public.
14nm | Create a new field within the World Development Indicators data source and name it Population with Access to Improved Water. It's kind of a long name, but we want to ensure that no one misunderstands the metric.
pfum | Level of Detail and Table Calculations
uipr | So, here's our approach to calculating the overall percentage of each region with access to clean water:
mlys | . The primary LOD type is FIXED at the Region level.
emzh | . The numerator (enclosed in the red box shown in the following screenshot) adds up the total population that has access to clean water.
ehya | . The secondary LOD type is INCLUDE at the Country Name level. We are using INCLUDE because we want to roll up the country-level data to the region.
j4z8 | Rationale: For every country, we need to know the total population that has access to the sources of clean water. We have the percentage of the population. So, we need to multiply the maximum percentage with the total population to get the number of people who have access to clean water.
pe03 | • The denominator (enclosed in the blue box in the following screenshot) is the total population. We need to know the total population by region. So, we add up the total population of each country.
6yda | . We will use the INCLUDE function at the Country Name level and then use the MAX aggregations. The granularity of the data is at the Year level. We are not including Year, because that would produce the population at the Country Name and Year level. We just want the total population of each country, as shown in the following screenshot:
q2fe | Chapter 6
70pp | This is a long field, but it accomplishes what has been difficult before, namely aggregating at multiple dimensional levels in one calculation without duplications, and aggregating records that are not a part of the visualization.
60bu | Add this field to the Rows shelf of the previous bar chart, turn it into a discrete field, and drag it to the left of Country Name, just as we did for Country Count.
vkzu | Also, right-click on the new calculated field, click on Default Properties, and then select Format so that we can set the number format as a percentage.
uynl | Here's the finished product. Only 69 percent of the people in Africa have access to clean drinking water:
az42 | Summary
j06k | In this chapter, you learned how to create quick table calculations to add depth and context to your visualizations. You also learned how to edit table calculations, how the different types of table calculations function, and how to address table calculations and create them manually. One of the important features of data analysis is the comparison of a data point to the others around it so that users understand the context of its performance. You learned how to create a basic, and advanced level of detail calculations to aggregate data points that are not visible, and to aggregate at multiple dimensional levels as well.
x0fk | In the next chapters, which focus on mapping and parameters, we will discuss using many of the concepts that you learned here to give control to your users and illustrate compelling, rich stories with contextually curated visualizations.
1wgb | Dashboard Design and Styling
fh0l | The purpose of a dashboard is to tell a story. In the scheme of human history, hieroglyphs, the Bible, epic poems, theatre, comic books, and even social media are a few of the many different media through which we recount events to each other. All stories have one of the several primary purposes, to teach values or historical lessons, create culture, motivate people to take action, or entertain, to name a few.
3jj5 | Knowing the purpose of the story that you are telling is imperative to making it memorable. Good stories have several important attributes, which should be kept in mind when you are working. Some of these attributes are as follows:
ak6r | · They're simple and focused
yv80 | . They create an emotional response
wkav | . Listeners can relate to the actors in them
k141 | · They have good, real data
18xq | It's a good idea to take a few minutes to think about the story that you want to tell before you even create a new dashboard. Think about the stories that are the most memorable to you and the data points in them. Then, put yourself in the place of your listener. Design with your listener in mind. If you can develop a list of the top three data questions that you think are most important to your listener and then design a dashboard that focuses on answering them simply and evocatively, then your dashboard will likely be impactful.
