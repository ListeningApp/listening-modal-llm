A jack of all trades. People relied on me a lot on the reservation, and I did things even when I wasn't paid.\"\n7c6p | Rigel (empathizing mode): \"Thank you for sharing that with me. It sounds like you are concerned that you may not be able to do the handyman jobs that you used to do, and, therefore, that you will not be useful to those that you care about.\"\nd1ee | Mr. Johnson: \"That's pretty much it. No amount of therapy can give that back to me.\"\nitx4 | Rigel (empathizing mode): \"Having lost so much of your ability to control your muscles and your balance, it makes sense that you would think that your abilities will never improve.\" (shifting to the advocating mode) \"I have worked with a lot of people, and\nvwrs | Mr. Johnson remains silent but gazes at Rigel.\nxjkw | Rigel (shifting to instructing mode): \"Mr. Johnson, I cannot tell you how much body function you are going to recover. That is a highly individual outcome that varies from person to person. What I can tell you is that working with me toward some concrete goals, beginning now, during these early days after your stroke, will allow you to gain more function than if you do not participate in therapy.\"\nwght | Mr. Johnson nods affirmatively and responds with an invitation: \"You can call me Bart.\"\n3lgb | Rigel (continuing with the instructing mode): \"Now that I know a little bit about what you were doing before your stroke, I would recommend that we work on activities and exercises that will serve as the building blocks toward eventually being able to engage in some handyman work again in the future. The future may seem like a long way away, but we need to get started soon in order to maximize the effects of our work. When we work together, I will be sure to explain how each thing that we are doing would build toward being able to complete handyman work one day.\"\nttwt | Mr. Johnson continues to listen but does not respond. His face reveals a blunted affect (an interpersonal characteristic). Therefore, Rigel has difficulty reading his expression.\nx5l2 | Rigel: \"Are you willing to try with me?\"\nilrs | Mr. Johnson: \"The doctor told me that recovery is mainly a function of time . . . that it is a waiting game.\"\n0a03 | Rigel (asks a rhetorical question consistent with the instructing mode): \"Did the doctor not explain how therapy can speed the process of recovery?\"\nauae | Mr. Johnson: \"No.\"\n5b6y | Rigel (instructing mode): \"The healing process of the human brain occurs both inside and outside of the body. The brain is not a static organ. It changes and can heal itself, to some degree, depending on whether and how much we exercise it. What a person does while he is healing and how he interacts with the people and objects within his environment can make a big difference-not only in the speed with which he recovers function but also in the extent to which he recovers function.\"\n1y10 | Mr. Johnson: \"OK. I'm tired now.\"\n6mnx | Rigel (instructing mode): \"Yes, and we are out of time. I look forward to continuing our work tomorrow.\"\ntynp | Explaining the Therapeutic Relationship: Need for a Conceptual Practice Model\nob0u | As noted in Chapter one, there has been discussion of the therapeutic use of self throughout occupational therapy's history. Although numerous recommendations have been made regarding the requisite training, characteristics, feelings, and behaviors necessary for effective interpersonal practice in occupational therapy, until the IRM, these recommendations had not been integrated into a coherent explanation. Moreover, there are few details about how the therapeutic relationship should be approached and managed in light of the field's central focus on the client's engagement in occupation. Educators, supervisors, students, and staff may benefit from a vocabulary with which to discuss and describe the interpersonal phenomena that have an ongoing impact on everyday practice.\n50o1 | The central question that a conceptualization of the therapeutic relationship in occupational therapy must answer is: How can one's therapeutic use of self be utilized specifically to promote occupational engagement and promote positive therapy outcomes?\ncw76 | The IRM is intended as a conceptual practice model. It was developed to explain the therapeutic use of self in occupational therapy and how that relationship can facilitate or hinder a client's occupational engagement. The model is designed to guide interpersonal reasoning for addressing dilemmas and challenges to the therapeutic relationship that arise in everyday practice. Finally, the model illustrates how best to develop\nlkk5 | Interpersonal Relating\nmolj | relationships that embrace the fundamental values and ethics of occupational therapy practice.\n5pto | Conceptual Background for the Model: How Therapeutic Use of Self in Occupational Therapy Differs From Psychotherapy\nmo6k | Many of the concepts for the IRM have their origins in theory underlying psychotherapy. However, as introduced in Chapter one, the IRM recognizes a fundamental difference between occupational therapy and psychotherapy. Figure three point one portrays the traditional psychotherapy process. As it shows, interpersonal relating between client and therapist is the central focus. Moreover, interpersonal communication is typically the only activity that occurs during psychotherapy.\nzh6q | In occupational therapy, particularly when conducted outside of mental health settings, the client-therapist relationship should not pretend to emulate the intensity, duration, and complexity of a psychotherapy relationship. The central focus of psychotherapy is symptom reduction and psychological change. The central focus of occupational therapy is occupational engagement. The unique role that the therapeutic relationship plays in occupational therapy is diagrammed in Figure three point two.\nkp04 | As shown, the occupational therapist employs several therapeutic strategies, usually rooted in existing models of practice, to facilitate the client's engagement in occupation. Depending on the occupational needs, capacities, and diagnosis of the client, any number of occupational therapy practice models might be employed alone or in combination to promote occupational engagement. However, this main task of promoting occupational engagement through employing the specific methods and strategies of occupational therapy does not exist in isolation of a larger process of relating that occurs between client and therapist.\n3e8r | The IRM explains the relationship between client and therapist that is part of the overall process of occupational therapy. Accordingly, the model is intended to complement existing occupational therapy conceptual practice models rather than to replace any single model. It explains the detailed and overarching aspects of the client-therapist relationship, an aspect of occupational therapy not addressed by other practice models in as much detail or as the sole focus. Figure three point three shows how the intentional relationship is designed to supplement the use of other occupational therapy conceptual practice models. As shown, the IRM should complement the usual concepts and strategies of occupational therapy that are directly aimed at facilitating occupational engagement.\n8g7g | The model's utility for occupational therapy lies in addressing the otherwise unarticulated aspects of the\n5j4f | Existing Occupational Therapy Models (e.g., Biomechanical, Cognitive Disabilities, Model of Human Occupation,",
