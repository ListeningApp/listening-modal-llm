The step size can therefore become small if norm pg norm is too large. To avoid this, we will make use of the fact that the gradient is bounded. In particular, by combining the right inequality of twenty and twenty-two, we obtain\nk5st | min one and zero norm PFIl less than or equal to norm gkIl less than or equal to Ex squared,\nd8e8 | which implies\ngb7b | ϵ ok min one and zero three over two\njxu0 | k two times one minus p Lg\nl1bb | Imposing this on the step size lower bound thirty gives\ni3e0 | Qk greater than or equal to min one and zero min\n78dj | The decrease is therefore given by\nc1pj | f(Xk plus one) minus f(Xk) less than or equal to pmin\n6v9y | two one, ak min one, two eight two ϵ\ndeen | less than or equal to negative pmin\n27bo | less than or equal to negative pmin, min of one and zero min two times one minus p Lg one three over two O k k one min. twenty percent\n72k6 | Inexact Newton-type Methods for Optimization with Nonnegativity Constraints\nemhp | The next three lemmas (Lemmas C point four to C point six) demonstrate the sufficient decrease of Type two steps. Recall that a Type two steps occurs once active set optimality is reached. Type two steps are taken until the inactive set optimality seven C is satisfied termination or a new index falls into the active set and disrupts active set optimality, in which case we resume Type one steps. The Type two step consists of only a Newton-MR step in the inactive indices no step is taken in the active indices. Indeed, a Type two direction can be written with possible reordering of indices as\ntcgw | x sub k left paren alpha right paren minus x sub k equals left paren zero semicolon script P left paren x sub k superscript script I plus alpha p sub k superscript script I right paren minus x sub k superscript script I right paren. Eliminating the active portion of the step allows us to leverage a second-order analysis of the inactive indices without having to account for the curvature of the projected gradient portion of the step. Indeed, the analysis of the algorithm reverts to essentially that of unconstrained Newton-MR, with some minor modifications to account for the projection. Specifically, with possible reordering of the indices, we partition the Hessian into four blocks as\n4d8s | H sub k equals left paren H sub k superscript script A semicolon H sub k superscript O semicolon H sub k superscript O semicolon H sub k superscript script I right paren, where H sub k superscript script A and H sub k superscript script I are the submatrices corresponding to the active and inactive indices respectively and H sub k superscript O is the remaining off-diagonal blocks of the Hessian. Under the Lipschitz Hessian condition Assumption three point five and using alpha less than or equal to delta sub k over norm p sub k superscript script I norm so that script P left paren x sub k superscript script I plus alpha p sub k superscript script I right paren equals x sub k superscript script I plus alpha p sub k superscript script I, we can write\n1cmq | f left paren x sub k left paren alpha right paren right paren less than or equal to f left paren x sub k right paren plus inner product of left paren g sub k superscript script A semicolon g sub k superscript script I right paren, left paren zero semicolon alpha p sub k superscript script I right paren plus one half inner product of left paren zero semicolon c semicolon H sub k superscript script I right paren, left paren H sub k superscript script A semicolon H sub k superscript O semicolon H sub k superscript script I semicolon H sub k superscript script I right paren left paren zero semicolon alpha p sub k superscript script I right paren plus alpha cubed L sub H over six norm left paren zero semicolon p sub k superscript script I right paren norm cubed\nu8s6 | equals f left paren x sub k right paren plus alpha inner product of g sub k superscript script I, p sub k superscript script I plus alpha squared over two inner product of p sub k superscript script I, H sub k superscript script I p sub k superscript script I plus alpha cubed L sub H over six norm p sub k superscript script I norm cubed. thirty-seven\n```",
