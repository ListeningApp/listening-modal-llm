You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

3g9w | Consideration of the context for the research also differs sub- stantively across the efficacy-effectiveness-implementation spectrum. Efficacy trials value conducting a trial that is invariant from beginning to end. This entails sometimes extraordinary efforts at training clin- icians and tracking subjects, so that the research team's efforts amount at times to "crypto-case management" (i.e., aggressive subject engage- ment and follow-up outreach) to ensure close follow-up and minimal data loss-which is not a problem since the focus of the trial is solely on testing the intervention under optimal conditions. However, since ef- fectiveness studies are more concerned with performance of an effica- cious intervention in real-world settings, careful attention is paid to limiting the amount of research-funded effort that is incorporated into the protocol, often "firewalling" research effort with carefully and ex- plicitly defined parameters (Bauer et al., 2001). Further, for im- plementation trials, trying to optimize the natural context in which uptake is being measured is a threat to validity of the trial. Thus, re- searcher involvement at the sites is drastically circumscribed, with

a3td | a See Section 4.1 for details.
ex5k | some implementation trials even limiting research support to training endogenous clinicians and utilizing remote, "light-touch" outcome as- sessments for patient and provider subjects (see also Smith, this issue).
9d4o | These differences across the efficacy-effectiveness-implementation spectrum are reflected in radically different priorities regarding trial validity (Loudeon et al., 2015). As noted above (Section 2), in efficacy studies internal validity prioritizes establishing a causal connection between the intervention and the outcome; in the service of this aim, the sample, outcome measurements, and intervention are all highly controlled without consideration of applicability beyond the specific trial itself. In effectiveness studies, external validity prioritizes the generalizability of trial results to other relevant populations and si- tuations; accordingly, although the effectiveness trial must have suffi- cient internal validity to carry out the study successfully, explicit design decisions are made that value generalizability beyond the trial itself. Finally, implementation trials, in contrast to both types of clinical trials, aim at arriving at the optimal implementation strategy, and maximal innovation impact, by the end of the study. Note, however, that in subtle ways such "mid-course corrections" are the case for all types of trials, including especially efficacy trials, in which intervention fidelity data are assiduously collected throughout the study and adjustments in training and even personnel are made to ensure internal validity. The difference between clinical trials and implementation trials is that in the latter such modifications are planned for a priori and are often the focus of specific study hypotheses, under the rubric of "formative evaluation" (Stetler et al., 2006; see also Elwy, this issue).
cjq2 | Thus, in overly simplistic terms, the clinical researcher establishes the efficacy and then effectiveness of an innovation, and then hands it off to the implementation scientist to test ways of getting people to use it. This process as stated is overly simplistic because it suggests a uni- dimensional flow of tasks (like our pipeline in Fig. 1). In reality the process is much more iterative as implementation experience may suggest changes in the clinical innovation to increase its external

m5ka | validity (while also taking steps to ensure fidelity to its core compo- nents, supporting internal validity).
byu8 | 4.2. Implementation science versus quality improvement and dissemination research
76b0 | Implementation science also differs from quality improvement, which usually begins with a specific problem rather than a practice to promulgate. It typically focuses on an individual clinic, hospital, or system, and tends not to seek to contribute generalizable knowledge (Johnson and Sollecito, 2018). It also differs from traditional dis- semination research, which usually focuses on spread of information using communication and education strategies (Dearing et al., 2018). However, the purpose and methods of these three fields often overlap, as you will see in the articles that follow in this issue.
zxz6 | 4.3. The scope of implementation science
xnth | Thus, not surprisingly, implementation science involves investiga- tion at more levels than just the individual patient/subject. Targets of investigation may also include the provider, clinic, facility, organiza- tion, community, and even the policy environment (Damschroder et al., 2009; Harvey and Kitson, 2016).
vafm | Thus, also not surprisingly given the central role of context in im- plementation science, implementation researchers include not just clinicians and clinical scientists but also social scientists, economists, systems engineers and health services researchers. Additionally, special mention should be made of the relationship between implementation researchers and their "operational partners" with whom a clinical in- novation is to be deployed: healthcare system leaders, administrators, and staff who run and staff the clinics, facilities, and organizations (and sometimes also including policymakers). Unlike clinical research, in which such individuals and structures play a primarily permissive or
2zmw | M.S. Bauer and J. Kirchner
bf9k | passively supportive role, in implementation research operational col- leagues need to be full partners in the research from study design through analysis, since implementation research aims to assess and actively intervene in their structures, where they are the experts. While there are cultural gaps between researchers and healthcare system leaders and staff that must be overcome (Kilbourne et al., 2012; Bauer et al., 2016), their participation is essential since an innovation will be implemented because of them, not in spite of them.
otkr | 4.4. Summary
ibgs | In summary, implementation science seeks to "continue the job" of biomedical research, taking evidence-based clinical innovations and testing strategies to move them into wider practice. Given this goal, the principles and methods of implementation science differ somewhat from clinical research. Most centrally, implementation science proto- cols do not ignore or control for context, but rather actively seek to intervene to change the context in which clinical innovations are used in order to enhance their uptake. Importantly, implementation scien- tists interface closely with healthcare leaders and staff as partners, breaking down the research-practice divide in order to achieve the ul- timate goal of increasing the public health impact of evidence-based innovations.
colo | A number of exciting challenges face the rapidly developing field of implementation science. First and foremost, further integration of im- plementation science methodologies into clinical trial designs will speed the development of evidence-based interventions that have de- monstrable public health impact.
d6r4 | In addition, development of efficient methodologies for data col- lection with minimal disruption to the processes under study will be important in order to minimize the Hawthorne effect in both descriptive studies and controlled trials. Testing and validating the theories that underlie implementation efforts is needed to enhance the development of next-generation analytic methods and interventions. Finally, the development of an investigator workforce with diverse and com- plementary skills, and provision of sustainable academic careers for them, remains a central challenge to the field (see Chambers, this issue).
9mrz | 5. Conclusion: overview of this special issue
pk06 | This Special Issue is designed to serve as an introduction to the principles, concepts, and methods of implementation science. The ar- ticles have been written particularly for clinical scientists interested in how to increase the public health impact of their work.
7wn9 | The Special issue provides articles on topics in two general areas, the first is those that are foundational to implementation science such as the conceptual background and specific methodologies that are core to this field of study. The second area are a set of articless that address special and emerging topics within implementation science including an expansion of case study analysis through a matrix process, the ap- plication of implementation science in gloabal settings and capacity- building and training opportunities. Each of the manuscripts includes a review of underlying principles, introduction to relevant methods, and an example from a real-world, funded study that illustrates and am- plifies the principles and methods discussed:
