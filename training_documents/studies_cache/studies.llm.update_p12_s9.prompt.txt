You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

z8tt | A number of the methods highlighted in our review, such as network analysis and agent-based modeling, are particularly well suited to explore relationality in SES (Preiser et al. 2018). Both network analysis and agent-based modeling are used extensively in SES research (Fig. 7), and offer integrative frameworks that capture relations and connectivity, can help to develop rich pictures, and deal with heterogeneity and redundancy (Janssen et al. 2006, Bodin and Crona 2009, An 2012, Filatova et al. 2013). Agent-based modeling and network analysis are process- orientated models that rely on decentralized control and automata to detect and create emergent patterns, and so do well to account for the adaptive and self-generating organizational capacities of CAS.
9g22 | Generally, the methods used in SES research have been sensitive to the context-dependency of SES challenges, probably helped by the notion that SES research has emerged from place-based local- scale studies (Colding and Barthel 2019). Many methods used in anticipatory future studies are adept at adapting frameworks to context, and specifically focus on anticipating adaptation and change (Berkhout et al. 2002, Carpenter et al. 2006, Shaw et al. 2009, Sheppard et al. 2011). These methods, and other participatory research methods that gather multiple evidence- based knowledge (Tengö et al. 2014) can help with observer- dependent framing (Shirk et al. 2012)
41fx | Although there are a reasonable number of methods that can account for the dynamic interactions that constitute complex systems and their relations with the environment, it may be difficult to find the necessary data to conduct analyses over sufficient time spans. Nevertheless, in fields such as system and dynamic modeling, there is a notable tradition of developing models that incorporate feedback loops, i.e., account for slow and fast variables (e.g., Levin et al. 2013, Lade and Niiranen 2017), nonlinearity, and unpredictability. Lade and Niiranen (2017) have proposed generalized modeling to be a particularly promising tool in both participatory and research settings to develop process- based understanding of SES dynamics despite limited system knowledge, but acknowledge that there are challenges to overcome. Similarly, Levin et al. (2013) show how essential features of SES have been successfully introduced into optimal management models (particularly in grasslands and coral reefs) and highlight strategies, like modeling fast and slow variables separately where possible, that can improve the suitability of dynamic models to the realities of SES as CAS.
7um8 | There is mixed evidence for how good current methods are at coping with the radical openness of SES. Although participatory research, which can help with observer-dependent framing (Shirk et al. 2012), is common, as are a host of other methods that gather multiple evidence-based knowledge (Tengo et al. 2014), few methods can truly account for unknown variables that could have important influences on model behavior. Stochastic modeling methods, and research conducted at multiple scales, however, offer promising avenues.
uow2 | Complex causality seems to be the organizing principle of CAS that methods struggle the most to address. To account for the nonlinearity of cause-and-effect trajectories and contend with emergence and the nature of wicked problems, we need methods that are able to collect large volumes of data, sense-making methods that can explore the implication of different trajectories, and methods that trace causality across scales. Although methods
iat7 | such as participatory narrative enquiry and dialogue workshops can help highlight nonlinear and cross-scale relationships, understanding how these relationships drive cause and effect or bring about emergent patterns of behavior is an exceedingly more complex and data-intensive task (Levin et al. 2013).
ywwr | CONCLUSION
0i6j | In this paper we review several dimensions of the growth of the SES research field, most notably describing it by the methods used in empirical SES research. Methodological pluralism remains one of the biggest challenges in conducting SES research. Our categorized list provides a manageable overview of common methods used in SES research that can serve as a guide to new researchers entering the field, and a first step to more methodological transparency. Our list also offers an opportunity for this field to assess its development into the future, particularly in terms of methodological integration. Assessing methods through the lens of SES as CAS offers a first, if limited, perspective on the alignment between the theory and philosophy that underpins SES research and methods used in the field. More empirical assessments are needed on the suitability of different methods for understanding different elements of CAS in SES research, and it would be interesting to see research on the development of new methods to fill identified gaps. Last, this paper focuses on methods used in SES, but the way in which research is combined in different contexts is perhaps what makes the field most interesting. We hope that future researchers will build on our work to investigate the way in which methods are combined in practice, for different purposes, and on the ethical and ontological contexts that shape our questions and approaches.
