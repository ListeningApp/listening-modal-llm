EIS Spectra for Electrodes with REF-Br Membranes Deposited on Silver or Nonsilver Substrate. The influence of the Ag phase was inspected by electrochemical impedance.\ny5r7 | A striking difference in the impedance spectra for electrodes with reference membranes deposited on Ag substrate or nonsilver substrate was observed. Namely, the difference is manifested by a disappearance of a low-frequency branch for the membranes deposited on Ag substrate which is present if the substrate is a nonsilver one. The EIS results indicate a slower electrochemical process rate in the membrane without dispersed Ag. The appearance of Warburg type behavior at lower frequencies can be attributed to a slower ion-transport in the membrane. It can be hypothesized that dispersed silver facilitates the overall electrochemical process.\nlrry | The EIS spectra illustrating this effect, recorded for electrodes with REF-Br-photo membranes deposited on a bare GC substrate and for the GC substrate covered with Ag are presented in Figure S-2.\nhvhm | Five. Mechanism of the Br-REF Response. Undoubtedly, the fact that the metallic silver, both as the layer on the substrate and in the form of dispersed nanosilver in the membrane, significantly contribute to stabilizing the potential of the REF-Br systems is of general importance to solid contact\n863b | ion-sensor technology with heterogeneous membranes. The composite-like heterogeneous membrane serves as the reservoir of Ag, AgBr, KBr, and respective silver bromide complexes. The coexistence of these three solid phases coupled through the contact with the respective ions (silver, potassium bromoargentate, and bromide ions) saturating pores and slow electrolyte outflow from the membrane is the prerequisite of the stability observed. Interestingly, the mean standard potential of the REF-Br electrodes (negative one hundred fifty-seven millivolts versus silver chloride with three molar potassium chloride, E naught equals positive two hundred ten millivolts versus normal hydrogen electrode) indicates that the composite reference electrode works as the analogue of the silver bromide reference electrode immersed in the heterogeneous membrane, which plays the role of a stable electrolyte bridge. The bridge provides a stable electrochemical matrix, in respect to the coexistence of the phases, ion concentrations, single ion diffusion, and activity coefficients. Generalized mathematical interpretation which reduces potential stability of the REF-Br electrodes to the fundamental Gibbs' Phase Rule and E naught set by silver plus and silver redox pair will be provided by the authors in a separate paper.\nfj24 | From the technical perspective, though, the system in focus is sufficiently attractive to be of choice in different analytical applications as shown below.\nuz3c | Six. Calibration of the REF-Br Electrodes in potassium bromide and MX Solutions. A crucial question regarding the conceptual and analytical validity of the REF-Br is their insensitivity toward bromides. Figure three shows the potential changes of the five\nd5bi | electrodes with REF-Br-photo membranes as well as Br-ISE recorded during calibration with potassium bromide solution. A striking difference provides direct proof of the invention reported.\nba4l | Negligible potential changes were observed for electrodes with REF-Br-nano, REF-Br-QB, and REF-Br-photo reference membranes during up-down-up as well as down-up-down calibrations in potassium chloride solutions with concentration ranging from one molar up to one times ten to the minus five molar. As an example, the potential values measured during up-down-up calibration are presented in Table S-3. Similar results were also obtained during calibration in lithium chloride, sodium chloride, potassium bromide, potassium nitrate, and calcium chloride solutions. The influence of lipophilic ions was also checked using the representative perchlorate ion. No statistically significant effect was observed between the calibrations performed in chloride and perchlorate salts.\nffx8 | Seven. Redox Sensitivity of the Electrodes with REF-Br Membranes. The presence of elemental silver can induce undesirable redox sensitivity of the REF-Br membranes. Therefore, all the membranes were studied in the calibration using the mixture of potassium hexacyanoferrate three and potassium hexacyanoferrate with total concentration zero point zero one molar but different molar ratios. Before and after redox calibration, additional measurements in two molar potassium bromide were performed to check the potential stability. The redox insensitivity was proved for all the REF-Br membranes and different substrates. The redox effect was not observed as well in the solutions saturated with oxygen, carbon dioxide, and argon.\ns6su | Eight. Potential Stability of the REF-Br Electrodes during Prolonged Contact with Deionized Water. For every reference electrode, the test of its behavior in water is most challenging and analytically relevant. For this reason, all the electrodes equipped with REF-Br-nano, REF-Br-QB, or REF- Br-photo reference membranes were tested in deionized water. After a due period of soaking, the potential of the REF-Br electrodes was measured for ten minutes versus the commercial silver chloride reference electrode (Metrohm). A very good potential stability was observed, and the potentials measured were practically invariant at least for several hours of contact with water (or even up to a few days for some of the electrodes).\ny219 | Nine. Multisolution Calibration Experiment. To judge the performance of the reference electrodes in real analysis, a multisolution calibration was carried out following the protocol shown by Mousavi. The potential of the electrodes with REF-Br-nano, REF-Br-QB, and REF-Br-photo reference membranes was measured in several solutions to check the influence of ion concentration, P H and ion mobility. The potential in each solution was recorded for ten minutes. After each test, the electrodes were rinsed with deionized water and immersed in the subsequent solution. The exemplary results obtained for electrodes with REF-Br-photo reference membranes deposited on Ag substrates and the potential values measured at the end of each ten minute period are shown in Figures four and S-6 and collected in Table S-6.\n06ht | Ten. Influence of P H: Potential Stability of the Electrodes with REF-Br Reference Membranes during Acid-Base Titration. To check the P H influence on the potential of the reference electrodes, the REF-Br-photo reference membranes and P H-ISE were employed in the titration of one milliliter of zero point one molar NaOH with zero point one molar HCl, Figure five. As required, both reference membranes are insensitive to P H changes in the course of the titration performed.\nv3r2 | Eleven. Performance of the Microcell with REF-Br Reference and Potassium-Ion Selective Electrodes. In this measurement, a homemade multielectrode platform with a body made of epoxy resin was used. The platform contained five gold wire electrodes (gold ninety-nine point nine nine obtained from Johnson Matthey Company) with a diameter of zero point eight millimeters. The external diameter of the epoxy body was eight millimeters. All the gold discs were electrochemically covered with silver, and the REF-Br-photo membranes and potassium-selective membranes were deposited by solution cast on selected discs. Negligible potential changes were recorded for both electrodes with REF-Br-photo membranes used and close to theoretical potential changes were recorded for potassium ion-selective electrode. These results indicate that employing the reference electrodes described here for designing a complete multielectrode microcell is feasible. Moreover, the junctionless REF-Br reference electrode is used in two roles as the external reference electrode and the internal solid-contact of the ion-selective electrode. Interestingly, a similar dual role has been reported by the authors before. However, in that case, the same conducting polymer film was employed either as the solid contact or as the electroactive membrane of an ion-selective electrode.\nnv42 | CONCLUSIONS\n```",
