You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures

History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

li1k | Integrins
pbea | Integrin activation in response to stable flow inactivates RHO GTPases through RHO-like GTPase signalling99. RHOA inactivation promotes YAP phosphorylation (at Ser127 and Ser381) in the cytoplasm to maintain an atheroprotective endothelial cell phenotype100. These interactions between integrins and RHO GTPases further activate RAC, leading to the assembly of the junctional mechanosensory complexes101. Addition- ally, the RHO GTPase CDC42 is polarized and activated in an integrin- dependent manner and subsequently regulates the polarity of the microtubule-organizing centre102,103. Under disturbed flow conditions, the cooperation between RGD-binding integrins (including &5ß1andavß3 integrins) and fibronectin has been shown to drive pro-inflammatory signal transduction involving the nuclear translocation of NF-KB, YAP and serine/threonine-protein kinase PAK 104-107.
ccpt | Flow-sensitive transcription factors
0fpw | Thus far, we have discussed mechanosignal transduction pathways occurring in an early-to-intermediate timescale, mediated by spe- cific mechanosensors in response to flow in endothelial cells. These relatively acute responses lead to the regulation of downstream, long-term responses, including activation of transcription factors and
dqn8 | transcriptional co-activators, such as KLF2 and KLF4, NF-KB, hypoxia- inducible factor 1x (HIF1x), YAP, TAZ and SOX13, which regulate gene expression profiles and cell function73. KLF2 and KLF4 are two of the most flow-sensitive master transcription factors regulating the expression of genes that control anti-atherogenic pathways induced by stable flow, including vasodilatation and antithrombotic and anti-inflammatory pathways108-112. KLF2 reduces the expression of pro-atherogenic genes by competing with NF-KB for transcriptional cofactor CBP-p300 and by promoting the translocation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (refs. 113-115). Stable flow increases KLF2 transcription by sequentially activating the members of the MAP kinase family MEKK3, MEK5 and ERK5, which in turn activates the transcription factors MEF2A and MEF2C116. By contrast, disturbed flow inactivates the ERK5 path- way, leading to the inhibition of KLF2 expression116. In addition, KLF2 expression is suppressed by the flow-regulated microRNA (miRNA), miR-92a
cop0 | NF-KB is a well-recognized transcription factor that is activated by flow. Nuclear translocation and activation of NF-KB in endothelial cells is increased transiently by stable flow and persistently by disturbed flow94,124. NF-KB target genes include those encoding VCAM1, ICAM1, E-selectin, HIF1x and numerous cytokines, all of which have a crucial role in atherosclerosis94,125,126. HIF1x is a pro-atherogenic transcription factor that is activated by disturbed flow127-129. HIF1x induces the expres- sion of glycolytic enzymes such as HK2, PFKFB3 and PDK1 (ref. 130). YAP and TAZ - which are transcriptional co-activators induced by the Hippo signalling pathway and are involved in organ growth and development as well as various diseases such as cancer and atherosclerosis - are also regulated by both stable and disturbed flow131-133. Disturbed flow induces YAP and TAZ nuclear translocation and activation, leading to endothelial cell inflammation and cytoskeletal remodelling and atherosclerosis131. A study published in 2022 identified SOX13 as a novel flow-sensitive transcription factor. Disturbed flow represses the expression of SOX13, which in turn leads to a strong induction of pro- inflammatory cytokine and chemokine production, including CCL5 and CXCL10, resulting in endothelial inflammation134.
lhkq | Omics approaches to study endothelial cells
82ju | Omics-based analyses have become standard approaches to determine changes in endothelial cells in response to various flow and disease conditions. Unlike traditional reductionist approaches studying one or a few candidate genes or proteins at a time, the astonishing advances in omics technologies and computational bioinformatics have made it possible to determine changes in genes, proteins and metabolites at a genome-wide, epigenome-wide, proteome-wide and metabolome-wide scale, often at a single-cell resolution, and using a small amount of sample. The application of these approaches using in vitro and in vivo models has generated a plethora of datasets of flow- dependent transcriptomic, epigenomic, proteomic and metabolomic profiles in endothelial cells and blood vessels under healthy and disease conditions15,135-140
y2qo | Early transcriptomic studies used bulk RNA and miRNA samples from pooled cultured endothelial cells and animal tissues to conduct microarray and RNA sequencing analyses. These studies identified numerous unexpected flow-sensitive genes, miRNAs and long non- coding RNAs (lncRNAs), generating wide-ranging novel hypotheses regarding their various roles in endothelial cell function and athero- sclerosis14,17,73. Numerous flow-sensitive genes (including BMP4, DNMT1, KDM4B, KLF2, KLK10, PLPP3, SEMA7A, THBS1, TMX1 and ZBTB46), miRNAs (including miR-95a and miR-712) and lncRNAs (including
1piq | Review article
7fqw | MALAT1 and MANTIS) were identified from these bulk-RNA studies and subsequently validated, as reviewed elsewhere14,17,73,141,142. The roles of flow-sensitive miRNAs and IncRNAs in endothelial function have been reviewed previously143,144. KLK10 (which encodes kallikrein-related peptidase 10) has been identified as one of the most flow-sensitive genes from a gene-array study using the mouse PCL model135. KLK10 expression is increased by stable flow, but nearly lost in response to disturbed flow in endothelial cells in vitro, mouse arteries in vivo and human coronary arteries with advanced atherosclerotic plaques143. After the KLK10 protein is produced, it is secreted into the circulat- ing blood (or the conditioned medium in in vitro assays) and func- tions as an anti-inflammatory and permeability-barrier-protective protein143. Interestingly, KLK10, which is a member of the KLK serine/ threonine protein kinase family, lacks inherent protease activity, and its anti-inflammatory and permeability-barrier-protective functions are mediated by protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1)-dependent and PAR2-dependent pathways143. Administration of recombinant KLK10 via tail vein injection or ultrasound-guided delivery of a KLK10 expression vector to the carotid endothelium prevented endothelial inflammation and atherosclerosis development in mice143,144, demonstrating the proof of principle that flow-sensitive proteins such as KLK10 could be used as novel anti-atherogenic therapeutics.
rhaz | Flow induces epigenome-wide changes in endothelial cells, as revealed by a DNA methylome study that used reduced representation bisulfite sequencing of mouse genomic bulk DNA samples combined with microarray analysis of bulk RNA samples of mouse carotid arteries after PCL surgery136. This DNA methylome study, together with other studies, showed that disturbed flow regulates DNA methylation pat- terns in endothelial cells via the DNA methyltransferases DNMT1 and DNMT3 (refs. 136,145,146). Further studies showed that genetic dele- tion or pharmacological inhibition of DNMT1 prevented endothelial inflammation and atherosclerosis development in Apoe /- mice145, demonstrating that flow-sensitive epigenomic modifications could be anti-atherogenic therapeutic targets.
