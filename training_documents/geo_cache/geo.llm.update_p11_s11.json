        "content": "hy0l | where HHV H2 greater than WV CH4, PH at STP, and PCHA at STP denote the higher heating value of hydrogen (three point five four kilowatt-hours per cubic meter), the working gas volume of natural gas in the storage system at standard temperature and pressure, and the density of hydrogen and methane at standard temperature and pressure, respectively. PH2 at res and PCHA at res refer to the hydrogen and methane density at pressure and temperature when the reservoir is full (P max). However, estimates on the operating gas pressure P min / max are not publicly available and we, therefore, estimate the maximum gas operation pressure to be seventy percent of the overburden pressure. In equation three, the product of the density ratio is utilized for the conversion of reported methane working gas volumes at standard temperature and pressure to hydrogen gas volumes at standard temperature and pressure. However, our data suggest that a constant conversion parameter of zero point eight five can be used over a range of temperatures and pressures relevant to underground gas storage, as shown in Table two. The results are summarized in Table two and Figure three. At present, there are sixteen underground pore storage facilities installed in Germany that have total installed capacity of around eight billion cubic meters of natural gas with a thermal energy content of ninety-five point two four four terawatt-hours, estimated using a higher heating value of eleven point zero seven kilowatt-hours per cubic meter for methane. This represents about one-third of the total underground storage capacity of natural gas in Germany. The remaining natural gas is stored in two hundred seventy-two salt caverns. In contrast, the corresponding hydrogen storage capacity is lower, amounting to around seven billion cubic meters of hydrogen gas with a thermal energy content of twenty-five terawatt-hours, given its lower energy content per volume (three point five four kilowatt-hours per cubic meter). The distribution of these pore storages is shown in Figure three. Hence, more volume is needed to store the same amount of energy compared to natural gas and other common fuels. Furthermore, decommissioned pore storage facilities could potentially provide an additional storage potential of one billion cubic meter of hydrogen or four terawatt-hours of hydrogen energy equivalent. Hence a total of eight billion cubic meters of hydrogen, which amounts to twenty-nine terawatt-hours of hydrogen energy equivalent could be stored in current and former underground gas storage pore storage systems. Figure three shows the distribution of all pore storage (active and inactive) and compares it to the planned network expansion initiative.\n4jmz | Four point two Theoretical hydrogen storage capacity in saline aquifers\nb7cq | Additional underground storage capacities may become available in saline aquifers that hold the highest storage potential due to their widespread occurrence. In order to assess the hydrogen storage capacity in saline aquifers, we employ the volumetric assessment of CO2 storage capacities in saline aquifers, as previously conducted by Knopf and May. This probabilistic approach yields a proven, median, and\n0b39 | possible CO2 storage capacity of twenty point four gigatonnes (P ten), forty-nine point one gigatonnes (P fifty), and one hundred fifteen point three gigatonnes (P ninety) for all evaluated rock units (onshore and offshore; green shaded areas in Figure three), respectively. Most of these resources are located in the North German Basin with estimated CO2 storage capacities ranging from nineteen point three gigatonnes (P ten) to one hundred eight point six gigatonnes (P ninety). By applying this data, we can estimate the thermal hydrogen energy content using\nqecd | E H2 equals M CO2 times HHV H2 times RG times P CO2 divided by P H2\n1o7p | equation four\ncp13 | where E H2 is the energy content of hydrogen (in petawatt-hours), M CO2 is the mass of stored CO2 (in gigatonnes), HHV H2 is the higher heating value of hydrogen (thirty-nine point four kilowatt-hours per kilogram), RG is the recoverable working gas volume (i.e., portion of the working gas volume: zero point four to zero point six), and the ratio P H2 is used to convert the mass of stored CO2 to the mass P CO2 of stored hydrogen. Knopf and May set an upper vertical limit of eight hundred meters in their analysis, at which\nbgre | CO2 is typically subjected to temperatures and pressures that preserve CO2 in a supercritical state. At these conditions the resulting CO2 densities are two orders of magnitude greater compared to gaseous H2. The CO2 storage capacity can therefore be converted to the mass of stored hydrogen, M H2 (in gigatonnes), based on a conversion factor of zero point zero one (i.e., P CO2 P H2 equals zero point zero one). Hence, saline aquifers may yield an additional capacity of eighty-one point six megatonnes to six hundred ninety-one point eight megatonnes working gas volume of hydrogen resulting in three point two to twenty-seven point three petawatt-hours of hydrogen energy equivalent, but almost all of these storage capacities are restricted to the North German Basin, which may hold three point zero to twenty-five point seven petawatt-hours of hydrogen energy equivalent. Nevertheless, one should keep in mind that these estimates represent theoretical capacities, and the extent to which these reserves can actually be used should be verified based on the storage criteria proposed here, but will also depend on technical, economic, environmental, and social aspects and requires further analysis.\n57lp | Five Discussion\nukth | Five point one Storage capacities and requirements in Europe\nkpvt | Existing and decommissioned underground pore storage facilities may account for up to thirty terawatt-hours of energy equivalent of hydrogen, but are unlikely to meet future storage requirements of thirty-four to six hundred sixty-seven terawatt-hours, not least because an overall conversion of all storage facilities from natural gas to hydrogen is unlikely. To meet these future storage requirements, additional capacities may be needed in the form of depleted hydrocarbon fields and saline aquifers. Approximately three point two to twenty-seven point three petawatt-hours of hydrogen energy equivalent could be stored in saline aquifers in Germany, which is comparable to the technical storage potential in salt caverns that has been estimated at thirty-five point seven petawatt-hours and similar to the hydrogen storage potential in saline aquifers in the UK with an estimated capacity of two point one petawatt-hours of energy equivalent of hydrogen. In practice, many of the storage sites may, however, prove unsuitable, given the technical, economic and social constraints or not least because of the increasing competition between different geotechnical applications, be it geothermal energy or storage of natural gas, CO2, or hydrogen.",
