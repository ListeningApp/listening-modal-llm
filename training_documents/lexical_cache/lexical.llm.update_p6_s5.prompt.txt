You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use

zse6 | Over nearly 50 years, however, perceptual studies have elaborated but not fundamentally altered the early claims concerning the suprasegmental dimen- sions involved. Syllables are perceived to be stressed if they exhibit F0 excursion (Fry, 1958), whereby the timing of the F0 movement within the syllable can be crucial for determining stress perception (Thorsen, 1982, for Danish), and some types of F0 movement may require more excursion than others (Hermes & Rump, 1994, for Dutch F0 rise versus rise-fall). Greater syllable duration is likewise associated with perceived stress (Fry, 1955). These two factors are the most strongly related and the least controversial.
p2n3 | More controversial is the common finding that amplitude manipulations only weakly affect stress perception (despite psychoacoustic research showing that quite small changes in this dimension are indeed perceptible; Sorin, 1981). Turk and Sawusch (1996) found listeners' perception of duration and amplitude variation to be non-orthogonal; importantly, they observed effects of irrelevant durational variation on judgments of loudness to be greater than effects of ampli- tude variation on judgments of relative length. This, they argued, provided a rationale for why prominence judgments should be based on duration, or on duration and amplitude together, but not on the latter alone.
ohh7 | Beckman (1986) proposed that a measure of total amplitude (across a syllable) could capture effects on stress judgments, but as pointed out by Sluijter, van Heuven, and Pacilly (1997), such a measure is inevitably confounded with syllable duration. An indirect amplitude effect may however exist, in the factor which Sluijter and van Heuven (1996) termed spectral balance; stressed vowels have more energy in the higher frequency regions of the spectrum than unstressed vowels do. A linear discriminant analysis of their measurement data suggested that the most reliable correlate of the presence of stress was durational lengthen- ing, with this spectral balance effect next in importance; overall amplitude had the usual weak impact on the analysis. A perceptual study of the spectral balance effect by Sluijter et al. (1997) showed that manipulations of this factor had a moderate effect when speech was presented to listeners over headphones, but a greatly increased effect when the speech was presented via loudspeakers! Sluijter et al. concluded that spectral balance directly reflects articulatory effort, in rehabil- itation of the claim that perceived loudness is the most reliable cue to stress.

dgcw | Campbell and Beckman (1997), however, failed to replicate the acoustic effect in English; they found spectral differences as a function of focal accent, but not as a function of lexical stress in the absence of accentual variation; this would there- fore rule out analogous perceptual effects in English. On this issue, the last word may not yet be spoken.
gvwz | 11.2 Language-Specificity of Stress and Its Perceptual Consequences
sk5m | 11.2.1 Stress in phonological systems
qws8 | The empirical evidence summarized in Section 11.1 was taken exclusively from studies of West Germanic languages. The evidence is similar across languages because the stress systems of these closely related languages are, although not identical, quite similar (see Figure 11.2). However, Germanic languages do not serve as a yardstick for languages across the world. First, stress characterizes the word-level phonology of only a subset of the world's languages. Second, there is considerable variation in word stress patterning even within stress languages, most obviously in the contrast between freely varying (as in the Germanic lan- guages) and fixed-stress placement. Fixed-stress systems are considered in more detail below.
877u | Little acoustic and perceptual evidence exists for non-Germanic free-stress lan- guages. Measurements of segmentally matched stressed and unstressed syllables in Arabic by de Jong and Zawaydeh (1999) revealed duration and F0 correlates "remarkably like" the results reported for English (p. 20). In Spanish, stress is perceived if cued by F0 and duration or by F0 and amplitude, but not by any one cue alone (Llisterri et al., 2003); syllable weight and lexical analogy also affect stress perception (Face, 2000, 2003). Williams' (1985) experiments on synthesized Welsh minimal stress pairs found strong effects of duration on listeners' stress judgments, but inconsistent effects of F0. In Thai (a tone language), stress is signaled effectively by duration alone (Potisuk, Gandour, & Harper, 1996). It should be noted that some forms of English can also show other patterning than that described in Section 11.1. For instance, in Indian English (Bansal, 1966) and Welsh English (Williams, 1985) F0 movement can be decoupled from stress; in each case this can induce stress misperceptions by speakers of other varieties of English, who may for instance be led by F0 peaks or movements on unstressed syllables to judge those syllables as stressed.
rzhj | In general, stress realization (and its perceptual reflection) will be dependent on other features of a language's phonological system. As Potisuk et al. (1996) point out, F0 does not vary as a function of stress in Thai because of its preemption by the tone system. Shen (1993) also observed that prominence in Mandarin is signaled by means other than F0. And just as tone preempts F0, so quantity distinctions in the segmental system render durational variation less useful for other purposes such as signaling stress. Berinstein (1979) found that speakers of Mayan languages with fixed final stress could learn to use duration variation as a position-independent cue to stress judgment, producing similar performance to

f2y8 | speakers of English, but only if their language did not have vowel quantity distinctions - i.e., only if their language had not already preempted durational variation as a cue to something other than stress.
o7qm | 11.2.2 Culminative vs. demarcative functions of stress
d52l | Lexical stress variation has the word as its domain. In each word, only one syllable bears primary stress (although a few languages may not conform to this general- ization; see Hyman, 1977, for further discussion). Thus stress is sometimes termed culminative within the word.
qlbb | The single primary stress constraint does not rule out further distinctions among syllables which do not bear primary stress. Phonological accounts of the metrical structure of stress languages can encompass fine-grained distinctions of promin- ence within utterances (see Van der Hulst, 1999, for descriptions of the metrical structure of a range of European languages). Thus in English PRESident, primary
nhsg | 272 Anne Cutler
hy0l | stress falls on the initial syllable, whereas it falls on the third syllable in presiDENtial. But the remaining three syllables of presiDENtial are not all un- stressed; the first syllable is said to bear secondary stress. The vowel in the initial syllable is not reduced, whereas those in the second and final syllables are likely to be; however, the possibility of vowel reduction is not a prerequisite for a contrast between secondary and lesser stress (consider Spanish presidente, which exhibits the same relative salience across its four syllables as English presidential, although Spanish has no vowel reduction). It is an empirical issue whether dis- tinguishing between syllables with primary versus secondary stress (for example, in presi- from English president versus presidential) is perceptually necessary; this will be considered further in section 11.3 below.
