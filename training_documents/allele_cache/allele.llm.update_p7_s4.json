        "content": "rl4j | To study in detail why ADASTRA failed to capture ASBs found in other studies, we used the set of ASB SNPs identified by one of the most advanced methods for ASB calling, BaalChIP. ASB event could be missed at the SNP calling stage, could fail to pass the read coverage thresholds, or fail to pass the significance threshold for false discovery rate-corrected P value estimated against BAD. To assess the contribution of different stages of our pipeline to ASB calling sensitivity, we performed a stage-by-stage analysis of the underlying SNP set (see Fig. three D). It turned out that the fraction of BaalChIP ASB SNPs recovered by ADASTRA was different for different cell types, with most of ASBs recovered for the cell types with the deepest sequencing coverage.\nvz32 | On the one hand, the basic coverage filters significantly reduced the number of SNPs under consideration resulting in a major loss in the fraction of recovered ASBs. On the other hand, we did not observe critical effects from any of the subsequent stages. For all cell types, the number of BaalChIP ASB SNPs recovered by ADASTRA decreased monotonously, suggesting that there was no particular bottleneck defining the sensitivity of the whole pipeline except the basic coverage filters. As more sites were recovered for cell types with better coverage, one can predict that the difference between different ASB calling pipelines would decrease as soon as more ChIP-Seq data would become available for analysis.\nncb0 | In general, there is an overlap between ADASTRA ASBs and the existing data on regulatory SNPs, including sites of allele-specific DNA accessibility and reporter assay quantitative trait loci (see Supplementary Figure five), but the vast majority of ADASTRA data are novel.\n8mp0 | Given the diversity of assessed TFs, it became possible to systematically compare SNVs carrying TF ASBs and identify the pairs of TFs preferring to share ASBs (see Supplementary Figure six). Indeed, hundreds of TF pairs are significantly enriched for common ASBs. As a rule, shared ASBs were not related to interacting TFs (considering protein-protein interactions from STRING-db). However, there was a systematic overlap between ASBs for chromatin-interacting epigenetic factors and related proteins, suggesting many of shared events are \"passengers\" in regions of allele-specific chromatin accessibility with TFs bound only to the accessible chromosome. Still, some interacting proteins (such as CTCF-RAD twenty-one) strongly prefer to share ASBs, and the same holds for particular composite elements of binding sites such as AR-FOXA one.\nxjyk | Motif annotation is concordant with ASB calls. For TFs specifically interacting with DNA, it is possible to perform computational annotation of ASBs with TF-recognized sequence motifs. When a strong binding site overlaps an ASB SNP and the alternating alleles directly change the key nucleotides in the TF-binding DNA sequence, this SNP likely relates to different TF-binding affinity to the sites at homologous chromosomes, which directly produce the ChIP-Seq allelic imbalance. We call such events \"driver\" ASBs to distinguish them from side effects of piggyback TF binding and chromosome-specific local chromatin accessibility, the examples of \"passenger\" ASBs. Motif annotation highlights the driver ASBs and allows comparing the observed ASB effect (the allelic imbalance) and the effect predicted by sequence analysis (the difference in binding specificity reflected in the motif prediction scores), providing an independent evaluation of the reliability of ASB calls.\nmt0f | An ASB was considered as overlapping the TF motif occurrence if the TF position weight matrix scored a hit with P less than or equal to zero point zero zero zero five for any of the two alleles. The log ratio of P values corresponding to position weight matrix hits at alternative alleles was used as an approximation of the TF affinity fold change. Figure four A compares the ASB significance (X-axis, signed log ten false discovery rate; the sign set positive for Alt-ASBs and negative for Ref-ASBs) with the log ratio of motif hits P values (Y-axis) for two hundred eighteen TFs having at least one ASB within a motif hit. Predominantly, at heterozygous sites, alleles with more specific motif hits are covered with more ChIP-Seq reads, revealing the prevalence of motif-concordant ASB events (blue dots in Figure four A). Such concordance persists for more than eighty percent of SNVs with ASB allelic imbalance false discovery rate less than five percent, growing with decreasing ASB false discovery rate and saturating at about ninety percent of SNVs (Figure four B). At five percent false discovery rate, good motif concordance stands for many TFs, as illustrated by the top ten TFs with the highest number of motif hits at ASBs (Figure four C). Importantly, even at larger false discovery rate, there are more concordant than discordant ASBs.\nawab | Yet, for approximately ten to twenty percent of SNVs, the motif hit odds ratios are discordant with the allelic imbalance (corrected for BAD), that is, more reads are attracted to the weaker motif hit (red dots in Figure four A and red bars in Figure four C). We believe that in such cases the allelic imbalance arises from other contributors (allele-specific chromatin accessibility or indirect TF binding), which override the sequence-specific TF affinity. Also, we use the motif prediction scores as a proxy of the TF-binding affinity and it is possible that the observed limited discordance partly reflects the imperfectness of the utilized motif models.\nixcc | To quantify ASB allelic imbalance for BAD other than one, we defined the ASB effect size as follows (see \"Methods\" for details). For individual SNV (SNV in a single data set):\n8p6h | Effect size Reference equals log base two of (Counts Reference divided by Expectation (Counts Reference ICAIt)) and Effect size Alternative equals log base two of (Counts Alternative divided by Expectation (Counts Alternative ICAIt given Counts Reference)).\npmgl | Here Counts Reference and Counts Alternative are the read counts at the Reference and Alternative alleles, and Expectation is the expectation. For BAD equals one: Effect size Reference equals log base two of (Counts Reference divided by Counts Alternative).\n90no | The aggregated Effect size of an ASB is calculated as a weighted mean of Effect size values for the same allele for SNVs aggregated at the same genome position over TFs or cell types, with weights equal to negative logarithms of individual P values, separately for each of the alleles.",
