Classical statistical mechanics says E equals two k T. Quantum mechanics says X equals h over p. It's pretty optimistic to put these formulas together and see what we get. But the result is approximately correct, though subject to limitations.\nag51 | We derived E equals k T using classical statistical mechanics. But it's close to correct for a single quantum particle in a big enough box at high enough temperatures. Otherwise quantum effects kick in.\n```",
