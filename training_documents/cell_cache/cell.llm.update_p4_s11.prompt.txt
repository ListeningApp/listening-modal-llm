You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

b780 | Another feature of murine minor ZGA is reduced efficiency of splicing and polyadenylation. Spliced transcripts and some degree of termination is detected near the polyA signal [65] and it thus appears that efficiency, rather than specific mechanisms, sup- presses processing of nascent transcripts. It may be that the splicing machinery in 1-cell pronuclei has limited capacity that would be overwhelmed by nascent transcripts in pronuclei with chro- matin highly permissive for transcription. The relaxed control of splicing and polyadenylation correlates with absent nuclear speck- les in 1-cell embryos [65] and disassembly of nuclear speckles is associated with reduced pre-mRNA splicing [68]. While this could explain inefficient processing of nascent transcripts in the larger male pronucleus with its "naïve" chromatin structure, it is unclear how the same would apply to the female pronucleus, where protamine-histone exchange does not occur. However, NGS analysis of parthenogenetic zygotes [63,65] implies that inefficient splicing exists also in female pronuclei.
ccmb | The significance of minor ZGA in mouse zygotes remains unclear. Why would the zygote produce nascent transcripts across the genome that would be inefficiently processed? Inefficient post- transcriptional processing could have a protective role against mis-expression of genes that would compromise development. This could also explain, at least in part, the uncoupling of transcrip- tion and translation observed for plasmid-borne reporter genes in 1-cell embryos [69]. It is also possible that some transcripts among genes transcribed in 1-cell embryos are efficiently spliced and translated into functional proteins important for continued development. Notably, low splicing efficiency would favor pro- tein expression from intron-less genes - in fact, a cluster of intron-less double homeobox genes recently has been implicated in ZGA [70-72]. Investigation of intron-less genes transcribed during minor ZGA is thus one research direction that could shed more light of the significance of minor ZGA. Finally, as transcription itself is required for some cellular processes, e.g., genomic imprinting [73], it should be considered that pioneering transcription itself (i.e. not its products) helps to remodel the chromatin during minor ZGA to set the stage for reprogramming gene expression during major ZGA. This notion resonates with the above-mentioned HiC data show- ing male pronucleus compartmentalization into active and inactive compartments that aligns with H4 hyperacetylation [47], which was known to accumulate rapidly in the male pronucleus [74].
ma93 | 6. The major ZGA in mouse zygotes
c6hh | Major ZGA in mouse zygotes takes place during the 2-cell stage and results in a dramatic change in gene expression. While mater- nal mRNA degradation can be viewed as an oocyte identity-erasing mechanism, major ZGA is a zygotic identity-generating mecha- nism. This transition is manifested in transcriptome similarities among different stages of OET. Transcriptome profiling by microar- rays as well as NGS documents an oocyte-like identity of the 1-cell transcriptome while the 2-cell stage transcriptome profile is shift- ing to that of the later preimplantation stages (Fig. ). This shift reflects loss of oocyte-like identity through maternal mRNA degra- dation and accumulation of a novel zygotic transcriptome which conveys cellular totipotency.
y7ea | Importantly, minor and major ZGA differ not only in the volume of transcription, but also in what is transcribed, i.e., the major wave of ZGA is not simply more of the same transcripts expressed during minor ZGA [63,65]. The estimates of genes transcribed during major ZGA vary according to filtering conditions. For example, microarray profiling of mouse early embryos identified ~3000 @-amanitin- sensitive genes in 2-cell embryos [61]. The bulk of transcription (RNA synthesis) in 2-cell embryos occurs in its long G2 phase (Fig. A). A small population of genes activated during major ZGA continue their expression in 2-cell embryos, but become silenced upon establishment of transcriptionally-repressive chromatin at the end of the 2-cell stage. NGS, however, documents that microar- rays underestimate the number of expressed genes because arrays lack many non-annotated genes while NGS has the sensitivity to detect low abundant transcripts. In addition, single-cell sequenc- ing of hybrid zygotes suggested existence of stochastic monoallelic expression and de novo activation of the paternal <LATEX>X</LATEX> chromosome [62]. In any case, ZGA and reprogramming gene expression entails thousands, not hundreds, of genes.
nav4 | 7. Minor and major ZGA in mammals - common and species-specific features
gem8 | The minor/major ZGA concept developed in mouse zygotes can- not be generalized for all mammals. Human and bovine embryos undergo ZGA several cleavage divisions later (4-16 cells), although NGS data suggest that transcription could initiate earlier than previ- ously thought [14,15]. Expression profiling of 2-cell mouse zygotes identified >3000 major ZGA genes [61-63]. Profiling early bovine development identified ~ 100 transcripts up-regulated at the 4- cell stage and ~1000 and ~1300 transcripts up-regulated at the 8-cell and 16-cell stages, respectively [14]. Profiling of human early development identified ~2500 genes whose expression increased between 4-cell and 8-cell stages [75]. According to another study, human ZGA occurs in three waves, with ~2000 genes up-regulated between 2-cell and 4-cell embryos ("early risers"), ~1500 genes up-regulated between 4-cell and 8-cell embryos ("middle risers"), and ~1400 genes up-regulated after 8-cell ("late risers") [76].
e8nr | It might seem that with more sensitive analysis, the ZGA timing in other mammals would shift into earlier stages and the minor ZGA could occur as early as in mice. In fact, Xue et al. reported minor ZGA in human 1-cell embryos [15]. However, there are two arguments against this possibility. First, some of the evidence for early human genome activation is possibly an experimental artifact, especially when the analysis is restricted to polyA RNA (Fig. B). Second, the whole transcription correlation data paint a different picture when comparing mice with human or bovine early embryos (Fig.)
k78w | The mouse model is exceptional in that minor and major ZGA produce distinct sets of RNAs that are separated by the cleavage between 1-cell to 2-cell embryos. This can be visualized as a dif- ference in developmental stage transcriptome correlations when
