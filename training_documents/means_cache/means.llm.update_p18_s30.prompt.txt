You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

n1wo | 13.5.5 Contrasts
5bq3 | There are various dialog boxes that can be accessed from the main dialog box. If a covariate is selected, the post hoc tests are disabled because the tests that we used in the previous chapter are not designed for models that include covariates.
ezla | However, comparisons can be done by clicking Contrasts ...
rsbu | to access the
magd | Contrasts dialog box in Figure 13.6. You cannot enter codes to specify user- defined contrasts (but see SPSS Tip 13.1); instead you can select one of the standard contrasts that we met in Table 12.6. In this example, there was a control condition (coded as the first group), so a sensible set of contrasts would be simple contrasts comparing each experimental group to the control (this results in the same contrasts as dummy coding). Click the drop-down list ( None and select a type of contrast (in this case Simple) from this list. For simple contrasts you need to specify the reference category (i.e., the category against which all other groups are compared). By default the last category is used, which for our data is the 30-minute group. We need to change the reference category to be the control group, which is the first category (assuming that you coded control as 1). We make this change by selecting

olce | 13.5.6 Other options
erx1 | You can get a limited range of post hoc tests by clicking EM Means ... to access the Estimated Marginal Means dialog box (see Figure 13.7). To specify post hoc tests, drag the independent variable (in this case Dose) from the box labelled Estimated Marginal Means: Factor(s) and Factor Interactions to the box labelled Display Means for (or click Save ... ). Once a variable has been transferred, you'll be able to select Compare main effects to activate the drop-down list ( LSD(none) ) of post hoc tests. The default is to perform a Tukey LSD post hoc test which makes no adjustment for multiple tests (and which I don't recommend). The other options are a Bonferroni post hoc test (recommended) and a Šidák correction, which is like the Bonferroni correction but is less conservative and so should be selected if you are concerned about the loss of power associated with Bonferroni. For this example we'll use the Šidák correction just for variety (we have used Bonferroni in previous examples). As well as producing post hoc tests for the Dose variable, the options we've selected will create a table of estimated marginal means for this variable: these are the

vcu3 | Clicking Options ... opens a dialog box containing the options described in Jane Superbrain Box 13.3. The most useful are (in my opinion) descriptive statistics, parameter estimates, residual plot and HC4 robust standard errors (see Figure 13.7).
hjzj | There is no option for specifying planned contrasts like we used in the previous chapter (see Section 12.6.2). However, these contrasts can be done if we fit the model using the regression menu. Imagine you chose some planned contrasts as in Chapter 12, in which the first contrast compared the control group to all doses of puppy therapy, and the second contrast then compared the 30-and 15-minute groups (see Section 12.4). We saw in Sections 12.4 and 12.6.2 that we specify these contrasts with codes. For the first contrast we discovered that an appropriate set of codes was -2 for the control group and then 1 for both the 30-and 15-minute groups. For the second contrast the codes were 0 for the control group, -1 for the 15- minute group and 1 for the 30-minute group (see Table 12.4). To do these contrasts when a covariate is included in the model, enter these values as two dummy variables. In other words, add a column called Dummy1 in which every person in the control group has a value of -2 and all other participants have a value of 1. Add a second column called Dummy2, in which everyone in the control group has the value 0, everyone in the 15-minute group has the value -1 and those in the 30-minute group have a value of 1. The file Puppy Love Contrast.sav includes these dummy variables. Output 13.4
j79f | Run the analysis as described in Section 13.3. The model summary and ANOVA table for the model will be identical to Output 13.1 (because we've done the same thing as before; the only difference is how the model variance is subsequently broken down with the contrasts). The <LATEX>b</LATEX> b-values for the dummy variables will be different than before because we've specified different contrasts. Output 13.4 shows the model parameters. The first dummy variable compares the control group with the 15-and 30-minute groups. As such, it compares the adjusted mean of the control group (2.93) with the average of the adjusted means for the 15-and 30-minute groups <LATEX>\left( \left( 4 . 7 1 + 5 . 1 5 \right) / 2 = 4 . 9 3 \right) .</LATEX> The <LATEX>b</LATEX> b-value for the first dummy variable should reflect the difference between these values: <LATEX>4 . 9 3 \quad - \quad 2 . 9 3 = 2 .</LATEX> We discovered in a rather complex and boring bit of Section 12.4.2 that this value gets divided by the number of groups within the contrast (i.e., 3) and so will be <LATEX>2 / 3 = 0 . 6 7</LATEX> (as in Output 13.4).4 The associated t-statistic is significant <LATEX>\left( p = 0 . 0 1 0 \right) ,</LATEX> indicating that the control group was significantly different from the combined adjusted mean of the puppy therapy groups.
6tbv | The second dummy variable compares the 15-and 30-minute groups, and so the <LATEX>b</LATEX> b-value should reflect the difference between the adjusted means of these groups: <LATEX>5 . 1 5 \quad - \quad 4 . 7 1 = 0 . 4 4 .</LATEX> In Section 12.4.2 we discovered that this value gets divided by the number of groups within the contrast (i.e., 2) and so will be <LATEX>0 . 4 4 / 2 = 0 . 2 2</LATEX> (as in Output 13.4). The associated <LATEX>t</LATEX> t-statistic is not significant <LATEX>\left( p = 0 . 5 9 3 \right) ,</LATEX> indicating that the 30-minute group did not produce significantly higher happiness than the 15-minute group after adjusting for love of puppies.
