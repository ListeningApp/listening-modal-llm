You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

dqn8 | Stool-based Xpert MTB/RIF assay for the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis in children at a teaching and referral hospital in Southwest Ethiopia
cop0 | Abstract
lhkq | Background
82ju | Diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) in children is challenging mainly due to the difficulty of obtain- ing respiratory specimen and lack of sensitive diagnostic tests. The objective of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of Xpert MTB/RIF (Xpert here after) for the diag- nosis of pulmonary TB (PTB) from stool specimen in children.
y2qo | Methods
1piq | A cross-sectional study was conducted among consecutively recruited children (less than 15 years old) with presumptive PTB at Jimma Medical Center, Ethiopia. One pulmonary specimen (expectorated sputum or gastric aspirate) was collected from each participant and tested for TB by Xpert and Lowenstein-Jensen (LJ) culture. In addition, one stool specimen per child was collected and tested by Xpert after a single step, centrifuge-free stool process- ing method adapted from KNCV TB Foundation. Diagnostic performance of Xpert was cal- culated with reference to LJ culture and to a composite reference standards (CRS) comprising of confirmed TB (positive by Xpert and/or culture) and unconfirmed TB (clinical diagnosis with improvement after anti-TB treatment).
7fqw | Results
rhaz | A total of 178 children were enrolled; 152 of whom had complete microbiological results. Overall, TB was diagnosed in 13.2% (20/152) of the children with presumptive TB. Of these, only ten had microbiologically confirmed TB (positive Xpert and/or culture) and the remain- ing ten were clinically diagnosed with positive response to anti-TB treatment and were clas- sified as unconfirmed TB. Stool Xpert had sensitivity of 100% (95%CI: 66.4-100) and specificity of 99.3% (95%CI: 96.2-100) compared to culture; however, the sensitivity was

wtfz | decreased to 50% (95%CI: 27.2-72.8) when compared to CRS. The Xpert on gastric aspi- rate had sensitivity of 77.8% (95%CI: 40-97.2) compared to culture and 40% (95%CI: 19.1- 64) compared to CRS.
qy1i | Conclusions
1k9e | The sensitivity of Xpert for stool sample is comparable to that for gastric aspirate. Stool sam- ple is a potential alternative to pulmonary specimen in the diagnosis of pulmonary TB in chil- dren using Xpert.
5bjs | Background
uodj | Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the leading causes of death globally [1]. Children account for 11% of the global disease burden with an estimated 1.1 million new childhood TB cases and 205,000 pediatric TB deaths in 2018 [1]. Early detection of TB is critical for timely initiation of treatment but is challenging in children because of non-specific clinical presentations, diffi- culty of obtaining respiratory specimen and lack of sensitive diagnostic tests [2].
k16v | Sputum specimen remains being the most frequently used clinical sample to confirm the diagnosis of TB microbiologically [3]. However, in most cases, children are unable to expecto- rate sputum specimen and when sputum is available; the yield is expected to be poor because of the paucibacillary nature of childhood TB. As a result, specimen obtained through different procedures such as induced sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage, and gastric aspirate have been studied to improve the sensitivity of microbiological examinations [4]. Though these proce- dures are well tolerated in adults, they are relatively uncomfortable for children, and the capa- bility to carry out these procedures may be lacking in many TB endemic settings. Thus, there is a need for non-sputum based specimen to diagnose TB in children who are unable to expec- torate sputum.
b2lm | Stool is an alternative specimen for TB diagnosis, because Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) can be swallowed with the sputum and detected in stool [5]. In particular, stool is easy to obtain from infants and young children who are unable to produce sputum [6]. The introduction of Xpert has revolutionized the diagnosis of TB and the World Health Organization (WHO) has endorsed Xpert for the diagnosis of TB from various types of specimen such as sputum, lymph node tissue and aspirate, cerebrospinal fluid, gastric lavage and aspirate [Z]. Recently, studies evaluating Xpert for detection of pulmonary TB (PTB) from stool have been published with highly variable sensitivities, ranging from 32% to 83.3% [6, 8]. In Ethiopia, there is a paucity of data on the diagnostic performance of Xpert on stool specimen for children who are unable to expectorate sputum. Therefore, this study is aimed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of Xpert for the diagnosis of PTB from stool specimen in children with presumptive TB.

wtow | An institution-based cross-sectional study was carried out among consecutively recruited chil- dren (less than 15 years old) with presumptive PTB at Jimma University Medical Center (JUMC), Ethiopia between March and November 2019. The study area is located in Jimma Zone, Oromia Regional State in Southwest part of Ethiopia. Jimma town is located 357km away from Addis Ababa (the capital city of Ethiopia). JUMC, located in Jimma town, is one of

nwfz | the oldest public hospitals in the country. JUMC is a teaching and referral hospital that pro- vides services for about 15 million people in its catchment area. Each year, JUMC reports serv- ing approximately 15, 000 inpatient hospital stays, 160, 000 outpatient visits, and 11, 000 emergency department visits [9]. Most of the patients getting services at the center are from rural area. According to WHO 2021 report, Ethiopia is among the 30 countries with high TB and TB/HIV burden, with an estimated annual incidence of 151,000 cases and an estimated 19,000 TB-related deaths (excluding HIV associated TB deaths).
nvfy | Study participants
mror | Participants were children aged less than 15 years presenting with a chronic cough of >2 weeks, weight loss, loss of appetite, persistent fever without an apparent cause, night sweats, or history of close contact with a TB patient within the preceding 12 months. They were classified as the presumptive PTB patients. Participants were excluded, if they had an already confirmed TB, had been on anti-TB treatment (ATT) for >72 hours before enrolment and clinical symp- toms or physical signs suggestive of extrapulmonary TB.
zlxc | Study procedures
k0bw | Children up to 15 years of age were screened for TB and those presumptive TB cases were enrolled into this study. TB screening was done as per standard of care, which mainly relies on self-reporting of symptoms suggestive of TB (cough, fever, night sweats, weight loss and his- tory of close contact with TB patients). Study subjects were diagnosed with confirmed TB based on positive microbiological test results (positive LJ culture and/or positive Xpert on gas- tric aspirate or sputum) or with unconfirmed TB based on a clinical diagnosis and positive response to ATT. Some of the patients with negative microbiologic results were given empiri- cal treatment based on the evaluation by the treating clinicians and were evaluated for response to treatment (resolution of symptoms, weight gain, and radiographic improvement) after two months. Demographic data and clinical information of the participants were col- lected through structured questionnaires. Clinical data such as radiologic findings, clinical improvement after ATT, HIV status, nutritional status, and BCG vaccination status were obtained from the participants' medical records.
