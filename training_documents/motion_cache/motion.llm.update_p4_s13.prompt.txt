You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

5xlt | where h = rx [i]M is the target-specific angular momentum with respect to the Moon, and h = |h||. The unit vectors î, j, and k in the rendezvous literature are generally referred to as V-bar, H-bar, and R-bar, respectively [3]. Note that the LVLH frame is defined with respect to the Moon, because the target is supposed to fly on lunar orbits, and vehicles incoming from the Moon surface or lower and higher orbits are expected to approach the target (as, for instance, is envisaged in the HLEPP [10]).
9bz4 | With reference to Fig. 2, the chaser position with respect to the Moon is given by:
yfv2 | (11)
pujl | re=r+p
3rqe | where p is the relative position of the chaser with respect to the target. The time derivative of Eq. (11) in the inertial frame is:
nsi3 | (12)
nil3 | where @yi is the angular velocity of L (i.e., of the target) with respect to I. Further derivation of Eq. (12) in I yields:
68a1 | (13)
seik | Noting that [@yilz = [@yile, and introducing Eqs. (9) and (10) in Eq. (13), we obtain the nonlinear equations of relative motion (NERM) in the LVLH frame:
oq7c | - + (1 - µ) ||r + rem r + rem 3 ||r +p+rem r +p +rem
z4mi | μ lr + p 11 3 r +p r
hkft | (14)
jai3 | The angular velocity of the LVLH frame with respect to the inertial frame can be computed by composition of angular velocity vectors:
p57i | (15)
u5ug | @l/i =@l/m +@m/i
i9k5 | where @ym and @m/i are the angular velocities of £ with respect to M, and of M with respect to I, respectively.
20z2 | The LVLH angular acceleration with respect to I is given by: [@yile =[@y/ml] + [@mfile = [@ym] + [@m/ilM -@l/m X @m/i
4cgs | (16)
htre | Equation (14), along with Eqs. (15) and (16), composes a set of nonlinear equations with time-varying parameters:
da3c | 1) r, @l/m, and [@]/m]c, which depend on the target motion around the Moon
890q | 2) Tem, @m/i, and [@ m/i], characteristics of the Earth-Moon system orbital motion
jomo | Equation (14) exactly describes the relative motion in the LVLH frame in the restricted three-body problem, providing that no orbital perturbations act on the spacecraft (e.g., solar radiation pressure). The consideration of the restricted three-body problem provides the option to model the primary bodies in either an elliptic or circular orbit around each other, depending on the three-body system considered.
06fi | In the following, the expressions of @l/m and [@1/m][ are derived, in order to complete the nonlinear description of the relative dynamics in the LVLH frame.
hb4s | B. LVLH Angular Velocity and Acceleration
cqq2 | We now look for an analytical expression of the LVLH frame angular velocity and acceleration vectors with respect to the Moon frame, which exploits only kinematics relationships. To this end, the same considerations adopted in [21] are here used to find an expression for @ym. The angular acceleration [@ym]e is then obtained by differentiation.
1ews | Consider the time derivatives of the LVLH frame unit vectors as seen in M:
afyn | M ; LÂM = @1/m x 1, [k]M=@ym XẾ
8sye | Left vector multiplication of the previous expressions by the relative unit vector gives:
r04h | ›[ÎM={x(@|m × }) = @|m - (@)|m · })}
orpr | which can be summed up obtaining:
k36m | (17)
wnuz | The time derivative of the unit vector k is:
sy14 | (18)
ghss | Noting that r = - rk and [i]e = - rk, we can write:
3s61 | r =- [r]·k =- ₼·k+(@|mxr)·k =- [^\·Î+@|m·(rxÎ) =- [r]M.k (19)
s3rm | Substitution of Eq. (19) into Eq. (18) gives:
pqxb | [ÂM = - (M ) + (2)M ) = - (MD)
08qc | (20)
hdj2 | Note that [i]M . j = 0 since the target velocity as seen in M is perpendicular to h, by definition of the specific angular momentum. For the unit vector j we have the following time derivative:
a57g | LIM = - 1(h) M - hh)
g8m3 | (21)
a9av | According to the definition of j, we have that h = - hj. Hence, Eq. (21) simplifies as follows:
