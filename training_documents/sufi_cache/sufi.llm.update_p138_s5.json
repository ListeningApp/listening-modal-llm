        "content": "j7hr | The rule is that:\n1kxa | Something which was functional becomes prized for itself: whether it is an exercise becoming a ritual, or an individual worker becoming idolized, or a tool becoming a totem.\n4414 | Whoever encourages this tendency will always find supporters, because this warp is already in the human environment, and its derivatives will seem 'right'.\n36zd | On the other hand, the concept of vehicle and instrument, of not seeing the wood for the trees, and other manifestations of this possible confusion, are so well established that there will always be people who will understand the importance of thinking straight on the container and that which is contained, and on other manifestations, including the grub-chrysalis-butterfly one.\n6gx9 | The means and the end are not the same. Studies, courses and processes exist for determining, perceiving and profiting from the knowledge of 'means' and 'end'.\nog9u | Do you remember Omar Khayyam saying:\nhhus | 'Temples and the Kaaba of Mecca are the houses of devotion, striking the bell is the sound of worship, the girdle and church and rosary and cross, every one is the sign of devotion.'\nal6d | The tool becoming a totem is especially marked as a tendency when people want to generalize theories, laws and rules out of situations which require a greater flexibility than just one or two alternatives.\n2yco | Concern and Campaign\nq6tt | Q: If one feels something very strongly, is it not right to pass this on to others, to get them 'concerned', and to form bodies of people who have similar interests?\no5gz | A: Any of these things might be right, or might be wrong, entirely depending upon what the subject in question is, and who the people involved are. I would have thought this inherent in the question. You only have to look about you to see the confusion and unhappiness caused by people indulging themselves by rushing about worrying other people and making them worriers-and hence inefficient - when concern and propaganda are no substitutes for knowledge and action. However, one of the great advantages of the fact that this 'wet-hen' behavior is so widespread is that it provides almost daily illustrations of its ugliness and often destructive role, enabling us to avoid it when it is functioning in that way.\n83or | Interestingly enough, it has not always been felt that agitation and recruitment are the answers to problems, or even that one does not benefit from sustaining problems, rather than always sharing them.\nw7fc | We can also meditate on the words of the Anwar-i-Suhaili - 'The Lights of Canopus' - where it is said:\n7bfs | The nightingale which cannot bear the thorn\n721i | It is best that it should never speak of the rose.\nxefe | Above all, I think that there is a need to know whether one is right, as well as a compulsion to believe that one is right and to convince others of this. The former attitude is just as important, but the latter perhaps is the one more familiar to most people.\nrq12 | 'Concerned' people may be right, but they may only be satisfying personal desires. To train other people to share these desires may be admissible: but only, I think, when they are recognized as\ncqq5 | desires, and not represented as necessities. In the latter case, if they are in fact not truths, both deception and self-deception are taking place. Can this be good?\nfg5t | THE MAN OF STRAW\nxwe0 | Saadi tells in The Boston of 'A wise youth from a decent land, who joined a community of people in Darband.' He was a person of 'excellence, intelligence and discernment' and the people received him well.\ni4qn | One day the chief of the pious said to him: 'Go, scatter the rubbish from the mosque!'\n6zpr | The youth went outside and disappeared. When he was seen the next day, he was accused of lack of respect for service, and selfishness, for not doing the sweeping:\n74l5 | 'Do you not know, O selfish infant, that men succeed through service?'\nez3l | Now these people had assumed that he saw what they saw- the dust in the mosque. But he was not a superficialist like them:\n0vf4 | 'He began to weep, burning with sincerity: \"I saw no dust or soil within that building .. I set off, so that the mosque should be clear of straw\".'\nms9q | This man regarded himself as the pollutant of the mosque, while the others only thought of the campaign of cleaning and the concern for the superficial: even when there was no dust in the mosque, they still wanted it swept.\njcs3 | Saadi continues:\ndp53 | This only is the Way of the Dervish:\nluyz | To humble his person.\n1mc9 | For eminence, choose humility!\nleyg | For to that roof, there is no ladder but this.\ngcno | The last line contains a play on words, and can also read, in the Persian: 'To that heaven there is no advance than this'...\nwd0q | Alas, people have not changed much since Saadi. Here is a sentence from a letter written to me by a famous man who is renowned for his spiritual virtues: 'I used to be proud and vain. Since I started to study Eastern teachings I am so humble you would hardly believe it.'\nsxvq | Use, Misuse and Disuse of forms of Study\n1n8p | Q: How can you explain the many forms in which people have attempted to teach? Since people believe in these forms, believe that they are true renditions of fact, they are enabled to reach truth through them. But is it that some are true and some are not, as the exponents of the organizations claim? If certain forms through which studies are carried out are true, are all the others false?\nkx45 | A: I must have answered this question - or, rather, the questions in this cluster - several hundred times, both in speech and in writing, including what I have written and quoted in books.\ncp08 | The fact that such questions continue to be asked constitutes a quite remarkable demonstration of what questioners are like: some at least will ask questions even though they have been answered in accessible form dozens of times.\n7av0 | But this may mean that the questions need to be answered again and again, until the answers penetrate.\nwwcy | The answers, once again, are: -\n0j1n | One. Truth has no form;\nriwd | Two. The means through which people may perceive Truth have forms;\numiu | Three. All forms are limited. Some of the limitations are time, place, culture, language;\ntirz | Four. Different forms are not necessarily antagonistic, for the above reasons;\n4cap | Five. Forms have changed through the centuries in obedience to the external world to which all forms belong;\nl6m4 | Six. When people believe that the form is more important than the Truth, they will not find truth, but will stay with form;\n86kg | Seven. Forms are vehicles and instruments, and vehicles and instruments cannot be called good or bad without context;\ndm6t | Eight. Forms outlive their usefulness, increase or diminish in usefulness;\nj0bl | Nine. These statements are abundantly to be found in the writings of Sufi teachers. They were written down in order to be read and remembered. They are seldom so energetically stated or so strongly maintained elsewhere, which may account for the fact that they have not been sufficiently heeded by people who have not given Sufi materials the study they deserve.\n6j1w | The outward forms of things of the world, about which Sufis so often speak, include the forms of teaching, which must be understood in their inward meaning, as well as exercising an instrumental function.\nu2vl | Nasir-i-Khusru has truly said:\nme1b | Your diver [for treasure] has only given you salty clay Because he has seen from you only envy.\nhjw7 | Seek the meaning from the Outward like a man: Don't be like an ass, content with noise.\nub63 | THE CAT WITH A UNIVERSITY DEGREE",
