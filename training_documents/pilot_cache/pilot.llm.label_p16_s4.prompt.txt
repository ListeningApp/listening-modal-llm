You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

06yq | Microdosing with psychedelics to self-medicate for ADHD symptoms in adults: A naturalistic study

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

y219 | Greater information dissemination about emerging practice activities and outcomes through electronic and other media could address the sense of isolation voiced by practitioners in this study. More frequent topic- specific articles in the professional literature could assist the profession in further understanding the new directions in practice and models of service delivery. While the AOTA SISs and associated quarterly newslet- ters address a breadth of practice areas, a specific SIS for emerging or community-based practices may allow therapists to more easily network and collaborate about issues specific to developing and delivering services in those practice settings.
06ht | Regulatory bodies and policy makers are in the position to facilitate or impede emerging practice and its future development through state practice acts that define and regulate the scope of occupational therapy practice. As such, members of regulatory boards, state professional associations, and agencies should be key participants in the decisions that will shape the future role of emerging practice.
v3r2 | Finally, the study results clearly articulated the need for the pro- fession and its members to support and conduct timely research to document the efficacy of occupational therapy services in emerging practice. The research findings would add to the body of evidence

jc47 | STUDY LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE RESEARCH DIRECTIONS
ko3c | The results of the survey painted a general picture of the nature of emerging practice. However, the study included a number of limitations that potentially affected the validity and applicability of the data. The low response rate and the use of convenience and purposeful sampling techniques may influence the validity of the results. In addition, the decision by the researchers not to provide a definition of emerging practice may have introduced interpretation bias among the survey respondents. This was a preliminary and pilot study of emerging practice and consequently cannot be construed to reflect the opinions or beliefs of the larger professional body. Further study with a larger sample size is needed to ascertain the validity of the results.
xek3 | In anticipation of the profession's 100 year anniversary, the Centennial Vision (AOTA, 2003) articulates a vision and plan for occupational ther- apy's future. Emerging practice is an integral component of this future vision. As such, the results of this study highlight the need for ongoing dialogue and further investigation of emerging practice, its future role, and strategies to support the development and provision of occupational therapy services in these new and expanded settings. Last, evidence-based research is essential to substantiate the efficacy of emerging practice and the profession's evolving domain.
