You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

wcd0 | And it was just bypassed [by the managers] like, 'don't use it, then as long as you do something'. Or that you don't need to use it. Or just try ... this was the conversation. And of course, if you give your employees the possibility that they can do something difficult if they want to, then obviously they won't do that and will use the easier way, Perhaps in some units the managers have stated more clearly that this is how we do things, everyone does like this, and there are no other options. And when people start doing it, that is when you learn, and it becomes a routine. (H5)
caos | Importantly, the street-level workers lacked understanding about the IS' usage for statistical and reporting purposes, and they felt that it was the managers' responsibility to ensure that these requirements were sufficiently met. Thus, managerial support and vision about how to implement the new technology in practice was lacking and called after.
qrvy | Implementation happened individually (during the everyday work practices)
pn9j | The implementation was done during the street-level workers' everyday work with the clients. Due to their busy schedules, learning to use the new IS along with the everyday work felt difficult. The street-level workers felt that there was no time for them to focus on really understanding how the IS operates. Instead of fully understanding the operational logic, the time restrictions limited the use of the IS only to the crucial features necessary for everyday work practices.
1pmc | I have to say that the more work I have and the busier and more clients I get, the less I will ... Like then you just use the IS the way you have learnt to use it and you think that, well, this is the way I have done things so far, I will just try to learn the new things later. (H1)
5z6q | Evidently, the street-level workers needed sufficient time and motivation for the implementation, that is, learning to use the IS' logic and features that were needed to ensure the continuation of work practices. The learning process was time-consuming, and sometimes, caused delays in everyday work. When the street-level workers had no time to learn and concentrate on the use of the new IS, or when the IS' features seemed too complicated and untrustworthy, the workers simply bypassed the IS and continued practice-as-usual.
yeoh | Due to the organization of their work, the street-level workers often worked alone. That being, they also were mostly by themselves when learning to use the IS during the implementation. Yet, support from colleagues was one of the most crucial aspects the street-level workers needed when learning to use the IS in practice. When encountering problems with the IS or when one did not know how to use the system, the street-level workers turned to their colleagues for support and advice.
b8hf | But then, due to the nature of our work, after the first few weeks when people more actively returned to do their own work, travelling and stuff, we quite quickly were in a situation in which we did not necessarily meet our colleagues so often. And after that it was like you first tried to figure it out on your own and then tried to seek help ... And always someone helps and ponders things with you. But when you do not have that colleague nearby, then you try to figure it out by yourself [ ... ] Or at least I think that we have all started to enact many things in our own way. (H2)
hntf | Evidently, the street-level workers did not often have either the possibility or time to reach out for help from their colleagues during their everyday work. In practice, the street-level workers made choices of what features of the IS they used individually, resulting to a situation where they had learned individualized ways of using the IS: "everyone just uses the system in their own way, despite of what the instructions say or what has been talked about in the trainings, everyone have just started to interpret and make their own choices." (H10)
99fo | Perhaps there was this uncertainty because we did not have any shared practices or understanding of how to do things [use the new IS], within the city or within the units, like how we will do the recordings, or how, if we meet our clients, how we will record the meeting to the system [ ... ] Previously, it was just that people did whatever they wanted to do [laughs], everyone just did how they know how to. And perhaps that also created resistance, we did not have shared practices, one did this and other did that. (H1)
y5r7 | Amid the everyday work, the features which seemed the most suitable for the work practices were taken to use, and others that seemed too complicated, difficult or time- consuming were left out. The street-level workers also put a blame on the busy schedule when explaining that they did not even have time to check out the IS' instructions, and when they did, the instructions were interpreted from the individual's perspective, only strengthening the individualized ways of using the IS: "I think that during the everyday work, people just don't remember nor have time to check the instructions, and they will just do something [laughs]." (H8)
lrry | Partially the individualized way of using the IS were caused by the system itself, which enables different ways of conducting the same procedures. Eventually, when the co-workers had already learned the different ways of using the IS, confusion and uncertainty about the need for shared practices emerged. Over an year after the implementation the street-level workers emphasized a need to develop and learn shared practices and ways of using the IS. They felt that standardizing the ways of using the IS and mutual understanding about why the IS was used in a particular way were crucial to unleash its potential. However, it was stated that it is difficult to change the ways of using the IS when the individualized ways had already been learnt. Again, time was needed to ensure the learning and unlearning.
hvhm | Ensuring the interaction and engaging with the clients (guided the ways the IS was used in practice)
863b | The street-level workers emphasized that their work at the social services was not as urgent as the work in healthcare services, and the characteristics of social services enhanced the street-level workers to choose how to use the IS in practice. Indeed, the extensive criticism towards the IS in the news media derived its source from healthcare service sector to where the IS was first developed. Paradoxically, it seemed that the operational logic of the new IS was more suitable for the social service sector: the street- level workers pointed out that the everyday work done in social services was not dependent on IS, or whether it was functioning properly. For example, it was possible to first use Word - or paper and pen - to document the necessary information about the clients and their situations instead of using the IS.
fj24 | In the everyday work, it was more important to focus on engaging with the clients, not using the IS. The street-level workers felt that especially in the meetings with clients the issues dealt with were sensitive and required them to be present in the situation for their clients: "I don't do registrations during the phone calls, there are so strong emotions, agony and needs that I find it silly to start typing, then, in my work, one must concentrate on the client." (H8). They choose, for example, not to use the IS for real-time registration. Instead, the street-level workers relied on their capability to remember the necessary information to ensure that their focus remained on clients, and used the IS only after the meetings. From the street-level workers' point of view, even using any technology - that is, having their laptops at the meetings - would interfere with the interaction with their clients, especially when the work was done alone.
mn1r | I feel like if I have my laptop with me, it affects how I can encounter my clients, I think that it prohibits good interaction which is crucial in those situations. That, like, then my focus is on what I write and what my fingers are doing and not on what the client says and what facial expressions and gestures they communicate with me. That is the reason I do not use it [laptop] at all. I find it easier to write one or two words in a notebook, and that does not take me away from the interaction. But the laptop in between cuts off the connection with the client. (H10)
5vqw | An overall agreement was that the street-level workers chose to use IS and its features for the benefit of their clients. They stated, for example, that all the recordings made in the IS should be done for the client and neither for statistical purposes nor for the sake of the IS' operational logic. One crucial feature of the new IS, the structured form for recording, was considered beneficial for statistical purposes but not suitable for recording the individualized situations and needs of the clients. Instead of the structured recording, the street-level workers preferred to use the IS' free text feature, which, from their perspective, better allowed the clients' life situations and needs to be heard:
meyw | Well, I think that the most important features are the ones with free text where the voice of the client is written, and what he or she talks about their lives within that particular moment. For example, one thing that has been seen problematic within our team is substance abuse. There is 'yes' and there is 'no'. It rarely is either or. If I click 'no', there will be no open space for text to be written, it is just 'no'. And then you must write it down somewhere else that the client has previously used intravenous drugs but has been clean for an year. Or something. That does not always serve its purpose. (H8)
2e62 | The street-level workers felt that the IS could also encourage their clients to participate in the service processes to benefit their own wellbeing as well as to increase the transparency of the social services. Client participation was enhanced through a client portal called Maisa, where it was possible for the clients to message street-level workers and to see their own recordings and decisions. From the perspective of the street-level workers using the IS this meant that they needed to be aware of the data visibility and data security issues when making the recordings. In addition, a sensitive and respectful approach towards their clients was called after. Yet, often due to time restrictions, the street-level workers needed to choose ways of using the IS which contradicted the benefit of their clients. For example, individualized recordings were seen important for the clients but not often compatible with their colleagues' data needs as well as too time consuming to do.
75y3 | We work in Family Services unit [ ... ] I criticize that we must do it [the decision] to every family member. Because that takes an awful lot of time, then. [ ... ] I think it's clumsy, there are sometimes seven, even eight children in the family, it really is a terrible [laughs], terrible waste of time. But then again, I couldn't use the same decision text to everyone because all these children are individuals [ ... ] Easily, it
s2g2 | feels like doing assembly line work, the child's own personality is not necessarily made visible and it feels wrong, I guess. But this is required, so shortcuts are needed. (H9)
q1q2 | The street-level workers stated that the IS needs to be so reliable that their crucial everyday work could be carried out without the need to test the system with the clients. Also, when encountering problems with the technology, support should be provided immediately to ensure that the work tasks, such as decisions, can be done without delays. Reliable and trustworthy IS meant better cooperation and trust in their interaction with clients.
cb7r | Technical, organizational and institutional aspects (affected the implementation process)
68xu | When it comes to the technical aspects, the street-level workers felt that the IS helped to govern their workload. They described, as a positive development, that the new IS notifies them when their own clients' recordings were incomplete, and that the IS enabled easy access to a holistic image of their workload, those work tasks that need attention as well as data and information of each client.
hd35 | On the other hand, the new IS was seen too complicated. The street-level workers' impression was that the IS had complicated their work practices and they hoped that it could operate on a more simplistic logic, meaning mainly that the IS entailed too many optional ways of completing the same functions. To reduce the complexity of the IS, the street-level workers hoped for example that they could modify the so-called "smart text" options and reduce the choices available in the structured recording function. An overall agreement among the street-level workers was that the terminology used both in the smart text and structured recording functions of the IS should derive from social services instead of healthcare services to reduce the complicatedness and confusion.
2zpk | Making the multi-actor collaboration difficult both between the units of the social service organization and especially in multi-organizational settings, the operational logic of the IS, and thus the street-level workers' access to information is dependent on the organizational structure and work role. That is, the rights of using the IS depends on the street-level worker's work unit and their role in it instead of the client or even the individual worker using the IS. This became especially problematic when a street-level worker had multiple roles within the organization(s) and depending on the role at hand,
epu7 | the IS' view, functions and access to client information varied. Technically, changing the role in the IS was seen complicated, frustrating and time-consuming: "Yes, because that just takes time. Like if this was a Formula 1 car, its speed would drop [ ... ] It would be in pit stop." (H6). Although the operational logic of the IS such as access to clients' information depends on organizational structure and the street-level worker's role within the social services, neither the practices of the work nor the needs of their clients were limited to these. Together, the operational logic of the IS as built on the organizational structures and restrictions deriving from law were affecting the access of information and caused delays in everyday work:
7od1 | It doubles the amount of work, like, there [Child Protection unit] already is the information but you don't get to use it [in Family Services unit]. I think that the biggest issue for us is, that the Child Protection unit, that we cannot see their recordings [ ... ] And yes, this is based on the law but of course it disturbs our work a lot. And especially now, it feels like ... There is a new limit of 35 clients [for a one social worker] in Child Protection unit, and it means that many of their current clients will change over to us at the Family Services, and their whole background [data] is there and we do not have any prior information, we do not see any of it, and we still have to continue their work, like, start from the middle. (H9)
0bqy | Along with the technical and organizational aspects, the Data Protection Act limits the use of IS in everyday work practices. Indeed, the Finnish law about the data protection, especially in social and healthcare services strongly guides the street-level workers' access to data. The IS' functions allow containing various data about the clients, yet the law restricts its use. Thus, the street-level workers needed to be well aware of which data they have access to, as well as what they can register and who else can access the registered data. Confusion about the rights to access data sometimes led to fear of mistakes. From the perspective of fluent everyday work, overcoming the organizational and role-related boundaries to access client's data can sometimes be well justified, but the law restricts the access. Quite naturally, the street-level workers did not want to risk breaking the law even if they needed the data.
b780 | Conclusions
