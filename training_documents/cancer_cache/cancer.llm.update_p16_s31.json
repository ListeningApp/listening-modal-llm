The authors suggested a correlation between treatment time and the number of O S atoms at the spheroid cores, possibly due to transport mechanisms. Overall, Sanchez-Cano et al. were able to demonstrate the anti-tumoral potential of left bracket left bracket R to the sixth minus P C Y M right bracket O S left bracket A Z P Y N M E two right bracket I right bracket to the plus against platinum-resistant tumors.\nvcu3 | Five point two point six. Spatially-Resolved Imaging of Platinum Metallodrugs in Three D Spheroids\nhjzj | Driven by the fact that tumor penetration of a metallodrug is a crucial step that has to be studied in order to better understand the tumoral cell's response, Theiner et al. aimed to apply LA-ICP-MS to study this parameter in two types of tumoral spheroids: colon HCT one one six and ovarian CH one P A one, exposed to three platinum Four compounds. Spheroids derived from HCT one one six and CH one P A one were grown in U-bottom ninety-six well plates at densities of two thousand and ten thousand cells per well, respectively. Using LA-ICP-MS, it was possible to detect the accumulation of the platinum Four compounds in specific areas of the spheroids. As can be seen in Figure five, in the HCT one one six spheroids, the platinum enrichment of the three compounds was observed in the periphery and the core, while in CH one P A one spheroids, the accumulation occurred primarily in the periphery (compounds one and two) and in the central region (compound one). The distribution of compound three (satraplatin) in the CH one P A one spheroids did not follow a particular pattern. These findings showed that LA-ICP-MS may be used to analyze the spatial distribution of platinum in heterogeneous structures such as multicellular tumor spheroids.\nj79f | Five point two point seven. Single-Spheroid Metabolomics\n6tbv | Despite being the subject of several studies, the mechanisms of action of some of the metallodrugs in clinical evaluation are still not fully understood. Studying the metabolome of tumoral cells after incubation with these metallodrugs could be a way of elucidating their anti-tumoral action. Rusz et al. tested spheroids on two different metallodrugs with distinct modes of action on colorectal cancer (HCT one one six): oxaliplatin and the ruthenium complex KP one three three nine under clinical trials.\nxb13 | Spheroids were grown in ultra-low attachment U-bottom ninety-six well plates at a density of three thousand cells per well. The spheroids metabolome was assessed twenty-four hours after exposure to twenty micromoles and two hundred micromoles of oxaliplatin and KP one three three nine, respectively. In the KP one three three nine-treated samples, nineteen metabolites were significantly downregulated compared with only six metabolites in the oxaliplatin-treated samples. These findings were correlated to what was seen in the monolayer culture, where oxaliplatin demonstrated significantly milder effects than KP one three three nine. The pathway enrichment analysis indicated that oxaliplatin exposure (Figure six a) altered the purine metabolism and pyrimidine synthesis, being consistent with its established mode of action of D N A targeting, as well as pathways associated with redox stress, such as glutathione metabolism, biosynthesis of coenzyme A, and nicotinamide metabolism. Furthermore, this work allowed for elucidating the hypothesis that oxaliplatin was also involved in ribosome biogenesis stress. On the other hand, KP one three three nine (Figure six b) had a distinct mode of action, which resulted in different metabolic perturbations. This drug affected the pathways associated with redox stress, such as glutathione metabolism and purine metabolism, but also unfolded protein response, such as glycerophospholipid metabolism and several amino-acid-metabolism-related pathways. Overall, Rusz et al. were able to develop a protocol for metabolomics studies in tumor spheroid samples, allowing for the comparison of various conditions, such as incubation with different metallodrugs.\ncxqi | These examples underline the need for incorporating cancer three D models in the preclinical testing of metallodrugs, which can support, or not, the results obtained in two D models. This combined approach can enhance the accurate in vitro assessment of the anti-tumor capabilities of metallodrugs, thereby potentially increasing the success of the process of drug exploration and advancement.\nqfmx | Six. Conclusions\nrut3 | The majority of clinically tested drugs fail during clinical trials due to inadequate effectiveness or excessive toxicity, resulting in a significant financial loss. As mentioned previously, this occurs in part due to the use of drug testing platforms that are unable to fully represent the tumor and the in vivo microenvironment.\nm3cp | Different models such as two D and three D cellular platforms, and animal models are necessary for the proper preclinical study of metallodrugs for anti-cancer treatments. Nonetheless, most of the metal compounds are still not tested in three D models. Additionally, as far as we know, the few studies that incorporate three D models use mostly spheroids. We envisage that in the future this paradigm may change and that three D models become a regular tool in metallodrug preclinical studies. In addition to the most commonly used spheroids, more advanced platforms, such as organoids and tumoroids, have the potential to make these studies even more relevant by introducing multiple cell types. Complex models such as organ-on-a-chip are already used in drug toxicity assessments for predictive evaluations, and tumoroids could even be used in the future as platforms to verify which metallodrug will be more adequate for each patient, covering an important aspect of precision medicine. Tumoroids might also be used to determine whether some subpopulations are more likely than others to respond differently or have side effects to certain metallodrugs depending on their genetic makeup. This is already the case for cystic fibrosis, in which concerted efforts in several European projects have developed and validated intestinal organoids as a clinical tool. All in all, the potential for three D models as valuable platforms for anti-cancer metallodrug testing has already been proven, and drug development could benefit greatly in the future from the introduction of three D models as tools in preclinical studies.",
