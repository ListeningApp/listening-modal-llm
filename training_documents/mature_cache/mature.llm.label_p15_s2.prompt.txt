You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

o9sc | Positioning a 'mature' self 485
121u | appear to position the 'other' as extreme, absurd, or problematic in some way. But the caricature need not always establish complete differentiation. Depending on its design, it may work selectively to problematize some features of the 'other', while indirectly leaving other features intact. Consider the following excerpt.
zh03 | Excerpt 5
1mvw | Participants: M: Moderator, D: Don, H: Hal, A: Andi
6d4s | 1 M: okay listen (.) so is it that the girls think that the guys are only looking for looks and =
mqah | 3 D: =depends on the guy (.) cause [some ( )]
xxr8 | 5 M: is that a common thing [some guys] just look for looks
rl4j | 4 A:
vz32 | 7 M very common (1.0) so you think you all are different from these guys
ncb0 | 9 ((all three boys nod))
8mp0 | 10 M you think so huh (.) Hal (.) you too
xjyk | H: yeah (.) those guys annoy me actually (.) like the guys that are all OHH she has such a nice bu :: tt (.) OH: I like it so: much' ((laughter, 1.0))
mt0f | 13 M: now are these also kids in your group
awab | 14 D: yeah (.) like we say: that (.) like but if we really wanna go out with em' (.) 15 we like just say Ä®hey you have a nice ass' (.) just say that and like (.) but 16 DON'T be like THEY: I WANNA GO OUT ((laughter, 1.0))
ixcc | The moderator's extreme case formulation of 'only' in line 1 marks the activity of the category 'guys' as extreme. Don undermines the extreme claim with a contrastive counter ('depends on the guy' in line 3) that works to open the landscape of possible masculine positions. They agree with the moderator in admitting that looking 'just for looks' is a common thing, but they all deny being like these kinds of guys (marked in line 8). By adopting a minority position, the boys are able to differentiate themselves from one feature of normative masculinity - looking just for looks. When the moderator asks Hal if he is different, he agrees and then upgrades the difference to being an 'annoying' difference (line 10). Hal's tag of 'actually' at the end of the assessment indexes his position as 'literal' or 'truthful', and in so doing, orients to the moderator's question as a potential challenge. Again, it positions the moderator as potentially misunderstanding and his question as incorrectly assuming that Hal is not different.
8p6h | Hal continues in lines 11-12 to offer the first caricature of these annoying boys, imitating the exaggerated and pronounced way in which these other boys fawn over girls' bodies, particularly with the way they are so obvious and forthcoming about it. The caricature parodies an 'obsession-style' discourse of transparent infatuation with 'butts'. What appears to be annoying to Hal is their extreme gawking, as indexed through the way he emphasizes the emphatic 'Oh's' and desire terms ('like it so ::: much'). When challenged by the moderator (12) as to whether they nevertheless affiliate with these types of boys, Don concedes that there are similarities in terms of the content of what they say ('like we say :: that'). But Don clarifies that there are differences, and that those differences are salient when they 'really want to go out with them' (line 14). Like the use of Hal's 'actually' (line 11), Don's use of the 'really' positions him as serious or truthful, and by extension, suggests that there are other times in which he is not 'really' being forthright. The 'really' indexes these other times, times when they are perhaps 'just playing around' (as in Excerpt 1). As such, there

qb7o | appears to be a dichotomy between being into looks in a 'real' or serious way and being into them in a less than 'real' or serious way. This dichotomy is treated by Don as the relevant context for differentiating themselves from these 'other' boys.
oae5 | Don goes on to offer a second caricature (lines 14-15). He works to show how they would tell a girl she has a 'nice ass' if they were serious about going out with her. The caricature differentiates a rather calm and unassuming approach, marked with the case softener 'just' and lack of prosody in 'just say hey you have a nice ass' (line <LATEX>\left. 1 5 \right) w i t h \quad a n</LATEX> exaggerated and emphatic approach ('HEY ::: I WANNA GO OUT'), which is reminiscent of the way Hal stylizes his caricature in lines 11-12. The latter approach is not only loud and demanding, but arguably desperate sounding. What we have, then, is a more qualified idea of what the caricature is and is not differentiating. What is different about these 'other' guys is not necessarily that they are into looks while Don and Hal are not. The difference lies in the way their interest is conveyed.
s0fl | Hal's and Don's caricatures position the 'other' boys as being over the top, obvious, loud, and seemingly desperate in the way they are interested in girls' looks. In contrast, Hal and Don are more nonchalant, even-tempered and seemingly confident in the way they go about orientating to girls' looks. The boys are not interested in resisting a normative male preoccupation with girls' looks because there is something in principle wrong with such a preoccupation. They are simply resisting overt displays of obvious and desperate infatuation with girls' looks in order to appear calm and confident when asking a girl out. Although this type of differentiation may seem instrumental or shallow, it is arguably part of the doing of maturity for them. While we would not want to argue that they are necessarily 'resolving' developmental tasks or that they are doing anything to thwart 'hegemonic masculinity' per se, we would argue that they are working to manage those aspects of 'heterosexual attraction' and 'desire' that, from their perspectives, need to be negotiated in order to successfully appear mature.
43ia | Discussion
3g2y | The aim of this article has been to offer a contextually sensitive analysis of several discursive methods used by adolescent males to present themselves as both mature and heterosexual while discussing their interest in girls' looks and physical attraction. It is our belief that a discursive methodology is essential for examining how such interests get brought off and situated rather seamlessly in the midst of questions and implicit challenges. Our goal has been to focus on the interactional subtleties and rhetorical finessing in the boys' management of such questions and challenges. We see such rhetorical finessing as illustrative of the 'developmental imperative'; that is, as ways of negotiating adolescent-appropriate forms of maturity. As such, we do not work from the assumption that their gendered identities arrive on the discursive scene pre-packaged, as more or less mature, such that the boys simply report their attitudes in the kind of straightforward way that they would on a scale or inventory. The value of a discursive analysis is that it reveals that it is precisely the sensitive orientations, and the work done to pre-empt and deflect possible counters to the hearable trouble in such orientations, that matter most for the boys as they work to position themselves as mature within the larger context of displaying their adolescent and heterosexual identities.
gc7v | There are several consequences to investigating maturity this way. First, it allows developmental researchers to move beyond survey or questionnaire approaches to adolescent male sexuality that catalogue problem attitudes and behaviours that are

7bdk | thought to pose psychological and physiological health risks. Operationalizing the ideological and normative aspects of masculinity in the form of forced-choice questionnaire items is a radically decontextualizing move that is wholly inimical to the discursive dictum that gender is a socially and interactively constructed phenomenon. Within a constructionist view, masculine norms are studied as the active accomplishments of the people who put them to use. Moreover, the heterosexual masculine norm to display desire for females is capable of taking on many forms in different situations. Thus, it is the situation that determines the logic or meaning of the norm being circulated. Seen this way, there is no <LATEX>a</LATEX> priori way to define what heterosexuality means, or of specifying a tout court distinction between what is normatively masculine and what is not. Connell (1995) has argued that most men are able to mix varieties of masculinities together so as to move between various normative dimensions of masculine roles. If this is true, then operationalizing normative masculinity may be a dubious enterprise.
fim0 | In contrast, a discursive focus allows for a more contextually sensitive exploration of the social and interactive processes used by adolescent males to construct and then engage with (and resist) hetero-normative masculinity. A focus on discursive process allows us to see that masculine norms are complex and fluid, and that they are not oriented to in either/or terms. As Graber et al. (1998) have argued, there is always a cost or 'cascade of effects' of embracing sexual norms, and that the negotiation of such costs is a dynamic one that methodologically requires contextually nuanced approaches. We believe that a discursive psychological analysis is a fruitful step in that direction.
ojro | Second, a discursive approach partially throws into question what is meant when psychologists talk about men 'resolving' stages that feature what could arguably be seen as 'less than mature' aspects of a sexual identity. We resist the urge to think of development in terms of successfully or unsuccessfully resolving tasks, or even of thinking in terms of gradations of resolution. Instead, we argue that young men learn to strategically mitigate appearing obviously or unknowingly complicit with the noxious aspects of hetero-normative masculinity. They do this in talk. And they do it in ways that resist 'fixity'. Seeing the resistance of 'fixity' is something that a discursive analysis is designed to reveal. By examining this in detail, we can more productively argue that their socialization involves what we referred to earlier as the development of 'finely tuned positioning skills', or the gradual refinement of a range of discursive techniques that allow the boys to maintain more than one ideologically dilemmatic position within a variety of situations and in the midst of a variety of potential challenges.
l6t9 | Third, connecting the type of ethnomethodologically informed discourse analysis employed in this study closer to the analysis of micro-genetically emergent positions of conversationalists opens up an important realm for developmental theorizing and investigation. A micro-analytic focus on the local 'fine-tuning' of interactive sense- making in the form of 'positioning skills' offers a relatively novel, discursive method for exploring developmental changes. In the group discussions analysed, the back and forth rhetorical orchestration between the participants is the space in which their identities micro-genetically emerge and consolidate. In utilizing this type of micro- analytic gaze for developmental theorizing, we are able to suggest that development (for these boys) involves the discursive rendering of linguistic, interactional and rhetorical skills, all of which reflect the burgeoning ability to be pragmatically and rhetorically 'answerable' in contested social contexts. A micro-developmental analysis of the 'fine-tuning' of such positioning skills reveals the gradual development of an 'interactive self' that is increasingly equipped for the vicissitudes of social life.

a0by | In the present data, the discursive ability to play up motives against empirical particulars, the strategic use of concessions to wash out the seriousness of a denial, and the inventive ability to style the other through caricature are all 'finely tuned positioning skills' that we believe begin to become strategic and common during adolescence. We believe this for two central reasons. First, adolescence has been well documented as a time when males are increasingly socialized to reconstitute their identities in normatively heterosexual ways (Eckert, 1994; Maccoby, 1998; Thorne, 1993). Second, it is a time when such socialization is flanked with innovative linguistic developments, which refer to an increase in the variable use of certain linguistic procedures and positioning strategies to do self-presentation and to manage face-work, particularly around gendered and sexual norms (see Eckert, 1998; Maccoby, 1998). Using language to position oneself as heterosexual is a precarious undertaking that involves a delicate balancing of directness with equivocation, something accomplished by practicing certain kinds of linguistic and rhetorical positioning skills.
u1ky | The gradual and refined use of such positioning skills allows the boys to hedge their commitment or non-commitment to what they see to be the precarious aspects of hetero-normative masculinity. These positioning skills are designed as if there are potential counters or criticisms lurking, from either the moderator or the other boys. As such, being able to effectively display such positioning skills entails a constant and vigilant negotiation of an array of discursive possibilities, as well as the use of inventive strategies for positioning self and other. Seen this way, creating a mature self involves reconciling the disparate or potentially incompatible features of social categories, like heterosexuality, in the moment. In the present study, it means finding ways of displaying heterosexual desire that get heard as mature.
