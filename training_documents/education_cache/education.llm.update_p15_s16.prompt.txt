You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

7szx | The key variables in deciding which is most likely are captured in the neighboring diagram, where the vertical axis deals with motivation considerations (is it about performance improvement, better alignment or dealing with disruption?) and the horizontal axis deals with readiness for change. Optimizers will be focusing mainly on performance improvement and be ready for only limited change. Transformers will have greater strategic ambition and be more focused on disruption.
hx9e | The future of higher education in a disruptive world
ywn2 | Whether transformers or optimizers, the four building blocks are the same:
a63r | 1. Strategy
dqvj | In relation to strategy, much depends on a view of the future, in one's own context. Building on earlier comments in this report, a plausible view of the future may have the following features:
r17u | Fueled by the dislocation of workers due to automation and new ways of working, demand will be high for upskilling, reskilling and retraining. Some estimate that almost all growth in formal hours of learning within static populations will be with adult learners who are older than the typical graduate.
3c47 | Some universities may move towards a subscription model, whereby for a regular payment, people will have access to a range of programs, thus potentially retaining the loyalty of their students across their lifespan.
g345 | Competing at scale
svhz | One of the extraordinary developments in today's economy has been the rise of the platform business. Seven of the 10 largest organizations in the world can be described in this way.20 The institution that can provide on-demand learning, at scale and personalized to the needs and wishes of the student, is the organization which can build resilience into its future.
oaen | e
5u67 | We may now see new forms of business model which draw on the entertainment industry, whereby some universities relay and quality assure content and assessment that is actually provided by others, as well as offering their own programs.
dvms | Lifestyle integration
qrd3 | Although not necessarily reducing in absolute numbers, the cohort of young people seeking the immersive, rite-of-passage, full-time, on-campus, bachelor education will reduce as a proportion of the whole student body. More students will be working part-time, undertaking family responsibilities and wanting to integrate learning into their lives rather than interrupt their lives for an immersive experience.

tf43 | 2.Capabilities
fcco | In 2018, KPMG International commissioned Forrester Consulting to conduct a study on customer-centric strategy decisions across 17 industries.21 This research identified that organizations that make a moderate or significant investment in all eight of the following capabilities are 2.1 times as likely to deliver customer experiences that exceed expectations, successfully execute on one or more customer-centric objectives, and achieve return on investment on one or more metrics.
8uji | Eight critical capabilities of connected enterprises
df3e | 1 Insight-driven strategies and actions: The ability to harness data, advanced analytics and actionable insights with a real-time understanding of the customer and the business to shape integrated business decisions.
53eu | 2 Innovative products and services: The ability to develop compelling customer value propositions on price, products and services to engage the most-attractive customers and drive profitable growth.
a5u1 | 3 Experience centricity by design:
ry7u | The ability to design seamless, intentional experiences for customers, employees and partners to support customer value propositions and deliver business objectives.
5mda | 4 Seamless interactions and commerce: The ability to interact and transact with customers and prospects across marketing, sales and services, and achieve measurable results.
i4li | KPMG International, also commissioned Forrester Consulting to survey universities in six jurisdictions for their self-reported investment in these capabilities and, because student centricity seems to be the key to thriving and surviving, we sought a particular focus on investment in customer-centric and related strategies.22
r8sm | An online survey was completed in early 2020, before the pandemic broke, by 410 institutional leaders in higher education in the US, Canada, the UK, Germany, Australia and India. Participants were at departmental chair level or above, and 14 percent were either C-level executives or presidents (and the equivalent).
cuin | The future of higher education in a disruptive world
n1i7 | Responsive operations and supply chain: The ability to operate the business with efficiency and agility to fulfill the customer promise in a consistent and profitable way.
0r5m | 6 Aligned and empowered workforce: The ability to build a customer-centric organization and culture that inspires people to deliver on the customer promise and drive up business performance.
ne2o | 7 Digitally enabled technology architecture:
sqxn | The ability to create intelligent and agile services, technologies and platforms, enabling the customer agenda with solutions that are secure, scalable and cost-effective.
6pmo | 8 Integrated partner and alliance ecosystem: The ability to engage, integrate and manage third parties to increase speed-to-market, reduce costs, mitigate risk and close capability gaps to deliver on the customer promise.
195r | A reasonable mix of institutional types and sizes participated, with 49 percent saying they were predominantly face-to- face, 22 percent online and 29 percent blended. About half (49 percent) were teaching and research, 35 percent were teaching only and 15 percent were research intensive. Slightly more institutions were private (54 percent) than public (46 percent), but 63 percent were non-profit.
kqmi | Eight out of 10 reported that they were putting customer centricity front and center. Twenty-five percent of surveyed higher education decision makers counted their customer- centric strategy among their institutions' top priorities and 51 percent said they were making it a high priority. While institutions across surveyed jurisdictions were placing a similar priority on developing their customer-centric strategies, institutions in India (84 percent) were more likely than institutions in other places to be placing a high or top priority on this effort, while those from Australia (68 percent) were least likely to be placing this level of priority.
g8rd | Traditional organizational drivers are taking a back seat to more student-focused objectives. Customer-centric strategies are driven largely by objectives centering around the student, rather than by more traditional institutional drivers, such as an increase in grant/donation funding and cost cutting. Improving the student experience (42 percent), improving student trust in the organization (36 percent), and gaining in-depth student insights (35 percent) topped the list. These top drivers were largely consistent across all measured jurisdictions.
nns9 | The majority of institutions considered their customer-centric capabilities average at best. Over half of higher-education institutions rated their customer-centric capabilities as less mature (14 percent) or about average (42 percent), compared with similar higher-education institutions. Institutions in India (50 percent) were somewhat more likely to rate their capabilities as more mature compared with their counterparts in Canada (44 percent), the US (43 percent), the UK (42 percent), Australia (36 percent), and Germany (32 percent).
9uwy | Few are going above and beyond in delivering on the student experience. Just four out of 10 institutions reported that the experience they provide students consistently (9 percent) or even occasionally (28 percent) exceeded student expectations. Institutions in the UK, Germany and Australia lagged behind the other jurisdictions in the study, with just 29, 28 and 24 percent, respectively, indicating that student experience exceeded expectations.
srly | Nearly 8 out of 10 higher education institutions are making customer centricity a top or high priority
dl6i | The future of higher education in a disruptive world
89ub | Many institutions have some distance to go in matching leading customer experience practices in other sectors.
dhle | The survey revealed that security, technology and people/process hurdles stand between institutions and the successful execution of customer-centric strategies. While higher-education institutions face numerous obstacles to success, their lack of qualified staff was listed as the number one barrier to the successful execution of customer-centric strategies, cited by 33 percent of respondents.
2nib | Barrier number two, cited by 29 percent of institutions, was students who "arrive lacking key academic and/or personal skills." It is, to put it mildly, unorthodox for a provider which actually selects its own customers then to say that some of them are the problem in executing a customer-centric strategy.
