A summary of the commonly used vasoactive agents is presented in Table one.\nhtm9 | Impact on Hemodynamic Parameters and Cardiac Performance\n8hul | Conventional descriptions of the agonist-receptor-effector interactions promulgated in traditional pharmacology teaching is primarily based on small studies from the nineteen fifties to nineteen sixties, using variable drug doses and indirect surrogate measurements of in-vivo receptor activity and downstream effects. In these early mechanistic studies, the observed physiologic effects of catecholamine administration in healthy subjects on blood pressure, total peripheral resistance, and heart rate were used to extrapolate specific agonist-receptor-effector biology. However, it is becoming\n87vz | Vasoactive Medications in Cardiogenic Shock\nym66 | increasingly evident that there is a far more dynamic and nuanced receptor-agonist interplay than previously appreciated.\nl0a3 | This complex interaction has been assessed in pharmacodynamic studies in a sheep model where comparable doses of catecholamines (epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine) were administered, and their doses titrated. Of note, all three drugs significantly and equally increased cardiac output, MAP, and right atrial pressure in a dose-dependent fashion. Similar observations have been made in clinical studies of CS, with the inotrope epinephrine being compared with the vasopressor noradrenaline and producing similar hemodynamic effects. These findings suggest that the arbitrary vasopressor and inotrope definitions for catecholamines, in particular when the term \"vasopressor\" is used to describe\nu8nw | predominantly peripheral arterial vasoconstrictive properties, do not necessarily reflect the true in vivo effects of these agents.\nl2v9 | Myocardial Oxygen Consumption\nafbe | Although the overarching purpose of vasopressors and inotropes in CS is to improve tissue oxygen delivery, these agents also increase myocardial oxygen demand, which in the setting of a cardiomyocyte oxygen supply-demand mismatch can cause further injury and contractile dysfunction. The energetic requirements of the myocardium is primarily met through oxidative metabolic pathways with less than five percent of ATP derived from glycolytic pathways. Basal metabolic requirements account for ten percent to twenty percent of the total myocardial oxygen requirements, with the remaining oxygen needs determined by variables that include heart rate, contractility, and systolic wall tension. The relative contribution of these variables has been characterized through human and animal models, primarily using exercise to induce increased cardiac work. From these studies, heart rate has been shown to be the greatest contributor to myocardial oxygen consumption. Through augmentation with pacing, it was found that thirty percent to forty percent of the heart's metabolic needs were secondary to heart rate variation. However, this is likely an underestimate of the true impact of heart rate, due to pacing mediated reductions in end-diastolic and stroke volumes, with some estimates of heart rate variation accounting for up to fifty percent to seventy percent of myocardial oxygen demand. The contribution of contractility has been elegantly assessed through several animal and human studies, showing that increased myocardial contractility under physiological stress (exercise) accounts for fifteen percent to twenty-five percent of the oxygen demand. In addition to factors that influence myocardial oxygen requirements, supply is principally governed by the coronary perfusion pressure gradient, perfusion time (which occurs predominantly during diastole and is reduced with increased heart rate), and coronary artery vasomotor tone. Therefore, the interplay between hemodynamic supports, cardiac filling pressures, heart rate variation, and coronary vasomotor tone has the potential to adversely influence myocardial oxygen supply-demand mismatch in the setting of CS.\n78r8 | COMMONLY USED VASOACTIVE DRUG CLASSES: PHARMACOLOGY AND PHYSIOLOGY\n320g | Catecholamines\ntp8g | The most commonly administered class of vasopressor and inotropic medications in the critical care setting are the sympathetic amines. These agents produce their physiologic effects through the stimulation of\ngxfd | Vasoactive Medications in Cardiogenic Shock\ns2v1 | the following receptors; alpha-adrenergic, beta-adrenergic, and dopamine receptors. A comparison of the alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptor pharmacology on vascular smooth muscle and cardiac tissue is presented in Table two and the intracellular signaling effects of catecholamines, in addition to other vasoactive agents, are presented in Figures one and two.\njkp9 | The direct cardiac effects of catecholamines are mediated through the G-protein-coupled beta-one-AR, which comprise eighty percent of the beta-AR population within the left ventricle. Beta-one- AR stimulation augments cardiac output through increased cytosolic calcium cycling and phosphorylation of troponin I, leading to increased myocyte contractility, lusitropy (active relaxation), and positive chronotropy. The second body system affected by catecholamines is vascular smooth muscle. The alpha-one-AR primarily modulates arteriolar smooth muscle tone. Activation of the alpha-one- AR causes increased cytosolic calcium concentrations resulting in smooth muscle contraction and an accompanying increase in systemic vascular resistance and MAP. Conversely, beta-two-AR stimulation activates the inhibitory G-i signaling pathways in vascular smooth muscle, causing vasodilatation.\nz8tt | Norepinephrine, epinephrine, phenylephrine, and dopamine are potent vasopressors and have comparable effects in increasing MAP. However, phenylephrine's exclusive alpha-oneAR agonist activity renders it unable to improve cardiac output and therefore should be avoided as a first-line agent for hemodynamic support in CS. Unlike phenylephrine, norepinephrine, epinephrine, dobutamine, and dopamine to a lesser extent all augment cardiac output through stimulation of the myocyte beta-one-AR. However, in contrast with dobutamine, dopamine, and epinephrine, norepinephrine has the capacity to improve cardiac output, without significantly increasing heart rate, and therefore may limit increases in myocardial oxygen consumption and potentially attenuate vasoactive medication related myocardial ischemia and injury.\n9g22 | Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors",
