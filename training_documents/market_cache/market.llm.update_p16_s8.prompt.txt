You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

7bdk | Several interesting and important findings emerge from Figures 4 and 5. First, the his- tograms show quite clearly that lots sold by Blas Chapa were much cheaper than those sold by Elías López; indeed, they were under
fim0 | $2000 per lot (in 1983 prices) compared with $3500 (see Figure 4 histograms and the over-
ojro | all means). Quite how Elías López managed to sell lots at much higher prices is hard to
l6t9 | explain, but the fact that he did offer formal Contracts for Deed (unlike Blas' preference for more informal receipts) and the fact that he had overall control of the development process in two distant settlements quite re- mote from Las Lomas where Blas Chapa had his base, may have been two key factors. Overall, it looks as though Elías López was the more business-oriented and profit-seek- ing of the two developers and this concurs with the fact that, unlike for Blas Chapa, the residents never held him in much affection. His recent death-if not celebrated-went relatively unmourned by most, as the focus group discussions revealed.
1ujy | Another feature suggesting that it is the development process more than location that shapes colonia prices is the fact that the trimmed mean purchase price of lots varies significantly by period (Table 4, col. 2). Lots sold during the early 1990s were consider- ably more expensive than those sold during the 1980s and were even higher than those that have come on line since 1995. This also suggests some differential price setting by certain actors-the developers, in this case. While both men were actively selling lots throughout the two decades, the bulk of Elias Lopez' developments were in the late 1980s to mid 1990s, so to the extent that he
qzor | and others were charging higher rates at this time, so the overall curve of land price changes could also be expected to rise in those years. As Figure 5 shows, Blas Chapa regularly 'undersold' lots during that period (his price curve actually declines), appar- ently only catching on to the opportunity of charging higher and more competitive prices in 1994. Interestingly, Blas must have known that he could have charged more for lots in the developments that he controlled, since the joint sales that he and Elías under- took together were usually at the higher rate (with some notable peaks and troughs, see Figure 5). Thus, to the extent that different developers are engaging in differential price- setting procedures at different periods, the overall price curve will also reflect their operations. In part, therefore, the upward price trends that we have observed, es- pecially in the 1990-95 period, at least in part reflects the impact that Elías López and others had in driving-up prices, rather than signifying an overall market change. Had it not been for Blas Chapa's continued activity of selling lots at lower prices, the increase would probably have been even more significant.
a0by | These findings are important since they tend to confirm other research for low-in-
u1ky | come (irregular) settlements that land prices are often 'socially determined', rather than being shaped primarily by more orthodox and conventional factors such as location, scarcity, amenity, etc. Future studies of land price changes in Texas colonias should ana- lyse carefully the role that developers play in setting prices and, in those cities where there are several different developers, it will be important to disaggregate the extent to which they work individually or in concert with one another. In Rio Grande City, Blas Chapa's somewhat aberrant (non-market) behaviour had a significant impact in offering lots at sharply different (lower) prices from those of his competitor developers. However, now that the developers' influence has been re- moved, we may expect other land market factors such as location, level of services, and physical characteristics to come more to the foreground and the pricing of lots in colonias will more closely reflect orthodox market factors, displacing the 'aberrations' borne of personal relations between devel- oper and clients that we have described here.
htm9 | Colonia Property: a Good Investment?
8hul | As well as asking people how much they paid for their lots, we also asked them to estimate the value of their lots-either their own, or those derived from recent sales that they knew about. Table 3 shows the resi- dents' estimated lot values in 2002. Looking over the data in Table 3 (col. 2, row 7), we see that a median lot cost was $4070 or 0.78¢ per square foot of land in 2002 prices. Inflating the 1983 values and trimmed mean of 0.50¢ (Table 4, col. 3) to 2003 values gives us a lot cost today of around $4250 which is the figure we use as our comparator to estimated current values in Table 3. Inter- estingly, however, estimates made locally by the residents themselves are considerably higher-a median of $6000 as estimated by 51 (valid case) respondents. While this varies somewhat between settlements (Table 3), the $6000 lot sale value is not unreasonable or inflated.13
87vz | Adopting a $6000 estimated lot value as
ym66 | the comparator, then the total gain in 2002 values would come out at between $1500 and $2000 per lot, although this return on the investment will depend heavily the period in which the householder bought the lot. Taking the data in Table 4 above, an individual buying a regular-sized lot at 36¢ per square foot would, in real terms, have made around $1350 on the investment assuming that upon resale the vendor was able to get the average increased value recorded across the settle- ments-$4250 (Table 3) in 2002. That same householder would earn a considerably higher gain of $2850 if, as respondents sug- gested, lots were selling for $6000. Calculat- ing these capital gains in terms of percentage annual yield of these two estimates over a 17-year period (for someone buying in 1985) comes out at 2.1 per cent and 5.3 per cent respectively. If we extrapolate the average purchase price of the next cohort of buyers (1990-94) at 54¢ per square foot (Table 4 above) and similarly compare the net return in real terms, then someone buying in 1993 would have experienced an overall loss of 1 per cent (on a $4250 valuation) and a gain of 2.7 per cent per annum on a contemporary $6000 resale.
l0a3 | What this tells us is that, unless lots are selling today for $6000 or more, people would not be making any significant gains on their investment and some would even be losing value in real-price terms. However, if a $6000 resale price was realised in the market in 2002, then those lot vendors would have made a profit of something in the order of $1250-2000-a sizeable equity gain for most people. But whether they can actually get that amount in the market-place is an- other matter. Assuming that they can, and depending upon when they bought, the gains range from 25-100 per cent in equity value.
u8nw | We also asked respondents to estimate the value of their properties (i.e. the lot and dwelling combined). Measured against what people now self-assess their property's worth, we see a substantial development of equity in Rio Grande City colonias. Some 82 respondents were able to estimate their own property's worth, with a median value of
