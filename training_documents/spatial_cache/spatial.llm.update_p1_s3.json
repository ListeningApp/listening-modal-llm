        "content": "4exe | The Analysis of Spatial Association by Use of Distance Statistics\n0myz | Introduced in this paper is a family of statistics, G, that can be used as a measure of spatial association in a number of circumstances. The basic statistic is derived, its properties are identified, and its advantages explained. Several of the G statistics make it possible to evaluate the spatial association of a variable within a specified distance of a single point. A comparison is made between a general G statistic and Moran's I for similar hypothetical and empirical conditions. The empirical work includes studies of sudden infant death syndrome by county in North Carolina and dwelling unit prices in metropolitan San Diego by zip-code districts. Results indicate that G statistics should be used in conjunction with I in order to identify characteristics of patterns not revealed by the I statistic alone and, specifically, the G sub i and G star statistics enable us to detect local \"pockets\" of dependence that may not show up when using global statistics.\nxh3i | INTRODUCTION\nsyiw | The importance of examining spatial series for spatial correlation and autocorrelation is undeniable. Both Anselin and Griffith and Arbia have shown that failure to take necessary steps to account for or avoid spatial autocorrelation can lead to serious errors in model interpretation. In spatial modeling, researchers must not only account for dependence structure and spatial heteroskedasticity, they must also assess the effects of spatial scale. In the last twenty years a number of instruments for testing for and measuring spatial autocorrelation have appeared. To geographers, the best-known statistics are Moran's I and, to a lesser extent, Geary's c. To geologists and remote sensing analysts, the semi-variance is most popular. To spatial econometricians, estimating spatial autocorrelation coefficients of regression equations is the usual approach.\nkg3t | A common feature of these procedures is that they are applied globally, that is, to the complete region under study. However, it is often desirable to examine pattern at a more local scale, particularly if the process is spatially nonstationary. Foster and Gorr provide an adaptive filtering method for smoothing parameter estimates, and Cressie and Read present a modeling procedure. The ideas presented in this paper are complementary to these approaches in that we also focus upon local effects, but from the viewpoint of testing rather than smoothing.\nlvae | This paper introduces a family of measures of spatial association called G statistics. These statistics have a number of attributes that make them attractive for measuring association in a spatially distributed variable. When used in conjunction with a statistic such as Moran's I, they deepen the knowledge of the processes that give rise to spatial association, in that they enable us to detect local \"pockets\" of dependence that may not show up when using global statistics. In this paper, we first derive the statistics G sub i left parenthesis d right parenthesis and G left parenthesis d right parenthesis, then outline their attributes. Next, the G left parenthesis d right parenthesis statistic is compared with Moran's I. Finally, there is a discussion of empirical examples. The examples are taken from two different geographic scales of analysis and two different sets of data. They include sudden infant death syndrome by county in North Carolina, and house prices by zip-code district in the San Diego metropolitan area.\no9sc | THE G sub i left parenthesis d right parenthesis STATISTIC\n121u | This statistic measures the degree of association that results from the concentration of weighted points (or area represented by a weighted point) and all other weighted points included within a radius of distance d from the original weighted point. We are given an area subdivided into n regions, i equals one, two, ellipses, n, where each region is identified with a point whose Cartesian coordinates are known. Each i has associated with it a value x (a weight) taken from a variable X. The variable has a natural origin and is positive. The G sub i left parenthesis d right parenthesis statistic developed below allows for tests of hypotheses about the spatial concentration of the sum of x values associated with the j points within d of the i th point.\nzh03 | The statistic is\n1mvw | G sub i left parenthesis d right parenthesis equals fraction numerator summation from j equals one to n w sub i j left parenthesis d right parenthesis x sub j over denominator summation from j equals one to n x sub j end fraction, comma j not equal to i, (one)\n6d4s | where left curly bracket w sub i j right curly bracket is a symmetric one/zero spatial weight matrix with ones for all links defined as being within distance d of a given i; all other links are zero including the link of point i to itself. The numerator is the sum of all x sub j, within d of i but not including x sub i. The denominator is the sum of all x sub i not including\nmqah | x sub i. Adopting standard arguments (cf. Cliff and Ord, pages thirty-two to thirty-three), we may fix the value x, for the i th point and consider the set of left parenthesis n minus one right parenthesis factorial random permutations of the remaining x values at the j points. Under the null hypothesis of spatial independence, these permutations are equally likely. That is, let X sub j be the random variable describing the value assigned to point j, then\nxxr8 | P left parenthesis X sub j equals x sub r right parenthesis equals one over left parenthesis n minus one right parenthesis, comma r not equal to i, and\nrl4j | Thus\nvz32 | (two)\nncb0 | E left parenthesis G sub i right parenthesis equals summation from j not equal to i w sub i j left parenthesis d right parenthesis E left parenthesis X sub j right parenthesis over summation from j not equal to i summation from j not equal to i, equals W sub i over left parenthesis n minus one right parenthesis, where\n8mp0 | W sub i equals summation sub j w sub i j left parenthesis d right parenthesis.
