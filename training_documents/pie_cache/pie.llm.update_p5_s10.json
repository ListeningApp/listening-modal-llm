        "content": "nvfy | Component causes of mortality can be partitioned in extrinsic and intrinsic, but mortality itself cannot, for the simple reason that extrinsic and intrinsic mortality are not mutually exclusive. Acknowledging a role for vulnerability in \"extrinsic mortality\" does not take away this objection. None of the component causes is more causative to the outcome, as without any one of them, the outcome would not occur. One could propose that there can be no predation without a predator and that therefore the (extrinsic) presence of a predator must be the most causative cause for death by predation. However, neither is there predation without a prey. Being prey is something \"intrinsic\". There is no such thing as \"most causative cause\". A partitioning that could have some utility is a partition of mortality in which an extrinsic component cause plays a role, versus mortality in which it does not. The term \"extrinsic mortality\" retains some meaning in this respect, although one could wonder whether purely intrinsic mortality exists at all.\nmror | Population heterogeneity\nzlxc | Populations are heterogeneous, and an observation at the population level may be quite different from individual-level processes. A population may seem homogeneous, but below the surface, organisms may differ greatly. Any change that may happen may have differential effects on each organism.\nk0bw | A way to look at heterogeneity in a population is to view all members of the population as different collections of causal pies that are sufficient causes for some outcome, for instance death. Some of those members will have many causal pies that are almost \"filled in\", that is, most component causes that make up the causal pie are present. Others will have mostly \"empty\" causal pies. Yet, others will have roughly equally filled causal pies, but the causal pies will be made up of different component causes. These individuals will be vulnerable to some types of stress, but robust to others, differing from individual to individual. How newly imposed stress affects each member of the population depends on the component causes that are yet present.\naq5a | Example: Frailty along the life course\nsc5y | A physiological view of human aging proposed by Izaks and Westendorp is that there exist multiple causal pies that form sufficient causes for deterioration and death which are slowly and steadily being filled in over the lifetime of an individual. Even apparently healthy older individuals are more vulnerable, because they have accumulated damages that in and of themselves do not cause disease or mortality, but that are part of causal pies\n0yab | that steadily have more component causes present. With more component causes already present, even if organisms appear healthy, it is easier to acquire the remaining component causes, leading to disability and death.\nw95z | This view is by no means limited to humans, but applies to all living organisms. Vital rates may be improving during part of the life cycle, but causal pies of disability and death are being filled in concurrently, making the distance to disability and death shorter. While physiological markers of aging are already deteriorating, that is, physiological aging, they may not yet lead to deterioration of mortality and fecundity, that is, demographic aging. Yet, any additional stress will have a much larger chance of completing a causal pie in older individuals, leading to quick deterioration of vital rates later in life. This explains why demographic aging can trail physiological markers (component causes) with a delay and why apparently healthy organisms may differ greatly in their vulnerability to stress. Together with trade-offs, causal pie models of aging may also contribute to explain the recently revealed diversity of aging patterns across the tree of life.\n0i1k | Discussion\ndqlg | All the results discussed in this paper derive from one and the same principle: the causal pie model. Still, any and all of these results can be derived without reference to the causal pie model. For instance, no evolutionary biologist would be surprised to learn that if genetic variation in some respect is initially subject only to random drift, it can suddenly become subject to natural selection if the environment changes such that the genetic variation becomes relevant to Darwinian fitness. This is standard evolutionary theory; no causal pie model is needed to explain it. Then what is the utility of the causal pie model, in particular when compared to other models of causation?\np6pq | In reality, science is subject to significant uncertainty. In a given natural system, not all causal pies may be known or identifiable, or the presence versus absence of (some of) the component causes may be ascertained only at a statistical level. More involved models, such as structural equation modeling, are then necessary to discover the underlying causal relationships. Causation is then expressed in probabilistic terms, such that A causes B if the probability of B in the presence of A is greater than in the absence of A, that is, P(B|A) is greater than P(B|minus A). As pointed out in section \"The model\", even though it is not itself a statistical model, the causal pie model is fully compatible with this probabilistic representation of causal relationships. The probability of the presence of all component causes of a pie chart is the product of the probabilities of the presence of each individual component.\nzse6 | Causal Pies in Ecology and Evolution\np2n3 | cause, such that if A through D are all the component causes of causal pie one, it holds that P(I) equals P(A)P(B)P(C)P(D). If there are more than one sufficient causes\nohh7 | Causal Pies in Ecology and Evolution\nvbni | (causal pies) for outcome, it holds that P(outcome) equals P(I) P(II) P(III).\ndgcw | To reveal underlying causal relations in a data set, the causal pie model offers no alternative to the appropriate tools of data analysis, such as structural equation modeling or quantitative methods of natural selection. However, we do not propose the causal pie model to take the place of these methods. Rather, it should be seen as a helpful tool of conceptualizing causation whenever this simplest model suffices. The causal pie model is a very simple model, perhaps the simplest, that captures the basic workings of causation. The model is instrumental in understanding a range of results, such as those discussed in this paper, and in avoiding common mistakes, such as partitions between nonmutually exclusive component causes and summing causes to one hundred. In the meantime, it contains little jargon and no mathematics, so that the model is easily and intuitively accessible.\ngvwz | Although we use different words in various disciplines, we describe the same phenomena. The causal pie model can help to make bridges, so that various disciplines can draw on and be inspired by each other's finding. The range of examples that we give is a good demonstration of the utility of the causal pie model in this respect. We propose that the causal pie model provides an effective framework for thinking about causation, that it helps to avoid mistakes, and that it provides a simple common language in which results can be communicated across disciplines.\nsk5m | We thank Kenneth Rothman for an extraordinarily clear explanation of epidemiology during the Erasmus Summer Program two thousand twelve, which MJW attended, Marc Morrissey for directing us to specific literature, and two anonymous reviewers for helpful comments.\nqws8 | Conflict of Interest\n877u | None declared.",
