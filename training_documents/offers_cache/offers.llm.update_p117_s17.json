        "content": "ju0a | Guarantee Offer one hundred thirty sales, thirteen refunds P equals one hundred seventeen Net sales one hundred seventeen divided by ninety-five equals one point two three times (twenty-three percent increase)\ne4y0 | Don't be emotional, just do the math. For a guarantee to not be worth it, the increase in sales would have to be one hundred percent offset by people who refunded. So an absolute increase in sales of five percent would need to be offset by an absolute increase in refunds of five percent (but that might be a doubling of refunds, which is unlikely). So, for the most part, the stronger the guarantee, the higher the net increase in total purchases, even if the refund rate increases alongside it.\nkpra | Warning: While guarantees can be effective sellers, people who buy because of guarantees can become very shitty customers. A person who only buys because of a guarantee is a person who may not be willing to put in the work necessary to see success with your product or service. In a world where you want to reverse risk and get customers the best outcome possible, tying your guarantee to the things they need to do to be successful can help all parties.\negbi | Pro Tip: High Cost Services Warning\nbnhs | If you have a tremendous amount of cost associated with your product or service, you will likely want to employ a conditional guarantee or an ANTI guarantee, as you will have to eat the cost of the refund AND the cost of fulfilling.\nktv2 | Types of Guarantees\nwoy6 | \"IF YOU DON'T ACHIEVE X IN Y TIME WE WILL ...\n6xev | What makes a guarantee have power is a conditional statement: If you do not get X result in Y time period, we will Z. To give a guarantee teeth you have to decide what you'll do if they don't get the result. Without the \"or what\" portion of the guarantee, it sounds weak and diluted.\nu2ud | Note: This is what most marketers do.\n3qum | Bad Example: We will get you twenty clients guaranteed.\nobst | Better example: You will get twenty clients in your first thirty days, or we give you your money back plus your advertising dollars spent with us. This is a simple, but strong guarantee.\n3mg9 | Here are the four types of guarantees. I'll go over them in theory then we will apply them.\n4j8f | One) Unconditional Guarantees\ne3ba | As I stated earlier, there are unconditional, conditional, and \"anti-\" guarantees. Unconditional are the strongest guarantees. They're basically a trial where they pay first then see if they like it. This gets a LOT more people to buy, but you will have some people refund, especially as consumer culture continues to shift towards entitlement and zero accountability.\n8c0j | Two) Conditional Guarantees\nurfd | Conditional guarantees include \"terms and conditions\" to the guarantee. These are the ones you can get VERY creative on. In general, you want these to be \"better than money back\" guarantees. Because if they are going to make an investment, you want to match their investment psychologically with an equal or higher perceived commitment. These also can have a very powerful effect on getting clients results. If you know the key actions someone must take in order to be successful, make those part of the conditional guarantee. In a perfect world, one hundred percent of your customers would qualify for a conditional guarantee, but will have achieved their result, and therefore will not want to take it. That is an ideal we can all aspire towards. And just FYI - if given the option of getting a refund or getting the outcome they were promised the vast majority of people will take the outcome.\nwhtg | Three) Anti-Guarantees\n2u5k | Anti-guarantees are when you explicitly state \"all sales are final.\" You will want to own this position. You must come up with a creative \"reason why\" the sales are final. Typically, you'll want to show a massive exposure or vulnerability on your part that a consumer could immediately understand and think \"Yes, that makes sense.\" These types of guarantees are especially important with items that are consumable or massively diminish in value once given.\nf8wg | Four) Implied Guarantees\nhgz1 | Implied guarantees are any offer that is a performance-based offer. This comes in many different forms. Revshare, profitshare, triggers, ratchets, monetary bonuses, et cetera are all examples. The end all concept is the same, if I don't perform, I don't get paid. Unique to this particular structure, it also confers the upside of \"If I do a great job, I will be very well compensated.\" These only work in situations where you have transparency for measuring the outcome and trust (or control) that you will get compensated when you do perform.\nkhf5 | Stacking Guarantees\nya4d | An experienced salesman understands that, like bonuses, you can actually stack guarantees. For example, you could give an unconditional thirty-day no questions asked guarantee then on top of that give a conditional triple your money back ninety-day guarantee. That would be an example of stacking an unconditional with a conditional guarantee.\ndzub | You can also stack two conditional guarantees around different (or sequential) outcomes. For example, you'll make ten thousand dollars by sixty days, thirty thousand dollars by ninety days as long as you do thing one, two, and three. This future paces the prospect into an outcome they now believe is far more likely (since you will be deliberately spelling it out in a conditional guarantee with a timeline for achievement). Doing this shows the prospect you are serious about getting them results and convinced that they will achieve what they want. This shifts the burden of risk back from them onto us ... a very powerful strategy.\noidq | Let's go through some different guarantee examples:\nfp0u | Guarantee: If you don't achieve X, in Y time, we will [insert offer] . . .\n34lv | [Unconditional] \"No Questions Asked\" Refund Guarantee\ngmoh | What the Client Gets: A) a full refund, B) a fifty percent refund, C) a refund of their ad spend and any ancillary costs incurred, D) you pay for a competitor's program instead, E) you return their money plus an additional one thousand dollars (or other applicable amount)\n2xvo | My Take: This is about as simple as it gets. It's also very risky. You put yourself in a situation where if someone does not achieve the results, whether because of your fault or not, you will still be held accountable. Obviously this is a strong, but unoriginal guarantee. You can add conditions, but the more conditions you add, the faster this guarantee loses its teeth.\nfhh2 | Wording: I heard Jason Fladlien, who I referenced earlier, pitch his unconditional guarantee on a webinar and I thought it was unbelievable. These are one hundred percent his words and not my own. I take no credit for this but have included it for completeness.",
