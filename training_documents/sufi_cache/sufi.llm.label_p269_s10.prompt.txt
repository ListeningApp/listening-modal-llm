You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

06yq | Microdosing with psychedelics to self-medicate for ADHD symptoms in adults: A naturalistic study

2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

ph8j | 277
bemf | His intention was to get money and goods. What did he get?
s9l9 | His defence lawyer explained in Court. In every single one of the nine shops which he visited, identifying himself as the coun- cillor, he was assailed by complaints about the public services. 'At one stage, to get out of a shop, he even left his telephone number for a lady shop assistant to contact him about the transfer of a house.'
bs07 | He was found guilty of forgery and housebreaking: but the disparity between his expectation and the reality was due to the fact that he made assumptions about what would be likely to happen if he did certain things: and his ignorance was his undoing.
y6eq | If people know about the effects of these exercises, they do not need to ask such questions as we have here. If they do not, it cannot be explained to them better than through an allegory such as this, taken from real life.
0tl4 | I like the headline to the account. It is: 'The thief who stole another man's burden.'
vbq2 | IF IN DOUBT, HAVE THEM OUT
pfrt | Random exercises are more likely than not to have the effect which taking Mulla Nasrudin's advice would have had, in this example of his wisdom:
iws8 | 'Nasrudin, you are a man of experience,' said a philosopher; 'Have you heard of a cure for aching eyes? I read a lot, and mine are giving me trouble.'
n452 | 'All I can say is,' replied the Mulla, 'that I once had pain in two teeth. It did not stop until I had them both out.'

enir | On the Lines of a School
e4d4 | Q: When is a student in a school, and when is he only 'working on the lines of a school'?
d8ta | A: When you are in a school, and not working along the lines of a school, you are not effectively in a school at all, are you? If you are in a workshop and you are fast asleep, it is, effectively, a bedroom, is it not?
c9cw | When you are 'working on the lines of a school', you are in a school. The only kind of 'working' that I can think of in which it could be said that you are 'only working along lines' is if you are being imitative. For instance, I would call 'working on lines', as near as I can interpret the phrase, as 'pretending to do something'; as when one might be amusing oneself while imagining that one is doing something more useful or important. But I would not use your turn of phrase to describe this condition, since I assign a technical-term value to the word 'working'.
b93o | 'Working' means to me 'doing what a school does and not pre- tending to do it or inventing reasons or interpretations for it.' In this kind of working, it is the relationship between the people and the activity which constitutes 'The Work', and this work cannot but be along the right lines.
tjqy | If I wanted to look at this question so as to obtain some sort of study advantage from it, I would have to rephrase, and to make a general kind of statement, like:
58xg | 'People want to learn. What tends to prevent most of them, consequently at best providing considerable delays in learning, at worst a distorted kind of activity for personal and group amuse- ment, is the maintenance of disabling tendencies, manifested by greed to learn, lack of self-observation, desire for social esteem beyond a reasonable amount, reluctance to learn creating a desire to fantasise instead, personal over-valuation or impatience resulting in attempting to achieve irrelevant or premature target ..
70zf | 279
xnbe | Sufi study must be real, not imitation. 'Working on lines' is imitation.
uv86 | To be engaged in the work of a school, the student must be able to approach this definition, given by Abu'l-Hasan Nuri, that the aim is to achieve 'freedom and generosity and abandoning [unnecessary] burdens, weakness of mind and liberality with the world.'
gksi | As Hujwiri explains, this means that to attain to real Sufi status, freedom includes the leaving off of the influence of attachments - what we would call the effects of conditioning and meanness- and giving those things which belong to mundane estimation 'generously', as it would appear, to those who prize them.
oh7q | This is the 'reality without a name' in Abu'l-Hasan Fushanji's memorable cry, over a thousand years ago: 'Being a Sufi today is a name without a reality: and formerly it was a reality without a name.'
6gn8 | People constandy insist that, since information and knowledge about Sufi principles and practices are so widespread, all that is needed is to put them into practice.
yun5 | And yet one sees almost every day how the really sad thing about supposedly serious people is that they actually disdain to learn from things which they regard as trivial: but which have important lessons for them if they would only see. The fact is that they do not see, and that is why there has to be a real school, to make sure that all appropriate actions and teachings are ob- served.
vdx2 | The tale of the Emperor's New Clothes, of course, teaches that one should be able to learn from any source and not reject it when it is not interesting enough to you, or if it lacks a million dollars, or a PhD, or mighty arms, or a spiritual reputation . . .
4k9e | It is characteristic of humanity (which includes people trying to 'work on the lines of a school') that, while all necessary knowledge or information may be present, people either take no notice of it, or only adopt such parts as they please.
keds | 280
ugy5 | INFORMATION AND ACTION
yhw8 | This current example [The Times, London, 18 November 1976, p. 8, col 2/4] puts it in a nutshell. Just because it is about eating and not about other intakes, however, how many people will spot the parallel?
o7zq | The German Society for Nutrition checked 50,000 households to see how people ate. In spite of widespread public information about wrong diet and overeating, it was found that the damage done to health through wrong eating habits stands annually as DM 17,000 million (£4,250 million or $7,225 million). The damage done by smoking and drinking is only DM 3,000 million a year, in contrast. One West German in two is overweight. All categories of people get the wrong balance and quantities of calories and proteins. Only 10% of the populace are their correct weight. Almost everyone gets too few vitamins.
hqd5 | Like all the other parallels which one notes, this is not intended to single out a specific community-in this case Germans-for we may find similar, equivalent, data everywhere.

s1l7 | Conduct- Teaching
12yz | Q: We read about people spending time with Sufi teachers, and we know that Sufis may remain in contact with those who want to learn for periods of years. Many accounts of the lives and actions of Sufi teachers and their interactions with disciples and also members of the ordinary public have been constantly published, originally in the East, and more recently widely in the West. What is the purpose of the 'conduct teaching' of the Sufis, as distinct from the purpose of spiritual exercises or explanations and ad- monitions?
0xfx | A: Interaction-teaching between a teacher and a learner has many aspects. One which is perhaps the most readily grasped but very neglected in understanding by students is that the impacts, stimuli and activities devised by the Sufi are intended to illustrate behaviour and expose subjective reactions. Great Sufis 'shocked' people, for instance, to let them experience the narrowness of their own cast of mind. Sufis continue to shock narrow-minded people, though there is of course no guarantee that such people will benefit from this experience. Sometimes mere onlookers benefit instead. Remember that the definition of a learner is one who learns, not one who thinks that he is a student.
bg91 | How the Sufi goes about this programme, what he says and does, what he does not say or do, will depend upon local conditions, as you can see in the traditional literature. 'Sufism', as has been said by one of the ancient Sheikhs, 'was formerly imparted by signs alone'. This requires a learner who can read signs. Similarly, with the introduction of literature, experiences of one kind and another can be imparted, illustrated - and so on - by literature, or partially through the written and spoken word, as well as through conduct. Benefiting from this will depend upon whether the student is in alignment with the material. He generally is not, being too greedy for 'truth' and 'progress' to develop the basic calm and relative humility towards the materials to do more than 'consume' them, as
bsog | 282
o7e8 | emotional stimuli; which he could have done with anything.
xjy8 | Sheikh Ibrahim Gazur-Ilahi, among the Sufi directors, has emphasised that when the Teacher has finished his own journey, he repeats it again and again, each time with one learner. This is referred to as the analogy of the seed being in the plant, and the plant in the seed.
6746 | The 'conduct teaching' of the Sufis has to be adapted to the students, and cannot be a mechanical thing, applied to all people in exactly the same way.
r5zg | Q: But, since this information is so generally available, and is contained in the works of the great Sufi teachers, why do more people not seek it?
hk56 | A: This has always been a fact. It is answered today as always, by the observation:
29ac | 'The wise know because they have paid for their wisdom. You do not accept their counsel because it is offered for so much less than they have paid for it'.
no4d | Conduct-teaching has many other dimensions, after the stage of showing people to themselves. One might quote it as equivalent to the situation referred to by Blacken, when he said: 'A first-class laboratory is one in which mediocre scientists can produce out- standing work.' The conduct-situation enables people who have some potentiality to excel themselves. In this kind of situation, too, people are encouraged to learn in the manner in which they can do so, not in the manner which they try to impose on the subject. In the scientific parallel again, Mackay* says: 'We shall have to learn to refrain from doing things merely because we know how to do them.'
nh8n | Conduct-teaching is often reported in real and devised anec- dotes. Mulla Nasrudin stories often show this characteristic: re- flecting both the conduct of the wise and that of the stupid, in addition to their other and more internal dimensions.
ircn | One such story, designed to be used as a paradigm in life situa- tions, is this:
npsf | * Alan L. Mackay, The Harvest of a Quiet Eye, a Selection of Scientific Quotations, London Institute of Physics, 1977.
dynl | THE MAN-VINE
msij | Some men were planting vines, and Nasrudin asked them what they were doing.
8n3m | 'Digging these in so that they will produce fruit'
ech9 | That is exactly what I would like,' said the Mulla 'so please plant me and I will bear fruit.'
p94v | After as many objections as they could think of, the men were prevailed upon to do as Nasrudin asked.
gf1i | Not long afterwards they saw him walking about. One of them said:
rouh | We told you that you can't grow fruit by being planted like that.'
080i | 'You haven't proved it yet', said Nasrudin, 'for I only uprooted myself for a bit because I was cold-not because I'm not going to produce fruit'

tmlf | The Curriculum of a School
oy09 | Q: Could you give us a view of the curriculum of a School, from 'inside the School' so to speak?
wvb1 | A: In our teaching, we must group correctly these elements: the pupils, the teacher and the circumstances of study. Only at the right time and place, with the teacher suitable to these, and with the right body of students, can our studies be said to be capable of coherent development.
qi9a | Does this sound difficult or unreasonable? Let us compare these requirements with an analogy of our needs: the ordinary educa- tional institution.
r7ii | If we are learning, say, physics, we must have a man skilled in physics; students who want to learn and who have capacity and some background for the study; and adequate laboratories and other facilities for the studies to take place.
ezxx | A physics teacher could not make any real progress with a class of idiots, or people who primarily wanted power or fame or gain through physics. These factors would be getting in the way of the teaching. A class of brilliant students, faced with a man who knew no physics, or who only had a smattering, would make little progress. A good teacher, with a suitable student body, could do little unless the instruments and equipment, the building and so on, were available as and when needed.
zzb7 | If anything is strictly demanded by the teachers of the perpetual Higher Teaching, it is these requirements.
zts3 | Yet this principle, so well established in conventional studies of all kinds, is largely passed over and has fallen into disuse, among esotericists. Why? Because they have a primitive and unenlightened attitude towards teaching. Like an oaf who has just heard of physics or only seen some of its manifestations, the would-be student wants it all now. He does not care about the necessary
q5zo | 285
z20w | presence of other students. He wants to skip the curriculum and he sees no connection between the building and the subject of physics. So he does not want a laboratory.
ig3d | Just observe what happens when people try to carry on learning or teaching without the correa grouping of the three essentials:
dgts | Would-be students always try to operate their studies with only one, or at the most two, of the three factors. Teachers try to teach those who are unsuitable, because of the diffi- culties of finding enough people to form a class. Students who have no teacher try to teach themselves. Transpose this into a group of people trying to learn physics, and you will see some of their problems. Others group themselves around the literature and methodology of older schools, trying to make the scrap material of someone else's physics laboratory work. They formalise rituals, become obsessed by principles and slogans, assign disproportionate importance to the elements which are only tools, but which they regard as a more significant heritage.
p1zf | Anyone can think of several schools, cults, religions, systems of psychology or philosophy which fall into the above classifications.
k0wj | We must categorically affirm that it is impossible to increase human knowledge in the higher field by these methods. The statistical possibility of useful gains within a reasonable time is so remote as to be excluded from one's calculations.
p83v | Why, then, do people persist in raking over the embers and looking for truth when they have so little chance of finding it? Simply because they are using their conditioning propensity, not their capacity for higher perception, to try to follow the path. There is intellectual stimulus and emotional attraction in the mere effort to plumb the unknown. When the ordinary human mind encounters evidences of a higher state of being, or even when it conceives the possibility of them, it will invariably conclude that there is some possibility of progress for that mind without the application of the factors of teaching-teacher-students-time-and- place which are essentials.
5yts | Man has few alternatives in bis search for truth. He may rely
l1qt | upon his unaided intellect, and gamble that he is capable of per- ceiving truth or even the way to truth. This is a poor, but an attractive, gamble. Or he can gamble upon the claims of an in- dividual or institution which claims to have such a way. This gamble, too, is a poor one. Aside from a very few, men in general lack a sufficiently developed perception to tell them:
