You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

06yq | Microdosing with psychedelics to self-medicate for ADHD symptoms in adults: A naturalistic study
dpv6 | ARTICLE INFO
8r5j | ABSTRACT
2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

tfra | WORK AND WORK
5lm9 | Q: Why do Sufis expect people to do physical and mental work; why do they so often have establishments which have to be kept going by labour?
wp2c | 43
us5v | A: I first came across this question in myself, when I was living in a Sufi settlement where everyone had to work. There were so many important and influential - and moneyed - people who visited the place that I used to wonder why our Teacher did not 'professionalise' things, and employ gardeners and so on, rather than having so many people doing things that some of them were manifestly not accustomed to doing.
rs2m | I asked him one evening when he called for questions: There are people constandy offering large sums of money to us. Would it not give more opportunities for study if we used this money to run the establishment?'
uz9y | DEVELOPING ONE'S OWN UNDERSTANDING
8ov0 | As is the custom among Sufis, he told me to go away and find the answers myself, and then to come back when I had them, to see whether I was only asking frivolous questions. So I spent three or four weeks on the subject.
mj9m | First I wrote down all the possible reasons I could think of, then I wandered about looking at the way in which things were being done, studying life through life, until I came up with the answers. They were these, and by giving them to you I am doing you no favour, since if you had worked them out yourself you would have gained more. As it is, I will have to give you the opportunity of learning something equivalent by some other pro- cedure :
94h3 | Some people offer money as a substitute for action, and those need to learn that they can serve by greater humility. Hence money is not taken from them, in their own interests. Others may give or offer money and it may be accepted, but it is the Teacher who decides how it shall be used, and students are not able to suggest a study or organisational programme when they are there to learn.
9jx1 | Again, having a working framework means that people can learn all kinds of things which cannot be learnt in the ordinary world, and which are vital to their ability to understand concepts and experiences of an extra dimensional nature. For instance, if you want to get something done in ordinary terrestrial terms, you
c3lz | may have to have a hierarchical system. This, in turn, may allow people to exercise a latent desire for power which may not be indicated in them. How are you to improve such people if you are in fact encouraging that tendency? You have to work with whom you have, and therefore the kind of organisation must afford opportunities for exercising good characteristics and starving negative ones.
8bwk | This cannot be done in an atmosphere where matters are run on the fuels (greed, hope, fear) which are essential to compel people to act and keep acting in the outside world. If, again, you take money from certain people, they (not you) may imagine inwardly that they have 'bought' something. This can encourage their desire for preferment. It can also, on the contrary, cause the person to feel that he or she is not pulling his weight and that he has just purchased his passage, as it were. This is not good for anyone either.
ez9s | Further, there are always the people who offer money and when you take it assume that you have used it for yourself. People should not be placed in a position where their worst characteristics, in this case suspicion, are exercised. It is one thing to create a situation where people can observe their own undesirable charac- teristics working, but it is quite another to produce one in which they have this subconscious canker, perhaps not ever exteriorising it.
mqot | That would make such a person worse, not better. That is just as bad as the implied moral blackmail where you appear like a saint, in order to make them feel respect or that they are un- worthy. Incidentally, it is for the last-named reason that Sufis refuse to exercise pressure on people by moral persuasion, which accords with modern discoveries in psychology, though historically we find that it was very little understood in most cultures. It still remains the main source of hypocrisy.

gipz | Conflicting Texts
b4wj | Q: Some Sim texts seem to show that a person should be disciplined and dedicated, others that he should be critical and objective. How can these be reconciled?
5xlt | ARE ALL LINES STRAIGHT?
9bz4 | A: In exacdy the same way as, say, mathematics can be recon- ciled if it is asked 'One book says all right angles are ninety degrees, but Einstein says that there is no such thing as a straight line, all lines are curved, hence there are no right angles'. You are mixing up two treatments of the same subject, treatments which depend upon the area in which you are working or the degree of advancement of the student, or both.
yfv2 | If the student is unable to adopt both disciplined and also critical postures, both linear and holistic thinking, he will not be able to perceive that which is to be perceived. Shabistari makes this point when he teaches that people have to be flexible and to find the path between extremes and opposites: '[The Seeker is] always balanced between rejection and faith.'
pujl | USE AND ABUSE OF HABIT OF MIND
3rqe | Habit of mind is at one and the same time one of the most useful and most useless instruments in approaching problems. If you choose the right approach, you may solve the problem. But if you cannot choose it, and only obey it, you may not be using the best habit for the purpose.
nsi3 | The habit which possesses present-day thinking is generally to assume that a disciplined approach will solve all problems. This is run a close second by its opposite: the beguiling but equally par- tial belief that if discipline is lost, insights are gained. In the story of the moth and the spider, entitled 'Scientific Advance' in my The Magic Monastery, you can see why neither approach when
nil3 | 46
68a1 | adopted as certain to provide a solution, will succeed in areas where the mechanical mind or the incoherent one, dominate thinking.
seik | The would-be Sufi needs guidance precisely because books, texts, while telling you what is needed, do not tell you when. Think of the proverb: "Words have to die if humans are to live.'
oq7c | Self-Deception
z4mi | Q: Can you mention something hurtful?
hkft | A: Surely most people can do that.
jai3 | To me, it is hurtful to have to deal with people whom you would like to teach when - pretending to themselves that they seek knowledge - they only want a social community, friendship, 'togetherness', attention and the like.
p57i | All these things are delightful: and all the more delightful when consciously indulged in, rather than found by means of deception. Deception in this case is pretending to oneself that one is studying when one is seeking stimuli.
u5ug | Such people may have the capacity to learn. But they overlay it with shallow aims. They may have been trained to seek smaller satisfactions and to give them grand names. They may, on the other hand, simply be carrying on the demands of babyhood. Rumi said: "When will you cease coveting nuts and raisins?'
i9k5 | The condition can be so well established that people are to all intents and purposes unconscious of its presence.
20z2 | UNDERMINING LOWER ASPIRATIONS
4cgs | Sufis jolt people from this 'sleep'. Such shocks are often experi- enced as hurtful - until they take effect, when we are always grateful that we have been allowed to encounter them. What is in fact hurtful to humanity does not necessarily feel hurtful at the time. Self-deception is the chief of these.
htre | When something real is being studied, lower aims will tend to vanish, and so will the hurtfulness of the effect of the lower pre- occupation's being assailed. As Sheikh Gazur-i-Ilahi says, in his Irskadat, if the development by means of the Sufi Way is pro- found enough, defects of thinking vanish, having nothing to sustain them.
da3c | It is not a question of where you go, or whether you join a
890q | group. It is a question of whether you have been correctly pre- pared to learn how to learn.
jomo | THE HOUSE AND THE LORD OF THE HOUSE
06fi | Bayazid Bistami emphasised the different ranges in perception of Truth when he said that the first time he visited the Kaaba at Mecca, he saw the Kaaba. The second time he saw the Lord of the Kaaba. The third time he saw neither of these, not the Kaaba nor the Lord of the Kaaba.
hb4s | Journeys to the East
cqq2 | Q: Do you want us to go to the East, or to join Sufi groups?
1ews | A: I have said and written so much about Sufism and the Sufis that some people imagine that I am trying to influence them to join a cult or a religious grouping.
afyn | It is, in fact, not possible for me to mount such a campaign, as I will now explain to you.
8sye | Hearing and reading what I have had to say about the Sufis has caused hordes of the religious-minded to flow towards the often grotesque versions of Sufism in the East. It has also, with equal force, caused masses of the curious and greedy to flock around the guru-ist cults of the West.
r04h | This leaves those who are uninformed, those who want to learn more of what Sufism is, and those who are unconcerned.
orpr | This operation has been highly successful, but this part of it has had no higher function for the majority than any other instru- ment which sorts things - or people - out.
k36m | THE AIM AND THE DESTINATION
wnuz | A mere journey to the East generally has the effect of the jingle: 'Two men looked out from prison bars/One saw mud, the other stars.' What is the wayfarer like, quite apart from the road or the destination? Sheikh Saadi reminds us: 'I fear that you will not reach Mecca, O Traveller, for you are on the road to Turkestan!'
sy14 | Take heart from the fact that this tendency to wander about looking for knowledge, and to set off for distant destinations (sup- posedly for knowledge but in reality just to get moving) is a very human tendency. There are plenty of examples of it and of its consequences, in my Tales of the Dervishes, and how this charac- teristic cropped up again and again in the lives of the classical Sufis and their disciples.
ghss | So we have to assess who it is that is proposing to go to The
3s61 | East, when this person wants to go, with whom - if anyone - and to where.
s3rm | More people go to the East and find nothing than ever realise guy heart's desire, because they do not know how to structure their enterprise.
pqxb | CAN YOU WAIT 150 YEARS?
08qc | Have you heard how Mulla Nasrudin heard that some parrots live to 150 years-and bought a young one to check whether this would turn out to be true?
hdj2 | 'Joining Sufi groups' is unlikely to be useful to people who find groups that they have the option to 'join', without being ad- mitted after assessment as to whether they could usefully join.
a57g | One would have to know about the 'Sufi group' before giving an answer which implied that people are likely to encounter real Sufi groups among the derivative 'orders' or 'schools' or "teachers' which have set themselves up publicly ...
g8m3 | VARIETY OF STATEMENTS
a9av | Whether studying in groups or travelling to the East, or whether otherwise engaged, I note that not many people seem to heed a wide enough variety of Sufi statements.
73l3 | One such which would repay deeper study before searching is the advice of the iUuminate Mumshad Dinwari:
ornm | You learn, he says, by association with a realised teacher. But you can gain nothing from such a person if you bring a sense of personal pride.
u2z1 | The widespread compulsion to do things for which one is not fitted, and also to assume that one's choice of action is appropriate, is seen everywhere, in all epochs.
atmh | THE LEGLESS BURGLAR
7hgg | In the contemporary world there is an excellent opportunity to see this working in the human behaviour reported in the daily and *Recorded in his TadhMrat al-Awltyya by Faridudin Attar.
xwsv | weekly Press. Take this almost random example. It shows be- haviour which underlies such things as unthinking group-joining or journeys to the East. Are they the product of spiritual aspira- tions or of sheer non-thinking elevated into a virtue?
756b | A cat-burglar, who climbed girders and houses to steal, and who carried out at least forty-one thefts, was caught and brought to court. Of course he was caught, in spite of his great skill: because he happened to have no legs, having had diem amputated years before .*

7wzm | What a Sufi Teacher Looks Like
e9xj | Q: How should a teacher appear to the students, according to the Sufis?
9vl6 | THE BRICK AND THE HOUSE
c2fd | A: This question, like so many others which assume that they can be usefully answered in a few words, reminds me of a story about Mulla Nasrudin. Someone asked him what his house was like, basically. In reply he brought this man a brick, saying: 'It is just a collection of these.' What the fool may do without realising it is foolish, the wise man may have to do or say in order to show how unthinking the question is.
jzvp | How can you say what a teacher should look like? The most one can do is to make a few remarks about it.
f71y | What is so perplexing to conditioned attitudes about the Sufis is that, unlike teachers of other kinds, they refuse to stick to one kind of appearance. As an example, if you go to see a Sufi divine, he may not look, talk or act like a mystical master at all. This is because he says either: 'You can teach only by the method indicated for each pupil, and you may have to teach by what seems to him unlikely'; or else because he says: 'There is a time and a place and certain company. According to these, we will teach. When it is a time to be serious, we will be serious. When it is a time to work through what looks like ordinary things, we have to do so.'
31e1 | So important is this lesson that it can be said to go before all others: in the sense that failure to know this can prevent you from learning more - and can leave you attached to the externals of hypocrites. This includes, of course, unconscious hypocrites.
40ry | If the Sufis are right in their claim that time affects behaviour, and that personal appearance should change (and even tempera- ment) then obviously all the people who cultivate a reverend appearance, and all those who acquire it, mistaking this for spirituality, are wrong.
d1j2 | 53
wstc | It is this unspoken contradiction which makes it almost im- possible for people who want continuity and easily identifiable teaching figures, to accept the change in circumstances and atti- tudes which the Sufi Way demands.
ba1e | These people, of course, will not have thought it out like this. All they know is that 'A holy man must seem holy to me'; or 'If he always behaves in the same manner, or always exhorts me to the same things, I believe that he may be right'.
en95 | The other problem is that the observer is confusing, as he is bound to confuse without having understood, continuity and con- sistency with reliability or truth. Because butter always tastes the same when it looks the same, he expects a similar 'reliability' in his spiritual teacher. He is, of course, self-deceived in this as- sumption.
