You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

hy0l | where HHV H2> WV CH4> PH,STP, and PCHA,STP denote the higher heating value of hydrogen (3.54 kWh/m3), the working gas volume of natural gas in the storage system at STP, and the density of hydrogen and methane at STP, respectively. PH2,res and PCHA,res refer to the hydrogen and methane density at pressure and temperature when the reservoir is full (Pmax). However, estimates on the operating gas pressure Pmin / max are not publicity available and we, therefore, estimate the maximum gas operation pressure to be 70% of the overburden pressure in accordance with Foh et al. (1979). In Eq. 3, the product of the density ratio is utilized for the conversion of reported methane working gas volumes at STP to hydrogen gas volumes at STP. However, our data suggest that a constant conversion parameter of 0.85 can be used over a range of temperatures and pressures relevant to underground gas storage, as shown in Table 2. The results are summarized in Table 2 and Figure 3. At present, there are 16 underground pore storage facilities installed in Germany that have total installed capacity of around 8 bcm of natural gas with a thermal energy content of 95.244 TWh, estimated using a higher heating value of 11.07 kWh/m3 for methane. This represents about one-third of the total underground storage capacity of natural gas in Germany. The remaining natural gas is stored in 272 salt caverns. In contrast, the corresponding hydrogen storage capacity is lower, amounting to around 7 bcm of hydrogen gas with a thermal energy content of 25 TWh, given its lower energy content per volume (3.54 kWh/m3). The distribution of these pore storages is shown in Figure 3. Hence, more volume is needed to store the same amount of energy compared to natural gas and other common fuels. Furthermore, decommissioned pore storage facilities could potentially provide an additional storage potential of 1 bcm of hydrogen or 4 TWh of hydrogen energy equivalent. Hence a total of 8 bcm of hydrogen, which amounts to 29 TWh of hydrogen energy equivalent could be stored in current and former UGS pore storage systems. Figure 3 shows the distribution of all pore storage (active and inactive) and compares it to the planned network expansion initiative IPCEI.
4jmz | 4.2 Theoretical hydrogen storage capacity in saline aquifers
b7cq | Additional underground storage capacities may become available in saline aquifers that hold the highest storage potential due to their widespread occurrence. In order to assess the hydrogen storage capacity in saline aquifers, we employ the volumetric assessment of CO2 storage capacities in saline aquifers, as previously conducted by Knopf and May (2017). This probabilistic approach yields a proven, median, and
0b39 | possible CO2 storage capacity of 20.4 Gt (P10), 49.1 Gt (P50), and 115.3 Gt (P90) for all evaluated rock units (onshore and offshore; green shaded areas in Figure 3), respectively. Most of these resources are located in the North German Basin with estimated CO2 storage capacities ranging from 19.3 Gt (P10)-108.6 Gt (P90) (Knopf and May, 2017). By applying this data, we can estimate the thermal hydrogen energy content using
qecd | EH2 = Mco2 X HHVH2 X RG X Pco2 PH2 ,
1o7p | (4)
cp13 | where EH2 is the energy content of hydrogen (in PWh), Mco2 is the mass of stored CO2 (in Gt), HHVH2 is the higher heating value of hydrogen (39.4 kWh/kg), RG is the recoverable working gas volume (i.e., portion of the working gas volume: 0.4-0.6), and the ratio PH2 is used to convert the mass of stored CO2 to the mass PCO2 of stored hydrogen. Knopf and May (2017) set an upper vertical limit of 800 m (Reinhold et al., 2011) in their analysis, at which
bgre | CO2 is typically subjected to temperatures and pressures that preserve CO2 in a supercritical state. At these conditions the resulting CO2 densities are two orders of magnitude greater compared to gaseous H2 (Figure 1). The CO2 storage capacity can therefore be converted to the mass of stored hydrogen, MH2 (in Gt), based on a conversion factor of 0.01 (i.e., Pco) PH2 = 0.01; Figure 2C). Hence, saline aquifers may yield an additional capacity of 81.6 (Mt)-691.8 (Mt) working gas volume of hydrogen resulting in 3.2-27.3 PWh of hydrogen energy equivalent, but almost all of these storage capacities are restricted to the North German Basin, which may hold 3.0-25.7 PWh of hydrogen energy equivalent. Nevertheless, one should keep in mind that these estimates represent theoretical capacities, and the extent to which these reserves can actually be used should be verified based on the storage criteria proposed here, but will also depend on technical, economic, environmental, and social aspects and requires further analysis.
57lp | 5 Discussion
ukth | 5.1 Storage capacities and requirements in Europe
kpvt | Existing and decommissioned underground pore storage facilities may account for up to 30 TWh of energy equivalent of hydrogen, but are unlikely to meet future storage requirements of 34-667 TWh (Lux et al., 2022), not least because an overall conversion of all storage facilities from natural gas to hydrogen is unlikely. To meet these future storage requirements, additional capacities may be needed in the form of depleted hydrocarbon fields and saline aquifers. Approximately 3.2-27.3 PWh of hydrogen energy equivalent could be stored in saline aquifers in Germany, which is comparable to the technical storage potential in salt caverns that has been estimated at 35.7 PWh (Caglayan et al., 2020) and similar to the hydrogen storage potential in saline aquifers in the UK with an estimated capacity of 2.1 PWh of energy equivalent of hydrogen (Scafidi et al., 2021). In practice, many of the storage sites may, however, prove unsuitable, given the technical, economic and social constraints or not least because of the increasing competition between different geotechnical applications, be it geothermal energy or storage of natural gas, CO2, or hydrogen (Suchi et al., 2014).
