You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

xags | 4 MODEL DETAILS
jc47 | Table 1 lists the hyper-parameters and network architectures. We use log magnitude spectrogram with Hann windowing, 50 ms frame length, 12.5 ms frame shift, and 2048-point Fourier transform. We also found pre-emphasis (0.97) to be helpful. We use 24 kHz sampling rate for all experiments.
ko3c | We use <LATEX>r = 2</LATEX> (output layer reduction factor) for the MOS results in this paper, though larger <LATEX>r</LATEX> values (e.g. <LATEX>\left. r = 5 \right)</LATEX> also work well. We use the Adam optimizer (Kingma & Ba, 2015) with learning rate decay, which starts from 0.001 and is reduced to 0.0005, 0.0003, and 0.0001 after 500K, 1M and <LATEX>2 M</LATEX> global steps, respectively. We use a simple €1 loss for both seq2seq decoder (mel-scale spectrogram) and post-processing net (linear-scale spectrogram). The two losses have equal weights.
xek3 | We train using a batch size of 32, where all sequences are padded to a max length. It's a com- mon practice to train sequence models with a loss mask, which masks loss on zero-padded frames. However, we found that models trained this way don't know when to stop emitting outputs, causing repeated sounds towards the end. One simple trick to get around this problem is to also reconstruct the zero-padded frames.
bbpr | EXPERIMENTS
5zyf | We train Tacotron on an internal North American English dataset, which contains about 24.6 hours of speech data spoken by a professional female speaker. The phrases are text normalized, e.g. "16" is converted to "sixteen".
9own | 5.1 ABLATION ANALYSIS
bqfb | We conduct a few ablation studies to understand the key components in our model. As is common for generative models, it's hard to compare models based on objective metrics, which often do not correlate well with perception (Theis et al., 2015). We mainly rely on visual comparisons instead. We strongly encourage readers to listen to the provided samples.
wwdt | First, we compare with a vanilla seq2seq model. Both the encoder and decoder use 2 layers of residual RNNs, where each layer has 256 GRU cells (we tried LSTM and got similar results). No pre-net or post-processing net is used, and the decoder directly predicts linear-scale log magnitude spectrogram. We found that scheduled sampling (sampling rate 0.5) is required for this model to learn alignments and generalize. We show the learned attention alignment in Figure 3. Figure 3(a) reveals that the vanilla seq2seq learns a poor alignment. One problem is that attention tends to
mn1r | get stuck for many frames before moving forward, which causes bad speech intelligibility in the synthesized signal. The naturalness and overall duration are destroyed as a result. In contrast, our model learns a clean and smooth alignment, as shown in Figure 3(c).
5vqw | Second, we compare with a model with the CBHG encoder replaced by a 2-layer residual GRU encoder. The rest of the model, including the encoder pre-net, remain exactly the same. Comparing Figure 3(b) and 3(c), we can see that the alignment from the GRU encoder is noisier. Listening to synthesized signals, we found that noisy alignment often leads to mispronunciations. The CBHG encoder reduces overfitting and generalizes well to long and complex phrases.
meyw | Figures 4(a) and 4(b) demonstrate the benefit of using the post-processing net. We trained a model without the post-processing net while keeping all the other components untouched (except that the decoder RNN predicts linear-scale spectrogram). With more contextual information, the prediction from the post-processing net contains better resolved harmonics (e.g. higher harmonics between bins 100 and 400) and high frequency formant structure, which reduces synthesis artifacts.
2e62 | 5.2 MEAN OPINION SCORE TESTS
75y3 | We conduct mean opinion score tests, where the subjects were asked to rate the naturalness of the stimuli in a 5-point Likert scale score. The MOS tests were crowdsourced from native speakers.
s2g2 | 100 unseen phrases were used for the tests and each phrase received 8 ratings. When computing MOS, we only include ratings where headphones were used. We compare our model with a para- metric (based on LSTM (Zen et al., 2016)) and a concatenative system (Gonzalvo et al., 2016), both of which are in production. As shown in Table 2, Tacotron achieves an MOS of 3.82, which outperforms the parametric system. Given the strong baselines and the artifacts introduced by the Griffin-Lim synthesis, this represents a very promising result.
q1q2 | 6 DISCUSSIONS
cb7r | We have proposed Tacotron, an integrated end-to-end generative TTS model that takes a character sequence as input and outputs the corresponding spectrogram. With a very simple waveform syn- thesis module, it achieves a 3.82 MOS score on US English, outperforming a production parametric system in terms of naturalness. Tacotron is frame-based, so the inference is substantially faster than sample-level autoregressive methods. Unlike previous work, Tacotron does not need hand- engineered linguistic features or complex components such as an HMM aligner. It can be trained from scratch with random initialization. We perform simple text normalization, though recent ad- vancements in learned text normalization (Sproat & Jaitly, 2016) may render this unnecessary in the future.
68xu | We have yet to investigate many aspects of our model; many early design decisions have gone unchanged. Our output layer, attention module, loss function, and Griffin-Lim-based waveform synthesizer are all ripe for improvement. For example, it's well known that Griffin-Lim outputs may have audible artifacts. We are currently working on fast and high-quality neural-network-based spectrogram inversion.
