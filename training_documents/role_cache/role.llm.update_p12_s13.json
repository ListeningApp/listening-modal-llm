        "content": "me84 | Y one H assay\no56m | The CDS of MdERF three and MdERF one hundred eighteen were ligated into the PJG four dash five vector in restriction enzyme sites Eco R one and Xho one. MdPME two, MdPGLR three and MdACO four were ligated into the Placzi vector in restriction enzyme sites Eco R one and Xho one, Kpn one and Xho one, and Kpn one and Xho one, respectively. The CDS of MdDof five point three and MdRAVL one were ligated into the PJG four dash five vector using restriction enzyme sites Eco R one and Xho one. MdERF three and MdERF one hundred eighteen were ligated into the Placzi vector, using restriction enzyme sites Eco R one and Xho one. All primers used are listed in Table S sixteen.\nslz6 | EMSA\n90k5 | The proteins of MdDof five point three and MdRAVL one were induced at thirty-seven degrees Celsius for six hours. Proteins were purified as described by Li. Oligonucleotide probes were synthesized and labelled with biotin. The biotin end-labelled double-stranded D N A probes were prepared by annealing complementary oligonucleotides as follows: the oligonucleotides were heated at ninety-five degrees Celsius for five minutes, then seventy-two degrees Celsius for twenty minutes, and immediately left to cool to room temperature before use. The biotin-labelled MdERF three promoter and MdERF one hundred eighteen primer sequences are shown in Table S sixteen.\n9m8s | Y two H assay\n893y | The CDS region of MdERF three was ligated into the pGADT seven vector using the Eco R one and Xho one restriction sites as described previously. The full-length MdERF one hundred eighteen, one through three hundred forty-four amino acids, was ligated into the pGBKT seven binding domain vector using the Eco R one and Sal one sites. The primers used are shown in Table S sixteen. B D and A D vectors were co-transformed into the Y two H Gold yeast strain. The interactions between two proteins were detected using the Matchmaker Gold Y two H library screening system.\nfavz | Bi F C assay\n7szx | The full-length CDS of MdERF three or MdERF one hundred eighteen without stop codon was amplified and ligated into p S P Y N E dash thirty-five S and p S P Y C E dash thirty-five S vectors containing green fluorescent protein, using the one-step seamless cloning kit; the constructs were checked by sequencing and then transformed into A. tumefaciens strain G V three one zero one. Two plasmids were co-transformed into the abaxial side of four- to six-week-old N. benthamiana leaves to detect specific interactions as described previously. After forty-eight hours co-infiltration, the N. benthamiana leaves were observed using an L S M five ten dash Meta confocal laser microscope. G F P signals were imaged under four hundred eighty-eight nanometer excitation wavelength.\nhx9e | Kompetitive allele-specific P C R, K A S P, genotyping and G A P modelling\nywn2 | Three hundred hybrids were randomly selected from each F one population of 'Zisai Pearl' x 'Red Fuji', 'Zisai Pearl' x 'Golden\na63r | Delicious', and 'Jonathan' x 'Golden Delicious'. All these hybrids were genotyped for the fifty-six markers, twenty-nine for flesh firmness retainability and twenty-seven for flesh crispness retainability, using KASP assay. The two hundred base pair sequences flanking the interested SNPs were used for K A S P primer design. The KASP primers are listed in Table S seven. The K A S P assay was performed using the L G C SNPline and the data were analysed using SNPviewer software. The D N A of parental cultivars, 'Jonathan', 'Golden Delicious', 'Zisai Pearl', and 'Red Fuji', were used as control in K A S P assay, because the marker genotypes of these cultivars were already known by previous parental re-sequencing.\ndqvj | Marker genotype effect was estimated by the deviation between the average O P V of the hybrids with the same genotype and overall mean phenotype value of the training populations. By using hybrids without missing marker genotype data, the G P V was calculated by sum up the genotype effects of all markers and population mean phenotype value. The prediction accuracy of G P V was evaluated by the Pearson's correlation coefficient between G P V and O P V of the hybrids. Fivefold cross-validation, run five times, was used to test the accuracy of the G A P models.\nr17u | Statistical analysis\n3c47 | Significant differences were analysed using the independent samples Student's T test. Asterisks denoted significance: P is less than zero point zero five, P is less than zero point zero one. Error bars indicate standard deviation of three biological replicates, each containing at least three technical replicates.\ng345 | Accession numbers\nsvhz | Sequence data were based on online databases. All B S A dash seq and R N A dash seq raw data have been deposited in the N C B I Sequence Read Archive under the accession number P R J N A six five zero five nine two. The accession numbers for the genes in this study are as follow: MdPME two MD zero two G one two zero seven nine zero zero, MdPGLR three MD zero three G one two six zero seven zero zero, MdACO four MD one six G one zero one nine nine zero zero, MdDOF five point three MD eleven G one one two three four zero zero, MdRAVL one MD one six G one zero four seven seven zero zero, MdERF three MD zero three G one one nine four three zero zero and MdERF one hundred eighteen MD one六 G one zero四 three五 zero zero.\noaen | This work was supported by the earmarked fund of the China Agriculture Research System, C A R S dash twenty-seven, and was partially funded by Qinhuangdao Beidaihe Zhongbaolvdu Agriculture Research Center.
