You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

k5r6 | Least altered volcanic rocks from the Tinakula deposit range from basaltic andesite and andesite to dacite, with basaltic andesite most abundant within and near the volcanic cones. Representative whole-rock geochemical analyses of altered volcaniclastic rocks from drill core are given in Table 4, with the associated alteration assemblages indicated. The least altered host rocks, described by Anderson (2018), were iden- tified petrographically by a lack of alteration minerals, loss on ignition (LOI) <1.2 wt %, low base metal values (<183 ppm Cu + Zn + Pb), and no obvious Na2O depletion (>4.0 wt %). Data for the three least altered basaltic andesite samples lie on linear trends, with those for the altered samples in plots of TiO2 versus Zr and TiO2 versus Al2O3 (Fig. 13). Excursions from this linear trend (e.g., Zr >160 ppm at ~1.5 wt % TiO2; Fig. 13A) may reflect variability in the parental rock compo- sitions, as volcanic rocks in this area show progressive frac- tionation from basaltic andesite to andesite (e.g., Anderson, 2018). The concentration ranges of immobile and mobile ele- ments for each alteration assemblage are shown in Figure 14. The narrow range of concentrations of Zr, Y, Sc, Nb, Ti, and Al reflect the fact that these elements are least mobile. Concen- trations of Ba, Si, Al, Fe, S, Mg, Ca, Na, and K show signifi- cant variation, consistent with their inferred mobility during hydrothermal alteration. High Ba, Ca, and S(T) reflect the abundance of barite and anhydrite/gypsum in the samples. High Fe2O3(T) and S(T) are related to pyrite occurrence. Illite- smectite alteration is characterized by relative enrichments in
z9v9 | K2O compared to the least altered basaltic andesite, whereas chamosite + corrensite alteration is dominated by MgO addi- tion. The bulk compositions are transitional between illite/ smectite + pyrite to illite/smectite + chamosite to chamosite + corrensite end members (Fig. 15).
gpu9 | The chondrite-normalized REE profiles for the altered volcaniclastic rocks and the least altered basaltic andesite samples (Fig. 16) show pronounced positive Eu anomalies, as Eu becomes concentrated in hydrothermal fluids after it is released from plagioclase during water-rock interactions. Smectite-rich assemblages (nontronite/montmorillonite and nontronite + corrensite) show slight REE depletion and have flat profiles. The illite/smectite + pyrite assemblage displays significant light REE (LREE) enrichment and steeper pro- files, whereas the chamosite-rich assemblages (illite/smec- tite + chamosite and chamosite + corrensite) show moderate LREE enrichment and flat profiles. The change in slope of the LREEs during the main stage of alteration (illite/smec- tite + pyrite) relative to the least altered rock indicates strong mobility. In contrast, the heavy REEs (HREEs) have slopes similar to those of the least altered rocks, which indicates that they are immobile during hydrothermal alteration. The HREEs are simply moved up or down relative to the least altered values due to the total mass gain or loss of the rock during alteration.
u5ws | Major element mass changes were calculated for all altera- tion assemblages following the single precursor method of MacLean and Barrett (Maclean, 1990; Maclean and Barrett, 1993; Barrett and MacLean, 1999) using the average concen- tration of the three least altered samples as the precursor. In this method, the ratio of the concentration of an immobile element in an altered rock to the concentration of that ele- ment in the least altered precursor is proportional to the total mass change in the rock due to hydrothermal alteration. We used the proportion of the least mobile element, Zr, in the precursor sample relative to the altered sample to calculate
