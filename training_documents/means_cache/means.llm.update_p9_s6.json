        "content": "1i8b | We can now see that the B-values for the two dummy variables represent the differences between these adjusted means four point seven one minus two point nine three equals one point seven eight for Dummy one and five point one five minus two point nine three equals two point two two for Dummy two). These adjusted means are the average amount of happiness for each group at the mean level of love of puppies. Some people think of this kind of model (i.e., ANCOVA) as 'controlling' for the covariate, because it compares the predicted group means at the average value of the covariate, so the groups are being compared at a level of the covariate that is the same for each group. However, as we shall see, the 'controlling for the covariate' analogy is not a good one.\n5sfj | Output thirteen point two\nvk4h | Thirteen point four Assumptions and issues in ANCOVA\nnsm3 | Including covariates doesn't change the fact we're using the general linear model, so all the sources of potential bias (and counteractive measures) discussed in Chapter six apply. There are two additional considerations: (one) independence of the covariate and treatment effect; and (two) homogeneity of regression slopes.\njdfw | Thirteen point four point one Independence of the covariate and treatment\nuc9r | IIII\nl0ap | effect\nx815 | I said in the previous section that covariates can be used to reduce within-group error variance if the covariate explains some of this error variance, which will be the case if the covariate is independent of the experimental effect (group means). Figure thirteen point two shows three different scenarios. Part A shows a basic model that compares group means (it is like Figure twelve point five). The variance in the outcome (in our example happiness) can be partitioned into two parts that represent the experimental or treatment effect (in this case the administration of puppy therapy) and the error or unexplained variance (i.e., factors that affect happiness that we haven't measured). Part B shows the ideal scenario when including a covariate, which is that the covariate shares its variance only with the bit of happiness that is currently unexplained. In other words, it is completely independent of the treatment effect (it does not overlap with the effect of puppy therapy at all). Some argue that this scenario is the only one in which ANCOVA is appropriate. Part C shows a situation in which the effect of the covariate overlaps with the experimental effect. In other words, the experimental effect is confounded with the effect of the covariate. In this situation, the covariate will reduce (statistically speaking) the experimental effect because it explains some of the variance that would otherwise be attributable to the experiment. When the covariate and the experimental effect (independent variable) are not independent, the treatment effect is obscured, spurious treatment effects can arise, and at the very least the interpretation of the ANCOVA is seriously compromised.\nepbj | The problem of the covariate and treatment sharing variance is common and is ignored or misunderstood by many people. Miller and Chapman are not the only people to point this out, but their paper is very readable and they cite many examples of people misapplying ANCOVA. Their main point is that when treatment groups differ on the covariate, putting the covariate into the analysis will not 'control for' or 'balance out' those differences. This situation arises mostly when participants are not randomly assigned to experimental treatment conditions. For example, anxiety and depression are closely correlated (anxious people tend to be depressed), so if you wanted to compare an anxious group of people against a non-anxious group on some task, the chances are that the anxious group would also be more depressed than the non-anxious group. You might think that by adding depression as a covariate into the analysis you can look at the 'pure' effect of anxiety, but you can't. This situation matches part C of Figure thirteen point two because the effect of the covariate (depression) would contain some of the variance from the effect of anxiety. Statistically speaking, all that we know is that anxiety and depression share variance; we cannot separate this shared\nnmn2 | variance into 'anxiety variance' and 'depression variance', it will always be shared. Another common example is if you happen to find that your experimental groups differ in their ages. Placing age into the analysis as a covariate will not solve this problem - it is still confounded with the experimental manipulation. The use of covariates cannot solve this problem.\ng3tm | This problem can be avoided by randomizing participants to experimental groups, or by matching experimental groups on the covariate (in our anxiety example, you could try to find participants for the low-anxiety group who score high on depression). We can see whether this problem is likely to be an issue by checking whether experimental groups differ on the covariate before fitting the model. To use our anxiety example again, we could test whether our high-and low-anxiety groups differ on levels of depression. If the groups do not\ntfra | significantly differ then we might consider it reasonable to use depression as a covariate.\n5lm9 | The treatment effect and covariate are simply predictor variables in a general linear model, yet despite several hundred pages discussing linear models, I haven't before mentioned that predictors should be completely independent. I've said that they shouldn't overlap too much (e.g., collinearity) but that's quite different from saying that they shouldn't overlap at all. If, in general, we don't care about predictors being independent in linear models, why should we care now? The short answer is we don't - there is no statistical requirement for the treatment variable and covariate to be independent.\nwp2c | However, there are situations in which ANCOVA can be biased when the covariate is not independent of the treatment variable. One situation, common in medical research, has been discussed a lot: an outcome (e.g., hypertension) is measured at baseline, and after a treatment intervention (with participants assigned to a treatment or control group). This design can be analyzed using an ANCOVA in which treatment effects on post-intervention hypertension are analyzed while covarying baseline levels of hypertension. In this scenario the independence of treatment and covariate variables means that baseline levels of hypertension are equal in the different treatment groups. According to Senn, the idea that ANCOVA is biased unless treatment groups are equal on the covariate applies only when there is temporal additivity. To use our hypertension example, temporal additivity is the assumption that both treatment groups would experience the same change in hypertension over time\nus5v | if the treatment had no effect. In other words, had we left the two groups alone, their hypertension would change by exactly the same amount. Given that the groups have different overall levels of hypertension to begin with, this assumption might not be reasonable, which undermines the argument for requiring group equality in baseline measures.\nrs2m | To sum up, the independence of the covariate and treatment makes interpretation more straightforward but is not a statistical requirement. ANCOVA can be unbiased when groups differ on levels of the covariate, but as Miller and Chapman point out, it creates an interpretational problem that ANCOVA cannot magic away.\nuz9y | Thirteen point four point two Homogeneity of regression slopes",
