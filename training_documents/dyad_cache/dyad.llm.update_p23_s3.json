        "content": "qf11 | By nineteen fifty, most of the Bataan Boys had left for the United States, and only two of MacArthur's original upper-level class remained in his Tokyo inner circle, which now amounted to twelve officers. Willoughby was one of the two. He had first met MacArthur in the mid nineteen thirties while serving at the rank of Lieutenant Colonel as a teacher of military history in a military academy. According to his own testimony, his whole teaching was based on a summary of MacArthur's ideas as a Chief of Staff. Upon Willoughby's request, he joined MacArthur in the Philippines in nineteen thirty-nine, and became his G-2 in nineteen forty-one. Despite this fast rise to power, Willoughby did not win the respect of others and was generally regarded as a mediocre man who held his post because of his \"doglike devotion\" to MacArthur. By some accounts, this devotion spilled over into his professional work, which reflected his tendency to \"cloud his judgment\" based on MacArthur's views. After the war, Willoughby gained more power and influence and became MacArthur's closest confidant. At the same time, he continued cultivating the Bataan Gang mentality, thus helping to create \"a command environment that rewarded sycophants and isolated those who challenged the conventional wisdom.\"\n8oqt | Devotion to the boss ranked as Willoughby's highest goal. In describing Lieutenant General Richard Sutherland - MacArthur's Chief of Staff during the war and a personal rival of Willoughby - he counted his \"devotion to the 'old man'\" and \"his quick perception of the General's wishes\" as the keys to his success. John Gunther, an early biographer of MacArthur, wrote that for Willoughby \"MacArthur is the only man in the world for whose opinion he cares anything.\" This was evident in the early stage of the war in Korea. Perceiving himself as MacArthur's personal intelligence officer, rather than as a provider of intelligence to the relevant consumers in Washington and on the battlefield, he prevented the transfer of means of collection as well as intelligence information to General Walker, who was defending the Pusan perimeter. Walker was not part of MacArthur's inner circle; MacArthur did not trust him and considered relieving him of his duty. On top of that, Walker's relations with Willoughby were hostile.\n6zah | The Inchon landing - \"the most masterly and audacious strategic course in all history\" as praised by Admiral William Halsey - increased the sense of self-assuredness and further decreased openness to opposing views among MacArthur and his inner circle. The near collapse of the KPA and the speedy re-occupation of South Korea increased MacArthur's confidence and his sureness that victory could be reached by the end of the year. MacArthur and his inner circle even \"punished those officers who cast doubt on the invasion's success.\" Walker, who knew that he was not getting the necessary engineering equipment to meet his tasks, certainly in comparison to Almond's Ten Corps, told the Joint Chiefs of Staff: \"We have been bastard children.\" He received a vivid confirmation of his feelings when MacArthur arrived in a liberated Seoul on September twenty-ninth. The general completely snubbed Walker, who sided with those who had been opposed to\n4v5o | Inchon and warmly greeted Almond, his former chief of staff, who was an enthusiastic supporter of the operation.\nha9e | Willoughby, who in early July had admonished the commander of the Twenty-fourth Division to expedite preparations for the controversial landing operation or be left behind, was no exception. The fact that his forecasts of only light North Korean resistance proved to be wrong shortly after the successful landing had taken place did not diminish his self-assuredness. Shortly after the invasion, James M. Gavin, an experienced airborne officer, visited the Kimpo airfield, the main airbase near Seoul. He found that it had been readied for use by a modern air force and told Willoughby that this most likely indicated a possible Chinese intervention. Willoughby assured him that the Chinese would never cross the Yalu and march into the peninsula. He had his sources. He knew\nxrnt | Indeed, by this stage, Willoughby's reports matched the available intelligence information he had. While various sources indicated that the Chinese army had moved large forces to Manchuria, hardly any reliable ones, particularly not communications intelligence, showed that they had made any large-scale crossing of the Yalu. Hence, the estimate that a massive intervention had become militarily too dangerous for the Chinese could constitute a reasonable foundation for MacArthur's commitment to end the war by December. The situation changed in late October when the Chinese offensive created a gap between MacArthur's optimism and the battlefield reality. Within the Bataan Gang, the way to bridge this gap was by adjusting reality to accord with their leader's view. It would be done by providing policymakers in Washington and commanders on the battlefield with intelligence estimates that would support MacArthur's optimism. Willoughby was precisely the man to do it, and the monopoly he held over the intelligence from Korea made this fabrication so effective.\nc8ra | That Willoughby falsified intelligence in order to please MacArthur is supported by good evidence from the Ten Corps and the Eighth Army staff officers. Almond's deputy chief of staff, Colonel William J. McCaffrey, who had served under Almond as the chief of staff of the Ninety-second Division in World War Two, believed that Willoughby \"was more interested in staying in MacArthur's good graces than in rendering an objective assessment of the available facts\" and that this was particularly the case regarding the estimate of the magnitude of the Chinese threat. Almond's G-Three, Jack Chiles, remembered: \"MacArthur did not want the Chinese to enter the war in Korea. Anything MacArthur wanted, Willoughby produced intelligence for. In this case, Willoughby falsified the intelligence reports. He should have gone to jail.\" Almond's G-Two, Colonel James H. Polk, wrote that \"we had the dope but old CAW (Willoughby) bowed to the superior wisdom of his beloved boss and didn't fight him as a good staff officer should.\"",
