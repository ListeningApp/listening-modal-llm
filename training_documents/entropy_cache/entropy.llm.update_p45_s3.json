He considered a model of nuclear matter where the energies E sub N approach plus infinity in a roughly logarithmic way. As you heat it, its expected energy keeps increasing, but its temperature can never exceed T sub H. This model turned out to be incorrect, but it is interesting anyway.\nasz3 | Now let's solve some puzzles on systems with a countable infinity of states. Some of these show up in quantum mechanics, but you don't need to know quantum mechanics to do these puzzles.\nsalu | Puzzle twenty-seven. Show that for a system with a countable infinity of states, if thermal equilibrium is possible for some negative temperature, it is impossible for positive or infinite temperatures.\nv78z | Puzzle twenty-eight. Work out the Boltzmann distribution when E sub N equals N E for some energy E, and show that it is well-defined for all temperatures\nf0em | zero is less than T which is less than plus infinity. The next puzzle is a lot like the previous one a bit more messy, but worthwhile because of its great importance in physics.\nc3sz | Puzzle twenty-nine. For a system called the quantum harmonic oscillator of frequency omega we have E sub N equals N plus one-half times h-bar omega, where h-bar is the reduced Planck's constant. Work out the Boltzmann distribution in this case, and show it is well-defined for all temperatures\nbghr | zero is less than T which is less than plus infinity. Puzzle thirty. For a system called the primon gas we have E sub N equals E ln N for some energy E. Show that the Boltzmann distribution is well-defined for small enough positive temperatures, but there is a Hagedorn temperature. Give a formula for the Boltzmann distribution in terms of the Riemann zeta function:\nfdud | zeta of s equals the sum from N equals one to infinity of N to the power of negative s. You can show that for the primon gas the sum of the N equals one to infinity of exp of negative E sub N over k T diverges at the Hagedorn temperature. But it can go the other way, too:\n8191 | Puzzle thirty-one. Find energies E sub N with a Hagedorn temperature such that the sum from N equals one to infinity of exp of negative E sub N over k T converges at the Hagedorn temperature.\nk3he | Various other strange things can happen, as you should expect when dealing with infinite series. For example, it's possible that the Boltzmann distribution is well-defined at some temperature but the expected value of the energy is infinite! But I'll resist the lure of these rabbit holes and turn to something much more important: systems with a continuum of states. We will need to get good at these to compute the entropy of hydrogen. Now our sums become integrals, and various new things happen.\nlze6 | THE FINITE VERSUS THE CONTINUOUS\nc1ys | THE FINITE\n1tyf | THE CONTINUOUS\nktwv | You can switch from finite sums to integrals in the definition of entropy, and we'll need to do this to compute the entropy of hydrogen. But be careful: a bunch of things change!\n0yl7 | We need to switch from finite sums to integrals when we switch from a finite set of states to a measure space of states. I'll illustrate the ideas with the real line, R. We define a probability distribution on R to be an integrable function p: R -> [zero, zero) with\n8kqn | Such a probability distribution has a Gibbs entropy given by\nct3i | S(p) equals negative k integral from zero to infinity of p(x) ln p(x) dx.\ntvep | We can also define Shannon entropy, where we leave out Boltzmann's constant k and use whatever base we want for the logarithm:\ndmvx | H (p) equals negative integral from zero to infinity of p(x) log p(x) dx.\n9z6z | I should warn you that many writers reserve the term 'Shannon entropy' only for a sum\n4qhr | H (p) equals negative sum of pi log pi.\n3qb9 | While that convention has advantages, I want to use the term 'Shannon entropy' to signal that I'm leaving out the factor of k.\naksw | Unlike the entropy for a probability distribution on a finite set, the entropy of a probability distribution on R can be negative! This is disturbing. Earlier I said that the Shannon entropy of a probability distribution is the expected amount of information\np87k | you learn when an outcome is chosen according to that distribution. How can this be negative?\ninmq | The answer is that this interpretation of entropy, valid for probability distributions on a finite or even a countably infinite set, is not true in the continuous case! We have to adapt our intuitions.\nigkq | Look at an example. Let Pe be the probability distribution on R given by\nfy1j | P(x) equals zero otherwise.\nfujm | For small e it's a tall thin spike near zero. Let's work out its Shannon entropy: I(p) equals negative p(x) log p(x) dx\nqq4d | equals negative integral from e to one over e of\nma98 | log one over e dx\nrboa | equals log e.\nbdkb | We're just integrating a constant here, so it's easy. When e equals one the entropy is zero, and when e becomes smaller than one the entropy becomes negative!\nl47b | Why? We need a distance scale to define the entropy of a probability distribution on the real line. If I measure distance in centimeters, I'll think the entropy of a probability distribution is bigger than you, who measures it in meters. And if I measure it in kilometers, I'll think the entropy is smaller-and possibly even negative.\nzio7 | Let's see how this works. If I measure distance in different units from you, my coordinate y on the real line will not equal your coordinate x: instead we'll have y equals c times x\nmty2 | for some c greater than zero. Then my probability distribution, say q, will have\ntbjy | q(y) dy equals q(c x) dx equals c q(x) dx so we must have\nmszq | q(c x) equals p(x) over c\ni0p0 | to make this integral equal one. In other words, stretching out a probability distribution must also flatten it out, making it less 'tall'-and its entropy increases. Indeed:\nok43 | Puzzle thirty-two. Show that H(q) equals H(p) plus ln c.\nqnqv | Thanks to this formula choosing zero less than c less than one compresses a probability distribution and makes it taller, reducing its entropy. Inevitably, this can make the entropy negative if c is small enough.\niwpq | In summary: in the continuous case, entropy is not invariant under reparametrizations: our choice of coordinates matters! And this can make entropy negative. This applies not only to R but many other measure spaces we'll be considering, like R. This issue will be very important.\noial | After learning this, it should be less of a shock that the entropy of a probability distribution on R can be infinite, or even undefined:\n8xfx | Puzzle thirty-three. Find three probability distributions p on the real line that have entropy plus infinity, minus zero, and undefined because it's of the form plus infinity minus infinity.\npgp5 | ENTROPY, ENERGY AND TEMPERATURE\n```",
