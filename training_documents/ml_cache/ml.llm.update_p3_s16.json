        "content": "d5bz | The study of DNA, mRNA and proteins is broadly denoted as genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics respectively. The genetic blueprint of a cell is explored using genomics, which looks at the DNA of individuals and helps us to investigate the presence or absence of certain genes.\nap5o | Are actively expressed and provides information about what is happening at the cellular level. Proteomics helps in characterising the information flow happening within the cell and the organism in the form of protein pathways and their networks.\n7zvf | Although metabolomics, lipidomics, and glycomics do not form part of the central dogma analysis, they still provide an invaluable amount of information regarding the metabolites, lipids and glycans (synthesised by the proteome via biosynthetic pathways). These substances are the intermediate products of a cell's information flow and therefore are considered to be excellent indicators of the cell's activity. Similar to single-genome studies, metagenomics is used to sequence genetic information from environmental samples without the requirement of isolating individual species.\nmov9 | All measured omics data can be used as a biomarker which helps us to understand and analyse the underlying characteristics and complexities of biological systems. Table one shows some of the important omics used to study biological systems. All of them are part of the same pipeline of biological information, whose output depends on the different inputs and regulation. As shown in Table one, each of these omics can be measured using specialised high-throughput technologies (for example microarray and mass spectrometry for genomics and\nks7m | metabolomics respectively). The table also includes a list of recent reviews on each of these omics. High-throughput generated omics data has played a pivotal role in developing precision medicine biomarkers for diseases such as Alzheimer's, diabetes, cancer, hypertension, cardiovascular and chronic respiratory diseases. Recently, these omics have also been integrated for COVID-nineteen studies. Many other specialised omics have also emerged such as pharmacogenomics, methylomics, interactomics and radiomics.\nw1w1 | Overall, these omics provide a complete picture of cell biology and related cellular function. This provided the impetus for the development of various software mechanisms which can offer a prediction of a particular phenotype while using the available next-generation multi-omics data. Furthermore, they can be utilised to develop materials and devices which be used for diagnostic and preventive purpose at the molecular level while targeting molecules with greater accuracy.\nh8gv | Two point two. Machine learning\nkwkp | Classical statistical modelling has always been the de facto standard choice for health data analysis and its interpretation. In recent years, with the increasing availability of affordable computing power and high-throughput omics data and the success of artificial intelligence technology in various fields, the use of Machine Learning has become popular in health sciences. Machine Learning can be used to mine information hidden in the experimental data. In contrast, a conventional statistics-based model is usually developed using statistical assumptions and draws an inference about a population from a given dataset.\nyj0m | The objective of Machine Learning methods is to acquire knowledge from historic or\newfp | present-day data and utilise that understanding to make forecasts or choices for unidentified forthcoming data measures. To assist beginners in the Machine Learning domain, a glossary of learning approaches covered in this review, standard Machine Learning terminology and commonly used Machine Learning algorithms are provided. The basic foundations of Machine Learning and its uses have been extensively covered in the literature.\noczy | Machine Learning is employed in a wide range of scenarios, where designing and programming explicit algorithms with optimal results is challenging, such as email filtering, hand-written optical character recognition, and computer vision. Also, it has been deployed for self-driving cars, cyber-security, automated assistants such as 'Siri', websites that recommend items based on the purchasing decisions of other people and novel solutions to some of the challenging problems of the real world.\n2ttg | Deep learning has emerged in recent years as the leading class of Machine Learning algorithms. It uses neural networks composed of hidden layers performing different operations to find complex representations of data. It has pushed the performance of classifiers beyond that of traditional Machine Learning algorithms, especially in scenarios involving large-scale datasets with high dimensionality. On the other hand, it is very computationally intensive, requiring high-throughput or high-performance hardware, and lacks explainability (transparency) in feature selection (black-box approach), in the sense that it is difficult to extract from the network the features that the network has found as mainly responsible for the task, e. g. classification. However, in the context of multi-omic integration, deep learning offers an exciting opportunity.\nhis3 | Fig. one shows the number of publications indexed on the Web of Science website with different key topics.
