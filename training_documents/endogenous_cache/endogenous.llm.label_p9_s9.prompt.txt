You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

ap5o | 335 After validating our approach, we next analyzed the effect of AD on neuroproteasome
7zvf | 336 localization, measured by the relative quantity of 20S proteasome subunits in our quantitative
mov9 | 337 mass spectrometry dataset. First, in comparing AD samples to cognitively normal controls, we
ks7m | 338 find a striking reduction in nearly every 20S proteasome subunit in the plasma membrane
w1w1 | 339 fraction from BA7 tissue (Fig 3B, Table S2). We next sought to determine whether ApoE
h8gv | 340 genotype influenced neuroproteasome localization in human tissue. Given the significant effect
kwkp | 341 of AD on neuroproteasome localization, we constrained the analysis only to the effect of ApoE 342 genotype on neuroproteasome localization by comparing the ApoE4/4 AD cohort against the
yj0m | 343 ApoE3/3 AD cohort. We observe a clear trend of reduced 20S proteasome subunits in the
ewfp | 344 membrane fraction in the ApoE4 genotype compared to ApoE3 genotype in the BA7 vulnerable 345 brain region (Fig 3C, Table S2).
oczy | 346
2ttg | 347 To validate our proteomics data, we monitored surface localization of neuroproteasomes by
his3 | 348 immunoblot analysis. We controlled for sample loading by normalizing against Kv1.2, a protein
m50z | 349 whose expression has been reproducibly demonstrated as unchanged in the AD brain(78-80).
me84 | 350 While this strategy is required for loading controls by immunoblot, these loading controls line up
o56m | 351 with the normalization strategy for mass spectrometry based on the total amount of TMT signal
slz6 | 352 from each sample. First, we validate our proteomics data and find a twofold reduction of
90k5 | 353 neuroproteasome surface expression in AD patients compared to controls in the BA7 region (Fig
9m8s | 354 3D). Moreover, we find a statistically significant reduction in neuroproteasome localization from ApoE4/4 tissue compared to ApoE3/3 unaffected tissue (Fig 3D). In contrast, we do not observe 356 changes in total expression of the 20S proteasome from the cytosolic fraction, suggesting that the
893y | 355
favz | 357 ApoE-isoform dependent changes we observe are specific to neuroproteasome localization and
7szx | 358 not a change in cytosolic proteasome levels. We find changes in Lrp1 concordant with that
hx9e | 359 observed with neuroproteasomes (Fig S3A). However, given the strong effect of AD pathology
ywn2 | 360 on the global proteome (as well as on neuroproteasome localization), we next used the BA4
a63r | 361 tissue to understand how ApoE isoforms could influence neuroproteasome localization with mild
dqvj | 362 AD pathology.
r17u | 363
3c47 | 364 In BA4 tissue, unlike BA7, we find comparable surface localization of neuroproteasomes
g345 | 365 between patients with and without AD (Fig 3E, Fig S3B). However, once stratified by ApoE genotype, we find that ApoE4/4 patients have a nearly 50% reduction in surface localization of
svhz | 366
oaen | 367 neuroproteasome compared with ApoE3/3 patients (Fig 3E). Both of these conclusions are
5u67 | 368 supported by analysis of proteasome subunits from unbiased proteomics datasets from BA4
dvms | 369 tissue (Table S2). Consistent with these observations, using LLVY degradation experiments to
qrd3 | 370 measure the catalytic activity of the proteasome, we found a significant reduction in
rxrg | 371 neuroproteasome activity in AD samples compared to unaffected controls and no change in
tf43 | 372 cytosolic proteasome activity (Fig S3C). This demonstrates that ApoE4 can influence
fcco | 373 neuroproteasome localization in areas with mild AD pathology. Taken together, we make two
8uji | 375 conclusions based on these data: 1) that neuroproteasome localization is reduced in brain regions
df3e | 374
53eu | 376 which have increased susceptibility to AD pathology and 2) that ApoE4 reduces
a5u1 | neuroproteasome localization compared to ApoE3.

5mda | 378 Quantitative proteomics reveals that selective inhibition of neuroproteasomes induces 379 accumulation of sarkosyl-insoluble Tau
i4li | 380
r8sm | 381 What is the consequence of ApoE4-dependent reduction in neuroproteasome function, or more broadly, any reduction in neuroproteasome function? The most straightforward way to address this question is to leverage neuroproteasome-specific inhibitors. We previously accomplished 383
cuin | 382
n1i7 | 384 neuroproteasome-specific inhibition using Biotin-Epoxomicin: an analog of the covalent and
0r5m | 385 highly selective proteasome inhibitor Epoxomicin with an N-terminal Biotin moiety. This small modification renders Biotin-Epoxomicin cell-impermeable for up to an hour and does not change
ne2o | 386
sqxn | 387 the selectivity or potency of Epoxomicin (4) (81-84). While time-limited, this approach found
6pmo | 388 that generally, neuroproteasome substrates are co- or peri-translationally degraded and that flux 389 through the neuroproteasome depends on neuronal activity(3, 4). However, the previous version
195r | 390 of Biotin-Epoxomicin was not a usable tool to assess broad physiological functions of
kqmi | 39 neuroproteasomes because the timescale was far too short and could not be used in vivo.
g8rd | 392
nns9 | 393 Based on principles of drug design, we considered that introducing a longer PEG linker between 394 the N-terminus of Epoxomicin and biotin would decrease the permeability of biotin-epoxomicin and allow us to reveal long-term consequences of neuroproteasome inhibition(85, 86). We chose
9uwy | 395
srly | 396 Epoxomicin because it leverages the unique chemistry of the catalytic threonines of the
dl6i | 397 proteasome - the a-amino group of the threonine opens the epoxide of Epoxomicin which forms 398 the final covalent morpholino adduct. The catalytic residues of Serine and Cysteine proteases do
89ub | 399 not have a-amino groups, which is the principle that renders Epoxomicin completely specific
dhle | 400 both against its target and relative to other proteasome inhibitors. These advantages explain why
2nib | 401 dozens of analogs of Epoxomicin have been made to the N-terminus without altering the
naev | 402 specificity of the drug against the proteasome: no off-target effects of Epoxomicin or its analogs
7h0h | 403 have been found in the two decades since its discovery (83, 84, 87-89). We synthesized click-
a64c | 404 able analogs of Epoxomicin (Azide-Epoxomicin) that would allow us to append a broad range of 405 linkers (Fig 4A). We then conjugated Biotin-PEG24-Alkyne to Epoxomicin, producing Biotin- 406 PEG24-Epoxomicin, or iBEp (Fig 4A). We observe efficient conjugation by HPLC analysis (Fig
gi7n | 407 S4A, B, C, D). All molecules were HPLC-purified as single peaks and confirmed by LC/MS 408 analysis (Fig S4D, E).
3pn1 | 409
wjuz | 410 We next tested the potency and selectivity of iBEp relative to Epoxomicin. Epoxomicin
3yxv | 411 covalently and irreversibly binds the catalytic ß subunits of the proteasome - therefore, the biotin
d8zj | 412 moiety on iBEp serves as a tracer to detect whether proteasomes are inhibited by monitoring 413 biotin signal on an SDS-PAGE gel(83, 87-89). We detect covalent biotinylation of only three
ywxn | 414 proteins from iBEp-treated neurons, corresponding to the three catalytic subunits of the
uxhs | 415 proteasome (Fig S4F). Therefore, we demonstrate that the iBEp linker does not modify the high 416 specificity of iBEp compared to Epoxomicin alone. This is supported by previous data that
ed6e | 417 modification of the non-reactive end of epoxomicin has been shown not to change the selectivity
6qqm | 418 of Epoxomicin for the proteasome(83, 87-89). While iBEp is still highly active against the
onum | 419 proteasome, we do find that the Biotin-PEG24 linker moderately reduces the efficacy of iBEp
3iir | 420 relative to Epoxomicin (Fig S4G). We therefore chose doses of inhibitor where the effective
7a0a | 421 concentration of the inhibitor was similar to previous studies using Epoxomicin alone and well 422 within the acceptable range of efficacy given how potent Epoxomicin is as a proteasome 423 inhibitor.
o1qp | 424
jrik | 425 To test the permeability of our compounds, we incubated primary cortical neurons with iBEp 426 over a time course and prepared both cytosolic and plasma membrane-enriched fractions.
xv78 | 427 Samples were immunoblotted and probed for cytosolic marker Actin and membrane protein 428 GluR1 to validate our fractionation (Fig 4B). We found specific biotin signal corresponding to
sdks | 429 covalent inhibition of the proteasome by iBEp only in the membrane fraction, and not in the
y8fb | 430 cytosol, over a 24 hour incubation in primary neurons (Fig 4B). As an orthogonal measure of cell 43. penetrance, we tested whether the activity of cytosolic proteasomes was affected by iBEp
521q | 432 treatment. We subjected cytosolic and membrane fractions from iBEp-treated neurons to LLVY-
yogo | based proteasome activity assays. Cytosolic proteasome activity remains completely intact from
2285 | 433
ys0g | 434 iBEp-treated neurons compared to DMSO controls, but proteasome activity in the membrane
7zvp | 435 fraction is almost entirely abrogated (Fig 4C). This suggests that neuroproteasomes are inhibited following iBEp incubation but cytosolic proteasomes remain unaffected.
ww6u | 436
hpi6 | 437
4uhb | 438 To further validate our neuroproteasome-specific inhibitors, we sought a cellular functional
epyi | 439 readout of whether our cell-impermeant inhibitors affected cytosolic proteasomes. One of the
y51p | 440 most penetrant and robust consequences of total proteasome inhibition is the induction of
x95m | 441 autophagy as a cellular response mechanism to compensate for the lack of proteasomal
yfum | 442 degradation(31-33, 90-92). To test this, we assayed three autophagy markers, p62 levels,
ppx4 | 443 LC3bI/II ratios, and Ulk1 levels. Each are robust markers of different steps of autophagy. p62
qf11 | 444 has been demonstrated to be rapidly induced upon proteasome inhibition and LC3bI/II induction 445 is thought to be slower, while Ulk1 is important for early phagosome formation(93). Cytosolic 446 proteasome inhibition has been reproducibly demonstrated to induce a strong increase in p62
8oqt | 447 levels in neurons(31, 32, 34, 93). Consistent with these reported observations, we find a strong induction of p62 and little to no change in LC3bI/II following 12 hours of total proteasome inhibition with epoxomicin (Fig 4D). However, when we treat primary neurons with iBEp, we 450 observe no change in either p62 or LC3bI/II levels (Fig 4D). These data are a functional 451 demonstration that iBEp is cell-impermeable to neurons and signify that specifically inhibiting 452 neuroproteasomes over all proteasomes does not induce compensatory autophagic degradation, 453 and together, validate the use of iBEp as a neuroproteasome-specific inhibitor.
6zah | 448 449
4v5o | 454 455 One important advantage of iBEp is the ability to use over extended timecourses, a property 456 necessary to understand how neuroproteasomes shape the proteome, if at all. We hypothesized 457 that prolonged neuroproteasome inhibition may reveal not only the turnover of candidate 458 substrates, but also affect the solubility and aggregation of proteins. If true, this observation may
ha9e | 459 provide some explanatory power for how neuroproteasome dysfunction (driven by ApoE4 or
xrnt | 460 other mechanisms) could underlie deficits in proteostasis with potential relevance for
c8ra | 46 neurodegenerative disorders. We incubated DIV12-14 primary cortical neurons with cell-
p1l0 | 462 impermeable proteasome inhibitors in biological duplicate for 1 and 6 hours, prepared sarkosyl-
1i8b | 463 soluble and sarkosyl-insoluble samples, and then collected and processed samples for
5sfj | 464 quantitative TMT-based proteomics (Fig 4E). We first analyzed proteins which increase over the
vk4h | 465 time-course in the soluble fraction. We recapitulate our previously published data and find that
nsm3 | 466 neuroproteasome inhibition induces the accumulation of previously reported neuroproteasome
jdfw | 467 substrates such as Rgs4, c-Fos, Sox4, Snurf, Arc, and Bex2 in the soluble fraction (Fig 4F, G,
uc9r | 468 Table S3)(4). Importantly, we also do not see accumulation of classical ubiquitin-proteasome
l0ap | 469 substrates such as PSD-95, Homer1, or GKAP(94-96) (Fig 4G). We also fail to observe an
x815 | 470 increase in p62, LC3b, GabarapL1, or any other marker of autophagy(1, 97) (Fig 4G). This
epbj | 471 provides orthogonal evidence that iBEp does not detectably penetrate cells and demonstrates the 472 validity of this approach to determine the consequences of selective neuroproteasome inhibition.
nmn2 | 473 These validate our previous data identifying neuroproteasome substrates(4) and extend them by
g3tm | 474 demonstrating neuroproteasome-dependent substrate turnover in a context without modulating 475 neuronal activity and over extended periods of time.
tfra | 476
5lm9 | 477 Next, our quantitative proteomics analysis revealed a selective pattern of protein insolubility
wp2c | 478 following neuroproteasome inhibition. We find that only 52 proteins become sarkosyl-insoluble
us5v | 479 in response to neuroproteasome inhibition (Fig 4H, Table S3), in contrast with over 250 proteins
rs2m | 480 increasing in the soluble fraction (Fig 4F). To narrow in on this list, we quantitated which
uz9y | 481 proteins show a greater than log-fold change in the insoluble fraction, but showed no change in
8ov0 | 482 the soluble fraction (Fig 4I). This analysis identified only four proteins which show significant
mj9m | 483 increases in the insoluble fraction relative to the soluble fraction (Ckmt1, Tau, Taf15, and
94h3 | 484 Hspb1) and one protein which significantly increases in the soluble fraction and showed no
9jx1 | 485 change in the insoluble fraction (Plk2) (Fig 4I). Of note, Taf15 has previously been observed in 486 detergent-insoluble fractions of brains from Alzheimer's patients, correlated with both Amyloid
c3lz | 487 ß and Tau insolubility(98-101). Ckmt1 has also been found in Neurofibrillary tangles and interacting with phosphorylated Tau inclusions(102-104).
8bwk | 488
ez9s | 489 490 Neuroproteasomes are differentially regulated by ApoE isoforms to determine formation of 491 endogenous sarkosyl-insoluble Tau inclusions
mqot | 492
oc99 | 493 Our findings raise the intriguing possibility that a fraction of endogenous mouse Tau becomes
gipz | 494 sarkosyl-insoluble following neuroproteasome inhibition. We sought to validate these findings
b4wj | 495 by immunoblot and extend them to determine if the same principle would hold for human Tau 496 isoforms, without pathogenic and aggregation-driving mutations. We therefore cultured primary
5xlt | 497 mouse cortical neurons from either WT or hTau-KI mice (105). The entire mouse Mapt sequence
9bz4 | 498 is replaced with the human Mapt sequence (including upstream gene regulatory elements) at the
yfv2 | 499 endogenous locus in hTau-KI mice. hTau-KI mice express all six human isoforms of Tau protein
