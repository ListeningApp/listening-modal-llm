You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

z2w8 | To start the dashboard creation process, click on the dashboard tab at the bottom of the Tableau Public interface. The dashboard tab is the tab with an icon of a rectangle divided into four quadrants, which is outlined in the following screenshot.
1l0m | You can also browse Dashboard | New Dashboard from the Menu bar:
9ctx | When you select the dashboard tab, the dashboard view is displayed. This is the interface that allows you to build and configure dashboards from the worksheets that you have already created in this workbook. To the left of the window are the available worksheets. From the left side of the window, you can also add to the dashboard various supporting elements such as text boxes, labels, web page windows, and images. To the right is the canvas area of the dashboard, where sheets and objects are dragged to, arranged, and configured.
yipb | Dashboard Design and Styling
a9dp | The dashboard interface is similar to the worksheet workspace in many ways. In the following screenshot, we have identified its several key areas.
zso4 | Like the worksheet view, the dashboard has the following elements:
4g5b | . The menus and toolbar, which are placed horizontally across the top of the page
ddml | . The Dashboard pane on the left, where you can determine the exact composition of your dashboard
ahtn | · The canvas, where you will drag worksheets and other visual elements
5jda | We have numbered the elements on the dashboard, as shown in the following screenshot. They are as follows:
q1jc | . A list of worksheets (1) that have not been hidden and which are sorted according to the order in which they are arranged in your workbook
ke6a | . Containers and objects (2) that can be dragged onto your dashboard to increase the integrity of the design
c4gy | · A controller (3) for new objects
lr9x | . A hierarchy of dashboard objects (4) that can be used for navigation
jux5 | · A controller (5) for the dashboard size
be8m | . The canvas (6) where you will compose the dashboard
1lxd | If you are creating a new dashboard, the canvas will be blank. If you open an existing dashboard, the various existing dashboard elements will be displayed on the canvas. The following screenshot shows the dashboard interfaces:
z3ff | Chapter 7
rv0j | It's important to keep in mind the purpose of your dashboard. We are building a dashboard that tells the story of carbon dioxide emissions over time. The dashboard should allow users to navigate to the areas of interest and then understand the factors of consumption.
kv4p | The dashboard will have the following key elements, which were previously discussed:
g1v3 | . Title, so that our users know what they are viewing
7d2w | . At least one visualization with data and proper context is required so that different data points relate to each other and to the user
3b38 | · A call to action (conclusion) is also needed so that users know how to explore the details within the dashboard or go to another web page
il0a | Dashboard Design and Styling
mato | In order to build this dashboard, we will start with a single visualization, which is the visualization with summary data in this case. Drag a sheet onto the canvas by hovering over the visualization that you want to add, pressing the left mouse button, and dragging it onto the canvas, as depicted in the following screenshot. You can also double-click on the worksheet name.
uas3 | If you wish to remove a worksheet from the dashboard, click on the title of the visualization until a grey container bar appears at the top border of the visualization. Then, right-click on the grey bar. Select Remove from Dashboard from the shortcut menu:
6hc3 | The result, as shown in the following screenshot, shows the map that we created. This map shows the CO2 emissions per capita in 2008, which was taken from the World Bank official website. Each country is colored by its relative percentile in the data set, and the label shows the CO2 emissions per capita.
rkb7 | However, users don't know all of that yet:
eu28 | Tableau Public automatically added the following two elements:
bes8 | . The worksheet name as the title
qlbn | . The color legend in a vertical layout container to the right
mnni | In order to compose an empathetically designed user experience with proper context, we need to use layout containers to rearrange the dashboard and create a flow of both navigation and information, that is, a data story. The next section discusses layout objects, and we will show examples of how to use them.
qvk0 | Dashboard Design and Styling
yoge | Layout objects
wb8y | Tableau Public has several different layout objects that you can add to your dashboard to control the composition.
wkvi | Objects are versatile, and you can use them to reflect the overall theme of your graphic composition. From the context menu of an object, you can perform the following tasks:
vo68 | . Format it with borders and background colors
1329 | · Remove it
d26s | · Set it as a floating or tiled object
52b2 | • Remove it from the dashboard
rvlv | You can set the height and width attributes for floating objects, just like you can for worksheets that you have added (and for the dashboard as a whole, which is highly encouraged).
vfsg | The following objects can be added to your dashboard:
xbmv | . Horizontal layout containers: You can drag worksheets that you want next to each other into these containers.
8dfo | . Vertical layout containers: You can drag other objects and worksheets that you want to stack from top to bottom into these containers.
lz3e | . Text objects: These can be used to add titles and calls to action. Though you can't add field tokens to text objects, you can add parameter tokens, which will be discussed in depth in the next chapter.
y26m | . Images: You can use these to browse logos or branding elements that add richness to your dashboard. You can also use images as links to web pages, since each image can have a URL attribute.
j0ou | . Web page objects: These can be used to add content from the Internet. You can even create dynamic content, which will be covered in the next chapter too.
zk07 | · Blank objects: These objects can be used to control space. Blank containers are transparent. So, the background colors that you are using will show through them.
0lr7 | Chapter 7
udsn | In the section of the dashboard pane that says New objects, the default object is set to Tiled. You should leave it there until you are comfortable with dashboard design. Each new object that you add to your dashboard will have this setting, and though you can easily change the attribute for individual sheets on a dashboard, it's best to keep things simple in the beginning. The Tiled automatically aligns objects to the dashboard grid, and floating adds new objects to the dashboard that are detached from the dashboard grid.
6tgb | notes:
7fxo | When you add objects, like worksheets, into a horizontal or vertical layout container, the widths and heights of the objects will be sized automatically, unless you specify otherwise. In case you're using actions, which will be discussed in the next chapter, it's particularly useful to use containers for sizing automatically.
nzpg | Setting the size of dashboard elements
kou3 | Usually, dashboard elements such as containers can be set by manipulating the border handles of each container and resizing them to a suitable size. Tableau Public also offers a Size feature, as shown in the following screenshot, that allows for more control in the positioning and sizing of these dashboard elements:
q8mn | 1
2n9u | The dashboard element must be in the floating mode so that it can be sized and positioned. In case the container or element is not already in the floating mode, it can be set to floating by clicking on the dashboard element and checking off the Floating checkbox, as shown in the previous screenshot.
xtmy | notes
mdfm | To change the positioning of the dashboard element, enter the x and y coordinates (this will take some trial and error) in the corresponding Pos: fields, or scroll up and down with the arrows for fine correction. To change Size, enter the width (w) and height (h) values in the corresponding fields using the up and down arrows for fine adjustment.
