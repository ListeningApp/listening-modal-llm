It is they alone who can restore harmony and balance in circles and individuals which have sacrificed these things in the search for continuity and reassurance in the hope of stabilisation.\ndo3u | Were it possible to attain the object in a systematised way, the means to do so would have been enunciated and recorded many thousands of years ago: just as the laws of ordinary material stability and performance are recorded and employed in physics or in applied arts.\nytev | The reactions of an audience to the efforts of a real teacher to redress the balance of an organisation are always predictable. They will include despair, confusion, desire for stimulus, fear that something might be taken away, rejection, and a desire to accept in order to profit by the 'new phase'.\nt9s8 | THE SHIP IN A STORM\n9it4 | Mulla Nasrudin objected to the captain of a ship making fast the sails aloft, when as he said: 'Can't you see that the trouble is at sea-level !'\n2p9e | The teacher, however much he may regret it, can never escape the necessity of saying that it is he who has the technical knowledge: who decides whether the sails or the hull have to be attended to.\ntcrb | If he calms the 'Mulla' by passing ropes around the hull, the ship may never reach port: though the 'Mulla's' death in the storm may take place in the circumstances of the utmost tranquility, sure in the knowledge that his desires have been fulfilled.\ndo7p | There are two kinds of community: one, the community produced and maintained by what is today called indoctrination; the other, the one accumulated and harmonised by starting with the right materials and the right knowledge.\ne67v | The situation with regard to the understanding of the subtler potential of the group and its finer tuning has its analogy in Rumi's explanation of the difference between the different levels of perception of religion. As he says in Fihi ma Fihi:\nrupi | Some are but children on the Path, they drink the milk of the Koran, its literal sense. And those who have reached maturity have a separate perception and another understanding, that of the inward significance of the Koran.\nwehi | Concealment of Shortcomings\nx36q | Q: I have seen in an English translation of AW ARIF EL MAARIF, a Sufi textbook, a statement to the effect that a disciple should conceal his teacher's shortcomings. How can a man be a teacher if he has shortcomings?\nad6a | A: One might almost put it the other way round-how can a teacher be a man unless he has shortcomings? But your question is more properly and probably usefully answered by pointing out that the fact that someone is a disciple means that he is likely to regard some actions of a teacher, which he does not understand, as shortcomings. It is a matter of understanding.\nbmpv | If the student imagines that something said or done by his teacher is a shortcoming when it is not, and this student maintains publicly that his teacher has deficiencies, the results will be undesirable for everyone.\nhnux | Mark Twain is reported to have said that as a youth he thought his father ignorant. When he grew up he was surprised how much the old man had learnt in so few years. Supposing, then, that in the years between his first and second assessments of his father, he has published the 'fact' that his father was ignorant, what would the consequences have been?\nmobw | But the statement is, above all, a reminder of the need for understanding being paramount.\n2ow1 | Furthermore, you should know that the Sufis have always maintained that whatever comes into this 'abode of decay' - the world - must partake of its imperfections.\n18j7 | Ghazzali, one of the greatest Sufis, said in the twelfth century that: 'The learner should know that he gains more from mistakes of his teacher, even if that teacher makes mistakes, than he gains from his own tightness, even if he is himself right.' Everyone interested in Sufism should ponder this statement carefully.\nt1m7 | Saints and Heroes\nn3b7 | Q: You talk about 'Heroes' and 'Saints'. How are these terms being used?\nm3or | A: A hero is a person who exerts himself at whatever cost, for the sake of values which are recognised by his community as vital. These are always regarded as vital because some form of assessment has arrived at them, and some form of acceptance has 'established' them in the mental set of the people. They are, in short, not necessarily truths, but certainly are agreed principles.\nha75 | A saint, on the other hand, is someone who exerts himself for the sake of what must be done, not what is assumed must be done. His source of knowledge about this necessity is factual (real knowledge, not assumption).\njv7m | Those religious people who sacrifice themselves because they are emotionally conditioned to a doctrine are heroes perhaps, but not saints. Those heroes who sacrifice themselves because of real knowledge, though this may appear to be logical or intellectual knowledge, are in reality saints, as Sufis use the word.\nvusw | People tend to follow the 'heroic' trait in heroes and those whom they adopt as saints alike merely because, being prone to conditioning and emotional arousal, the public can recognise 'social sacrifice' which belongs to the domain of heroism, but not, in general, 'essential sacrifice', appertaining to the realm of sainthood. The latter word, in Sufi usage, denotes objective knowledge, not simply miracles or the odour of sanctity.\neekz | Put it like this: If a man dies because by doing this he will save others, and the situation is obvious (an enemy is at the gates) he will be considered a hero, even a saint, or both. But if he dies, or does not die, and makes a sacrifice which is not always understood by his fellows, for a cause which they themselves are not heedful enough to perceive, he may be a saint. They may or may not canonise him, depending not upon their perception of his saintliness, but upon their opinion of his saintliness or heroism,\noa2r | which is a very different thing.\nny2b | Our Mulla Nasrudin shows quite clearly in one of his adventures how people try things 'heroically', and still do not learn - but, on the other hand rationalise their situation so as to satisfy their own desire to prevail. The result is ludicrous to a detached observer, while it may still remain 'logical' to whoever subscribes to the assumptions which prompted the act\nhf0t | Invited to a grandee's court, Nasrudin was offered a horse to ride.\nguma | TRICKS AND HORSES\n777z | As soon as it was brought to him, he placed his right foot in the left stirrup, sprang up, and landed on its back, facing the animal's tail.\n2fyc | 'Perhaps you are not accustomed to the mount of gentlemen' sniffed the aristocrat.\nm0s8 | 'Perhaps not,' said Nasrudin. 'On the other hand, I prefer to believe that I can see through the tricks of people who try to palm off back-to-front horses on me.'\nkyn7 | The Levels of Service\nslnt | Q. I have heard the 'Three Levels of the Service Situation', that does this mean? How does this accord with Wisdom and how does repentance accord with both?\n8oup | A:\nu7p0 | One. Structural Level: A man works, obtains money, his employer benefits by selling the product at a profit.\nygsa | Two. Psychological Level: Man 'A' serves, service makes him happy- Man 'B' and or an organisation benefits through material or emotional gain from 'A's service.\nuwue | Three. Higher Level: 'A' serves, acquires merit, avoids consuming it in the form of self-satisfaction or attention-demand. 'B' or an organisation benefits because of 'A's progress, and feeds back this benefit into its teaching.\n```",
