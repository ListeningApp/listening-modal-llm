        "content": "xxr8 | studies should aim to reveal which of the three scenarios in Fig. three, B through D, is most likely for the light inhibition of\nrl4j | R sub dee. Several mechanisms co-contribute to the Kok effect\nvz32 | Our analyses suggest that not a single mechanism determines the Kok effect, but at least three mechanisms, that is, decreasing capital phi sub two with irradiance, varying capital gamma superscript star over C sub C, and light inhibition of R sub dee, co-contribute to it. Using a model, we quantitatively estimated the relative contribution of the carbon dioxide-specific processes like refixation, reflected via left capital gamma superscript star over C sub C right, versus the light-dependent decrease in photochemical efficiency left capital phi sub two right in explaining the Kok effect. Our result suggested that varying capital gamma superscript star over C sub C explained circa twenty-five percent of the Kok effect, while variable capital phi cannot be ignored and explained circa twelve percent of the Kok effect, across various carbon dioxide, oxygen, and temperature conditions. The appreciable contribution of variable capital phi sub two is supported by decreases in the slope of phase two, compared with Phase one, of the A minus I sub abs plots under conditions where photorespiration is greatly suppressed, for example, for C three species under low-oxygen conditions or for C four species.\nncb0 | However, there are still small decreases in the slope of phase two for C three species under low-oxygen conditions or for C four species when A was plotted against I sub abs capital phi sub two. This effect in C four species may reflect the low efficacy of the carbon dioxide-concentrating mechanism, abbreviated C C M, caused by a high leakiness at low irradiances. However, for a C three species, Buckley et al. observed even more significant changes for developing leaves under two percent than under twenty-one percent oxygen conditions, suggesting an involvement of other mechanisms. A fourth mechanism was shown here to potentially contribute to the Kok effect, but we were not able to verify it, as any variable f sub act and or rho sub two are hard to identify at the light intensities showing the Kok effect. Our results, that B one to B two ratios, Table two,\n8mp0 | and R sub D one to R sub D two ratios, Table three, were very close to one at two percent oxygen or seven hundred micromole per mole carbon dioxide suggest that significant involvement of a fourth mechanism was highly unlikely. Thus, our remaining unexplained part, circa sixty-three percent of the Kok effect, is most likely a result of the light suppression of R sub dee, in agreement with the statement of Buckley et al. on the dominant role of this third mechanism.\nxjyk | A dual effect of photorespiration in contributing to the Kok effect\nmt0f | Our strong linear relationships between the B one to B two ratio and the capital gamma superscript star over C sub C ratio, Fig. five a, confirmed previous results in the literature showing that the Kok effect was strongly associated with the occurrence of photorespiration. Perhaps it is because of the significant contribution of varying capital gamma superscript star over C sub C that the Kok effect reported in the earlier days, generally had sharper transition than the recent data because C sub a has been increasing over years. However, the contribution of other factors as discussed earlier means that the Kok effect will never disappear in the future high-carbon dioxide atmosphere; instead, it will continue, but to a lesser extent.\nawab | Our modelling analysis suggests that strong associations between the B one to B two ratio and the capital gamma superscript star over C sub C ratio shown in Fig. five a are the combined result of a dual effect of photorespiration in contributing to the Kok effect. The first-type effect is what Farquhar and Busch discussed on the role of increasing capital gamma superscript star over C sub C with irradiance in explaining the Kok effect, as a result of regulation of g sub S and g sub M. The second-type effect is what we found here - the light inhibition of R sub dee identified after removing the first-type effect was still positively correlated with capital gamma superscript star over C sub C, Fig. seven. Our results suggest that the second-type effect, representing real biological inhibitions, probably contributed more to the Kok effect than the first-type effect.",
