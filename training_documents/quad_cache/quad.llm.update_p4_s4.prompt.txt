You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

a3td | IV. Radical Democracy, Radical Markets
ex5k | However, cautious but increasingly ambitious experimentation seem warranted given the po- tential of QV to create a truly radical democ- racy in several senses. First, and most mechani- cally, QV may also be viewed as individuals re- ceiving votes equal to the square root or radi- cal of the voice credits they spend. Second, QV gets to the roots of what the framers of mod- ern democratic institutions, such as Alexander Hamilton, the Marquis de Condorcet and Jeremy Bentham, viewed as the aim of democracy: to ensure the state serves the general happiness of the people maximally. Third, QV radically ex- pands the rights of citizens to fully and freely ex- press their political views, liberating them from the straight jacket of 1p1v influence rationing. In this sense, it shows how mechanism design can suggest fundamental and yet also practical reforms of social institutions.
9d4o | Yet Vickrey's vision has nearly as much to give to markets for private as public goods. A follower of Henry George, Vickrey was skepti- cal of private property and the central argument of his 1961 classic was that auctioning assets en- sured their efficient allocation, which Myerson and Satterthwaite (1981) show this is impossi- ble beginning from private ownership. One can imagine many assets (other than personal prop- erty) being continuously auctioned for rental ac- cording to Vickrey's favored English auction, much as occurs with internet advertising slots. However, rather than the revenue being appro- priated by a web platform, it could be returned to the public in equal shares as a social dividend, much as envisioned by George. Such a Vick- rey Commons would on the one hand take the logic of the free market to its furthest extreme, while on the other hand abolishing private prop- erty and most inequality. It is the natural private goods markets analog of the radical market logic of QV.
cjq2 | As with the direct application of Vickrey's schemes to collective decisions, a Vickrey Com- mons would face a host of practical challenges and variations on it, such as those proposed by Weyl and Zhang (2017), are of greater practi- cal relevance. Yet as a thought experiment it, along with QV, illustrates the potential to break the deadlocked ideologies of left and right that plague our society. For mechanism designers to
5esx | realize this potential, they will have to broaden their horizons beyond both narrow applications and impractical theory, to learn to be at once idealistic and pragmatic, to deploy rigor flexibly and to account for sociological, psychological, legal and other factors that they have tradition- ally shied away from given their analytical in- tractability. Here we tried to illustrate briefly the challenges and promise of such an approach.
