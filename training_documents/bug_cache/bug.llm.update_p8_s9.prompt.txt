You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

tfra | Analyses
5lm9 | To assess the amount of incremental variance explained by each type of antecedent, we analyzed data with hierarchical regression. First we entered the control variables (firm type, firm size, age, gender, ethnicity, education, group tenure, job status ). Consistent with the work on contextual analysis (e.g., Bedeian, Kemery, & Mossholder, 1989; Firebaugh, 1979; Moss- holder & Bedeian, 1983), we entered the individual-level pre- dictors ( satisfaction with the group and global self-esteem) prior to the group-level predictors (group size and style of manage- ment). Given the past emphasis on satisfaction as an antecedent of voice, we entered satisfaction prior to self-esteem. In the final step, we entered the product terms for each interaction. We assessed the significance of each step with the <LATEX>\Delta F</LATEX> and evaluated individual parameters at each step with t values. We plotted significant interactions using median splits.
wp2c | Results
us5v | Descriptive statistics and intercorrelations are reported in Table 1, and results for the hierarchical regression anal- ysis are summarized in Table 2. Overall, our model ex- plained 17% (14% adjusted) of the variance in voice behavior assessed 6 months later,

Individuals in nonmanufacturing firms engaged in significantly more voice than individuals in manufacturing firms. Men, Whites, and those with at least some college experience engaged in more voice than women, non-Whites, and those with no college experience.
uz9y | Satisfaction with the group explained an additional 3% of the variance in voice behavior 6 months later, <LATEX>\Delta F \left( 1 \right. ,</LATEX> <LATEX>\left. 4 3 1 \right) = 1 6 . 7 3 ,</LATEX> <LATEX>p < . 0 0 1 ,</LATEX> providing support for Hypothesis 1. As expected, group members who were more satisfied with the group engaged in more voice than group mem- bers who were less satisfied with their group.
8ov0 | Global self-esteem explained an additional 1% of the variance in voice behavior 6 months later over and above the variance accounted for by satisfaction with the work group and the controls; however, this relationship was only marginally significant, <LATEX>\Delta F \left( 1 , 4 3 0 \right) = 2 . 8 0 ,</LATEX> <LATEX>p < . 1 0 .</LATEX> Consistent with Hypothesis 2, group members with higher levels of global self-esteem engaged in more voice than group members with lower self-esteem.

Consistent with Hypothesis 4, individuals in self-managed groups exhibited more voice behavior than individuals in traditionally managed groups.
seik | Finally, the block of interactions explained 3% of the variance in voice behavior 6 months later, AF (4, 424) = 3.56, p < . 01. Table 2 shows that both of the self-esteem- situation interactions reached significance. Figure 1 illus- trates the global self-esteem-group size interaction. Con- sistent with Hypothesis 5a, the negative relationship be- tween group size and voice was stronger for individuals with low self-esteem than for those with high self-esteem. Figure 2 shows the global self-esteem and style of man- agement interaction. As predicted by Hypothesis 5b, the positive relationship between self-management and voice was stronger for individuals with low self-esteem than for individuals with high self-esteem.
oq7c | Although Table 2 shows that both of the satisfaction- situation interactions reached statistical significance, the plots illustrated in Figures 3 and 4 did not support Hypoth- eses 6a and 6b. Whereas we expected stronger relation- ships between the situational factors (group size and style of management) for individuals with low levels of satis-

jai3 | Discussion
p57i | Given the increasing prevalence of work groups and the need for flexibility, adaptation, and innovation (Jelinek & Schoonhoven, 1993), voice behavior is an important con- cept that merits increased research attention. Although some studies have examined voice on the basis of Hirsch- man's (1970) model of exit, voice, and loyalty, past re- search had weak explanatory power. This difficulty stems
