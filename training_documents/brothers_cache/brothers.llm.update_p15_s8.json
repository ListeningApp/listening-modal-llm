        "content": "b2lm | Newspaper reports indicate that a \"road-map\" for peace was agreed upon as early as January twenty nineteen. Simultaneously, rumours have circulated that an agreement had\nti7f | been reached on a detailed framework regulating cross-border movement of people and goods, and that only President Isaias Afwerki's approval was pending.\noksu | On the issue of demilitarisation and border demarcation, no concrete movements have been made beyond some redeployment of troops away from the border zone. Ethiopian military forces still occupy territories granted to Eritrea by the EEBC, including the symbolic village of Badme and the more sensitive Irob area. No territories have been vacated and returned to Eritrea.\nwtow | Likewise, Eritrea maintains full mobilisation and has not yet announced any plans to demobilise or to reform the open-ended national service obligation. Neither have any plans been announced for broader political and economic reforms, as for instance instituting the Eritrean Parliament, or implementing the suspended Eritrean Constitution. The country is still governed by Presidential Decrees.\no22k | The formal rapprochement initiated last summer has even taken a step back, with the unexpected unilateral decision by Asmara to close the border crossings for Ethiopians to enter Eritrea in late December twenty eighteen, without any official explanation given by Eritrean (or Ethiopian) authorities as to why this was imposed. Only the Oumhajir-Humera crossing remained partly open for traffic, until it was closed suddenly in late April twenty nineteen.\nnwfz | Subsequently, further restrictions were imposed on Eritreans wanting to cross the ground border into Ethiopia by apparently introducing a differentiated policy. The Eritrean border population is apparently allowed to cross back-and forth on foot with few obstacles. Eritreans from Asmara and other inland towns, however, need to apply for permission from their local authorities to travel to Ethiopia. They must then obtain an exit visa from the immigration authorities in Asmara, presumably similar to an ordinary exit visa. At the border, Eritrean authorities seem to have established an immigration facility where \"inland\" Eritreans need to show their exit permit and register before being allowed to cross over to Zalambessa. People without permits are still crossing, but taking a one-hour detour around the formal check-point. If they are discovered by Eritrean border guards, they are reportedly just ordered to turn back without any further sanction. The active shoot-to-kill policy has thus seemingly been lifted.\nnvfy | Failure to institutionalise peace\nmror | Ethiopia announced in late May twenty nineteen that two trade agreements had been submitted to Asmara for endorsement. One agreement regulated cross-border petty trade, and the other focused on bilateral trade. Interviews conducted in Addis Ababa with high-level government representatives during spring and summer twenty nineteen, however, suggested that these agreements, in addition to a port agreement regulating Ethiopian use of the Eritrean Red Sea ports, in reality had been finalised in early twenty nineteen, but were pending Eritrean input which had been constantly delayed.\nzlxc | Key Ethiopian officials admit off-the-record that \"it takes two to tango\"; they are frustrated and do not understand why President Isaias Afwerki does not appear to want to move forward and institutionalise the peace process. Even Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed alluded to this when he visited Axum in June twenty nineteen: in response to a question from the audience about when the border would be reopened, he admitted that the peace process had stalled. \"It is not only up to us to open the border; there are two sides to the process\", he explained to an impatient crowd of Tigrayans. According to Dr Abraha Negash, Vice President of Tigray, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed also alluded to President Isaias Afwerki's unpredictability in moving the process forward; he believed he had secured an agreement with President Isaias Afwerki to reopen the Zalambessa border crossing in early May twenty nineteen, as the regional government in Tigray received a call from the prime minister's office \"to be ready\" in Zalambessa for cross-border traffic. The regional government sent reinforcements of police and administrative personnel to the border, but nothing happened, and the border remains closed at the time of writing November twenty nineteen. Despite the stand-still of institutionalisation of the peace process and the lack of response from Asmara, the Ethiopian government is preparing a peace dividend with Eritrea by furthering economic collaboration and integration, with policies aiming to establish joint economic activities along their long border and revamping the infrastructure between the two countries.\nk0bw | Inside Eritrea, however, there are few signs of similar activity. Allegedly, rapprochement with Ethiopia had been discussed at some meetings at different political and administrative levels after the signing of the peace agreement. Some interpret this as a preparation for reforms. So far however, no public commitments or statements have been made to this effect. Indeed, in speeches made by President Isaias Afwerki on Liberation Day, twenty-four May and Martyrs' Day, twenty June twenty nineteen, he neither commented on the peace agreements nor hinted at any forthcoming reforms. Rather, he has used the opportunity to tell the Eritrean people that this is a time to consolidate and take\naq5a | stock of their development efforts, and continue their struggle for development as nothing has changed. Likewise, two months after the Nobel Committee awarded the Nobel Peace Prize to Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed in beginning of December twenty nineteen, neither President Isaias Afwerki nor any of his spokespeople had publicly commented upon the award or congratulated their \"brother in peace\".\nsc5y | The absence of any institutionalisation of the peace declaration is obviously an increasing concern. Without this, considering the history of outbreak of war in nineteen ninety-eight, the unpredictability of the process is glaring. Currently, the \"peace\" and \"reconciliation\" content of the formal agreement are concepts held hostage by the political elites in both countries, without any border-population input or influence. Similarly, the re-securitisation of the border restricts its permeability and the possibility of advancing reconciliation and renegotiation of borderlands' identities.\n0yab | Consolidating peace and reconciliation bottom-up?\nw95z | Notwithstanding the hobbled formal top-level negotiation process and the set-back of closing the border, informal people-to-people reconciliation continues. Border populations are reconnecting as individuals and families, neighbouring communities, and even as local government administrators, and security forces on both sides of the border. Eritreans in the borderlands cross back and forth every day, although in dwindling numbers, for petty trade, to buy necessities, to visit friends and family, or to participate in religious or social ceremonies.",
