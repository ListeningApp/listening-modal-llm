        "content": "k5r6 | Least altered volcanic rocks from the Tinakula deposit range from basaltic andesite and andesite to dacite, with basaltic andesite most abundant within and near the volcanic cones. Representative whole-rock geochemical analyses of altered volcaniclastic rocks from drill core are given in Table Four, with the associated alteration assemblages indicated. The least altered host rocks, described by Anderson, twenty eighteen, were identified petrographically by a lack of alteration minerals, loss on ignition less than one point two weight percent, low base metal values less than one hundred eighty-three ppm copper plus zinc plus lead, and no obvious Na two O depletion greater than four point zero weight percent. Data for the three least altered basaltic andesite samples lie on linear trends, with those for the altered samples in plots of Ti O two versus Zr and Ti O two versus Al two O three (Figure Thirteen). Excursions from this linear trend, for example, Zr greater than one hundred sixty ppm at approximately one point five weight percent Ti O two; Figure Thirteen A, may reflect variability in the parental rock compositions, as volcanic rocks in this area show progressive fractionation from basaltic andesite to andesite, for example, Anderson, twenty eighteen. The concentration ranges of immobile and mobile elements for each alteration assemblage are shown in Figure Fourteen. The narrow range of concentrations of Zr, Y, Sc, Nb, Ti, and Al reflect the fact that these elements are least mobile. Concentrations of Ba, Si, Al, Fe, S, Mg, Ca, Na, and K show significant variation, consistent with their inferred mobility during hydrothermal alteration. High Ba, Ca, and S T reflect the abundance of barite and anhydrite/gypsum in the samples. High Fe two O three T and S T are related to pyrite occurrence. Illite-smectite alteration is characterized by relative enrichments in\nz9v9 | K two O compared to the least altered basaltic andesite, whereas chamosite plus corrensite alteration is dominated by Mg O addition. The bulk compositions are transitional between illite/smectite plus pyrite to illite/smectite plus chamosite to chamosite plus corrensite end members, Figure Fifteen.\ngpu9 | The chondrite-normalized Rare Earth Element profiles for the altered volcaniclastic rocks and the least altered basaltic andesite samples, Figure Sixteen, show pronounced positive Eu anomalies, as Eu becomes concentrated in hydrothermal fluids after it is released from plagioclase during water-rock interactions. Smectite-rich assemblages nontronite/montmorillonite and nontronite plus corrensite show slight Rare Earth Element depletion and have flat profiles. The illite/smectite plus pyrite assemblage displays significant light Rare Earth Element enrichment and steeper profiles, whereas the chamosite-rich assemblages illite/smectite plus chamosite and chamosite plus corrensite show moderate light Rare Earth Element enrichment and flat profiles. The change in slope of the light Rare Earth Elements during the main stage of alteration illite/smectite plus pyrite relative to the least altered rock indicates strong mobility. In contrast, the heavy Rare Earth Elements have slopes similar to those of the least altered rocks, which indicates that they are immobile during hydrothermal alteration. The heavy Rare Earth Elements are simply moved up or down relative to the least altered values due to the total mass gain or loss of the rock during alteration.\nu5ws | Major element mass changes were calculated for all alteration assemblages following the single precursor method of MacLean and Barrett using the average concentration of the three least altered samples as the precursor. In this method, the ratio of the concentration of an immobile element in an altered rock to the concentration of that element in the least altered precursor is proportional to the total mass change in the rock due to hydrothermal alteration. We used the proportion of the least mobile element, Zr, in the precursor sample relative to the altered sample to calculate\nonkh | Method abbreviations refer to laboratory methods used by ActLabs: one G equals aqua regia Hg cold vapor flow injection technique, CS equals total sulfur by IR, FUS equals fusion, TD equals total digestion; ICP equals inductively coupled plasma, INAA equals instrumental neutron activation analysis, MS equals mass spectrometry.
