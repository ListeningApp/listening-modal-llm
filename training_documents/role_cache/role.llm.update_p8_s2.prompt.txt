You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).

y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

z8f7 | The genomics-predicted value (GPV) of flesh firmness retain- ability of 473 hybrids and GPV of flesh crispness retainability of 394 hybrids were shown in Tables S8 and S10, respectively. Relatively high prediction accuracy was obtained as 0.5712 and 0.6585 for the retainability of flesh firmness and crispness, respectively (Figure 6b,c). The fivefold cross-validation exhibited an average prediction accuracy of 0.5541 and 0.6018 for flesh firmness and crispness retainability, respectively (Tables S12 and S13). In a simulative selection, when flesh firmness retainability GPV criterion was set as 5.0 months, the selection rate was 2.54% and the efficiency was 100% (12/12), which indicated that the observed phenotype value (OPV) of all the 12 selected hybrids was equal to or longer than 5.0 months (Table S14). When the GPV criterion for flesh crispness retainability was set as 5.0 months, the selection rate was 3.48% and the efficiency was 64.29% (Table S15).
7w7j | Discussion
51vd | Flesh firmness retainability and crispness retainability are the critical properties affecting fruit cold storability. The heritability of flesh firmness and crispness retainability was as high as 83.85% and 83.64%, respectively, which was slightly higher than the estimate (70.0%) for firmness and crispness at harvest or after two month cold storage (Bink et al., 2014; Mckay et al., 2011). Flesh firmness and crispness retention can be prolonged if the initial values of firmness and crispness at harvest are high or if the flesh softening rates during storage are low, or both (Costa, 2015; Johnston et al., 2001; Nybom et al., 2013). In this study, unlike flesh firmness and crispness at harvest, the segregation of flesh firmness and crispness retainability did not displayed Gaussian distribution, a large proportion of hybrids lost accept- able flesh firmness and crispness one month post-harvest.
baj1 | According to the QTL effects in tomato, flesh firmness loss was not predicted by firmness at harvest (Aurand et al., 2012). The phenotype correlations between the initial flesh firmness/crisp- ness and their retainability were also relatively low in this study. In a two-year trial, apple fruit firmness after storage correlated positively with both firmness at harvest and changes in firmness during storage; however, no obvious correlation was observed between changes in firmness and the initial firmness at harvest (McClure et al., 2018). A major QTL for apple fruit firmness retention after storage was identified on chromosome 10; however, a gene encoding ERF (MDP0000855671) was predicted as the candidate rather than the frequently detected MdPG1 in other populations, indicating that the genetics of the trait firmness retention might differ from that of initial firmness at harvest (McClure et al., 2018). In a MetaQTL analysis, of the six MetaQTLs for apple fruit texture attributes, two (MetaQTL6.1 and MetaQTL10.1) were for both firmness at harvest and firmness after two months cold storage, one (MetaQTL10.2) for both softening and firmness after two months, and three for solely softening (MetaQTL5.1), firmness at harvest (MetaQTL15.3), and firmness after two months (MetaQTL15.1), respectively (Costa, 2015). This indicated that these three texture attributes were mutually related but partially independent. High initial flesh firmness or crispness is necessary but insufficient for long-term firmness and crispness retainability. In this study, several new
n1wo | <LATEX>\left. * * P < 0 . 0 1 \right) .</LATEX> QTLs for flesh firmness and crispness retainability were identified on chromosomes 2, 11, 12 and 17, which were previously considered as always having low values for segregating QTLs on these chromosomes (Bink et al., 2014).
5bq3 | The four functional markers, MdACS1, MdACO1, MdPG1 and an expansin gene, MdExp7, for fruit firmness and crispness in apple have been well studied to dissect phenotypic variability among cultivars and hybrids (Costa et al., 2005a, 2008; Harada et al., 2000; Wang et al., 2009). Unfortunately, the empirical predictive power of these four functional markers were limited, with 15% of the observed variation in initial firmness and 18% in softening rate; therefore, their large-scale use for MAS was doubtful (Nybom et al., 2013). The genotypes of commonly used markers on MdACS1 (MD15G1302200) and MdACO1 (MD15G1205100) did not segregate in the 'Zisai Pearl' x 'Red
ezla | Fuji' population (Wu et al., 2020), which offered opportunity to map more QTLs. Ethylene production, however, varied with types of firmness and crispness retainability (Figure 1e,f). RNA-seq data showed that the expression levels of MdACO1, MdACO2, MdACO3 and some ethylene response genes were higher in flesh firmness and crispness unretainable type I hybrids.
rsbu | Flesh firmness and crispness are usually measured simultane- ously; however, they should be two closely relevant but clearly distinct texture attributes (Nybom et al., 2013). One evidence for the close relatedness was that the phenotypic correlation coefficient between the flesh firmness retainability and crispness retainability was as high as 0.8024, which was inconsistent with the previous report (Hardner et al., 2016). Another evidence was that the overlapping QTLs on chromosomes 3 and 16 associated with flesh firmness and crispness retainability. The third evidence
magd | was that variations in MdERF3 and MdERF118 affected both flesh firmness and crispness. On the other hand, retainability of flesh firmness was likely a prerequisite for flesh crispness retainability. Additionally, many QTLs were identified independently for flesh firmness retainability and crispness retainability, which manifested the distinctness of these two flesh texture attributes.
