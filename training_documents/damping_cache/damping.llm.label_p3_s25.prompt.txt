You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

5z6q | Since <LATEX>\mathrm { V } \partial _ { t } M</LATEX> belongs to <LATEX>\mathbb{L} ^ { 2 } \left( \mathbb{R} ^ { + } \times \Omega \right) ,</LATEX> this last term tends to zero as n goes to <LATEX>+ \infty .</LATEX> In the same way we pass to the limit in the other terms to obtain

fj24 | Remark 6. The solutions of (22) are known as harmonic maps to the unit sphere, which turn up in several equations in physics, such as Ginzburg-Landau equation, and were extensively investigated mathematically in the past decades due to their importance both in mathematics and in many applied fields; see, for example, [15, 16]. For the links between harmonic maps and the solutions of the LLG equation we refer to the book [17, Chapter 4]. Some results on the dynamic version of (22) can be found in [18].
uz3c | 3. Limiting Process for High and Small Nonlocal Damping
d5bi | We first analyze the limiting process when <LATEX>\zeta</LATEX> goes to <LATEX>+ \infty .</LATEX> We denote by <LATEX>M ^ { \zeta }</LATEX> a global weak solution of LLG equation (1) associated with <LATEX>\zeta</LATEX> and the initial data <LATEX>M _ { 0 }</LATEX> and satisfying the energy inequality (7). We have the estimates.
ba4l | Lemma 7. There exists <LATEX>C > 0</LATEX> independent of <LATEX>\zeta</LATEX> such that the sequence <LATEX>M ^ { \zeta }</LATEX> satisfies the estimates

s6su | We also have the following.
y219 | Lemma 8. The sequence <LATEX>M ^ { \zeta }</LATEX> is compact in

ko3c | The above convergences allow one to conclude.
xek3 | Theorem 10. Let M be the limit of a subsequence of <LATEX>M ^ { \zeta }</LATEX> as <LATEX>\zeta</LATEX> goes to +00. Then, the domain <LATEX>\Omega</LATEX> is uniformly magnetized.
bbpr | Remark 11. The result of Theorem 10 is of interest. In fact, the added term in the effective field can act as a control for magnetization switching.
5zyf | Our aim now is to pass to the limit as <LATEX>\zeta</LATEX> goes to zero in (1). We denote by <LATEX>M ^ { \zeta }</LATEX> a global weak solution of LLG equation (1) associated with <LATEX>\zeta</LATEX> and the initial data <LATEX>M _ { 0 }</LATEX> and satisfying the energy inequality (7). The bound on <LATEX>\sqrt { \zeta } \nabla \partial _ { t } M ^ { \zeta }</LATEX> in <LATEX>L ^ { 2 } \left( 0 , \widetilde { T } ; L ^ { 2 } \left( \Omega \right) \right)</LATEX> (see (7)) allows one to get the following.

wwdt | (25)
mn1r | Moreover, <LATEX>M</LATEX> satisfies the saturation condition <LATEX>| M \left( t , x \right) | = 1</LATEX> almost everywhere.
5vqw | Remark 13. From (25), we can say that, for lower values of <LATEX>\zeta ,</LATEX> the magnetic nonlocal damping vanishes and the classical switching continues for ever. In other words, the magnetization precesses several times around the effective field direction before it reaches equilibrium.
meyw | 4. Concluding Remarks
2e62 | In this paper, we have considered nonlocal damping in magnetization dynamics. The model consists of a generalized LLG equation that contains a term characterizing nonlocal damping expressed in terms of <LATEX>\Delta \partial _ { t } M</LATEX> in the effective field. The long time behaviour of the solutions is characterized and the sensitivity of the model to nonlocal damping parameter

s2g2 | { is discussed. The results obtained can be applied without difficulty to the case of effective field with anisotropy and demagnetizing fields. Note that the model considered in this paper neglects the additional damping due to transversal spin currents whose form is 0;M x 0;0,M. In this case the LLG equation takes the following form (see Nembach et al. [1]):
