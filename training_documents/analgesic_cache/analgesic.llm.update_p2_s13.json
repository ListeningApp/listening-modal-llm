        "content": "3g2y | Cats were administered acepromazine (zero point one milligrams per kilogram; Acepran zero point two percent; Vetnil Indústria Comércio Produtos Veterinários Ltda, SP, Brazil) intramuscularly as premedication. After fifteen minutes, a twenty-two gauge catheter (Angiocath; Becton Dickinson, SP, Brazil) was placed in a cephalic vein and anesthesia was induced with IV propofol (five-eight milligrams per kilogram; Propovan; Cristália Produtos Químicos e Farmacêuticos Ltda, SP, Brazil); maintenance was accomplished with isoflurane (Isoflorane; Cristália Produtos Químicos e Farmacêuticos Ltda) in sixty-seventy percent oxygen (air-oxygen mixture) administered through a rebreathing circuit. Pressure-controlled ventilation (Anesthesia Machine Inter Linea A; Intermed, SP, Brazil) was instituted with a peak inspiratory pressure of seven-eight centimeters of water, tidal volume eight milliliters per kilogram, inspiratory:expiratory ratio of one to two, and positive end-tidal expiratory pressure one centimeter of water. The respiratory rate was adjusted to maintain end-tidal carbon dioxide partial pressure within thirty-forty millimeters of mercury (five point zero-six point zero kiloPascals). End-tidal isoflurane concentration and inspired oxygen concentration were measured using a side stream gas analyzer (POET IQ2; Criticare Technologies Inc., WI, USA). Heart rate, rhythm (DX twenty twenty multiparametric monitor; Dixtal Biomédica Indústria e Comércio Ltda, SP, Brazil) and Doppler systolic arterial pressure (Doppler eight eleven B; Parks Medical Electronics, OR, USA) were monitored during the entire procedure. Intraoperative IV fluid therapy was lactated Ringer's solution (three milliliters per kilogram per hour).\ngc7v | A remifentanil constant rate infusion (CRI; zero point two micrograms per kilogram per minute; Ultiva two milligrams; GlaxoSmithKline Brasil Ltda, RJ, Brazil) was administered IV with a syringe driver (ST six seventy syringe pump; Samtronic, SP, Brazil) starting after induction of\nwqfv | anesthesia and finishing during abdominal closure. If systolic arterial pressure and/or heart rate increased or decreased by greater than fifteen percent of values immediately before skin incision, remifentanil CRI was increased or decreased, respectively, by zero point one micrograms per kilogram per minute.\nj30a | Cats were randomly assigned by an online random sequence generator to one of three groups, ten cats in each. At ten minutes before the end of the remifentanil CRI, during skin closure, cats were administered IV analgesics according to the assigned group: group D twenty-five, dipyrone (twenty-five milligrams per kilogram every twenty-four hours; D five hundred; Zoetis Inc., SP, Brazil); group D twelve point five, dipyrone (twelve point five milligrams per kilogram every twelve hours); or group M, meloxicam (zero point one milligrams per kilogram every twenty-four hours; Maxicam zero point two percent; Ouro Fino Saúde Animal, SP, Brazil). The drugs were diluted in zero point nine percent saline solution to a final volume of zero point five milliliters for each group. A collaborator prepared the injections so that the evaluator would be unaware of the group assignment. In the first twenty-four hours after anesthesia, the drugs were administered IV. At hospital discharge, the clients were directed to administer the same drug orally for six days (dipyrone) or three days (meloxicam).\n7bdk | All the procedures were performed by a single anesthesiologist (LAG) and a single senior surgeon (JMM) with an assistant using a standardized surgical protocol.\nfim0 | Measurement of ex vivo COX activity\nojro | Ex vivo COX-one and COX-two activities were determined by measuring concentrations of their major enzymatic products, thromboxane B2 and PGE2, respectively, according to an adaptation of a previously described technique. Blood samples (two milliliters) were drawn from the cephalic vein catheter of six randomly selected cats per group and were transferred to a heparin tube and a glass tube at the following time points: immediately before the first analgesic administration and at thirty minutes, four and twenty-four hours. At twenty-four hours, blood was collected before the next drug administration.\nl6t9 | For thromboxane B2 analysis, immediately after collection, one milliliter of whole blood in the glass tube was incubated at thirty-seven degrees Celsius for one hour. Afterwards, the blood was centrifuged at three thousand g for five minutes at four degrees Celsius and one hundred microliters of the supernatant plasma was harvested, added to four hundred microliters of methanol and homogenized. This solution was then centrifuged at six thousand g for ten minutes and stored at negative eighty degrees Celsius until COX-one activity was determined by means of a technique previously described.\n1ujy | For ex vivo COX-two activity, heparinized blood (one milliliter) was immediately transferred into two one point five milliliter polypropylene tubes (five hundred microliters each). One tube contained ten microliters of lipopolysaccharide isolated from Escherichia coli in zero point one percent bovine serum albumin in phosphate buffered saline solution. The second tube contained ten microliters of phosphate buffered saline and was used as the negative control sample. Samples were then incubated at thirty-seven degrees Celsius for twenty-four\nqzor | hours. Afterwards, samples were centrifuged at two thousand g for five minutes at eighteen degrees Celsius, one hundred microliters of plasma were added to four hundred microliters of methanol and homogenized. This solution was then centrifuged at six thousand g for ten minutes at eighteen degrees Celsius; supernatant was harvested and stored at negative eighty degrees Celsius until the time of PGE2 concentration analysis.\na0by | All tests were performed in duplicate and the quantification of thromboxane B2 and PGE2 concentrations were performed with commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits (Thromboxane B2 ELISA kit and PGE2 ELISA kit monoclonal; Cayman Chemical, MI, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions.\nu1ky | Laboratory tests",
