You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

b2lm | On a different note, the advent of seamless and multimodal virtual reference tools has provided users with multichannel points of entry to hubs of information.

Web-based applications on smartphones and other mobile devices provide users with additional mobility, and the global reach " and 24/7 anytime/anywhere point-of-need access of these tools mean that reference services are not place bound.27 These tools proved invaluable to information intermediators for providing reference services at a distance during the pandemic.
ti7f | Despite the use of technology in online interactions, virtual reference interviews are not that dif- ferent from face-to-face transactions because many of the same reference skills and techniques are used. Information professionals today have a variety of virtual reference tools (e.g., text messaging, synchronous reference options, etc.) to support their user needs but also encounter some challenges (e.g., real-time typed interactions can be cumbersome).

For example, Springshare offers LibAnswers as a 24/7 reference cooperative that includes an international multichannel platform using a LibChat widget and the ability for libraries to answer questions via email, SMS, Facebook, and Twitter as well as providing access to FAQ knowledge bases for academic and public libraries.28 Other information institutions participate in consortial arrangements, such as Florida's statewide Ask-a-Librarian consortium of public and academic libraries. However, challenges can arise with consortial reference arrangements when the staffing of the virtual reference desk is shared among various participating libraries, and information professionals are asked to answer questions about library systems with which they have no personal knowledge or experience.
wtow | Technological advances have also impacted readers' advisory services that information pro- fessionals offer, particularly in school and public libraries (see also Chapter 8: Literacy and Media Centers: School Libraries and Chapter 10: Community Anchors for Lifelong Learning: Public Libraries). Information professionals use digital readers' advisory tools (such as NoveList, Goodreads, and even Pinterest) to provide book recommendations on topics ranging from Christian fiction and graphic nov- els to popular crafts and local history. Public libraries also quickly expanded their digital advisory ser- vices when in-person help and in-library browsing were not feasible during the COVID-19 pandemic.

mror | What are the pros and cons of reference services delivered in person, by phone, and by various online virtual methods of communicating?
zlxc | Web 2.0 social tools also encourage reference interactions through blogs, wikis, and group messaging. Social media tools (including TikTok, Instagram, Snapchat, Facebook, and Twitter) are frequently used to engage with personal learning networks, promote library resources and services, and even respond to information queries. The technological advancements in social tools have had a profound impact on library and information services, contributing to changes in the ways that refer- ence services are delivered and to the development of a twenty-first-century service model called Ref- erence 2.0.29 Reference 2.0 is the term used to describe this new service model of collaborative social networking tools used in conjunction with information sources to provide digital reference services.
k0bw | Reference 2.0 services have made it possible to move beyond the place-bound services offered at the reference desk to a two-way seamless interaction between information users and reference librarians that can be used to facilitate information intermediation services. For example, information professionals can:
aq5a | · amplify their social networks by tweeting on Twitter when they may want expert help with spe- cific questions, 30
sc5y | · use social media to promote reference services and enhance information intermediation (see also Chapter 30: Communication, Marketing, and Outreach Strategies), and
0yab | · co-browse with a user through chat services (see also Chapter 12: Virtual Resources and Services).

However, information professionals have unique expertise and skills that are otherwise not available to users via these other alternatives, and they are able to target their services to the needs of their " local communities. Specifically, reference librarians provide value-added help to users with specialized research questions, are able to address patron-driven wants, and provide a "high-tech and high-touch" ap- proach.31 This expertise positions them well to be knowledge professionals in the age of Google and adapt to the myriad circumstances and unforeseen challenges in delivering reference services.

zse6 | Roles for Information Intermediators
p2n3 | As information-seeking behaviors become increasingly user driven, virtual, and self-directed, refer- ence librarians and other information intermediators continue handling traditional reference roles and taking on new methods for mediating between users. Management is one of those areas that plays an important role for providing reference work in all types of settings. For example, information sources need to be collected and managed, while service points used to deliver reference services need to be organized and assessed (see also Chapter 27: Managing Collections).32 This work can range from de- signing online and in-person services that meet the needs of the community being served to evaluating and improving how those services are delivered. Reference librarians also must ensure that reference staff are adequately trained and have ongoing professional development opportunities.
ohh7 | Outreach and marketing of services and resources that are offered by information organizations to the broader community of users are other important areas of responsibility handled by today's reference librarians.33 Although librarians had been using social media for marketing and outreach in addition to more traditional tools for some time, the importance of promoting reference services virtually became much more apparent during the COVID-19 pandemic.
