        "content": "jkp9 | The AKT pathway has a critical role in diverse biological processes including cell proliferation, differentiation, and metabolism. On the one hand, it leads to the assembly of mTORC1, which is critical for regulating mitochondrial metabolism as well as lipid, fatty acid and protein synthesis. On the other hand, the AKT signalling pathway inhibits the activity of the Forkhead box O FoxO transcription factor, which regulates glucose and lipid metabolism. However, the exact role of FoxO in the brain is still unclear. IRS one slash two in addition to or possibly competing with Shc can also activate the MAPK pathway, which plays a key role in many biological processes like cell proliferation, differentiation, development, transformation, and apoptosis. Both Shc and IRS activate Grb two slash Sos complexes, which, in turn, lead to the activation of Ras-Raf-MEK-ERC-cascade and further downstream substrates regulating cell growth-related gene expression and cell proliferation. The relevance of IRS and Shc for activation of the Ras pathways may differ between cell lines and tissues as well as during different stages in brain development and function.\nz8tt | Very recently, a co-receptor called \"inceptor\" was discovered in the pancreas that is involved in the degradation of insulin receptors on beta cells through clathrin-mediated endocytosis. The inhibition of this co-receptor has been shown to be associated with higher insulin secretion and a lower peripheral glucose level, hence providing an interesting target for diabetes treatment. Whether this regulatory co-receptor has a relevant role in the brain is an area of current research.\n9g22 | Two point two. Insulin action in the dopaminergic midbrain\n41fx | For a very long time, hypothalamic nuclei have been considered the only central target of insulin to assure homeostatic control, which was assumed to be segregated from hedonic food reward seeking. However, a wave of fundamental studies has clearly shown that homeostatic\n7um8 | information is integrated into the DA midbrain since a) different neuron populations from the lateral hypothalamus and the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus project to the VTA inducing or inhibiting DA release in the VTA and its projection sites depending on the homeostatic state and b) multiple metabolic hormones including insulin and nutrients also directly act in the DA midbrain. Insulin receptors are co-expressed on DA neurons in the midbrain. And indeed, key regulators of the intracellular insulin-signaling pathway such as IRS two and PI three K slash AKT have been identified to play a critical role in DA signalling in VTA neurons.\nuow2 | Two point two point one. Insulin increases DAT expression and function\niat7 | Particularly, the PI three K slash AKT pathway regulates DA clearance by modulating DAT expression and function. Acute application of insulin to the VTA in vitro reduced somatodendritic DA levels in fast-scan voltammetry through increased DAT clearance in a concentration-dependent manner by activating PI three K and mTOR signalling pathways. In line with this, increased DAT MRNA levels were detected in the VTA after chronic insulin application. In turn, suppression of PI three K signalling, selective DAT inhibition with GBR one two nine zero nine as well as DAT-knockout inhibited the DA-suppressing effect of insulin.\nywwr | Two point two point two. Insulin modulates tyrosine hydrolase TH activity - the rate-limiting enzyme in catecholamine synthesis\n0i6j | Selective knockout of insulin receptors in TH-expressing neurons reduced the expression of TH-MRNA. Moreover, the acute application of insulin on VTA slices directly increases the firing rate of SN slash VTA neurons in patch clamp recordings potentially through PI three K-signalling pathways. However, the exact signalling pathways are still unclear.\n87cq | Two point two point three. Insulin modulates the excitatory and inhibitory inputs on DA neurons\n0qs3 | The VTA receives excitatory glutamatergic input from the prefrontal cortex, lateral dorsal tegmentum, pedunculopontine nucleus PPTg, and lateral hypothalamus. Insulin administration in the VTA decreases the excitatory inputs on DA neurons and induces long-term depression LTD via AKT slash mTOR signalling and endocannabinoid mediated presynaptic suppression of glutamate release, while the inhibitory GABA-ergic inputs remain unchanged. This effect could be driven by PPTg inputs to the VTA, as phasic DA release in the NAc evoked by stimulating PPTg inputs to the VTA is suppressed by intra-VTA insulin. This appears in contrast to the facilitating effects of insulin on the firing rate of VTA dopamine neurons. The spontaneous firing frequency was not different between control and insulin-receptor lacking DA neurons, suggesting that basal endogenous insulin signalling does not influence the firing of DA neurons. However, bath application of insulin increased the firing rate of DA neurons. This may occur via intrinsic mechanisms or through reduced inhibition of D two-receptors. It is possible that insulin has a differential impact on tonic and phasic DA release of VTA neurons: Higher firing frequency might increase tonic DA release in low concentrations in the NAc. And the insulin-mediated suppression of excitatory inputs could decrease the ability to produce phasic bursts, which are particularly relevant for the reward-seeking behaviour. However, these are only speculations and need to be systematically investigated in future studies.\nz8f7 | To summarise the available data, insulin in the VTA reduces extracellular somatodendritic DA concentrations through increased DA re-uptake, reduces LTD of excitatory inputs, and decreases PPTg-evoked DA release in the NAc.\n7w7j | Two point three.
