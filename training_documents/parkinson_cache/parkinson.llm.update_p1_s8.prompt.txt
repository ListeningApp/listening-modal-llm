You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

jdfw | Role of the Endolysosomal System in Parkinson's disease
uc9r | Abstract
l0ap | Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders, affecting 1- 1.5% of the total population. While progress has been made in understanding the neurodegenerative mechanisms that lead to cell death in late stages of PD, mechanisms for early, causal pathogenic events are still elusive. Recent developments in PD genetics increasingly point at endolysosomal (E-L) system dysfunction as the early pathomechanism and key pathway affected in PD. Clathrin-mediated synaptic endocytosis, an integral part of the neuronal E-L system, is probably the main early target as evident in auxilin, RME-8, and synaptojanin-1 mutations that cause PD. Autophagy, another important pathway in the E-L system, is crucial in maintaining proteostasis and a healthy mitochondrial pool, especially in neurons considering their inability to divide and requirement to function an entire life-time. PINK1 and Parkin mutations severely perturb autophagy of dysfunctional mitochondria (mitophagy), both in the cell body and synaptic terminals of dopaminergic neurons, leading to PD. Endolysosomal sorting and trafficking is also crucial, which is complex in multi-compartmentalised neurons. VPS35 and VPS13C mutations noted in PD target these mechanisms. Mutations in GBA comprise the most common risk factor for PD and initiate pathology by compromising lysosomal function. This is also the case for ATP13A2 mutations. Interestingly, a-synuclein and LRRK2, key proteins involved in PD, function in different steps of the endolysosomal pathway and target their components to induce disease pathogenesis. In this review, we discuss these E-L system genes that are linked to PD and how their dysfunction results in PD pathogenesis.
x815 | The endolysosomal system is increasingly recognized as the key pathway affected in Parkinson's disease (PD). Clathrin-mediated synaptic endocytosis, an integral part of the neuronal endolysosomal system, is probably the main early target. Autophagy, another important endolysosomal pathway that aids in maintaining proteostasis and a healthy mitochondrial pool is affected. Other crucial pathways such as endolysosomal sorting and trafficking, along with lysosomal degradation are also hampered. Key PD proteins such as a-synuclein and LRRK2 target the endolysosomal components to induce pathology. Here, we comprehensively discuss these mechanisms to better understand the role of endolysosomal system dysfunction in PD pathogenesis.
epbj | Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, clinically identified by motor symptoms, with an increasing recognition of non-motor manifestations (Hoehn & Yahr 1967; Chaudhuri & Schapira 2009). Loss of dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) (40-50%) and the presence of a-synuclein pathology in surviving neurons are the neuropathological hallmarks of PD. At the onset of motor symptoms, dopamine levels have decreased 60-70% in the dorsal striatum, where most SNpc dopaminergic neurons form synaptic connections (Dickson et al. 2009; Ma et al. 1997; Kordower et al. 2013; Fearnley & Lees 1991) . Under physiological conditions, a-synuclein is predominantly present in presynaptic terminals, aiding neurotransmitter release, whereas in PD, a-synuclein tends to aggregate and form Lewy bodies (the defining a-synuclein pathology in PD) (Spillantini et al. 1998; Spillantini et al. 1997). Aggregation of a- synuclein, perturbed proteostasis, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and impaired calcium homeostasis are the major cell-autonomous mechanisms of PD pathogenesis. Non-

g3tm | cell-autonomous mechanisms include cell-to-cell transmission of pathological a-synuclein and neuroinflammation (Poewe et al. 2017; Jyothi et al. 2015). So far, incomplete knowledge on causal mechanisms has limited treatment strategies to symptomatic relief. Recent studies targeting the endolysosomal (E-L) system reveal that its dysfunction can lead to the mentioned disease mechanisms, suggesting the E-L system as a key pathway in PD pathogenesis. In this review, we discuss important E-L system components, their roles in neuronal survival, and how their dysfunction causes PD.
tfra | The E-L system comprises of complex, highly dynamic membrane-enclosed tubular- vesicular structures with overlapping properties and functions (Klumperman & Raposo 2014). They facilitate nutritional intake from a cell's microenvironment through endocytosis, neutralize pathogenic materials via phagocytosis, promote cellular proteostasis through autophagy, and maintain overall cellular homeostasis through endosomal sorting and trafficking of various proteins/enzymes across organelles (Klumperman & Raposo 2014; Repnik et al. 2013). E-L system functions vary greatly depending on cell type and functional state. Neurons are unique in their highly polarized intracellular compartmentalization of cell body/soma and processes including axons, axon terminals, and dendrites. This organization enables them to form complicated networks that mediate specialized functions (Figure 1). This complexity comes at a price: burdensome demands on the E-L system, which have been increasingly implicated in neurological diseases including PD (Kett & Dauer 2016; Wang et al. 2018).
5lm9 | In neurons, synthesis of E-L components occurs primarily in the cell body/soma (Figure 1A). These components are trafficked through the secretory pathway to their subcellular location. A prime example of this is lysosomal hydrolase trafficking. Lysosomal hydrolases are produced in the endoplasmic reticulum, then undergo glycosylation and other post- translational modifications at the Golgi apparatus [e.g. addition of mannose-6-phosphate (M6P) groups] (Nixon & Cataldo 1995). This modification directs hydrolases to lysosomes. More specifically, hydrolases form complexes with transmembrane M6P receptors, which are sequestered into clathrin-coated vesicle (CCVs) budding from the trans-Golgi networks (TGN) to form endosomes/early endosomes (Nixon & Cataldo 1995) (Figure 1A). Inside early endosomes, M6P receptors detach from hydrolases and are recycled back to the TGN for their next round of transport (Saftig & Klumperman 2009), while hydrolases are delivered to lysosomes (discussed below).
wp2c | Simultaneously, early endosomes are also derived from the cell surface through the endocytic pathway, an integral part of the E-L system. Many of the nutrients required for neuronal function and surface receptors designated for recycling are internalised through clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) at the plasma membrane and delivered to early endosomes (Figure 1A). Early endosomes derived from both the TGN and the plasma membrane mature into late endosomes, where Rab5 and Rab7 play a prominent role (Saftig & Klumperman 2009). This process occurs with the help of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) (Figure 1A), which facilitates ubiquitin-dependent sorting of cargo/hydrolases from the outer membrane of early endosomes into interluminal vesicles
