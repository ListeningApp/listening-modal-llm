        "content": "vbni | Bio-Panning. In each bio-panning round, the input and output phases were titrated immediately before or after the experiment. The results of titrations are shown in Table one. The presented mean P left parenthesis O divided by I right parenthesis value for each bio-panning round may be interpreted as the efficiency of phage binding. In chemical nomenclature, P left parenthesis X right parenthesis is defined as negative log left parenthesis X right parenthesis, so a higher P left parenthesis O divided by I right parenthesis means a lower ratio of phage output-input. The P left parenthesis O divided by I right parenthesis value for the first panning round is relatively low. However, usage of more concentrated Tween-twenty (from zero point one to zero point five percent) causes a significant increase in P left parenthesis O divided by I right parenthesis values for the second round (around four) despite a higher phage input. In addition, there is a difference between the second and the third P left parenthesis O divided by I right parenthesis, which may be interpreted as an enrichment of TnT-binders in the phage pool, and it is the main aim of bio-panning via phage display. The increase in phage recovery yield is a widely reported observation by manufacturers and other authors.\ndgcw | Screening of Isolated Variants. The best TnT binders were isolated via ELISA screening (Figure one). As a negative\ngvwz | control, wild-type M-thirteen phage was used. Selected clones provide higher signals for TnT-containing wells than for bovine serum albumin (BSA, negative control). It is worth mentioning that both TnT- and BSA-precoated wells were blocked with the same zero point one percent BSA solution, so BSA was present in each well in significant excess. Nevertheless, the presence of TnT causes a noticeable increase of signal, which may suggest a higher affinity of clones to TnT than BSA. Signals from wells that do not contain phages (blank sample) and wild-type phage, which does not expose any peptide, are at least two to five\nsk5m | times lower than signals from the analyzed clones. This result confirms the impact of the displayed peptide on phage behavior against TnT and BSA. The significant drawback of this experiment is the inequality of concentrations of different clones because although all solutions were about ten to the power of ten pfu per milliliter, the exact value of the pre-exponential factor differed. Nevertheless, a comparison of the signal of each clone for TnT and BSA reveals a difference.\nqws8 | Analysis of Exposed Peptides on the Selected TnT- Binding Phages. Sequencing of a fragment of gene encoding p-three minor coat protein showed the presence of twelve-amino-acids peptide at the N-terminus in almost all phages. Simultaneous analysis of the sequenced variants (Table two) shows some conservative motifs in all four independent phage pools recovered after three rounds of bio-panning. The peptides DHAQRYGAGHSG (frequency four out of sixteen proper sequences) and QMGFMTSPKHSV (frequency eight out of sixteen proper sequences) are the most abundant. The isoelectric point (calculated using the online tool) of almost all sequenced peptides is above pH seven point four. The recognition steps were performed in PBS, making these peptides positively charged. This result may suggest that these peptides interact with TnT via electrostatic interactions because, in these conditions, the N-terminal region of TnT is negatively charged. In these peptides, predominantly hydrophilic amino acids with hydrogen bond donor groups are present, enabling them to interact with the glutamate-rich regions (which may act as hydrogen bond acceptors). Interaction with the negatively charged helical N-terminus may play a crucial role in recognizing the cardiac TnT isoform due to the tissue-specificity of this region. In conserved central and C- terminal TnT regions, there is a low number of aromatic amino acids (Phe: six, His: four, Trp: three, Tyr: four); however, this fact and the coincidence with the conservation of His residue in most of the peptides may suggest possible sites of interaction via T-T stacking. Additional studies are needed to prove the site where selected peptides may interact with TnT; however, the mentioned conserved positively charged peptides and His residue give hope that the site is located in the cardiac-specific N-terminal region.",
