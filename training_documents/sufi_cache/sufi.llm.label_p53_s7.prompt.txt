You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

06yq | Microdosing with psychedelics to self-medicate for ADHD symptoms in adults: A naturalistic study

2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

l3do | So important is this lesson that it can be said to go before all others: in the sense that failure to know this can prevent you from learning more - and can leave you attached to the externals of hypocrites. This includes, of course, unconscious hypocrites.
u9bo | If the Sufis are right in their claim that time affects behaviour, and that personal appearance should change (and even tempera- ment) then obviously all the people who cultivate a reverend appearance, and all those who acquire it, mistaking this for spirituality, are wrong.
7avo | 53
uzo6 | It is this unspoken contradiction which makes it almost im- possible for people who want continuity and easily identifiable teaching figures, to accept the change in circumstances and atti- tudes which the Sufi Way demands.
89b4 | These people, of course, will not have thought it out like this. All they know is that 'A holy man must seem holy to me'; or 'If he always behaves in the same manner, or always exhorts me to the same things, I believe that he may be right'.
5f7e | The other problem is that the observer is confusing, as he is bound to confuse without having understood, continuity and con- sistency with reliability or truth. Because butter always tastes the same when it looks the same, he expects a similar 'reliability' in his spiritual teacher. He is, of course, self-deceived in this as- sumption.
h83u | The genesis of the attitude adopted by the people of externals is that their inward drive is for finding tidiness, order. This is not a spiritual activity, it is perhaps, rather, a therapeutic one. Order is essential for disordered people. Looking for it as a major factor in 'esoteric' directions is the mistake.
kjoa | In trying to make what - for them - is order out of what they imagine to be the disorder of Sufi tradition, they have to over- simplify. They ignore parts of the teaching and succeed only in creating an imitation of Sufism.
wb1c | Because so many people desire order so strongly, you will find more imitations than reality. One cannot blame anyone for this. But pointing out facts can help.
ak13 | WHAT A TEACHER SHOULD BE
s7el | Ibn Arabi's dictum on this matter has not been bettered:
0lfu | 'People think that a teacher should display miracles and mani- fest illumination. But the requirement in a teacher is that he should possess all that the disciple needs.'
cnjl | BEYOND APPEARANCES
rtdl | In order to possess what a disciple needs, the Teacher must be one who has gone beyond appearances and has realised his inner-
norp | 54
chx3 | most self, after transcending the barriers imposed by attach- ment to secondary factors. He really exists and is aware of this existence. As Ibn Arabi says: 'Absolute existence is the source of all existence'.
sfcf | Hallaj put it in this way, indicating the peculiarity of the realised individual:
nuxs | 'I am the Real, for I have not ceased to be real-through the Real.'
umx0 | Sufi teachers who have reached stages where strange things happen in their vicinity, generally called miracles and wonders, due to actions other than any attempt to impress, have to try to compensate for this. Otherwise people are attracted to them or to the Sufis in general because of a craving for wonders.
o306 | THE ONION SHOP
qm1b | One example of this is when the great woman Sufi Rabia had no vegetables in the house, and mentioned it. Suddenly a string of onions fell from the sky, it seemed, and people cried out that this was a proof of divine blessing.
n9ms | Conversions through miracles, Rabia realised, are only emo- tional happenings and have no essential spiritual reality. So she said, in a famous phrase:
icdp | 'A miracle, you say? What, does my Lord therefore keep an onion shop?'
wtse | 55
bm7g | Books and Beyond Books
jr68 | Q: What is the compatibility, if any, of the Sufi book and the Sufi teaching beyond books?
axix | A: Many people say that they cannot learn from books.
05y4 | INSTRUMENTAL FUNCTION
2fb0 | Of course they cannot: because they have first to learn that, correctly guided, they can learn from books, or from grass- hoppers, or from anything.
s9fn | A book, for the Sufis, is an instrument as much as it is some- thing to give information.
k5r6 | Information and action are both necessary.
z9v9 | The key is the teacher.
gpu9 | If he says: * Read this book' then you should read it.
u5ws | If your answer is: 'I cannot learn from books', then you are in fact refusing his teaching.
onkh | If you refuse teaching, do not be surprised if you do not learn anything.
8t55 | You may be one of those whose problem is that you do not want to learn, and your saying T want to learn' is a protection against ever learning: an incantation, in fact.
7imw | No real teacher will mistake a man or woman who merely says: 'I want to learn' for one who undoubtedly wants to learn.
lf1t | That is why so many people have to go through stages which will show them that their condition (while they claimed that they wanted to learn and could not find the materials) was an un- suitable basis for learning.
tze7 | REALITY AND POTENTIALITY
ryvv | Man has to come to understand how to see himself as he really is, so that he can achieve something in the area which he calls 'what he might be'.
zdrh | 56
osmo | Again, it is the teacher who knows what is indicated: whether his student has to develop through linear or other modes. As Khaja Khan says, traditionally, direct teaching beyond books, the mystery of unification, was taught to the spiritual elite, while the linear Holy Law (the Islamic Shariyya) was given to the ordinary people. In this way the limited could rise via discipline, the Shariyya, and the elite were able to descend to the Law by means of the Truth of immediate perception.
0b8v | According to the Sufis, there is only one Essence, Reality (Haqq = Truth). Derived from this is appearance, Form, referred to by Ibn al-Arabi, in his Fusus al-Hikam, and others, as Khalq, that which is created, secondary. To mistake the secondary for the primary is usual and humanity has to learn how to avoid this. But living in a secondary realm, 'the world', humanity must learn the value and limitations of the secondary, of phenomena. The limitations include the fact that such derivatives cannot help one beyond a certain stage with anything. The value is the occasions and circumstances in which such things can be of help, and the kind of use they can be.
fucs | VALUE OF THE RELATIVE
yply | 'The Relative is the Channel to the Absolute' (Al-majazu qantarat al-Haqiqa) encapsulates this statement. The Sufi's experience in- forms him in relation to knowing how to deal with the secondary factors, and hence enables him to teach.
75n5 | The Sufi teaching through books, or through the use of scholas- tic methods applied to indicate their absurdity or limitations, was demonstrated one day by Shaqiq of Balkh when Haroun al- Rashid visited him seeking wisdom.
ec91 | THE VALUE OF A KINGDOM
wul6 | The Caliph, in all his magnificence, was in need of a lesson in the relative nature of power and possessions. 'Ask a favour of me', be said.
4rhy | Shaqiq asked him whether he would give one-half of his realm
092d | to someone who would give him a drink of water, if he were dying of thirst in a desert.
94ul | Haroun said that he would.
0vdu | And, continued the Sufi, would he give the other half to some- one who enabled him to pass that water, if he had become unable to do so?
a230 | Haroun said that he would.
dvoe | Now Shaqiq asked the Caliph to reflect why he valued his kingdom so highly, when it was something which could be given away in return for a drink of water, which itself does not stay with one.
677t | People assume, like the Caliph, that they have something of value and that by giving some of it away they can gain something of even greater value. They tend, too, to offer not what they have to get rid of, but something which they can give because they want to.
5hk6 | Therein lies the genesis of trade, and a desirable thing it is, too - if confined to trade. Therein, too, lies the desire to prescribe one's own studies, one's own path: 'Ask a favour of me', as the Caliph put it.
viei | But, as the Sufis never tire of saying, the Path has its own requirements, and the things which people want to do are likely to be those which will help them to continue in the way in which they are already set, rather than in a direction which will break through their limitations.
rk0j | Because Sufi affairs do not seem to resemble the kind of organisation of studies familiar to most people, they imagine that they have to be carried out in a completely incoherent manner. It is worth listening to what Aftab-ud-Din Ahmad has to say about this, in his Introduction to a version of Gilani's Fuiuh al-Ghaib:
c6x9 | SUFISM AS A SCIENCE
g5at | 'The word "mysticism" [employed in English for Sufism] has an elusive atmosphere about it, whereas tasaamif [Sufism] is a regular science with its set laws and a full scheme in detail. It is based on palpable experiences which can be reproduced, like in any other science, under set circumstances. Every pilgrim has to
re3j | 58
6z45 | pass through the same stages in his spiritual journey and these stages are readily recognisable by their detailed descriptions given unanimously by all masters. The landmarks and pitfalls are des- cribed in equally exhaustive particulars. Just as in any other course of study, there are methods in it to test the progress of the disciple and his merit. As in any other branch of knowledge, there are geniuses in this branch of study who create a stir in the world .. . '*
20af | GARBLED MESSAGE
huae | Books and other methods of mass-communication are used selec- tively by Sufi teachers. And there are cases where the message is garbled, so that they do not use certain versions of them at all. Some translations, for instance, contain ludicrous errors, even when made by experts. This sort of garbling can happen with anything, and only a human guide can put things to rights.
rblh | THE NEWS-STORY
gl5i | The British Broadcasting Corporation, within hours of the death of King Faisal of Saudi Arabia, put out a recording of a highly emotional account of the assassination taken from the Saudi network. This, you would imagine, must be something on which one could rely. But there was only one problem about the BBC's version: it was in fact the final minute of the Czech language commentary on the Ali-Wepner fight in Cleveland, Ohio. Reading some 'Sufi' materials, they sound the same ...

mjt8 | Saintliness
htcn | Q: Can you say something about saintliness and Sufi teachers?
86d4 | A: The people who are.most anxious about finding, following, refuting or dealing in some way with Sufi teachers tend to be those least able to identify or locate them.
z7qp | This is because the searchers are usually looking for obses- sional: people who cannot help behaving in a way which an- nounces, twenty-four hours a day, I am a spiritual man'.
6t1g | Those who lead ordinary Uves, or who lack the trappings, are invisible to the anxious.
cpls | But the reverse of this opinion is more likely to be the case. Those who signal by manner, impedimenta and otherwise that they are to be regarded as authorities are in fact usually the superficialists.
m50n | The 'saintly' appearance is one of three things, in all branches of esoteric activity, Sufism included:
eztf | 1. Imitation by superficialists.
bwsu | 2. Adopted by indoctrination or obsession.
oqod | 3. Affected as a temporary or superficial measure to signal to those who can perceive only this aspect.
tey0 | The task of the teacher and the student is to get beyond the appearance as soon and as completely as possible.
ghiv | SERVICE
o5ts | It is on this subject that Saadi of Shiraz wrote the poem, in his Bostan, 'The Orchard':
hd7d | The Path is not other than the service of the people: It is not in the rosary, the prayer-rug and the dervish robe.
ehux | 60
poxj | WHAT A SAINT IS AND DOES
2xvb | Saintlincss, which superficialists identify with what are too often superficial actions and appearance, lies, as Saadi reminds us, in the service of the people. People who seek saintliness are only to be taken seriously if they are also concerned with human service.
m1hx | Saintship, being a saint, as Dr. A. E. Affifi rightly remarks, according to Sufi lore, 'does not mean holiness or piety, although such characteristics may accidentally be found in a saint ... Any man is a saint ... if he possesses such a degree of 'gnosis' (supreme knowledge) as would enable him to understand his exact relationship to God (Reality) of whom he is but a manifestation, and to realise his essential oneness with the One Reality. In other words, a man is a saint if he is what Ibnul Arabi calls a "Perfect Man" ...*
9psh | KNOWLEDGE AND BEHAVIOUR
aiqv | Saintship is not in miracles, not in looking devout. The test is in knowledge. People ask: 'How can knowledge be as good as behaviour and belief?' The Sufi answer is that without knowledge there is no certainty that behaviour is right, and no guarantee that belief is real. Real religion and real correct behaviour come through knowing what religion is and knowing what should or should not be done: not in accepting the local cultural norms without experience.
4klz | Sufis have constantly maintained that knowledge accords with holiness and generally accepted behaviour: but not with the counterfeit of these which are all that mainly exist in the self- deceived 'good' people.
xz5d | Saintliness, if by this we mean appearances, including supposed wonders or the effect which someone has on other people who conclude on this basis that he is a saint, is entirely subjective and cannot be called saintliness at all in the Sufi sense.
erwx | A DOG HAS PRECEDENCE
ie7i | Bayazid Bistami, walking through the streets with some of his followers, made an occasion to demonstrate the shortcomings of
aksw | 61
0fsl | such superficial assessments, as reported in Attar's Musibat-Nama, 'The Book of Calamity'.
0m3g | A dog was walking towards them, and Bayazid made way for it. One of the disciples thought to himself that this must be wrong: Bayazid was a great saint, accompanied by students, allotted a high status, and a dog was after all only a dog.
9sp0 | Bayazid perceived this man's feelings and explained.
nbpk | The dog had seen them coming and had projected the thought to Bayazid that he must be sinful to have been created a dog, while this great man must be saintly because he was able to appear in such a resplendent and honoured form.
xs3r | Tt was because of this idea of that dog's,' said Bayazid, 'that I gave him precedence.'
ffuj | 62
h7f6 | Secrecy
t74k | Q: There seems to be no traditional psychology or similar study without a conception of secrets and secrecy. Why is this, and what is the nature of this secrecy?
qdn7 | A: Among the Sufis, the technical term 'secret' is applied to 'the innermost consciousness of man', and may be found authori- tatively rendered as such. It is common knowledge among people of traditional spiritual systems that there are differences in the significance and emphasis of the idea of the 'secret*, according to the condition of the person involved.
