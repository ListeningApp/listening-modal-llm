Thus the entropy of the gas is\n4fln | S sub i equals left parenthesis expected value of E sub i minus F sub i right parenthesis divided by T equals k N left parenthesis ln fraction V over Lambda cubed plus three halves right parenthesis minus k ln N factorial. In short, it is k ln N less than for the gas of distinguishable particles. This makes beautiful intuitive sense: there are N factorial permutations of the particles that we no longer care about in the indistinguishable case.\ntmlf | STIRLING'S FORMULA\noy09 | Stirling's formula says\nwvb1 | approximately equal to square root of two pi N left parenthesis N divided by e right parenthesis to the power of N\nqi9a | N factorial\nr7ii | and it gives ln N factorial approximately equal to left parenthesis ln N minus one right parenthesis N plus one half ln two pi N where the error goes to zero as\nezxx | N approaches positive infinity. Now we need a bit of math: Stirling's formula for the factorial function. In one form this says\nzzb7 | limit as N approaches positive infinity of the fraction square root of two pi N left parenthesis N divided by e right parenthesis to the power of N divided by N factorial equals one. We abbreviate this fact, that the ratio of two quantities approaches one as N approaches positive infinity, by saying N factorial is asymptotic to square root of two pi N left parenthesis N divided by e right parenthesis to the power of N. We also write\nzts3 | N factorial asymptotic to square root of two pi N left parenthesis N divided by e right parenthesis to the power of N. where the symbol asymptotic to means 'asymptotic to'.\nq5zo | If we take the logarithm of both sides we get\nz20w | ln N factorial approximately equal to left parenthesis ln N minus one right parenthesis N plus one half ln two pi N. The symbol approximately equal has a vaguer meaning: 'approximately equal to'. But it turns out that in this instance the approximation is extremely good: the difference between the left and right sides goes to zero as N approaches positive infinity. In fact we will content ourselves with a cruder approximation:\nig3d | ln N factorial approximately equal to left parenthesis ln N minus one right parenthesis N because in the entropy entropy of an ideal gas N is typically huge, so the term we have discarded here is dwarfed by the others.\ndgts | N approximately equal to six times ten to the power of twenty-three. What is the ratio of fraction one half ln two pi N to\np1zf | N? While deriving Stirling's formula is fascinating and not at all trivial, doing so would take us rather far afield. So I will resist, and refer you instead to this:\nk0wj | THE SACKUR-TETRODE EQUATION\np83v | In thermal equilibrium, an ideal gas of N indistinguishable classical particles in a three-dimensional box of volume V has entropy\n5yts | S sub i equals k N left parenthesis ln fraction V over Lambda cubed plus three halves right parenthesis minus k ln N factorial where Lambda equals Planck's constant divided by square root of two pi mass Boltzmann constant T is the thermal wavelength.\nl1qt | Using Stirling's formula\n183q | ln N factorial approximately equal to left parenthesis ln N minus one right parenthesis N we get the Sackur-Tetrode equation:\nvdw3 | S sub i approximately equal to k N left parenthesis ln fraction V over N Lambda cubed plus five halves right parenthesis Taking our formula\n8whh | S sub i equals k N left parenthesis ln fraction V over Lambda cubed plus three halves right parenthesis minus k ln N factorial and using a simple version of Stirling's formula, ln N factorial asymptotic to left parenthesis ln N minus one right parenthesis N, we get the famous Sackur-Tetrode equation:\niywu | S sub i asymptotic to k N left parenthesis ln fraction V over Lambda cubed plus three halves right parenthesis minus k left parenthesis ln N minus one right parenthesis N asymptotic to k N left parenthesis ln fraction V over N Lambda cubed plus five halves right parenthesis. Note that with this formula, if we multiply both V and N by the same constant, the entropy also gets multiplied by that constant. In this situation we say the entropy is 'extensive'.\nqn1v | For a better approximation, we can use\no9ng | ln N factorial approximately equal to left parenthesis ln N minus one right parenthesis N plus one half ln two pi N where the error goes to zero as N approaches infinity. This gives a correction to the Sackur-Tetrode equation:\n6od4 | S sub i approximately equal to k N left parenthesis ln fraction V over N Lambda cubed plus five halves right parenthesis minus one half ln two pi N. Here if we multiply both V and N by a constant c, we don't just multiply the entropy by c: we also have to subtract one half ln two pi c. So the entropy is not quite extensive but this effect is tiny when you've got a mole of gas.\njx1z | THE ENTROPY OF AN IDEAL MONATOMIC GAS\n```",
