You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

495n | 3. Extending the range of linear response with synthetic forcings. We discuss in this section the notion of synthetic forcings, and how they can be used to extend the regime of linear response. We start by describing the notion of synthetic forcings in Section 3.1, and give examples in Section 3.2 for both overdamped and underdamped Langevin dynamics. Then, we provide a methodology for choosing the magnitude of the forcings in Section 3.3. Finally, we briefly discuss how to linearly combine multiple extra forcings in Section 3.4.
awri | EXTENDING LINEAR RESPONSE WITH SYNTHETIC FORCINGS
bl28 | 3.1. Notion of synthetic forcings. As discussed in Section 2.1.1, a system with a nonequilibrium perturbation has a generator of the form
d5bz | (3.1) Cn = Lo + n Õ,
ap5o | where L is the generator of some perturbation to the reference dynamics with gener- ator Lo. We considered in Section 2 only the case where L is Lphys - in other words, the perturbation corresponds to some physical perturbation on the system, which is the typical scenario in the context of statistical physics. We now consider, in addition to the physical perturbation, some possibly nonphysical extra perturbation, which we denote by Lextra, so that £ in (3.1) is replaced by
7zvf | Č = Čphys + aČextra,
mov9 | for o E R. We call the resulting perturbation a synthetic forcing.
ks7m | The key requirement of synthetic forcings is that the the addition of the extra forc- ing should preserve the invariant measure of the reference dynamics, thus preserving the linear response. In other words, the dynamics with generator
w1w1 | Ln,a = Lo + n (Čphys + aČextra)
h8gv | has the same linear response as the dynamics associated with Ln,o = Lo + nCphys when
kwkp | Čextra 1 = 0.
yj0m | (3.2)
ewfp | We denote by Un,a the invariant measure for the dynamics associated with the gen- erator Ln,Q, i.e. the solution to the stationary Fokker-Planck equation
oczy | (3.3) Ch, aUn, a = 0.
2ttg | When there is no indication of the value of a, e.g. Vn, it means that a = 0.
his3 | From the definition (2.26) of the linear response 01, it is indeed easy to see why the linear response is preserved with the addition of Lextra: the conjugate response S defined in (2.10) is preserved, and so is f1 in view of (2.24), which allows us to conclude by Lemma 2.2. Let us emphasize that (3.2) is the key condition to be satisfied for extra forcings to be admissible. We provide various examples of admissible extra forcings in Section 3.2. For technical reasons, the extra forcings we consider should satisfy the same conditions as Lphys in Assumption 4.
m50z | One practical interest is to optimize the extra perturbation in order to increase the regime of linear response. As made precise in Proposition 2.4, the variance of the estimator (2.38) is of order O(n-2). A larger linear regime therefore means that larger values of n can be considered without introducing too much bias on p1. This leads in turn to a smaller statistical error, and hence shorter simulation times to reach the same accuracy. One idea in particular is to look for Lextra which minimizes 02, the leading order n2 of the nonlinear response, as a proxy for minimizing |En(R) - pin|, i.e. the nonlinear portion of the response. This is discussed in detail in Section 3.3. This also naturally suggests that one could further combine k forcings in order to cancel the first k + 1 orders of the response, as discussed in Section 3.4.
me84 | Another approach to optimizing the perturbation is to increase the range of n for which the nonlinear response is within some desired distance from the linear regime, in relative error, also discussed Section 3.3.

90k5 | 3.2. Examples of synthetic forcings. To make synthetic forcings more con- crete, we now go over some examples of extra forcings. We first outline in Section 3.2.1 the general classes of operators we consider. We then discuss more precisely examples for overdamped Langevin dynamics in Section 3.2.2 and for underdamped Langevin dynamics in Section 3.2.3.
9m8s | 3.2.1. General classes of extra forcings. When considering possible extra forcings, we restrict ourselves to differential operators of at most second-order in order to realize them in Monte Carlo simulations. We consider the following classes of differential operators:
893y | (1) First-order differential operators Lextra = GTVr, with G: X > Rd such that div(Gyo) = 0. The latter condition ensures that (3.2) is satisfied since Lextra = - GTV. r;
favz | (2) Second-order differential operators of the form Lextra = - 0* dzi or more gen- erally -ot Dijoxi for some (nonnegative) function Dij: X -> R+. In the case Cextra = - Ox Ox;, the operator is self-adjoint, i.e. Cextra = L'extra, so that (3.2) is easily seen to hold. For Lextra = - Og Dijoxi, it holds that Lextra = - Og Dijox;, which also satisfies (3.2).
7szx | (3) First-order differential operators with nontrivial zero order parts, such as Lextra = 0* = Ox U - Oxi for yo(x) = e-U(x). Through some abuse of nota- tion, we use dr U to denote the multiplication operator by the function dz. U. These operators satisfy Lextra = 0x., so that (3.2) holds.
hx9e | The class of extra forcings outlined in items (1) and (2) can be easily implemented and realized in Monte-Carlo simulations. Implementing forcings of the form described in item (3), however, requires some extra work to take care of the multiplication operator, as we now discuss.
