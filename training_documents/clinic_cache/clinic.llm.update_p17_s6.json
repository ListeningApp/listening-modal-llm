        "content": "tfra | This systematic review has many strengths including analyses of very large amount of clinical data from several settings and countries reflecting global periodontal practices, which increases its external validity and power. Limitations are evident, such as potential selection bias due to exclusion of studies, cases with no available data and restriction to studies published from twenty seventeen. Most included studies were retrospective cohort studies. Information and residual confounding bias cannot be excluded because of the unavailability of some of the required data. Multi-level and meta-regression analyses were not performed, as not all required data were available. Therefore, the low tooth loss rate may not be generalizable for all periodontitis patients. Including different stages of periodontitis and APT protocols may affect the discriminative power of the study. Study selection was limited to those published after twenty seventeen, as they better reflect current practice globally, particularly since official endpoints were proposed by the WWC twenty seventeen. IPD analyses are resource-intensive and we felt a five-year restriction, which still included twelve thousand eight hundred eighty-four subjects, would be pragmatic.\n5lm9 | Further research is required to assess the different endpoints and their accuracy when predicting tooth loss, oral-health-related quality of life and the systemic impact of periodontitis, which collectively form the true endpoints of periodontitis.\nwp2c | Overall, the data collected from twelve thousand eight hundred eighty-four periodontitis subjects and presented here demonstrate the following:\nus5v | An overwhelming majority of subjects and teeth do not successfully achieve 'stability' or meet the recommended 'endpoints of therapy' of current guidelines following APT. This suggests that either periodontal treatment still has a long way to go before being considered efficacious or the currently proposed endpoints are not realistic. We, with a certain degree of optimism based on the relatively low tooth loss during SPC, would like to believe in the latter.\nrs2m | Certain surrogate endpoints may be more relevant at the tooth level than at the subject level. Endpoints should be specific to the tooth type if more personalized treatment approaches are required.\nuz9y | The present findings apply to patients compliant with SPC. Yet, non-compliant patients represent a major proportion of treated patients. The generalizability of the results may depend on the extent, stage and grade of periodontitis.\n8ov0 | Periodontally involved teeth can be well maintained when compliant with SPC. Rethinking endpoint selection may resolve any\nmj9m | controversy surrounding periodontal treatment efficacy, particularly in relation to five-year tooth survival rates, and prevent unnecessary overtreatment. Furthermore, as healthcare moves towards personalized medicine and the paradigm surrounding pathogenesis of periodontitis has shifted to consider the individual's host immune-inflammatory response, it may be justified to consider individualized endpoints acknowledging the patients' demographic, systemic and lifestyle factors.\n94h3 | AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\n9jx1 | We are indebted to all authors of studies included who have very kindly provided the data used for the analyses described: Professor Pierpaolo Cortellini, Professor Maurizio Tonetti, Professor Mario Aimetti, Dr Cristina Vidotto, Dr Greta Barbe, Dr Isabel Scharfenberg, Dr Amelie Baumer, Dr Yan Wang-Kuffer, Dr James Collins, Dr Raluca Cosgarea, Dr Fridus van der Weijden, Dr Dagmar Slot, Dr Christian Graetz, Dr Birte Holtfreter, Professor Huanxin Meng, Dr Jian Jiao, Dr Muhammad Saleh, Dr Andrea Ravida, Professor Hom-Lay Wang and Dr Sarah Sonnenschein.
