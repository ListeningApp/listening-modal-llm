o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

cwrw | In general, while the dopamine nerve terminals are destroyed in the striatum/putamen after toxin administration, transport of neurotrophic molecules to the substantia nigra may still be possible retrogradely, as described above, or anterogradely via medium spiny projection neurons, thus demonstrating that striatal injection of AAV carrying neurotrophic factors is a viable therapy for Parkinson's disease. Although, the anterograde transport of GDNF to the substantia nigra may not be as effective on functional restoration as compared with retrograde transport, it may be beneficial not to overexpress proteins in stressed substantia nigra dopamine neurons in patients.
4i0e | 3. AAV to Target Substantia Nigra
h2l3 | Taking into consideration the special characteristics of substantia nigra dopaminergic cells (see above), targeting these neurons with AAV vectors can be challenging. For example, if a promoter driving a gene of interest is giving exceptionally high expression levels, this can naturally cause excessive protein accumulation and lead to further stress on the cells [23]. Safe transduction of the dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra is an important aspect in therapeutic approaches, and there have been several studies testing AAV preparations to target substantia nigra dopamine neurons. It has been demonstrated that injection of AAV-GFP to the substantia nigra of rats showed long lasting expression in both the nigral areas (up to 25 months) and striatum (up to 18 months) [57]. Similar results have been obtained in mice, with various vector serotypes able to label the whole substantia nigra, ventral tegmental area, as well as the striatum [58]. In regards to AAV-GFP and dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra, studies in rats have shown that several different vector preparations carrying GFP are able to transduce TH-positive neurons effectively in the substantia nigra as well as in fibres of the striatum [59,60]. Transduction efficiency of AAVs in substantia nigra neurons has also been tested successfully in monkeys, a relevant model when considering the clinical implication of viruses since the size differences between the rodent, primate, and human brain need to be taken into account, particularly concerning spreading. As such, studies have shown that injecting AAV-GFP to the substantia nigra of monkeys results in efficient transduction of the neuronal [61] and dopaminergic cells [62] of the substantia nigra. It is clear that choosing the virus serotype is dependent on the species and the areas or neurons that need to be transduced; therefore, selecting the correct preparation for one's experiment will depend on these factors. It is also evident that it is possible to transduce TH neurons in the substantia nigra with AAVs successfully.
dfzb | In relation to neurotrophic factors, though they are usually given to the striatum, a study compared striatal and nigral delivery in rats where the AAV-NRTN was given simultaneously with the 6-OHDA lesion. This was performed with an idea that enhancing the survival of the substantia nigra neurons by nigral AAV-NRTN injection may induce greater protection of the connecting striatal fibres. Indeed, the results showed that targeting both the striatum and substantia nigra was the most effective strategy [63]. However, in the case of therapeutic proteins, the overall detrimental effects of overexpression of transgene or RNA can be 'hidden' by the positive effect of the therapy itself. Specifically, using only a non-AAV control may not show the damaging effects. Moreover, caution should be exercised when trying to overexpress any proteins in dopamine neurons, as this can induce stress response pathways affecting their functions and survival, as in [64] and [65]. As a way to overcome the detrimental effect

awvu | of constitutive protein overexpression or to regulate signalling of neurotrophic factors that are known to be very potent, regulated vectors have been developed. A destabilizing domain that can be regulated with trimethoprim has been effectively used with AAVs carrying GDNF [66]. A single AAV vector for tetracycline-regulated expression with rtTA (reverse tetracycline transactivator) has also been used for GDNF transgene expression in Parkinson's disease models [67]. Mifepristone-controlled vectors have also been shown to restore motor function in the 6-OHDA rat model of Parkinson's disease [47,68]. The mifepristone-regulated vectors are based on binding to a human progesterone receptor, fused to a human p65 transactivation domain and a yeast Gal4 DNA-binding domain. As endogenous neurotrophic factors are biologically active at very low doses, these regulated approaches could be used for neurotrophic factor therapies and may be safer options for targeting substantia nigra dopamine neurons. However, similar to the regulated vectors that express any other foreign protein, there is caution to be considered since there are indications of astrocyte expression-mediated toxicity and a widespread inflammatory response caused by non-self transgenic protein overexpression [69].
on9b | 4. AAV-x-syn Animal Models of Parkinson's Disease
a8ge | Transducing substantia nigra dopamine neurons with genes related to human Parkinson's disease has been explored to provide valuable animal models of the disease. AAV carrying cDNA of human WT «-syn injected to the substantia nigra induces slowly progressing neurodegeneration and the presence of «-syn inclusions [70,71]. These models have been used in mice [72-74] and rats. A study using both human WT or mutant A53T «-syn carried in recombinant AAV-CBA (chicken ß-actin) injected into the substantia nigra of rats showed a loss of striatal TH fibre density and dopamine and degeneration of TH-positive cells in the substantia nigra. Furthermore, in animals with a significant loss of TH in the nigral area, severe behavioural deficits developed at 24-27 weeks post-injection, as compared with GFP controls [75]. Studies using WT human «-syn with AAV6 [76], AAV5 [77], and AAV9 [78] injected to the nigra have shown TH loss in the nigrostriatal system and motor deficits. In addition, recombinant AAV human WT «-syn injection to rats has resulted in the phosphorylation of endogenous «-syn in the substantia nigra area [79]. However, in [80], the authors observed that x-syn phosphorylated at Ser129 is not necessary for pathology in the dopamine system and deficits in motor behaviour and therefore, WT human -syn is enough to cause dysfunction. For the mutant forms, AAV5-S129D and S129A [80], AAV2-A53T [81], and AAV6-A30P [82] have been tested in rats and compared to the WT form. A large study compared the model in mice, rats, and monkeys, wherein AAV9 human mutant A53T x-syn was injected into the substantia nigra, and found that there was degeneration in the nigrostriatal areas in all species and motor deficits in rats, but interestingly aging did not exacerbate the loss or symptoms [83]. A long-term study was performed with a variety of pathology and behavioural measures, in which the authors used AAV7 carrying human WT or mutant (A53T) «-syn and injected it into the substantia nigra [84]. The results showed that this mutant form was able to induce behavioural deficits on rotarod and cylinder tests, induce dopamine cell death in the substantia nigra, decrease dopamine release in the striatum, and also form insoluble aggregates [84]. A recent study in rats using human WT «-syn with four and eight week time points did not show TH loss in the striatum at 4 weeks, but did show a mild loss of TH-positive neurons in the substantia nigra and decreased dopamine content at eight weeks after vector injections [85]. While most of these studies do show some loss of TH and robust «-syn expression, which are important in modelling the disease, in some cases, AAV carrying GFP or other control results were not shown as a comparison. Additionally, many of these studies use enhancers for the transgene expression levels. It should also be noted that it is a mutant form of human «-syn in certain studies, not the WT, which demonstrates TH loss and motor deficits in the animals. In Table 1 we have summarized these studies, in which a GFP control was most often used as a comparison to the AAV-x-syn.

wzno | In general, though some of the previous studies were able to recapitulate the disease, there is still large variability between and within studies, including our own findings [65]. Additionally, without a control for a comparison of dopamine neuron loss in the substantia nigra, it is difficult to conclude that it is specifically the «-syn overexpression causing the damage. By optimizing the volumes, particle number and injection needle parameters to be similar as described in, for example, [75], there is no reason why the number of successfully lesioned rats with AAV-«-syn could not be increased. However, proper controls need to be used for comparison and it is clear that caution should be applied when setting up the model.
xagm | 5. Challenges in Control AAV Vectors for Targeting Substantia Nigra Dopamine Neurons
iwn5 | To study the AAV-x-syn-mediated mechanisms, it is important to use appropriate controls to ensure that the degeneration is not due to protein or RNA overexpression in general. It is also valuable to study whether the control proteins, RNA, or empty vectors are toxic to the dopamine neurons. As mentioned, substantia nigra dopamine neurons are particularly vulnerable to stress and therefore can be easily damaged. Although AAV vectors produce a minimal immune response in the brain [86], the extent of the cellular antiviral defence response in substantia nigra dopamine neurons after AAV vector injections is not known and not well studied. Innate immune responses triggered by pattern recognition receptors in relation to AAV capsids or by DNA are not known; for example, there have been no studies conducted on the relationship of Toll-like receptors and AAV vectors [87]. However, an important study was performed in which the authors observed that AAV9 mediated the overexpression of GFP, a protein from jellyfish, which resulted in an astrocyte-mediated immune response when injected to the nonhuman primate brain, as opposed to AAV carrying a non-foreign protein, which did not end in a toxic response [69]. Additionally, while increasing the titer of an AAV will naturally increase the amount of positive cells and protein expressed, it can also lead to neurodegeneration. In a study in which AAV8 carrying GFP was injected into the substantia nigra of rats, the high dose used caused a 41% loss of dopamine neurons compared to the non-injected side, however the lower dose showed no neurotoxicity [88]. When a chimeric AAV1/2-GFP was used at the same titer as AAV1/2 carrying A53T «-syn, it also caused neuron death in the substantia nigra of rats, but when the titer was lowered to 1:3 or 1:10, no toxicity was observed with GFP [81]. A recent study compared the titers of AAV-x-syn and AAV-GFP and demonstrated that, at a titer of 2 x 1014 gc/mL and higher, GFP resulted in approximately a 62% loss of TH positive cells in the substantia nigra [64]. These studies clearly demonstrate that overexpression-induced dopamine neurodegeneration is not specific to -syn and careful testing and caution needs to be taken with regard to how much virus is used in the control condition, particularly with neurodegeneration studies. And indeed, it has been previously reported that AAV5-eGFP can cause a significant lesion to the dopamine system as the corresponding AAV5-x-syn vector [89]. In addition, immune responses to non-self proteins need to be taken into consideration. We have found that not only the overexpression of GFP via AAV but also the overexpression of RNA that did not translate to any protein, led to degeneration of dopamine neurons in Parkinson's disease models [65]. Neuronal loss after AAV-mediated transduction is most likely caused by the increased sensitivity of dopamine substantia nigra neurons to stress, due to their properties [10], and the results clearly suggest that it is not only protein overexpression that can be detrimental but also RNA overexpression. Indeed, excessive RNA and/or protein synthesis after AAV-mediated transduction of nigral dopamine neurons can impair proteosome and autophagy pathways, promote formation of stress granules, activate endoplasmic reticulum, and unfolded protein response pathways, collectively leading to synaptic dysfunctions and impaired neuronal activity (Figure 1). The results described above suggest that such overloading of substantia nigra dopamine neurons with either RNA or protein can be caused by the overexpression of WT, mutant «-syn, GFP, untranslated RNA, or perhaps by any non-specific sequence. Therefore, intranigral injections of AAV vectors for dopamine neuron transduction may not be the best method in neurodegeneration studies.
