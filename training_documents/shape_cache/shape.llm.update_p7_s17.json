        "content": "rsbu | The Small of Back, or SoB, is vital in developing the TC two software's Measurement Extraction Protocol, as the software cannot locate the waist without some points of reference. The SoB is defined as the deepest point of the spinal curve at the tangential change, closer to the buttocks, differing from traditional manual landmarking. The SoB represents the starting point for waist measurements and is key to how shape would be defined and, therefore, should be fully understood. Plus numbers, for example, plus six point three five centimeters, give the distance above the SoB; defining the upper limit for the region within which a scanner can find the smallest waist circumference. SizeUK allows an upper limit of plus four centimeters and the FFIT plus six point three five centimeters from the SoB; see Table one.\nmagd | Equipment suitability\ntb74 | The TC two body scanner's suitability, reliability, and validity within clothing science research has been demonstrated by multiple authors. Notably, the TC two scanner provides a greater depth and volume of data than traditional methods. As body scanning captures\n8l69 | points, lengths, surface, shape, and volume, while tape measures - for example - only capture length.\n1jyv | Out of FFIT's nine body shapes, we used Yim Lee et al.'s algorithm for FFIT's seven body shapes in our automatic shape sorting programme; see Table two. We categorized participants into body shape using Visual Basic. We selected Yim Lee et al.'s algorithm as it is the same algorithm Simmons, Istook, and Devarajan used in FFIT's development. We accept that our excluded shapes, diamond and oval, would be categorized into 'other' shapes because of limitations in defining the abdomen and stomach - as Yim Lee et al. accepted. Yim Lee et al. even considered another category - 'Shape not known' - to filter unclassified shapes from the extracted measurements, as we use in Table two; see Box one in Appendix Table A one.\nolce | Box one. Visual basic coding of the FFIT formulae.\nerx1 | HipBustResult equals Hip minus Bust greater than or equal to nine point one four and Hip minus Bust less than or equal to twenty-five point four.\nb3bt | HipWaistResult equals Hip minus Waist greater than or equal to twenty-two point eight six.

The FFIT's Hip measurement definition is, however, replaced with the SizeUK Hip measurement definition with TC two's Seat Girth measurement, presented in Table one. For DS two, only the hip's definition is different. We maintain the other three measurements to see how changing only one measurement definition in four alters the body shape classification.\ncxqi | Definition Set three, or DS three, includes the bust, waist, high-hip, and seat, in place of the hip, girth measurements, the same as the SizeUK measurement definition, presented in Table one. The bust measurement and its parameter settings in the TC two Measurement Extraction Protocol are the same for the FFIT and SizeUK; see Table one. For DS three, all measurement definitions are as per the SizeUK sizing survey.\nqfmx | Waist measurement parameters' selection\nrut3 | This study's two waist measurement parameters are: SizeUK's SoB plus four centimeters region and the FFIT's SoB plus six point three five centimeters region.\nm3cp | Shoulder measurements' parameters' selection\nmq4s | The three shoulder measurement parameters we used to represent shoulder anthropometrics were: shoulder-to-shoulder, horizontal, shoulder-to-shoulder, caliper, and shoulder girth. We selected these three parameters to capture the shoulder's shape,\n95el | allowing shoulders to relate to the other shape classification measurements.\na0a5 | While higher complexities of shoulder anthropometrics - such as pitch, slope length, and front-to-back depth - may associate with FFIT body shape, we focused on key measurements traditionally used in garment construction. Using traditional measurements retains consistency with the FFIT's measurements and current practice. It was essential to select measurements that - like the other FFIT dimensions - could define the shape and provide a context within current pattern cutting practices.\ngocl | Data handling\nob1z | Manchester Metropolitan University held the study's data within a database of UK scan data following the Data Protection Act. A practitioner - with fifteen years' experience - extracted participant data from the database before inspecting all scans to ensure the data's reliability and validity. Before conducting statistical analysis - i.e. Multinomial Logistic Regression, t-tests, or ANOVA -, we followed procedures to check for violation of Normality, Linearity, and Homoscedasticity assumptions. We found no serious violations, allowing us to proceed with data analysis.\nm4cb | Statistical analysis\nm61y | We undertook all statistical analysis with Statistical Package for the Social Sciences, with initial screening in Excel. Significance for all tests was determined at the P less than or equal to point zero five level. We interpret effect sizes and power requirements in line with Cohen's widely accepted benchmarks.\nu2ob | Alternative measurement definitions\n2gnm | We used Kappa Measure of Agreements to gauge the level of agreement between the FFIT categorical classifications under DS one, DS two, and DS three measurement definitions, investigating hypothesis one. High agreement indicates high stability in the classification. Table two shows how many participants fit each of the FFIT's body shapes, according to differential measurement definitions. We selected the hourglass body as the reference shape because it was the most common in DS one, FFIT's 'standard' interpretation.\nemgw | Alternative waist definition's measurement impact We used T-Tests to investigate the differences between alternative waist measurement definitions.
