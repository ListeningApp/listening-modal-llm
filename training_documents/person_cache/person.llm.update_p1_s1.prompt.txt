You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

u8nw | The Counselor: Person and Professional
l2v9 | CHAPTER TWO
afbe | Introduction
78r8 | The Counselor as a Therapeutic Person
320g | One of the most important instruments you have to work with as a counselor is yourself as a person. In preparing for counseling, you will acquire knowledge about the theories of personality and psychotherapy, learn assessment and intervention techniques, and discover the dynamics of human behavior. Such knowledge and skills are essential, but by themselves they are not sufficient for establishing and maintaining effective therapeutic relationships. To every therapy session we bring our human qualities and the experiences that have influenced us. In my judgment, this human dimension is one of the most powerful influences on the therapeutic process.
tp8g | A good way to begin your study of contemporary counseling theories is by reflecting on the personal issues raised in this chapter. By remaining open to self- evaluation, you not only expand your awareness of self but also build the foundation for developing your abilities and skills as a professional. The theme of this chapter is that the person and the professional are intertwined facets that cannot be separated in reality. We know, clinically and scientifically, that the person of the therapist and the therapeutic relationship contribute to therapy outcome at least as much as the par- ticular treatment method used (Duncan, Miller, Wampold, & Hubble, 2010; Elkins, 2016; Norcross, 2011).
gxfd | Visit CengageBrain.com or watch the DVD for the video program on Chapter 2, Theory and Practice of Counseling and Psychotherapy: The Case of Stan and Lecturettes. I suggest that you view the brief lecture for each chapter prior to reading the chapter.
s2v1 | Counseling is an intimate form of learning, and it demands a practitio- LO1 ner who is willing to be an authentic person in the therapeutic relationship. It is within the context of such a person-to-person connection that the client experi- ences growth. If we hide behind the safety of our professional role, our clients will likely keep themselves hidden from us. If we strive for technical expertise alone, and leave our own reactions and self out of our work, the result is likely to be ineffective counseling. Our own genuineness can have a significant effect on our relationship with our clients. If we are willing to look at our lives and make the changes we want, we can model that process by the way we reveal ourselves and respond to our clients. If we are inauthentic, we will have difficulty establishing a working alliance with our clients. If we model authenticity by engaging in appropriate self-disclosure, our clients will tend to be honest with us as well.
jkp9 | I believe that who the psychotherapist is directly relates to his or her ability to establish and maintain effective therapy relationships with clients. But what does the research reveal about the role of the counselor as a person and the therapeutic relationship on psychotherapy outcome? Abundant research indicates the centrality of the person of the therapist as a primary factor in successful therapy. The person of the psychotherapist is inextricably intertwined with the outcome of psychotherapy (see Elkins, 2016; Lambert, 2011; Norcross & Lambert, 2011; Norcross & Wampold, 2011). Clients place more value on the personality of the therapist than on the
z8tt | THE COUNSELOR: PERSON AND PROFESSIONAL
9g22 | specific techniques used. Indeed, evidence-based psychotherapy relationships are critical to the psychotherapy endeavor.
41fx | Techniques themselves have limited importance in the therapeutic process. Wampold (2001) conducted a meta-analysis of many research studies on therapeu- tic effectiveness and found that the personal and interpersonal components are essential to effective psychotherapy, whereas techniques have relatively little effect on therapeutic outcome. The contextual factors-the alliance, the relationship, the per- sonal and interpersonal skills of the therapist, client agency, and extra-therapeutic factors-are the primary determinants of therapeutic outcome. This research sup- ports what humanistic psychologists have maintained for years: "It is not theories and techniques that heal the suffering client but the human dimension of therapy and the 'meetings' that occur between therapist and client as they work together" (Elkins, 2009, p. 82). In short, both the therapy relationship and the therapy methods used influence the outcomes of treatment, but it essential that the methods used support the therapeutic relationship being formed with the client.
7um8 | Personal Characteristics of Effective Counselors
uow2 | Particular personal qualities and characteristics of counselors are significant in creating a therapeutic alliance with clients. My views regarding these personal characteristics are supported by research on this topic (Norcross, 2011; Skovholt & Jennings, 2004; Sperry & Carlson, 2011). I do not expect any therapist to fully exemplify all the traits described in the list that follows. Rather, the willingness to struggle to become a more therapeutic person is the crucial variable. This list is intended to stimulate you to examine your own ideas about what kind of person can make a significant difference in the lives of others.
iat7 | + Effective therapists have an identity. They know who they are, what they are capable of becoming, what they want out of life, and what is essential.
ywwr | · Effective therapists respect and appreciate themselves. They can give and receive help and love out of their own sense of self-worth and strength. They feel adequate with others and allow others to feel powerful with them.
0i6j | · Effective therapists are open to change. They exhibit a willingness and cour- age to leave the security of the known if they are not satisfied with the way they are. They make decisions about how they would like to change, and they work toward becoming the person they want to become.
87cq | + Effective therapists make choices that are life oriented. They are aware of early decisions they made about themselves, others, and the world. They are not the victims of these early decisions, and they are willing to revise them if necessary. They are committed to living fully rather than set- tling for mere existence.
0qs3 | · Effective therapists are authentic, sincere, and honest. They do not hide behind rigid roles or facades. Who they are in their personal life and in their professional work is congruent.
z8f7 | · Effective therapists have a sense of humor. They are able to put the events of life in perspective. They have not forgotten how to laugh, especially at their own foibles and contradictions.
7w7j | CHAPTER TWO
51vd | · Effective therapists make mistakes and are willing to admit them. They do not dismiss their errors lightly, yet they do not choose to dwell on misery.
baj1 | · Effective therapists generally live in the present. They are not riveted to the past, nor are they fixated on the future. They are able to experience and be present with others in the "now."
n1wo | . Effective therapists appreciate the influence of culture. They are aware of the ways in which their own culture affects them, and they respect the diver- sity of values espoused by other cultures. They are sensitive to the unique differences arising out of social class, race, sexual orientation, and gender.
5bq3 | · Effective therapists have a sincere interest in the welfare of others. This concern is based on respect, care, trust, and a real valuing of others.
ezla | · Effective therapists possess effective interpersonal skills. They are capable of entering the world of others without getting lost in this world, and they strive to create collaborative relationships with others. They readily entertain another person's perspective and can work together toward consensual goals.
rsbu | · Effective therapists become deeply involved in their work and derive meaning from it. They can accept the rewards flowing from their work, yet they are not slaves to their work.
magd | · Effective therapists are passionate. They have the courage to pursue their dreams and passions, and they radiate a sense of energy.
tb74 | · Effective therapists are able to maintain healthy boundaries. Although they strive to be fully present for their clients, they don't carry the problems of their clients around with them during leisure hours. They know how to say no, which enables them to maintain balance in their lives.
