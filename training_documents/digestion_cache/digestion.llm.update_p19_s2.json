These enzymes have an optimum pH of five point five, as with lysosomal enzymes; this is associated with intracellular digestion. Given their location on the apical zones of microvilli, these enzymes appear to be membrane-bound.\nmqot | Data from lysosomal proteases (cathepsins) are also known as dipeptidyl peptidases; they are classified according to letter or number. Most of the cathepsins become activated at the low pH found in lysosomes. Thus, the activity of this family lies almost entirely within these organelles.\noc99 | Similar distributions of enzymes within the digestive tract of other bivalve species have been identified: grooved carpet shell (Ruditapes decussatus); blue mussel (Mytilus edulis) and king scallop (Pecten maximus). The movement of food through the digestive tract of the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas and the sites of enzyme action and uptake of nutrients is shown in figure nineteen.\ngipz | Experiments performed on Crassostrea gigas have shown that when the animal is starved or has been out of the water for a long period, all of the cavities are empty. Whole algae have been observed in the stomach, the main ducts of the digestive gland, the intestine and the rectum. Without being subjected to enzyme action, this material begins to be expelled through the anus, surrounded by mucus. The duration of this stage is strongly influenced by temperature: six hours at ten degrees Celsius and three hours at twenty degrees Celsius. The animal continuously compensates for this loss by taking in new food. From the beginning of their entry into the ducts of the digestive gland (one to two hours), the nutrient particles are exposed to enzymes, although living cells (algae) have been observed for around six hours after food has reached the stomach and eight to sixteen hours in the intestine.\nb4wj | Module B L five eight zero one Nutrition. Topic one: Feeding and digestion - invertebrates Jonathan David\n5xlt | PG Diploma in Sustainable Aquaculture Module B L five eight zero one: Nutrition\n9bz4 | Due to the pronounced endocytotic nature of the digestive caeca, this gland is a major site for the uptake of metal and organic contaminants. A wide range of enzymes that degrade organic contaminants has been detected in the digestive gland of numerous bivalves. Metallothioneins, antioxidant enzymes and oxyradical scavengers, such as glutathione have also been found in these glands.\nyfv2 | In molluscs, proteins are taken up by pinocytosis by the acinar epithelium of the digestive ceca or diverticula, following which they are hydrolyzed to amino acids. Experiments on marine bivalves have provided evidence of significant uptake of amino acids via the gills. This is discussed in more detail in a later lecture.\npujl | Four. Energy storage\n3rqe | A significant proportion of the energy coming from food is used to cover the metabolic requirements, particularly those associated with reproduction. The reserves are stored either in tissues which are specific to this function or in tissues which have a different physiological function (muscle, digestive gland, hemocytes). In addition to its role in the digestion of food, the digestive gland serves as a site for the storage of metabolic reserves and the control of the distribution of assimilated energy utilized during gametogenesis and during periods of physiological stress.\nnsi3 | In the blue mussel (Mytilus edulis) storage tissues are present in the mantle and in the visceral mass and are made up of two types of cell in juxtaposition: adipogranulous cells; vesiculous cells with glycogen (vesicular connective tissue). The adipogranulous cells (six to twenty micrometers) are spherical and occupy the spaces between the vesicular connective tissue. Glycogen is very abundant and accumulates in a voluminous vacuole.\nnil3 | The flat oyster (Ostrea edulis) possesses only vesiculous cells with glycogen. The vesicular connective tissue forms a bed which may be highly developed, adhering to the mantle by the external surface and enveloping the visceral mass.\n68a1 | A correlation between the activity of the reserve tissue and that of the gonad was established several years ago in the blue mussel (Mytilus edulis). It was shown that glycogen disappeared progressively during the maturation of the gonad; at the same time both the volume and number of cells of the reserve tissue regressed.\nseik | Studies of the ultrastructure and the cytochemistry revealed the existence of a complex process of autophagy (a catabolic mechanism that involves degradation of unnecessary or dysfunctional cellular components by intracellular lysosomes) which destroy the adipogranulous cells. Metabolites are thus released and \noq7c | Module B L five eight zero one Nutrition. Topic one: Feeding and digestion - invertebrates Jonathan David\nz4mi | PG Diploma in Sustainable Aquaculture Module B L five eight zero one: Nutrition\nhkft | these products of lysis become distributed around the tubules of the gonad and are absorbed by the young oocytes by pinocytosis. Most of the adipogranulous cells are destroyed. The vesicular tissue cells also lose their glycogen through the action of lysosomes; this may also entail a total lysis of cells. The activity of glycogen phosphorylase is intense.\njai3 | Regeneration of reserve tissue begins at the end of the annual period of reproduction and is brought about by hemocytes which accumulate between the gonad tubules and then form a loose mesh tissue. The synthesis begins from spring onwards and lasts to the autumn in mussels in northern latitudes, which corresponds both to the annual cessation of spawning and the period when food is most abundant. There is a significant increase in somatic growth following the drop due to the emission of gametes; this appears as a marked increase in the rate of linear growth.\np57i | The reproductive strategy of oysters is different from that of mussels. There is no relationship between the glycogen reserves and gonad maturation. In the European oyster (Ostrea edulis) gametogenesis and the accumulation of glycogen take place at the same time. The increase in the availability of food in spring meets the energy requirements of the oyster and the increase in temperature at this time accelerates gametogenesis. An identical pattern occurs in the Atlantic oyster (Crassostrea virginica) and the Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas). In all species, the highest level of glycogen occurs before the resumption of sexual activity, the period where growth in oysters is particularly fast. Glycogen levels drop dramatically after the emission of gametes in summer in species where fecundity is high, but this drop is less marked in the flat oyster (Ostrea edulis) which has a lower fecundity.\nu5ug | Five.
