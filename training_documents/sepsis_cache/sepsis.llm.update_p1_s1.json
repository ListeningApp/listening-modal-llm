        "content": "c6hh | Therapeutic Hyperthermia Is Associated\ny7ea | With Improved Survival in Afebrile Critically\nnav4 | Patients With Sepsis: A Pilot Randomized Trial\ngem8 | OBJECTIVES: To test the hypothesis that forced-air warming of critically ill afebrile sepsis patients improves immune function compared to standard temperature management.\ne8nr | DESIGN: Single-center, prospective, open-label, randomized controlled trial. SETTING: One thousand two hundred bed academic medical center.\nk78w | PATIENTS: Eligible patients were mechanically ventilated septic adults with: one) a diagnosis of sepsis within forty-eight hours of enrollment; two) anticipated need for mechanical ventilation of greater than forty-eight hours; and three) a maximum temperature less than thirty-eight point three degrees Celsius within the twenty-four hours prior to enrollment. Primary exclusion criteria included: immunologic diseases, immune-suppressing medications, and any existing condition sensitive to therapeutic hyperthermia (e.g., brain injury). The primary outcome was monocyte human leukocyte antigen D-R expression, with secondary outcomes of C-D three/C-D twenty-eight-induced interferon gamma production, mortality, and twenty-eight-day hospital-free days.\ng9du | INTERVENTIONS: External warming using a forced-air warming blanket for forty-eight hours, with a goal temperature one point five degrees Celsius above the lowest temperature documented in the previous twenty-four hours.\nf682 | MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We enrolled fifty-six participants in the study. No differences were observed between the groups in human leukocyte antigen D-R expression (six hundred ninety-two versus two thousand two; P equals zero point three nine six) or interferon gamma production (thirty-one versus sixty-nine; P equals zero point six seven eight). Participants allocated to external warming had lower twenty-eight-day mortality (eighteen percent versus forty-three percent; absolute risk reduction, twenty-five percent; ninety-five percent confidence interval, two to forty-eight percent) and more twenty-eight-day hospital-free days (difference, two point six days; ninety-five percent confidence interval, zero to eleven point six).\nli1k | CONCLUSIONS: Participants randomized to external forced-air warming did not have a difference in human leukocyte antigen D-R expression or interferon gamma production. In this pilot study, however, twenty-eight-day mortality was lower in the intervention group. Future research should seek to better elucidate the impact of temperature modulation on immune and nonimmune organ failure pathways in sepsis.\npbea | Fever is a key feature of infection, yet fewer than half of critically ill patients with sepsis have a fever at the time of diagnosis. Afebrile sepsis patients have up to twice the mortality and are more likely to develop secondary infections than patients with fever, but the reason for these observations is unknown. Fever may be an adaptive response to infection that is critical for survival. Animal and in vitro studies have shown elevated temperature to have beneficial effects on adaptive and innate immunity, including increased antibody production, T-cell activation, macrophage function, and heat shock protein response.\nccpt | Sepsis is associated with pro- and anti-inflammatory mechanisms that can lead to prolonged periods of immunosuppression. Several biomarkers have been implicated in sepsis-induced immunosuppression, including reduced expression of human leukocyte antigen D-R, decreased lipopolysaccharide-induced tumor necrosis factor-alpha production, decreased anti-C-D three/anti-C-D twenty-eight-stimulated interferon gamma production, and persistent lymphopenia. Patients exhibiting persistently depressed levels of these immune markers suffer from higher mortality and increased secondary infections compared to patients with intact immunity. While fever has been associated with immunocompetence, the role of temperature itself has not been rigorously evaluated.\n0fpw | Therapeutic hyperthermia, artificially raising body temperature through external warming, has been used for immunomodulation to treat several types of cancer. This strategy is thought to improve function of natural killer cells, dendritic cells, and T cells. In addition, perioperative warming has consistently been shown to decrease postoperative infections. As a whole, these data provide compelling biologic rationale that therapeutic hyperthermia may be an effective treatment for sepsis.\ndqn8 | The objective of this trial was to determine whether forced-air warming of critically ill afebrile sepsis patients improves immune function compared to standard temperature management. We hypothesized that warmed patients would exhibit higher levels of human leukocyte antigen D-R expression and C-D three/C-D twenty-eight-stimulated interferon gamma production and a reduced prevalence of persistent lymphopenia. We also aimed to assess the feasibility and safety of raising body temperature in critically ill sepsis patients and to evaluate the impact of warming on clinical outcomes.\ncop0 | MATERIALS AND METHODS\nlhkq | Study Design\n82ju | This study was a single-center, prospective, open-label, randomized controlled trial comparing external warming of afebrile critically ill adult sepsis patients to usual care. The trial reviewed by and approved by the Washington University Human Research Protection Office (Institutional Review Board Number twenty fifteen twelve twelve one two one) and was registered on ClinicalTrials.\ny2qo | gov. Written informed consent was obtained from legally authorized representatives, and this study is reported in accordance with the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials Statement extension for pilot/feasibility trials. The study protocol is included in Appendix A.\n1piq | Participants\n7fqw | This study was conducted in the medical and surgical I C Us of a one thousand two hundred bed tertiary care academic medical center between March two thousand sixteen and April two thousand nineteen. Adult patients admitted to the I C U with a diagnosis of severe sepsis were screened daily by a study coordinator for inclusion. Severe sepsis was defined according to the two thousand one Sepsis Taskforce consensus statement, and a post hoc review verified that all included patients met Sepsis-three criteria. Enrollment criteria also required participants to be enrolled within forty-eight hours of sepsis diagnosis (defined as the date/time of the first order for antibiotics), mechanically ventilated with an expected duration of mechanical ventilation greater than forty-eight hours, receiving continuous pharmacologic sedation with a Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale less than zero, and having a maximum temperature less than thirty-eight point three degrees Celsius within the twenty-four hours prior to enrollment. Exclusion criteria included: history of immunological disease; treatment with immunosuppressive medications within the previous six months; treatment with corticosteroids at a dose of greater than three hundred milligrams per day hydrocortisone or equivalent at the time of enrollment; history of chronic infection with hepatitis B or C virus; contraindications to hyperthermia (e.g., sudden cardiac arrest, acute ischemic stroke, acute coronary syndrome, traumatic brain injury or spinal cord injury, sickle cell disease, or multiple sclerosis); pregnancy; comfort care treatment status; contraindications to forced-air warming devices per manufacture instructions (i.e., ischemic limbs); or enrollment in another clinical trial. These inclusion/exclusion criteria were selected to maximize participant safety and tolerance of the intervention and to exclude participants in whom immune biomarkers were unreliable or who might be harmed by artificially elevated body temperature. Patients admitted to the I C Us were screened daily and eligible patients were consecutively approached for enrollment.\nrhaz | Randomization",
