        "content": "7od1 | There is another factor to consider with regard to the results with probe one. The discussion of steric effects on the rate constant for ring opening of substrate-derived radical ignored the fact that two enantiomers of this substrate were allowed to react with the chiral enzyme. If sterics-enforced stereoelectronic effects were operative, it is unlikely that both enantiomeric radicals derived from the enantiomers of the probe would suffer similar ring-opening rate retardations. The formation of aryl hydroxylated product in amounts comparable to the amount of alcohol one A produced complicates the analysis, however. As indicated above, it is likely that the two different products are derived from the two different enantiomers of the probe substrate. Further studies with enantiomerically pure probes are planned to resolve this question.\n0bqy | Aside from steric factors within the active site, other considerations to explain the lack of rearranged substrate with M. capsulatus Bath must be addressed. For example, one cannot rule out that the hydroxylation reaction may proceed through two different mechanisms from a common intermediate. One pathway, D or E, could involve a substrate radical, thus accounting for the rearranged products observed with MMO from M. trichosporium O B three B. An alternative pathway could involve mechanism A, B, C, or F. The specific pathway chosen would then depend on the energetics of the substrate. It is possible, however, that the frequency with which each pathway is followed may differ between the two organisms. Alternatively, MMO from M. capsulatus Bath and M. trichosporium O B three B may exhibit different hydroxylation mechanisms, which would explain the presence of ring-opened products for the latter.\nb780 | We now return to the intramolecular deuterium isotope effect of five point one observed for the hydroxylation of deuterated one. Although an isotope effect of this magnitude is generally associated with processes that involve a relatively linear transition state, such as would occur for oxygen rebound, mechanisms containing intramolecular cyclic transition states cannot be excluded. In fact, dimethyldioxirane, a reagent believed to oxidize hydrocarbons via an insertion process, oxidized cyclododecane-d zero and d twenty-four with an isotope effect of five point seven seven. Thus our observed value of five point one would be consistent with pathways A, B, C one, and F, all of which involve transition states for C-H bond cleavage that resemble the dioxirane oxygen insertion process and avoid the formation of a substrate radical or carbocation in the catalytic cycle. The\ng9du | Hydrocarbon Hydroxylation by Methane Monooxygenase\nf682 | previous observation of an N I H shift in the hydroxylation of aromatic substrates with MMO from M. capsulatus Bath would support such a mechanism.\nli1k | In summary, the failure of substrate probes one and two to form rearranged alcohol products upon hydroxylation with the M. capsulatus Bath MMO is best interpreted in terms of a mechanism that does not involve the formation of a radical or carbocation, namely, A, B, C one, or F. It is unlikely that the enzyme active site induces a stereoelectronic barrier to ring opening. The fact that the same amount, eighty-five percent, of the probe, both converted and unconverted, can be recovered from the enzymatic reaction mixture under hydroxylation conditions or in control reactions omitting N A D H indicates that ring-opened substrate radical has not formed and been lost in the extraction procedure. In addition, these probes do not lead to inactivation of the enzyme over the time course of the reactions, indicating that ring-opened product has not formed and reacted with the enzyme. The kinetic isotope results are consistent with a concerted pathway for C-H bond insertion for the key hydroxylation step.\npbea | Comparisons with Related Work. The MMO mechanism is almost always drawn in analogy to that of cytochrome P four hundred fifty. In particular, a catalytic cycle involving an iron oxo intermediate that abstracts H' from the alkane, mechanism D, has been proposed by several authors. The ability of high concentrations of hydrogen peroxide to effect a shunt pathway for the M. trichosporium O B three B MMO has been cited as evidence for heterolytic cleavage of the O-O bond, although it is noteworthy that, unlike the situation for cytochrome P four hundred fifty, other oxo-transfer reagents could not be substituted for hydrogen peroxide. Hydrogen peroxide does not operate at comparable levels in the M. capsulatus Bath system. Various authors have invoked radical intermediates for the hydroxylation reaction. For example, exo, exo, exo, exo-two, three, five, six-d four-norbornane epimerizes upon hydroxylation by M. trichosporium O B three B MMO, a result that has its parallels in cytochrome P four hundred fifty chemistry. The extent of epimerization with MMO, however, was significantly less, being two percent following hydrogen atom abstraction from the endo position compared to eighteen percent with cytochrome P four hundred fifty, and five percent after abstraction at the exo position compared to fourteen percent with cytochrome P four hundred fifty. Similarly, allylic rearrangements occurred in twenty percent of the MMO hydroxylation products from three, three, six, six-d four-cyclohexene compared to thirty-three percent with cytochrome P four hundred fifty. Mechanistic studies of MMO from M. trichosporium O B three B with the free radical probe one, one-dimethylcyclopropane and with S and R one-two-H, one-three-H-ethane were also consistent with radical formation, but cationic intermediates could not be ruled out. It has also been claimed that radical intermediates can be trapped during methane hydroxylation by the MMO of M. capsulatus Bath. In addition, the mechanism for olefin epoxidation by MMO from M. trichosporium O B three B differs from that believed to occur with cytochrome P four hundred fifty. With cytochrome P four hundred fifty, the one-trans proton of propylene exchanges with solvent protons during turnover, leading to the hypothesis that the epoxidation mechanism involves oxametallocycles and iron carbene intermediates. In the reaction of propylene with MMO, however, no such exchange occurred.\nccpt | In view of these and the present results, it would appear that no single unifying mechanism can account for all of the data. Instead, it seems likely to us that more than one mechanism might",
