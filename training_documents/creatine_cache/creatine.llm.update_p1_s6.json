Accumulating evidence also suggests that creatine supplementation produces a variety of beneficial effects in older and patient populations. Furthermore, evidence-based research shows that creatine supplementation is relatively well tolerated, especially at recommended dosages (i.e. three to five grams per day or zero point one grams per kilogram of body mass per day). Although there are over five hundred peer-refereed publications involving creatine supplementation, it is somewhat surprising that questions regarding the efficacy and safety of creatine still remain. These include, but are not limited to: One. Does creatine lead to water retention? Two. Is creatine an anabolic steroid? Three. Does creatine cause kidney damage/renal dysfunction? Four. Does creatine cause hair loss/baldness? Five. Does creatine lead to dehydration and muscle cramping? Six. Is creatine harmful for children and adolescents? Seven. Does creatine increase fat mass? Eight. Is a creatine 'loading-phase' required? Nine. Is creatine beneficial for older adults? Ten. Is creatine only useful for resistance/power type activities? Eleven. Is creatine only effective for males? Twelve. Are other forms of creatine similar or superior to monohydrate and is creatine stable in solutions/beverages? To answer these questions, an internationally renowned team of research experts was formed to perform an evidence-based scientific evaluation of the literature regarding creatine supplementation.\nob1z | Introduction\nm4cb | Creatine (methylguanidine-acetic acid) is endogenously formed from reactions involving the amino acids arginine, glycine and methionine in the kidneys and liver. Exogenously, creatine is primarily consumed from meat and/or as a dietary supplement. According to PubMed (archive of biomedical and life sciences journal literature at the U.S. National Institutes of Health's National Library of Medicine) there are over five hundred peer-refereed publications involving various aspects of creatine\nm61y | supplementation. Based on the enormous popularity of creatine supplementation, the International Society of Sports Nutrition (ISSN) published an updated position stand in twenty seventeen on the safety and efficacy of creatine supplementation in exercise, sport, and medicine. This comprehensive paper provided an evidence-based review of the literature examining the effects of creatine supplementation on performance, recovery, injury prevention, exercise tolerance and rehabilitation, neuroprotection, aging, clinical and disease state populations, and pregnancy. Importantly, the safety profile of creatine was also reviewed. As of September first, twenty twenty, the paper has been viewed one hundred seventy-nine thousand times and cited one hundred times. Furthermore, Altmetric data indicates\nu2ob | that the paper has been mentioned in nineteen news outlets, four blogs, four hundred ninety-two tweets, fifty-four Facebook pages, and been uploaded sixty-nine times in video posts. Instagram stories and posts are not included as Altmetric data.\n2gnm | Despite the widespread outreach of the twenty seventeen ISSN position stand paper, along with other evidence-based review/meta-analysis papers involving various aspects of creatine supplementation published after the twenty fifteen Creatine in Health, Sport and Medicine Conference in Germany, questions and misconceptions involving creatine supplementation still remain. These include, but are not limited to: One. Does creatine supplementation lead to water retention? Two. Is creatine an anabolic steroid? Three. Does creatine supplementation cause kidney damage/renal dysfunction? Four. Does creatine supplementation cause hair loss/baldness? Five. Does creatine supplementation lead to dehydration and muscle cramping? Six. Is creatine supplementation harmful for children and adolescents? Seven. Does creatine supplementation increase body fat? Eight. Is a creatine supplementation 'loading-phase' required? Nine. Is creatine supplementation beneficial for older adults? Ten. Is creatine supplementation only useful for resistance/power type activities? Eleven. Is creatine supplementation only effective for males? Twelve. Are other forms of creatine similar or superior to monohydrate? Is creatine stable in solutions/beverages? To address these questions, an internationally renowned team of research experts, who have collectively published over two hundred peer-refereed articles involving creatine supplementation, was formed to perform an evidence-based scientific evaluation of the literature. Each question was answered by one researcher, chosen according to her/his expertise on the topic. Then, the final version of this manuscript was reviewed and approved by all authors, therefore reflecting the group opinion.\nemgw | Does creatine lead to water retention?\nxaqt | The purported myth of creatine supplementation increasing body water is likely due to early research which showed that creatine supplementation at twenty grams per day for six days was associated with water retention. It does appear that the most common adverse effect of creatine supplementation is water retention in the early stages (first several days). For example, studies have shown that three days of creatine supplementation increased total body water and extracellular body water and intracellular water. Unfortunately, based on these short-term responses, this notion that creatine increases water retention over the long-term has been widely accepted.\n5rcb | Creatine is an osmotically active substance. Thus, an increase in the body's creatine content could theoretically result in increased water retention. Creatine is taken up into muscle from circulation by a sodium-dependent\n524j | creatine transporter. Since the transport involves sodium, water will also be taken up into muscle to help maintain intracellular osmolality. However, considering the activity of the sodium-potassium pumps, it is not likely that intracellular sodium concentration is dramatically affected by creatine supplementation.\nxd3m | In summary, while there is some evidence to suggest that creatine supplementation increases water retention, primarily attributed to increases in intracellular volume, over the short term, there are several other studies suggesting it does not alter total body water (intra or extracellular) relative to muscle mass over longer periods of time. As a result, creatine supplementation may not lead to water retention.\n8qb6 | Is creatine an anabolic steroid?\nwkbn | Anabolic steroids are a synthetic version of testosterone, an androgenic hormone which is also produced\nftfg | endogenously within both males and females, and is used in conjunction with resistance training with the intent of enhancing muscle mass and strength due to increases in muscle protein synthesis. This increase in muscle protein synthesis is due to testosterone's ability to enter the muscle cell, bind with the intracellular androgen receptor, and increase the expression of various muscle-specific genes. Creatine is converted to phosphocreatine, regulated by the enzyme creatine kinase in muscle and used to create intracellular adenosine triphosphate production. Creatine supplementation, however, can increase the capacity of adenosine triphosphate and energy produced during heavy anaerobically-related exercise, thereby possibly increasing muscle power, repetitions and exercise volume which can subsequently contribute to muscle performance and hypertrophy over the course of a training period.\n```",
