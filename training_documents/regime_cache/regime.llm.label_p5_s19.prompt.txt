You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

06yq | Microdosing with psychedelics to self-medicate for ADHD symptoms in adults: A naturalistic study

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

xnth | We need to make precise some estimates on the evolution semigroup associated with (2.4) for the analysis presented in Section 2.3. We consider to this end weighted spaces of bounded functions. To define them, we first introduce a family of Lyapunov functions denoted by (Kn)nEN, with Kn : X > [1, +00) such that
vafm | Vn ≥ 0, Kn < Kn+1.
2zmw | The associated weighted Bºº spaces are
bf9k | B = > measurable|4 | BO = sup Kn (x) < +00} .
otkr | In particular, for any 4 E Bm, it holds that |6| < |6|Bo Km. We can then introduce the space , which consists of all functions 4 € C'(X) which grow at most like Kn for some n, and whose derivates also grow at most like Km, possibly with m > n

We also consider the subspace <LATEX>\mathscr{S} _ { 0 } = \Pi _ { 0 } \mathscr{S}</LATEX> of functions with average 0 with respect to <LATEX>\psi _ { 0 } ,</LATEX> where <LATEX>\Pi _ { n }</LATEX> for <LATEX>\eta \in \mathbb{R}</LATEX> denotes the projection operator
pk06 | <LATEX>\Pi _ { \eta } \varphi = \varphi - \int _ { \mathcal{X} } \varphi \psi _ { \eta } .</LATEX> We denote by <LATEX>\| \cdot \| _ { \mathcal{B} \left( E \right) }</LATEX> the operator norm on the Banach space <LATEX>\mathcal{B} \left( E \right)</LATEX> of bounded linear operators on a Banach space <LATEX>E ,</LATEX> defined by
7wn9 | <LATEX>\| \mathcal{A} \| _ { \mathcal{B} \left( E \right) } = \sup _ { g \in E \setminus \left\{ 0 \right\} } \frac { \| \mathcal{A} g \| _ { E } } { \| g \| _ { E } } .</LATEX> Before we state the next assumption, we let <LATEX>\mathcal{A} ^ { * }</LATEX> denote the adjoint of <LATEX>\mathcal{A}</LATEX> on the space <LATEX>L ^ { 2 } \left( \psi _ { 0 } \right) .</LATEX> More explicitly, for any test functions <LATEX>\varphi ,</LATEX> <LATEX>\phi \in C ^ { \infty }</LATEX> with compact support,
wcd0 | <LATEX>\int _ { \mathcal{X} } \left( \mathcal{A} \varphi \right) \phi \psi _ { 0 } = \int _ { \mathcal{X} } \varphi \left( \mathcal{A} ^ { * } \phi \right) \psi _ { 0 } .</LATEX> The action of these operators can be found via integration by parts. In particular, for <LATEX>\psi _ { 0 } \left( x \right)</LATEX> a probability density proportional to <LATEX>\mathrm { e } ^ { - \beta U \left( x \right) } ,</LATEX> an integration by parts shows that <LATEX>\partial _ { x _ { i } } ^ { * } = - \partial _ { x _ { i } } + \beta \partial _ { x _ { i } } U .</LATEX> In addition, note that <LATEX>\nabla _ { x } ^ { * } \nabla _ { x } = \sum _ { i = 1 } ^ { d } \partial _ { x _ { i } } ^ { * } \partial _ { x _ { i } }</LATEX> d ∗ .
caos | Note that the Fokker-Planck equation (2.3), written in terms of the <LATEX>L ^ { 2 } \mathrm { - a d j o i n t } ,</LATEX> can also be written with the <LATEX>L ^ { 2 } \left( \psi _ { 0 } \right)</LATEX> as <LATEX>\mathcal{L} _ { 0 } ^ { * } 1 = 0 .</LATEX> We make the following assumption on the Lyapunov functions.

hvhm | <LATEX>0 = \int _ { \mathcal{X} } \mathcal{L} _ { \eta } \mathcal{K} _ { n } \psi _ { \eta } \leqslant - a _ { n , \eta } \int _ { \mathcal{X} } \mathcal{K} _ { n } \psi _ { \eta } + b _ { n , \eta } ,</LATEX> so that
863b | <LATEX>1 \leqslant \int _ { \mathcal{X} } \mathcal{K} _ { n } \psi _ { \eta } \leqslant \frac { b _ { n , \eta } } { a _ { n , \eta } } .</LATEX> The condition (2.5) then follows from the last statement of Assumption 2 since, for any <LATEX>n \geqslant 1 ,</LATEX> there exists <LATEX>C _ { n } > 0</LATEX> and <LATEX>m \geqslant 1</LATEX> such that <LATEX>1 \leqslant \mathcal{K} _ { n } ^ { 2 } \leqslant C _ { n } \mathcal{K} _ { m } .</LATEX> Condition (2.8) also implies the existence of an invariant probability measure for any <LATEX>\eta \in \mathbb{R}</LATEX> when a minorization condition holds [21]. The minorization condition typically follows from a controllability argument and (hypo)ellipticity conditions, see for instance [34, 40]. <LATEX>A s</LATEX> for Assumption 1, trajectorial ergodicity holds when the generator <LATEX>\mathcal{L} _ { \eta }</LATEX> is either elliptic or hypoelliptic, and there exists an invariant probability measure with positive density with respect to the Lebesgue measure [23].
fj24 | We need an assumption in our analysis on the generator <LATEX>\mathcal{L} _ { 0 }</LATEX> of the reference dynamics, which will be useful when stating some technical results later on.
