Central to these efforts is the simultaneously empowering and contested construct of the \"user.\" This paper examines what the construct of the user highlights, as well as what it conceals. We introduce post- userism, a perspective that simultaneously acknowledges the limits of, and proposes alternatives to, the central construct of the user as proxy for the \"human\" in HCI. Drawing on developments across the historical trajectory of HCI, we articulate how the user is enacted across four different levels of representation-systems, interface, design process, and the ideology-and identify situations where the user breaks down. Synthesizing prior work, we offer a series of strategies for grappling with such situations. In doing so, we seek to overcome the limitations imposed by the user and develop a language that will aid in evolving the foundations of HCI by asking what, exactly, we place at the center of our scholarship and design.\n2ttg | INTRODUCTION\nhis3 | Human computer interaction examines the interactions between computational systems and human beings. While seemingly obvious, the simplicity of this statement belies numerous underlying tensions. When originally articulated, HCI was \"a discipline concerned with the design, evaluation and implementation of interactive computing systems for human use and with the study of major phenomena surrounding them.\" In other words, the\nm50z | primary, or perhaps even the only, kind of interaction of interest was when a human was using a computer. Put differently, users are the raison d'Ãªtre of HCI.\nme84 | In this paper, we demonstrate how a myopic focus on the user prevents us from fully accounting for the diversity of interactions between humans and computers, either in our scholarship or in our design work. Enumerating subject positions beyond \"user,\" as well as articulating the relationships among them, helps to broaden the scope of interactions for which HCI can account.\no56m | From User to Post-user\nslz6 | HCI has experienced significant successes in its mission to bring the human user to the forefront of both the study and the design of technology. User interface design, groupware, social media, e-commerce-these arenas demonstrate how the practices of user-centered design have empowered technology users, making them the focus both of HCI design and scholarship.\n90k5 | Part of user-centered design's strength comes from a willingness to elevate anyone to the status of user. The most common way to account for the H in HCI is to cast that person as a user. In effect, to \"user-ify\" people- transforming people into representations within our systems, interfaces, design practices, and discourse-has become more than our method, it has become our ideology. With this ideology comes a set of values, principles, and commitments that shape what we do and how we do it.\n9m8s | Engaging people through the lens of the user is a double- edged sword. On the one side, calling someone a user and centering a design around them has significant potential for empowerment. However, HCI also has a fraught relationship with the term \"user.\" Our misgivings are concisely captured in Tufte's popular quote that \"only two industries refer to their customers as 'users': computer design and drug dealing.\" Meanwhile, faced with more than nomenclature, HCI researchers and practitioners have increasingly encountered interactions with computers that fall outside the traditional scope of use.\n893y | The broadening scope of human-computer interactions becomes evident in recent work. Numerous studies have identified niches of \"invisible\" groups who often reside \"out there\" beyond the well-educated, affluent, industrialized contexts of much technology research. People in developing regions who do not have direct access to or ownership of certain devices (due to cost, lack of literacy,\nfavz | access constraints, etc.) will interact with technology via an intermediary, who uses the technology on their behalf. Examples also occur in contexts more familiar to many in the HCI community. Individuals at times create single-use, \"throwaway\" accounts to post content or questions they do not want linked with their primary online identity. The complexities of algorithmically-based systems, such as search engines, can lead to inadvertent associations, e.g., between gay men and sex offenders or between African Americans and incarcerated criminals. Social media profiles for deceased users are transformed by their friends and family into memorial pages; the people \"using\" such profiles differ from the site's representation of who the profile's user is. Recent interest in technology non-use is also symptomatic of this larger condition. In each case, there exist relationships and interactions with computing technology-the beneficiaries of an intermediary, individuals with multiple throwaway accounts, subjects of algorithmic discrimination, mourners-that fall beyond the traditional bounds of \"user.\" Focusing on the person who \"uses\" the computer limits our ability to perceive, let alone to design for, these other kinds of configurations.\n7szx | In order to move beyond the \"user\", we borrow from humanistic discourse and theorizing of subjectivity and subject positions. As described by, subject positions speak to the \"social roles that people are thrust into\" while subjectivity refers to the \"felt experience ... of individuals\" in a given position. Subject positions in HCI include \"power users, novices, early adopters, and non- users; gamers, trolls, and n00bs; standard users and admins; makers and hackers; and many more.\" Subject positions are relational, both exists because of and is defined by its relationships within an ecology of other subject positions. This quality makes them an ideal way to talk about human-computer relationships, and the way that HCI's users frame subject positions and subjective experiences.\nhx9e | How can we do so in a principled way that facilitates both rigorous scholarship and informed design practice? At first glance, documentation of these alternative subject positions may seem scattershot, a disorganized effort to recapture the remainder. However, looking across such examples, underlying structural similarities emerge that span the diverse niches. Explicating such similarities offers an approach that we term post-userism. In many ways, the user is a modernist notion, one that emphasizes the values of efficiency, calculability, and predictability. In turn, the modernist impulse essentializes the subject position of the user. Responding to the modernist thinking that permeates much of the work in HCI, our terminology is meant to invoke concepts from post- modernism, post-structuralism, and post-humanism. Doing so can enable HCI, both in scholarship and in design, to account for the diversity of interactions that can occur among humans and computers.\nywn2 | The argument presented here proceeds as follows. We first track the historical development of the ideology of the user across scholarship in HCI. We then describe how the construct of the user appears and is used differently across four levels of representation: systems, interface, design process, and ideological. These four levels provide an analytic perspective that we use to examine a series of examples from prior work in HCI, describing how post- userism occurs when there are breakdowns across levels of representation. We then synthesize across these examples to present a series of strategies both for identifying and for grappling with post-user scenarios. We conclude by offering an outline of how post-userism can offer a conceptual foundation for simultaneously expanding and strengthening the scope of HCI.\na63r | THE IDEOLOGY OF THE USER",
