You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

wstc | a large-scale offensive, mainly against the four ROK divisions that were deployed with the Eighth US Army on the western peninsula and the X Corps on the eastern coast. The ROK First Division fell into a giant ambush by the CPVF 39th Army. Its commander, Gen. Paik, who was considered the best ROK commander, immediately realized that the skilled soldiers his division met were Chinese. Shortly afterward, he personally interrogated the first Chinese POW and heard from him that 20,000 Chinese soldiers were deployed nearby. The information was immediately reported through the Eighth Army's G-2 to Gen. Willoughby in Tokyo. During the next four days, the ROK Second Corps, made up of three divisions, suffered thousands of losses and was driven back in disarray.
ba1e | Simultaneously, Gen. Almond's X Corps advancement was blocked by a strong Chinese force. A Chinese POW who identified himself as a soldier of the 5th PLA Regiment of the Chinese 8th Army said that another 4,000 to 5,000 troops were nearby. " Additional POWs said in interrogations that 4 they belonged to the 124th Division. Almond, who personally interviewed them, reported to MacArthur that PLA units were deployed in northeast Korea. 130
en95 | At the end of October, "the frontline commanders did not doubt that the Eighth Army and the X Corps had encountered powerful, organized elements of CCF [Chinese Communist Forces] armies across a wide spectrum of extreme North Korea."By November 1, as an American official history of the war concluded, "the CCF had driven back the ROK II Corps, crippling it disastrously, and was south of Chongchon on the open right flank of Eight[th] Army. And disaster was also threatening in the center of the Eight[th] Army front of Unsan. " 132 It came a day later, as another official account described it: "The climax of this early Chinese intervention came on the night of 1-2 November when the 8th Cavalry Regiment, 1st Cavalry Division, was attacked by a full Chinese division in positions near Unsan and very roughly handled."133 Practically, the regiment lost more than half its men.14 It was the first major clash between American and Chinese forces and the first American defeat since the landing in Inchon. The outcome sent shock waves through the Eighth Army. Walker's G-2 concluded that the Eighth Army now faced two PLA armies with "improved tactical capabilities" displaying "an unusual capability to fight at night."> The X Corps' G-2 reached a similar conclusion: following a number of limited battles with the CPVF and after interrogating at least 30 POWs, he reported, on October 29, "Integral PLA have been committed against UN Forces." On November 2, US Marine forces destroyed the PLA's 124th Division in a fierce battle that was supported by tanks. The destroyed division was immediately replaced by another one-a clear indication of the magnitude of the CPVF.137
l3do | Altogether, the Chinese First Campaign (October 25-November 8) took a high toll on UN forces. In October, the American losses were 40 per day. They rose to 326 per day in the first week of November.1 138 8 By Chinese accounts, 12,325 South Koreans, 3,518 Americans, and 147 other nationalities were killed, wounded, or captured during the campaign. The CPVF sustained 10,700 casualties including MIAs.139 4
u9bo | Willoughby's reaction to the reports about the Chinese intervention was mainly denial. Shortly after X Corps soldiers caught the first Chinese soldiers, Almond told Willoughby about it and asked him to come and see them with his own eyes. Willoughby refused, saying that they were only a "token force." Close to four weeks later, he did come, saw a number of the POWs, but insisted that they were North Koreans and not Chinese.14 In between, he passed on to Washington the information about captured PLA soldiers, accepting that organized Chinese units were in Korea, but denying what that meant:
7avo | From a tactical standpoint, with victorious United States divisions in full deployment, it would appear that the auspicious time for intervention has long since passed; it is difficult to believe that such a move, if planned, would have been postponed to a time when remnant North Korean forces have been reduced to a low point of effectiveness." 142
uzo6 | In the following days, Willoughby's reports labeled the Chinese forces in Korea "volunteers." Even more importantly, the numbers of soldiers he reported did not reflect the magnitude of the threat. On November 2, he reported that 16,500 Chinese soldiers were in Korea and a day later (11/3) that their number had risen to 34,000, while an additional 415,000 were deployed in Manchuria.143 On November 11, he estimated that 76,800 Chinese troops were in Korea. 144
89b4 | The figures provided by Willoughby, which were based on the information from the interrogated Chinese POWs, systematically decreased the size of the opposing force. This was accomplished by a selective use of the available data. On October 29, for example, many reports based on POW interrogations indicated that a massive PLA crossing of the Yalu had taken place. Nevertheless, Willoughby's assessment cited only one report and estimated that "only token forces from the Fortieth Army Headquarters and from each of its divisions entered Korea on 20 October."> Later, 4 while admitting that elements of four Chinese armies were in Korea, he counted the specific units of the captured soldiers but not their parent units. Thus, when visiting the X Corps in November he estimated that "probably only a battalion of volunteers of each division identified was actually in Korea."146 Justin Haynes rightly concluded: "Due to this method of analysis Willoughby accounted for only one third of Chinese Communist troops inside North Korea at that time."14 In fact, on the eve of the Second CPVF Campaign, Willoughby accounted for less than a fifth of the Chinese power. 148
