You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.

wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

The first indication of hydrothermal venting in the Jean Charcot troughs was a methane anomaly detected in the water column near the Starfish seamount during the KAIYO 89 cruise (Urabe et al., 1990). This anomaly was investigated on the SOLAVENTS cruise, which recovered fresh and

Additional cruises in the area included the SEAPSO Leg 2 cruise (Récy et al., 1986), a GLORIA side-scan sonar survey (Johnson et al., 1992), and the SOPACMAPS cruise (Kroenke, 1995). More recent work has been aimed at exploration for SMS deposits. The Tinakula deposit was discovered by Neptune Minerals, Inc., in Sep- tember 2011 during the ASHR Leg 2 cruise aboard the MV Dorado Discovery. It is located in the Temotu Province within the exclusive economic zone of the Solomon Islands, approxi- mately 890 km east-southeast of Guadalcanal. The discovery was initially made by locating the source of a seafloor-hugging hydrothermal plume, followed by dives with a remotely oper- ated vehicle (ROV), which located sulfide chimneys. Addi- tional mapping, ROV grab sampling, and shallow drilling occurred during four subsequent (2011-2012) cruises.

ez9s | The Tinakula SMS deposit is located at depths of 1,070 to 1,204 m b.s.l. on the flank of the Starfish stratovolcano (Fig. 1B). The geology of the Tinakula area has been interpreted from seafloor observations and sampling during ROV dives,
mqot | drill core logging, and analysis of newly acquired high-reso- lution (20 cm) bathymetry. The bathymetry details reveal a strong structural control on volcanic and hydrothermal fea- tures (Fig. 2).
oc99 | Volcanoes in the Tinakula area are composed of basaltic andesite (53.4-57.3 wt % SiO2) and dacite (63.0-67.9 wt % SiO2) (Anderson, 2018) and include composite cones, cinder cones, and the submarine equivalent of maars (craters without cones) (see App. Fig. Al). The morphologies of these edifices are broadly similar to those of subaerial volcanoes, but the edifices are consistently smaller than their subaerial equiva- lents. In the central part of the map area, the volcanic cones are aligned along a large (~1.6 km long) NS-trending fissure (Fig. 2, inset). The southern part of the fissure is dominated by a large composite cone with bimodal lava flows and blocky volcanic talus. This is followed northward by a 900-m-long row of cinder cones, on which the deposit is centered, and two small maar-like craters at the northern end of the fissure. The volcanic material making up the cinder cones consists of vari- ably altered basaltic andesite with vertical and lateral facies variations over several meters, including changes in clast size, shape, composition, and degree of sorting (Figs. 3, 4; App. Figs. A2-A18). The breccia facies include the following: (1)
gipz | MINERALIZATION AND ALTERATION OF THE TINAKULA SMS DEPOSIT
b4wj | monomict breccia characterized by clasts with glassy curvi- planar margins, flow-banded phenocrysts, and local jigsaw-fit textures (Figs. 3A, B, 4B); (2) monomict breccia composed of vesicular volcanic clasts associated with variable amounts of juvenile clasts, glass shards, and crystal fragments and rare blocks or bombs (Figs. 3C-E, 4C); and (3) polymict breccia associated with mass-flow bedforms with rounded to suban- gular clasts, ranging from relatively unaltered to completely clay altered clasts (Fig. 3F). The predominant facies is mas- sive to crudely bedded monomict breccia (lapillistone) with clasts containing up to 20% vesicles (uniformly distributed) and no evidence of welding. Basaltic-andesitic lava flows were the last products to be erupted along the row of cinder cones at Tinakula. These facies are consistent with cinder cones on land, which form via Strombolian-type eruptions, progressing from cone-building activity to lava flows during the waning stages as the magma loses most of its gas (Vergnoille and Man- gan, 2000). Cinder cones of the type at Tinakula are generally considered to be monogenic, having formed during one erup- tive cycle over a period of days to months (e.g., Wood, 1980).
5xlt | Dark-colored mafic(?) volcaniclastic sediment covers most of the map area around the Tinakula deposit, interpreted to be fallout from nearby eruptions. The material ranges from coarse sand- to pebble-sized, with a few larger volcanic frag- ments or bombs (with elongate vesicles and quenched mar- gins) and no fine ash-sized fraction. The sediment ranges in thickness from 1.5 to >8 m and is massive to crudely bed- ded with weak grading. Abundant ripple marks are observed in the sediment, with large-scale dunes (up to 7 m wide and 124 m long) visible in the bathymetric data.
9bz4 | Two large (55-87 m tall and 327-512 m wide) composite cones with dacite lava flows in the northwest corner of the mapped area (Fig. 2) appear to be unrelated to the central fissure. Large dacitic lava flows in the southwest corner of the map have a distinctly different morphology, with sinuous ridges that are characteristic of channelized flow. The relative ages of the flows are interpreted from ROV dive observations of sediment thickness, with higher degrees of sediment asso- ciated with older relative ages. The ages of these flows relative to other eruptions in the area are unknown.
