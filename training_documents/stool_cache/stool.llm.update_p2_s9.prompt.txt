You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

rl4j | We defined patients with presumptive TB, following clinical guidelines in both settings, as children with signs or symptoms suggestive of pulmonary TB (at least one) such as persistent cough, unexplained fever and/or night sweats, poor weight gain or weight loss, reduced playful- ness or malaise, history of contact with a TB patient, or enlarged lymph nodes in the neck (Ethiopia only).
vz32 | Under the SOC, national guidelines in both countries recommend the use of GeneXpert for the diagnosis of paediatric TB.614 However, in both countries, sputum smear microscopy (SSM) is allowed for diagnosis if the PHC has no access to GeneXpert. Despite this recom- mendation, in both countries, most PHC units do not have access to a GeneXpert machine, and therefore use SSM for the diagnosis of paediatric TB. For the diagnosis of paediatric TB, in the primary (base-case) analyses, we assumed that SSM was the bacteriological test used at PHC in SOC in both Ethiopia and Indonesia. In the sensitivity analyses, we considered alternate scenarios with Xpert used for bacteriological testing for sputum in SOC.
ncb0 | The intervention was modelled as implementing the simple stool Xpert testing method at PHC and hospital level. Thus, considering spontaneous sputum expecto- ration to be limiting in obtaining a test result under SOC, we conceptualised the intervention as increasing the frac- tion of children with a bacteriological test result at both the primary and higher healthcare level.
8mp0 | We assumed that children with a negative bacteriolog- ical test under the intervention would receive clinical assessments for TB while only a small proportion would get clinical assessments under SOC. A clinical diagnosis can be made based on TB-suggestive signs or symptoms, chest X-ray results and tuberculin skin test (Indonesia only) or contact history with a TB patient. Indonesian referral centres that do not have access to chest X-rays and/ or TB skin tests use a score chart for clinical diagnosis.
xjyk | Systematic review data on the sensitivity of stool-based diagnostics for identifying TB in children, indicate sensi- tivity of 50-67%3 4 12 in children with bacteriologically confirmed TB, but very poor sensitivity (2-6%) in clini- cally diagnosed TB.34 We, therefore, assumed that stool
mt0f | testing would only detect a proportion of those children who would be bacteriologically positive under ideal circumstances. The accuracy of Xpert testing on stool using the SOS method was modelled based on a system- atic review4 which reported pooled sensitivity and speci- ficity of stool Xpert of 57.1% (95% CI 51.5-62.7%) and 98.1% (95% CI 97.5-98.6%), respectively, compared with culture on a respiratory sample as the reference standard. The intervention was to reduce mortality through higher sensitivity for detecting TB, and to reduce referrals and reassessments.
awab | Modelling approach
ixcc | The pathway of care shown in figure 1 was coded into a decision tree using the HEdtree package in R. 15 16 15 16 Referral endpoints from PHC level were modelled by adding an identical hospital care pathway to follow the three paths for referral from PHC level. All care outcomes were extended to either death or survival. The probability of children following different pathways through the tree was assumed to depend on: true TB status and age (0-4 years or 5-14 years). Mortality risk from TB by age group and anti-TB treatment (ATT) status was modelled using a published approach, using case-fatality ratios based on systematic review data.18 We neglected mortality in chil- dren who were truly negative for TB. We did not model drug-resistant TB or HIV status.
8p6h | All parameters in the model were treated as uncertain and following specified distributions. All results were based on applying the model to calculate mean outcomes from the tree for each of 10000 samples from these parameter distributions.
pmgl | Literature review and parameterisation
90no | To inform the parameters needed in the decision tree model (figure 1, parameters noted as such in table 1), we followed a three-step data collection process. First, we reviewed data from ongoing studies in Ethiopia11 and Indonesia (Kaswandani et al Xpert MTB/RIF testing on stools using simple preprocessing methods to diagnose childhood pulmonary tuberculosis in Indonesia. 2019). Second, we systematically searched peer-reviewed litera- ture for parameters not available from country study data. In brief, initially, systematic reviews on TB in children were sought by a search of PubMed including the terms 'systematic review', 'meta-analysis', 'tuberculosis' and 'children' on 19 June 2020. Subsequently, we constructed pooled estimates from primary literature, published from 2010 to present, about TB diagnostic testing in infants and children, including healthcare seeking and health- care cascade with a focus on Ethiopia and Indonesia. For this, a systematic search strategy was developed by an information specialist combining free-text and thesaurus searching. Except for searches specifically addressing
