        "content": "8s7w | Because board approval is necessary for V C exits, V Cs negotiate aggressively for board seats when investing in startups. While data on board composition in private, V C-backed firms are scarce, two persistent patterns emerge from various small-scale studies of V C contracting documents and V C-backed firms. First, V C board representation tends to increase with new financing rounds, especially outside rounds that bring in new V Cs. Second, in a plurality of firms, neither common shareholders nor V C-appointed directors ever achieve outright control; the swing vote remains in the hands of an independent director. Keeping the swing vote in the hands of an independent director makes it more difficult for either the common shareholders or the preferred shareholders to act opportunistically with respect to the other class of shareholders. But as one of us has argued in\nkyrg | CARROTS AND STICKS\nn4zo | other work, these studies (and the outwardly neutral appearance of independent directors) may understate the extent of de facto V C control over startup boards.\n9l9c | Two. Shareholder Rights\nhef7 | As noted above, for V Cs seeking an exit transaction, board approval is not sufficient. Shareholder approval is also necessary.\n8zhn | As a matter of corporate law, some shareholder approval is always required. The nature of that approval will depend on the corporate law of the state in which the firm is domiciled as well as the firm's charter and other organizational documents. In some states, such as Delaware, the default arrangement is that a majority of preferred and common shares (voting together) must approve exit transactions. But alternative arrangements, including provisions giving particular series of preferred stock veto rights, are common. In other states, including California, a majority of each class of shares (including common stock) must approve exit transactions.\nbodo | As a matter of business practice, the buyer in a trade sale may also insist on shareholder approvals not required by corporate law or the firm's organizational documents. For example, a buyer might be concerned about appraisal rights. Under corporate law, dissenting shareholders in a merger (those voting against the transaction) can exercise appraisal rights and have a court determine the \"fair value\" of their shares; the buyer is then forced to pay fair value to these dissenters. If the court's determination of fair value is much higher than the amount paid per share in the transaction, the cost of acquiring the target could rise substantially. To minimize potential appraisal claims, an acquirer may insist that a supermajority of shareholders approve the transaction. The bottom line is that corporate law may provide only a floor\nu2tw | CARROTS AND STICKS\n8yt6 | for shareholder-approval requirements.\nltcv | Because common shareholders' approval is sometimes needed as a matter of corporate law (in states where approval by each class of stock is required) or business practice, V Cs can (and sometimes do) negotiate for \"drag-along\" rights that allow them to force common shareholders to vote for any transaction favored by the V Cs. If the common shareholders have agreed to vote their shares as directed by the V Cs, they cannot block an exit transaction via a class vote. Instead, they must seek other means to stop the transaction.\n01hw | Two Potential Entrepreneurial-Team Resistance to Trade Sales\nmda3 | This Part explores why the entrepreneurial team may resist a trade sale that the V Cs propose. Subpart A explains why founders and other executives may oppose, and may be able to impede, a trade sale. Subpart B explains why common shareholders may oppose, and may be able to impede, a trade sale.\nw5v8 | A. Resistance by the Founder and Executives\nnqdq | The founder and other executives may have both reasons and the means to oppose a trade sale.\n59n0 | One. Incentive\n7iv7 | Consider a founder who is still the C E O. The founder-C E O may have ambitious (perhaps grandiose) financial and nonfinancial aspirations for the startup. He or she may believe that these aspirations can be realized only if the startup remains independent and he or she remains in control. A trade sale may well snuff out these aspirations. To the extent the founder-C E O wants to keep the startup independent so that it can realize its full \"potential,\" he or she may oppose a trade sale.\nblvr | Whether or not the founder is still part of the management team, the firm's executives might have two very practical reasons to oppose a trade sale. First, the executives may well be replaced or subject to tighter supervision as the firm comes under the control of a single shareholder (the acquirer). The acquirer could thus force the executives to give up the pay, perquisites, and\n8spn | CARROTS AND STICKS\n5ev7 | prestige associated with their positions-or to work harder for them.\nefbz | Second, executives may own substantial amounts of common stock in the firm, especially if they are part of the founding team. As we discuss below, a trade sale may yield little for common shareholders while eliminating the option value of their stock. To the extent executives own common stock that they will be forced to give up for less than its option value, they have another reason to try to block a trade sale.\niwje | Two. Ability\nkww0 | Executives of V C-backed firms seeking to block a trade sale have three potential means to do so. First, and most importantly, they can refuse to cooperate in the sale of the firm. They can refuse to report acquisition interest to the V Cs, they can drag their feet in dealing with a potential acquirer, and they can refuse to provide information or emphasize negative aspects of the business to a potential acquirer. Moreover, if a potential acquirer wants members of the executive team to stay on after the acquisition (for example, to continue developing a startup's technology), executives can block the deal by refusing to work for the acquirer. In short, executives can use their positional power in the firm to undermine and sabotage efforts to sell it.\ntcsa | Second, to the extent executives have seats on the board, they can threaten to vote against a sale and try to persuade independent directors to oppose the transaction. Attorneys advising a board may prefer a vote to be unanimous because it reduces litigation risk. The desire for a unanimous vote would increase the ability of even a single director to impede a sale.\n63wj | Third, if common-shareholder approval is necessary for the deal and executives own a large block of common shares, they can threaten to vote their shares against the deal and lobby other common shareholders to oppose the deal. This brings us to common-shareholder opposition to trade sales.\ne9du | B. Opposition by Common Shareholders\n81jd | Common shareholders, like executives, may also have an incentive (and some ability) to impede a trade sale.\nc9eb | V Cs exiting via trade sale can always choose to retain their preferred shares rather than convert them into common shares. In this scenario, the\n4id4 | CARROTS AND STICKS\nhgxi | V Cs have liquidation preferences that must be paid in full before common shareholders receive any payout. Thus, common shareholders may not receive much, if anything, in a trade sale. However, even if the V Cs' liquidation preferences exceed the sale price, the common stock might have considerable option value at the time of sale: if the firm is not sold now, it might later hit a home run and be sold later for a price that far exceeds the preferred shareholders' liquidation preferences, giving a large payout to common shareholders. The less common shareholders receive, and the greater the loss of option value, the more common shareholders will wish to block a trade sale.\nhzpf | In blocking a sale, the common shareholders' goal may not be to keep the startup independent so that it can later go public. Rather, these shareholders may resist a trade sale today because they believe that, if the startup remains independent, there is a good chance that the future will bring a more attractive trade sale-one that provides significantly more value for common shareholders.\nz69t | Two. Ability\nhqle | Common shareholders can block a trade sale in three ways: by (a) using their shareholder voting rights; (b) litigating or threatening litigation; or (c) using their influence over the board.\nu1ax | a.
