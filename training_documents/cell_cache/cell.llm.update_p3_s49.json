        "content": "2e62 | DNA methylation in the mammalian germline undergoes two reprogramming events, in which existing DNA methylation is largely eliminated. In mouse zygotes, maternal and paternal genomes show two distinct demethylation patterns upon staining with a five-methylcytosine recognizing antibody. The paternal genome rapidly loses five-methylcytosine signal (six to eight hours after fertilization) while the maternal genome gradually reduces methylation during cleavage-stage development. The overall loss of DNA methylation is associated with reduction of repressive chromatin. The molecular mechanism of five-methylcytosine loss entails oxidation into five-hydroxymethyl cytosine by TET dioxygenase and base excision repair. Active paternal DNA demethylation in the zygote is found in many mammals, but is not entirely conserved and is incomplete. Apart from imprinted loci, which retain their parent-of-origin methylation pattern in imprinting control regions, intracisternal A-particle, an active murine endogenous retrovirus also remains methylated despite global demethylation.\n75y3 | Histone modifications offer a system for recording additional information concerning the histone-associated DNA. Functionality of key histone modifications is more conserved across eukaryotic kingdoms than DNA methylation. The \"histone code\" has many roles including regulation of transcription and DNA repair. Importantly, some histone marks are generated because of a specific event (e.g. transcription, DNA damage), but are not maintained and do not constitute a true epigenetic mark per se.\ns2g2 | A detailed catalogue of histone modification dynamics during oocyte-to-embryo transition has been provided elsewhere. A growing number of chromatin factors has been implicated in establishing the correct epigenetic landscape, including polycomb-mediated gene silencing or histone demethylase KDM1A associated with gene activation or repression in a context-dependent manner. Recent advances in analysis of global chromatin architecture allowed also for exploring genome-wide distribution of histone marks, chromatin accessibility and global chromatin architecture during early development.\nq1q2 | A notable feature of chromatin remodeling during oocyte-to-embryo transition is reduction of parental heterochromatin prior to zygotic genome activation. As mentioned above, most paternal histone modifications, including heterochromatin marks, are almost completely erased during spermatogenesis. Maternal heterochromatin histone marks are also reduced after fertilization in mice. H four K twenty trimethyl and H three K sixty-four trimethyl are rapidly lost by the two-cell stage and H three K nine trimethyl is reduced in pericentric heterochromatin up to the eight-cell stage. These patterns suggest that removal of parental heterochromatin marks is part of the reprogramming process that results in totipotent blastomeres. The pattern is also consistent with the open chromatin structure observed during early development and reminiscent of the chromatin structure observed in pluripotent embryonic stem cells.\ncb7r | Spatially distinct genome organization was observed using a single-nucleus, high-resolution chromosome conformation capture in paternal and female pronuclei during mouse oocyte-to-embryo transition. Notably, the maternal genome was not segregated into active and inactive compartments (possibly due to inactive transcription in the extended G one phase) suggesting that its compartmentalization in zygotes is established de novo. In contrast, there was weak, but significant, compartmentalization of the paternal genome which was either rapidly established de novo or inherited from sperm chromatin.\n68xu | Five. The onset of zygotic genome activation in mouse zygotes - the minor zygotic genome activation\nhd35 | Mice have the earliest known onset of zygotic genome activation among mammals with new RNA transcripts detected in mouse zygotes as early as seven hours after pronucleus formation; a more sensitive analysis could possibly detect transcription even earlier. Male pronuclei produce more RNA than female pronuclei. The difference historically has been ascribed to the chromatin remodeling in the male pronucleus that is associated with protamine histone exchange. This remodeling could provide an opportunity for maternal transcription factors to associate preferentially with the male pronuclear DNA.\n2zpk | The nature of the initial transcription (minor zygotic genome activation) at the one-cell stage has been unclear. Promiscuous or random transcription is supported by the observations that in one-cell mouse embryos, repetitive elements such as B-two-containing sequences or murine endogenous retrovirus L are expressed. In addition, plasmid-borne reporter gene expression does not require an enhancer for robust expression in one-cell embryos, whereas an enhancer is required for robust expression in two-cell embryos. However, apart from detection of murine endogenous retrovirus L retrotransposon transcripts at the late one-cell stage, RNAs produced during minor zygotic genome activation could not be detected by microarrays. Thus, either minor zygotic genome activation did not produce messenger RNAs or their abundance was too low to be detected by these technologies.\nepu7 | Next-generation sequencing analysis of polyadenylated RNA, which can detect low-abundant and unannotated transcripts, documented hundreds of potential minor zygotic genome activation messenger RNAs. However, whether these messenger RNAs reflected transcription or de novo polyadenylation that occurs in fertilized eggs was unclear. This issue could be avoided by using total RNA for next-generation sequencing. Indeed, comparison of published total RNA and polyadenylated RNA next-generation sequencing data in oocytes and early embryos indicates that polyadenylation of maternal messenger RNAs could be confused with transcriptional activation. Two next-generation sequencing studies of total RNA addressed the nature of transcripts produced during the minor wave of zygotic genome activation. One sequenced total RNA (depleted of ribosomal RNA) and identified approximately six hundred genes whose expression was up-regulated greater than one point five fold between oocyte and one-cell stage. The other sequenced total RNA and observed transcription within approximately four thousand genes. Altogether, next-generation sequencing data document that the first wave of\n7od1 | zygotic transcription is relatively promiscuous, low-level, genome-wide, and produces transcripts that are inefficiently spliced and polyadenylated.\n0bqy | Low level, genome-wide transcription that is both inter- and intragenic implies that transcription in one-cell zygotes only requires minimal promoter features. However, minor zygotic genome activation transcription exhibits some selectivity in that oocyte-specific genes are not transcribed. It has been proposed that minor zygotic genome activation could be \"primed\" by the sperm because greater than three hundred minor zygotic genome activation transcripts are also expressed in sperm, but not in parthenogenetic embryos. However, only a few highly expressed testis-specific genes are detected during minor zygotic genome activation and bioinformatic analysis shows that transcription of many genes, known to be expressed during major zygotic genome activation, already can be detected during minor zygotic genome activation. This implies that transcription factors controlling gene expression specifically during oocyte's growth phase are replaced by the one-cell stage with transcription factors controlling embryonic genome activation. Elimination of maternal factors (as documented, for example, for NOBOX) would explain the lack of expression of maternal transcripts and expression of major zygotic genome activation genes. The promiscuous transcription would then reflect increased accessibility of potential (cryptic) promoters to the available transcription factors. As chromatin structures further matures, this accessibility would be lost and the cryptic promoters would not be engaged.",
