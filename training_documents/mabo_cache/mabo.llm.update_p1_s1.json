Brennan J (with whom Mason CJ and McHugh J agreed) envisaged that his decision would afford a new, just and appropriate 'skeleton of the common law' in Australia concerning the title to land of its indigenous peoples. Many have applauded the decision as long overdue. Others have condemned it as a judicial usurpation of power. The Honourable Peter Connolly, a former Judge of the Supreme Court of Queensland, described it in emphatic terms: ' ... as law, the decision is pitiful.' Rarely has a decision of an Australian court attracted so much praise and so much calumny. Most commentators have, of course, not read the decision. Most do not really know exactly what the case decides.\nm50z | That the Mabo decision would attract such varied comment was probably inevitable. After all, the decision rejected the legal concept of terra nullius - a fundamental assumption, until now, in Australia's legal history. It is the extent of the public debate, and its vehemence, which is notable and virtually unique. Needless to say, the recognition, in principle, of a form of native title, lying as a substratum to Australia's established systems of real property law, has excited ambition, consternation and vituperation on the part of those who perceive that their interests may fall within the domain of the emerging Mabo principle.\nme84 | For some, the Mabo decision is correct, morally and legally. For others, it stands as a nearly insurmountable obstacle to their perceived rights and as an impediment to economic progress in Australia as they perceive it. The issues, the subject of popular debate, will only ultimately be clari-\no56m | fied by legislative intervention, or, in the absence of legislative initiative, by decisions of the courts as they have to consider the individual claims to land presented to them.\nslz6 | The Mabo decision is legally significant in a number of respects. First, it recognised the entitlement of indigenous people of Australia to a form of native land title. This recognition required the overruling of the common law doctrine of terra nullius. For this, the High Court has been criticised upon the basis that it thereby usurped a legislative function and so breached the separation of powers doctrine enshrined in the Australian Constitution. Second, the High Court offered guidance as to the circumstances in which an established common law doctrine may be overruled by a court. Third, guidance was offered as to the proper influence which international law and international instruments may have upon the development of the common law in Australia. Finally, the decision implicitly brings to the fore an important question of judicial policy.\n90k5 | The most telling criticism which has been targeted at Mabo concerns not how the High Court came to its decision, but whether, as a matter of judicial policy, it ought not to have left such a seemingly radical change of the law to the elected representatives of the Australian people in their democratic Parliaments.\n9m8s | AN OVERVIEW OF THE MABO DECISION\n893y | The scope of this article forbids a detailed analysis of the Mabo decision. However, it is essential to offer a broad description of the decision if only because most observers have little or no idea of what the case actually holds.\nfavz | The Meriam people (a people of Melanesian descent) live on the Murray Islands. This small group of islands is situated in the Torres Strait. The islands in question comprise an area of nine square kilometers. The largest island is called Mer. There had not been a migration of permanent settlers to the Murray Islands. The islands remain today basically as they were when Australia was acquired by Britain.\n7szx | The indigenous inhabitants of the islands live in village communities. Property is passed, by custom, from one generation to another. The evidence taken by the primary judge in Mabo suggested that the cultivation of gardens was a primary activity. The Meriam people of today retain a strong sense of 'affiliation with their forebears and with the society and culture of earlier times'. Brennan J noted that 'the findings show that Meriam society was regulated more by custom than by law'.\nhx9e | In eighteen seventy-nine, the islands were annexed to the then colony of Queensland. In eighteen eighty-two, the Queensland Government reserved the islands for the native inhabitants. It leased two acres to a society of missionaries. In nineteen thirty-one, a lease of two of the smaller islands in the group was granted by the Queensland Government so that a sardine factory could be established there. However, the lease made express reference to the native interest in the islands by prohibiting interference with the natives' use of the islands.\nywn2 | In Mabo the Meriam people sought, in part, a declaration that, notwithstanding the annexation of the islands by Queensland in eighteen seventy-nine and subsequent related actions, they retained native title to the islands entitling 'the Meriam people ... as against the whole world to possession, occupation, use and enjoyment of the island'. They were successful in this application.\na63r | The actual decision of the High Court of Australia was neatly summarised, with the authority of the court, by Mason CJ and McHugh J in their short note expressing agreement with the judgment of Brennan J. Their Honours said:\ndqvj | In the result, six members of the Court (Dawson J. dissenting) are in agreement that the common law of this country recognizes a form of native title which, in cases where it has not been extinguished, reflects the entitlement of the indigenous inhabitants, in accordance with their laws or customs, to their traditional lands and that, subject to the effect of some particular Crown leases, the land entitlement of the Murray Islanders in accordance with their laws or customs is preserved, as native title, under the law of Queensland.\nr17u | The essential difference between the several majority judgments was that Mason CJ and Brennan and McHugh JJ did not agree with the\n3c47 | ... conclusion to be drawn from the judgments of [Justices] Deane, Toohey and Gaudron ... that, at least in the absence of clear and unambiguous statutory provision to the contrary, extinguishment of native title by the Crown is wrongful and gives rise to a claim for compensatory damages.\ng345 | The summary provided by Mason CJ and McHugh J outlines the legal outcome of the case. However, it does not outline the reasoning of the judges towards this outcome. That reasoning can be outlined in the following way.\nsvhz | THE REASONING BEHIND THE RECOGNITION OF NATIVE TITLE\noaen | There is no doubt that the Crown is sovereign in Australia. Necessarily, it is sovereign in those territories annexed to Australia. However, sovereignty is a concept distinct, in law, from the absolute beneficial ownership of land. Hence, while the Crown is sovereign in all of the territory of Australia, the Crown's 'ultimate', 'final' or 'radical' title enabling the beneficial use of the land remains subject to any pre-existing indigenous native title which has not been extinguished in a manner recognised by the law. That is, the radical beneficial title to land is a potential outcome of the doctrine of sovereignty - it is not a necessary incident to sovereignty.\n```",
