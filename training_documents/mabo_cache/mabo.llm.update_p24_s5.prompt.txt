You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

1ujy | Similarly, in Chu Keng Lim v The Minister for Immigration, Local Govern- ment & Ethnic Affairs, 141 the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights was considered once again. While it was not determinative of the deci- sion in that case, Brennan, Deane and Dawson JJ made their position clear. Their Honours said:142
qzor | We accept the proposition that the courts should, in a case of ambiguity, fa- vour a construction of a Commonwealth statute which accords with the obli- gations of Australia under an international treaty.143 The provisions of [the relevant statute] ... are, however, quite unambiguous.
a0by | The significance of Mabo in this respect is therefore that it has rein- forced the legitimacy of international law and instruments as proper sources of influence in the development of the domestic common law of Australia. The proper inference to be drawn is that, after Mabo, the astute lawyer in Australia will, where appropriate, direct the attention of Aus- tralian courts to relevant international material. Courts themselves, upon the basis of Mabo and the subsequent cases, will increasingly regard such material as legitimate sources of data. As the cases bear out, such use of international material need not be limited to circumstances in which 'in- ternational law declares the existence of universal human rights'.144 The use will come to extend to other, perhaps more mundane, circumstances. In this respect, Mabo has dictated that the common law of Australia will in future be influenced by legal authority, policy, principle and applica- ble rules of international law.
u1ky | What is so revolutionary about this notion? In the age of nuclear fis- sion, the Human Genome Project, global telecommunications, jumbo jets, international problems such as HIV/ AIDS and so on, do we not need a legal system - and legal weapons in our judicial armoury - which, in appropriate cases, can bring our Australian law into harmony with the advancing law of the community of nations? I suggest that we do. Mabo advances this necessary and beneficial legal development apt for the com- ing century.

8hul | HOW REMARKABLE IS THE RECOGNITION OF NATIVE TITLE?
87vz | The recognition of indigenous or Aboriginal land rights is by no means peculiar to the law of Australia. Indeed, Australia is one of the last of the common law nations to acknowledge in its legal system the legitimacy of indigenous or aboriginal land rights.
ym66 | For example, the right of indigenous people to native title has been recognised, in a similar form to Mabo, in Canada.145 Likewise, in Amodu Tijani v The Secretary, Southern Nigeria,146 the Privy Council recognised that a 'usufructuary' right was vested in the indigenous people of a part of Nigeria, despite the fact that the 'radical' title to land was held by the British Crown. In New Zealand, the courts have been vigilant in their protection of the common law rights of the Maori -- although in that country the Treaty of Waitangi establishes a special relationship between the Crown and the Moari people which has no equivalent in Australian history.
l0a3 | Where the particular factual circumstances prevent the recognition of native title, by the application of the established common law principles,147 native title has often been recognised by legislative enactment.148 It is sur- prising to note that, in the United States, the recognition of indigenous native title at common law, once adopted by the Supreme Court, now appears to be denied. It has largely become the domain of the legisla- ture. 149
u8nw | Without embarking on any detailed analysis of the developments in other jurisdictions, the point to be made is that, by whatever means cho- sen in each particular jurisdiction, native or indigenous title has been rec- ognised in most settler and non-settler communities of the common law. In many cases, principles have been adopted similar to those applied in Mabo. The particular factual circumstances sometimes demanded a dif- ferent result. However, an inference may clearly be drawn that the High Court's decision in Mabo was by no means remarkable - still less
l2v9 | revolutionary - tested against international developments. Instead, it was in line with the international developments of accepted responsibili- ties towards indigenous people and it was in line with the responses of many legal system similar to our own, which had long ago abandoned the fiction of terra nullius.150
afbe | To those who say that the creative judiciary ought to have waited for the legislatures of Australia to correct this long-standing affront to justice to an unimportant section of the Australian community - the questions come back: why had they not acted before now? How long must the courts wait before discharging their own constitutional duty to ensure justice under the law?
78r8 | CONCLUSIONS
320g | In my respectful opinion, the Mabo decision is commendable in a number of respects. First, the High Court recognised the legitimate claims of in- digenous people to native title. It did so overruling the inappropriate application of the common law doctrine of terra nullius to the Australian continent. That the application of terra nullius was inappropriate to in- habited countries -- such as Australia undoubtedly was - was explicitly recognised by the court. No fair-minded person, with knowledge of the Aboriginal presence in Australia before British settlement, could seriously object to the decision of the nation's highest court in refusing any longer to build its laws as to land title on a myth and a falsehood.
tp8g | Second, the High Court provided valuable guidance to Australian courts in respect of two crucial aspects of the future development of our common law system. Those are: the proper influence which international law and international instruments may play in the development of the common law; and the proper circumstances in which long-standing rules of the common law in Australia may be overruled.
gxfd | Third, the decision itself, and the subsequent debate, brings to the fore the important issue of the judicial role in a constitutional democracy. The criticism of the decision upon the basis that the High Court in Mabo usurped a legislative function overlooks the legitimate judicial function of judicial creativity in the law. The High Court has increasingly assumed that function in recent years, as I have shown. Other Australian courts have also followed suit. The creative function invites, to some degree, a rejection of the concept of strict judicial restraint. But creativity in the common law judiciary is by no means a recent development. Ultimately,
s2v1 | In Defence of Mabo
jkp9 | the duty of the courts of Australia requires of them the attainment of a proper balance between stability and adaptation of the common law to new and ever changing social circumstances. The Mabo decision is con- sistent with, and is an example of, the High Court's performance of its judicial function.
z8tt | It is clear that Mabo, as it stands now, leaves many questions unan- swered. However, those questions did not have to be answered by the High Court in that case. The decision has, nevertheless, provided a frame- work for the recognition of indigenous native title. That framework must now be completed, either by subsequent case law or by legislative enact- ment. At least now, Australia has a judicial stimulus to action: to establish a more just legal system as it affects the Aboriginal people of this conti- nent.
9g22 | Without Mabo, that stimulus might never have been provided. As a civilised people, we need to ponder that fact when we criticise the deci- sion in Mabo and the judges responsible for it. In the long perspective of history, Mabo will probably be seen as remarkable not for its delivery in 1992 but because it was so long coming in Australian law. It will be viewed as an illustration of the way in which the common law system eventually corrects itself of most errors and rights most wrongs. Being a system based upon human reason and justice, it eventually attains those goals. It did so here. The correction creates, it is true, some uncertainty and some oppo- sition at the time. But, far from being a revolutionary usurpation by the judges of legislative power, Mabo is an example of the common law in action.
