Occasional reports of successful spawning north of this region have been made over the years consistent with the expected shift associated with warming of the CCLME. Fertilized embryos and larvae remain beneath the mixed layer, and as larvae grow, they move inshore to the continental shelf and slope.\n5bq3 | The survival of larval Pacific hake is strongly influenced by environmental conditions such as upwelling, advection, and water temperature experienced during the first few months after spawning. Cold ocean years typically produce weak year classes, while more variation in year class strength occurs among warm ocean years. Cold ocean years along the west coast also have stronger upwelling, equatorward transport after the spring transition, and offshore advection. Depressed Pacific hake recruitment in cooler years may be due to advection of embryos and larvae to unfavorable habitat or the presence of different dominant zooplankton prey and/or predator species. Warm years with weak upwelling and offshore advection early in the year might allow larvae to quickly reach favorable coastal habitat and take advantage of upwelling-driven biological production later in the year.\nrsbu | Nine point three point three Juveniles and adults\nmagd | Nine point three point three point one North-south distribution\ntb74 | The north-south distribution of the migrating coastal stock ranges on average from about twenty-five to fifty-five degrees North, with adults from southern and offshore spawning areas feeding off Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia from April/May through September/October. Age structure, size\n8l69 | distribution, and environmental conditions are all important factors in determining the spatial distribution and annual coast-wide migration of the Pacific hake stock and its availability to both monitoring surveys and commercial fishing operations. Usually, the oldest, largest fish travel the greatest distances north into Canadian waters, likely because they can sustain higher swimming speeds. A greater fraction of these fish also tends to be females, which, beyond the age of three years are on average larger than males. During warm years, Pacific hake migrate farther northward than in cool years due to an intensified northward California undercurrent, weaker upwelling, and equatorward surface flow and changes in prey distribution.\n1jyv | The northward feeding migration begins during the winter and early spring, when poleward transport dominates. These conditions favor the northward movement of Pacific hake. When equatorward transport in surface waters and upwelling conditions in the springtime are strong, the northward movement of Pacific hake is impeded because the fish must swim against strong southward currents, they may avoid cold upwelled waters, or they may find favorable feeding areas farther south after upwelling has improved productivity. The role of ocean conditions in the timing of the southward migration in the fall is less known. Thomson et al. noted that Pacific hake typically disappear from the La Perouse Bank area around the time of the fall transition and linked this disappearance to marked declines in prey production. Saunders and McFarlane suggested that factors influencing southward migration might be similar to those influencing northern migration, i.e., age-dependent swimming speed and favorable current patterns.\nolce | Changes in adult Pacific hake migration may affect where spawning occurs and how well the embryos, larvae, and juveniles of succeeding year classes grow and survive. Ressler et al. reviewed evidence of a more northerly distribution of both spawning and summertime feeding aggregations, including a more northerly distribution of adult hake in summer surveys, year-round presence of adult hake in southeast Alaska, and the presence of hake larvae and juveniles off Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia in summer during some recent years.\nerx1 | Nine point three point three point two Cross-shelf distribution\nb3bt | Pacific hake form dense daytime aggregations on the continental shelf break and near the edges of mid-shelf banks and basins, sometimes extending forty kilometers or more offshore over water depths as great as two thousand meters. Pacific hake are found primarily between depths of fifty and five hundred meters during the day, most commonly in aggregations at depths of between one hundred fifty and two hundred fifty meters.\n```",
