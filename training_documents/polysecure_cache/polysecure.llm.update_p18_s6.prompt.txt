You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

hqgv | Mikulincer and Shaver created a model of attachment-system functioning and dynamics,4 which I've adapted into a flowchart showing how the different attach- ment experiences arise. First, if a child experiences a threat-whether perceived or actual, physical or emotional-they will try to find protection by seeking closeness to an attachment figure. If their attachment figure is available and responsive, and meets their needs, the child feels safe and can go back to playing or exploring. But if their attachment figure is unresponsive or inaccessible, and the child is left with- out a safe haven to turn to, they may adapt by either deactivating (turning down) or hyperactivating (turning up) their attachment needs.
tf20 | As children, when we feel afraid, threatened or in need, and seeking closeness with our parents is not a viable option because they're not available or because turning towards them doesn't make things better, we learn to rely more on our- selves. We become more self-reliant and we minimize our attachment needs. When we deactivate our attachment system, we suppress our attachment-based long- ings-not because we don't still want closeness and connection, but in order to adapt and survive. If we experience discomfort or danger and closeness to a parent is still somewhat of a viable option, we might learn that we can get their attention by intensifying our attachment cries. If our caretakers did not respond to our initial
ar2w | bids, but ramping up our demands and hyperactivating our attachment system did get their attention in some form, we then learn that this is an effective strategy. Later in this chapter, we'll talk about how these strategies-deactivating, hyperac- tivating, or vacillating between the two-relate to the three different insecure at- tachment styles.

81dg | Caregiver behaviors that could lead a child to take on a deactivating attachment strategy include:
8gco | . Neglecting or abusing the child.
0sc2 | . Being emotionally cold or rejecting the child.
yufa | . Giving the child hostile, angry or threatening responses.
4ggu | · Discouraging a child's expression of vulnerability.
vbg6 | . Encouraging (whether explicitly or implicitly) the child to be more self-reliant and independent.
o5y1 | Caregiver behaviors that can incite hyperactivating attachment strategies include:
gxus | . Being unreliable, unpredictable or intrusive, where interactions are some- times gratifying and connected, but at other times mis-attuned and discon- nected .
kfy5 | · Punishing or criticizing a child for their independence or curiosity.
eg1f | . Conveying messages that the child is not enough, or is incapable, stupid or failing in some way.
4npi | . Taking on a helicopter style of parenting, which might include excessive praise but also excessive control, protectiveness or perfectionism.
q93a | . Experiences of abuse or traumas that occur when the child is separated from their primary attachment figure, which can reinforce the notion that it's dan- gerous to be apart from them.
gxvi | Both of these strategies can also occur simultaneously, meaning a child may expe- rience both hyperactivation and deactivation, or may vacillate between the two sur- vival strategies. We'll discuss this more in the section about fearful-avoidant at- tachment.
igdg | SECURE ATTACHMENT: WHEN ATTACHMENT NEEDS ARE MET IN CHILDHOOD
3u7c | Children who have a secure attachment style have generally experienced a family environment that's mostly warm and supportive. Their parents or caretakers are available, accessible and responsive to their needs, enough of the time. Not neces- sarily all of the time but enough of the time, when the child has an attachment need, they reach out to their attachment figure and that attachment figure moves towards them in an emotionally attuned way that calms the child's nervous system.6 This in turn teaches the child that allowing themselves to feel their needs and communi- cating those needs to others is an effective strategy. A caretaker being present, safe, protective, playful, emotionally attuned and responsive is of paramount importance to a child developing a secure attachment style.
cx2c | Early positive attachment experiences have a huge impact on healthy brain development and emotional regulation.Z When the attachment figure is able to emotionally resonate with the child, the child feels supported and learns to regulate their own positive and negative emotional arousal. This helps to lower stress hor- mones and increase oxytocin (the bonding hormone). By co-regulating with a care- taker, the child learns to understand and process facial and social cues, they learn empathy and they develop an increased ability to cope with stress. When children experience secure interactions with the adults in their lives and function from a se- cure attachment style, they also tend to have better self-esteem, be more resilient to trauma, have strong social skills, concentrate better, enjoy play and have solid overall emotional health. Through these nourishing experiences, a child develops a sense of safety and trust. They take in the messages that the world is a friendly place and that they can ask for what they want because the people in their lives care and are willing to help.
uoim | Secure Attachment as an Adult
dwsl | Early childhood attachment experiences become the blueprint for the kinds of con- nections we go on to expect and seek in our adult romantic relationships. The interactions we experienced with our caretakers create internal working models of how we see ourselves-both positively and negatively-and set our positive or negative expectations about how attuned and available our partners will be to us in
lpnq | times of need.§ People with a secure attachment style experience a healthy sense of self and see themselves and their partners in a positive light. Their interpersonal experiences are deeply informed by their knowledge that they can ask for what they need and people will typically listen and willingly respond. It's empowering to know that our actions are effective. As children, if we reach out with our body and use our voice to get the help or connection we need to mitigate our distress, and if our parents usually meet these attachment bids, we learn that we matter and are worthy of love. This builds the foundation for healthy self-esteem and a sense of compe- tence in the world. As adults, this helps us be more flexible when our partners can't meet our needs. We're better able to weather hearing no, to wait for our needs to be met at a later time or to seek an alternative means of having our attachment needs met without shaking the foundation of our relationship.
c0cp | Bowlby viewed attachment as relevant "from the cradle to the grave." He said that adult romantic relationships function as reciprocal attachment bonds, where each partner serves as an attachment figure for the other. Bowlby conceived of the parent-child attachment relationship as having four essential features: proximity maintenance, separation distress, safe haven and secure base. We can see many paral- lels between the parent-child attachment relationship and the adult-adult attach- ment relationship. For instance, adults seek physical contact with each other, en- gage in dreamy eye-gazing, and even use baby talk or cooing sounds to nurture and encourage bonding. We feel separation distress when apart, and we turn towards our romantic partners as a safe haven in times of need. We also see them as a se- cure base from which to explore the world and our sexuality, and we feel able to share important discoveries with them.10
vm3e | Of course, there are differences between the parent-child attachment bond and the adult-adult attachment bond. As adults, even though we seek regular and con- sistent proximity to our partner, we can tolerate much longer periods of separation from our partners by employing mental representations of them to help give us an understanding of why we are apart (e.g., "I know my partner is at work," "My part- ner is away on a trip" or "I have this weekend with my kids and I'll see my partner
