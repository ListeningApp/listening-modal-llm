You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).

Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021.

kiqm | THE WAVELENGTH OF A WARM PARTICLE
6n7u | In thermal equilibrium, the average energy of a classical free particle in 3d space is
codw | (E) = CkT 3
suvf | where T is the temperature and k is Boltzmann's constant.
psc6 | If the particle has mass m,
m69t | E= mv2, p=mv = p= V2mE = V3mkT
ylr1 | In quantum mechanics, a particle of momentum p has wavelength X = h/p where h is the unreduced Planck's constant. So, at temperature T, the typical wavelength of a free particle of mass m is roughly
7xmx | V3mkT
spty | Particles are waves! Their wavelength is shorter when their momentum is bigger. And the warmer they are, the bigger their momentum tends to be. So there should be a formula for the typical wavelength of a warm particle. And here it is! It helps us visualize the world: particles are a bit blurry, with a characteristic wavelength that depends on temperature.
fosi | We get this formula from a blend of ideas. Classical mechanics says kinetic energy is E equals p squared over two m. Classical statistical mechanics says E equals two k T. Quantum mechanics says X equals h over p. It's pretty optimistic to put these formulas together and see what we get. But the result is approximately correct, though subject to limitations.
tsuw | We derived E equals k T using classical statistical mechanics. But it's close to correct for a single quantum particle in a big enough box at high enough temperatures. Otherwise quantum effects kick in.
l0hr | Another problem is that (E) = 2kT and E = p2/2m do not imply (p) = V3mkT, even if p here means the magnitude of the momentum vector. The arithmetic mean of a square is not the square of the arithmetic mean! Really the 'root mean square' of p is v3mkT. Similarly, even if the root mean square of p is v3mkT and quantum mechanically > = h/p, we cannot conclude that the root mean square of \ is h/v3mkT. Again, you cannot pass a root mean square through a reciprocal!
5jk8 | So, our derivation above is dodgy-but it's okay as an order-of-magnitude approxi- mation for a warm enough particle in a big enough box.
4cms | THE PARTITION FUNCTION AND THE THERMAL WAVELENGTH
iynx | The partition function of a classical free particle of mass m in a 1d box of length L is
ub6m | Z = −∞ −∞ 0 [L 100 e-Bp2/2m
a67b | dp dq h
8ibh | = L
elv7 | 2Tm β
oazo | where
l85h | 1= h \ 2m
he3v | 27Tm
y1kq | is called the 'thermal wavelength'.
clin | Last time we saw that at temperature T, the typical wavelength of a free particle of mass m is roughly
hiag | 1 V3mkT h = hy β 3m
wfg5 | But the partition function of a classical particle of mass m in a box simplifies a lot if we introduce a slightly different distance scale, which people call the thermal wavelength
f5sm | A = 2TmkI = hv
yw9n | V2TmkT
8u3s | Then the partition function is just the length of the box divided by A. The thermal wavelength A is a bit smaller than X: we have A ~ 0.69). But we probably shouldn't worry about this too much, since our calculation of \ was so rough. Of course all these details are worth thinking about. But the thermal wavelength will turn out to be very useful!
hmg7 | FREE ENERGY AND THE THERMAL WAVELENGTH
p0a7 | In thermal equilibrium, a classical free particle of mass m in a 1d box of length L has free energy
ochb | F =- 1 1 B ln
pcum | L h -
bu0s | 2Tm
jr8i | β
7mby | F = - kT In
a1ha | where
gkfg | 2Tm β
v9o7 | A = hy
gq1l | is the thermal wavelength.
90in | Since the partition function of the classical free particle in a one-dimensional box is
8zn4 | and free energy is related to the partition function by
exk3 | F =- InZ,
tx5q | we have
ly5j | Expressing this in terms of temperature rather than coolness, we have
h2rq | F = - kT In
9shl | ENTROPY AND THE THERMAL WAVELENGTH
rur1 | In thermal equilibrium, a classical free particle of mass m in a 1d box of length L has expected energy
7ai3 | (E) = KT
xoe3 | and free energy
ldca | F = - kT In Λ L
pten | where A = h/V2TmkT is the thermal wavelength.
2aah | But entropy S is ((E) - F)/T, so
5ww2 | S = k ln
89h3 | Now that we have clean formulas for the expected energy and free energy of the classical free particle in a 1-dimensional box, we can get a nice formula for its entropy. This is equivalent to the formula we saw before, but it's easier to understand. It's a sum of two terms:
tbgj | S=k (In +2).
ba14 | Let's make sure we understand this! We've seen that for any system in thermal equilibrium, the entropy is the sum of two parts:
72rs | 1. The free energy part. For the classical particle in a 1-dimensional box, this is
kb97 | 7 = kln -. F L
1jn0 | V
8q4r | 2. The expected energy part. For the classical particle in a 1-dimensional box, this is
y60y | (E)
14cu | 1 = 2 k .
sxgl | The free energy part is always k times the logarithm of the number of accessible states, and for the particle in a one-dimensional box the number of accessible states is L/A. The expected energy part is 2k, by the equipartition theorem, because the particle's expected energy depends on one degree of freedom.
v1id | Let us think a bit more about why the number of accessible states is L/A. The most rigorous approach is simply to compute the number of accessible states that is,
ospk | the partition function:
ayzb | Z =
yid2 | = 0 CL
0tro | = L h 2Tm β
fkdd | = L Λ
egd7 | A more hand-wavy approach is to imagine the space of states of the particle, meaning the space of position-momentum pairs (q, p) € [0, L] x R. When it comes to counting accessible states, each region of area h holds one state. The 'accessible' states are those where the energy is not too big compared to kT, so the probability density e-E/kT is fairly large. This is a bit vague, as it must be, because 'accessibility' is not really a yes- or-no matter. But let's just pretend it is, and demand E ≤ kT. Then the 'accessible' region of state space is where p2 /2m ≤ kT, or
um9s | pl V2m/ B.
it25 | This region is
3mfz | {(q, p) | ≤ q ≤ L, - \2m/ B < p ≤ \2m/ B } { [0, L] x IR
0vyw | It has area L x 21/2m/3, so the number of states it holds is this divided by h, or
rf9l | 2L
hycc | 2m h VB VITA 4 L
l8ni | This is just 13% more than the exact value of Z. More importantly, I hope this cal- culation gives you a mental picture of number of accessible states for the particle in a one-dimensional box. A mental picture can be helpful even if it's oversimplified. I like to imagine counting the little rectangles of area h that can fit into the 'accessible' region of state space.
ipcw | In fact this idea is related to Bohr and Sommerfeld's early approach to quantum physics, the 'old quantum theory', which was later subsumed by the theory of 'geometric quantization'. In Bohr and Sommerfeld's approach, when we quantize a classical system with one position and one momentum degree of freedom, there should be approximately one quantum state for each region of area h in the qp plane. More generally, when we quantize a classical system with n position and n momentum degrees of freedom, there should be approximately one quantum state for each region R C R2n with
adu9 | R ď™pď™q hn =1.
pq8y | So, delving into more quantum mechanics, and geometric quantization, would shed more light on the calculations we're doing now.
