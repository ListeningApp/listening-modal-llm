        "content": "ma93 | Control and manipulation of the virtual environment VR offers the ability to control and manipulate features of the environment that can be used to test and assess relevant variables, such as eliciting paranoia in social situations or examining responses to cues within the environment. Experimental control is a cornerstone of psychological research, enabling direct comparison between conditions to determine causal relationships between variables. Strong methodological rigor can be achieved in VR through careful manipulation of variables across conditions in virtual environments. For example, Veling et al randomized participants with psychosis, siblings, and health controls to conditions with varying levels of social stress within a virtual environment. They found a dose-response relationship between social stress and paranoia, which was associated with psychosis liability, supporting the theory that social stress may account for the relationship between the environment and psychosis. Another example comes from Freeman et al who examined experiences of paranoia and perceptions of social rank within a virtual underground train. Participants were placed in two conditions: one where they were taller than others on the train and another where they were shorter. Findings showed that under the condition\nc6hh | where they were shorter, participants had a more negative view of themselves relative to others and greater levels of paranoia. The differences in paranoia were fully mediated by social comparison, suggesting that negative views of the self, relative to others, may drive feelings of mistrust.\ny7ea | Another capability of VR is that individuals are able to interact with objects within the system, rather than simply observing or imagining different scenarios. This not only enhances ecological validity, as interaction is inherent to the real world, but also allows researchers to examine behaviors of individuals within the virtual environment and their impact by manipulating different contingencies. Previously, this type of research was only possible using actors or \"confederates\" who performed certain roles within situations, which was costly and limited in ecological validity. Furthermore, the controlled nature of the experience enables greater reproducibility relative to field studies where the environment is constantly changing. These capabilities have important implications for social psychology, but also for identifying differences characteristic of mental disorders. For example, previous studies have demonstrated that exposure of each participant to the same virtual scenario can allow controlled examination of the determinants of paranoid ideation. As such, the enhanced environmental control and interactivity of VR allows for standardization of otherwise dynamic variables, ensuring a consistent assessment experience, both over time and across individuals.\nnav4 | Personalization and tailoring\ngem8 | Because virtual environments are computer-generated or recorded, it is also possible to program tailored VR experiences that match individual needs, abilities, or preferences (for example, slowing down a sequence, using text or audio instructions, minimizing distraction). Rizzo et al developed a VR-based exposure therapy for post-traumatic stress disorder that enabled the therapist to customize various features of a combat scenario most relevant to the trauma experienced by soldiers. Since effective treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder requires exposure to cues of highly idiosyncratic experiences, customization of the virtual environment is an important feature. Such customization also has important\ne8nr | utility for assessment purposes, though very little research has examined this to date. For example, functional analysis involves the examination of how symptoms change in relation to different triggers and responses. VR could be used to examine changes in symptoms across different situations and in relation to certain cues, for example visual, auditory, and olfactory, allowing precise insight into the determinants of relevant clinical events. Gatti et al describe a VR protocol whereby clinicians were able to customize the virtual environment with personally relevant cues to alcohol craving and behaviors for the purposes of clinical formulation. The ability to perform psychiatric assessment via personalized tests and tasks meaningful to the individual and their situation is powerful but is currently understudied within VR.\nk78w | Real-time, automated data capture\ng9du | The benefits of using technology for automatic data capture has been well recognized. Mobile apps for tracking symptoms and other clinically relevant information over time has been a major area of progress in digital mental health, with findings suggesting that they are feasible and acceptable to individuals. Researchers are starting to consider how data collected from devices such as smartphone apps and VR might be clinically informative. Patterns in data collected from technology devices, such as movement, speech, and geolocation, have been associated with changes in symptoms and may even be used to predict relapse among people with psychosis.\nf682 | It is possible to capture data automatically from users during VR experiences. Eye-tracking software can be integrated with VR, capturing a source of data commonly used to identify markers of psychiatric disorders and cognition. It is also possible to measure behaviors within the virtual environment, such as decisions about how to navigate and interact with different objects and agents. Capturing the temporal relationship between variables in real time (i.e., how thoughts, emotions, and behaviors unfold in relation to changes in the environment), makes it possible to test hypothesized processes and causal interactions. Furthermore, physiological measures commonly used as objective indicators of psychological states, such as heart rate and galvanic skin response, can be recorded and synced with virtual content or even eye gaze. MÃ¼hlberger et al developed a VR-delivered behavioral avoidance test to assess fear in specific phobia while automatically collecting heart rate, skin conductance, subjective rating of discomfort, and stimulus-approach distance. Results indicated that the physiological measures were good predictors of fear intensity. Others have begun to investigate integrating more sophisticated biosensors, such as wireless electroencephalography, with VR to assess psychologically relevant constructs such as emotional state, with the aim to feed the data back to clinicians for enhanced decision making or even within VR itself as biofeedback.\npbea | Increasing engagement \nccpt | Another benefit of delivering clinical evaluation via VR is the potential to enhance an individual's engagement with the test or assessment. Traditional testing procedures undertaken in mental health can be lengthy, repetitive, and/or laborious, which may impact individual performance, especially for measures of attention or memory. Therefore, replacing traditional assessment with more engaging, meaningful, or enjoyable methods has substantial appeal. This is particularly important given that symptoms such as poor concentration and lack of motivation are common across mental health conditions. This application of VR may also be of benefit in young people experiencing mental ill-health, a population where digital technologies are common and their use for mental health is promising.\n0fpw | VR may enhance engagement with clinical evaluations through the immersive, realistic, enjoyable environments enabled by the technology. The term \"presence\" has been used in VR research to refer to the subjective experience of being in a place or environment, even when one is physically situated in another. The feeling of presence is influenced by the degree of immersion, defined as the extent to which the system generates sensory stimulation consistent with sensorimotor experience (for example, images are updated as the head moves). Sense of presence has traditionally been linked to an individual's level of engagement and motivation. As such, high rates of presence and immersion reported within investigations of clinical uses of VR point to the ability of the technology to enhance engagement with clinical evaluation. However, it is currently difficult to create VR environments with a high level of realism, which can create a strong aversion to the experience. \ndqn8 | VR could further increase engagement with clinical evaluation by adding elements of digital games to the assessments, a process known as \"gamification.\" Incorporating features of games, such as rewards and feedback, within VR may",
