You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

ma98 | The slight discrepancy arises solely from the fact that a hydrogen molecule is not exactly half the mass of a helium atom! It's a bit heavier. It's actually more like 0.50358 times the mass of a helium. This makes its thermal wavelength a bit smaller than our estimate in the last paragraph, which boosts its entropy. It's nice that such subtleties, ultimately due to nuclear physics, are showing up here.
rboa | By the way, all our calculations have been for the most common isotopes of hydrogen and helium: hydrogen whose nucleus consists of a single proton, and helium whose nucleus consists of two protons and two neutrons. Other isotopes have significantly different mass, and this changes the entropy values significantly.
bdkb | Puzzle 48. Helium has a lighter isotope called helium-3, whose nucleus is made of two protons and just one neutron. The mass of helium-3 is <LATEX>5 . 0 0 8 2 3 \times 1 0 ^ { - 2 7 } \mathrm { k g } .</LATEX> If we repeat our calculation of the entropy of helium at standard temperature and pressure, changing only this mass, what value do we get for the bits of entropy per atom of helium-3?
l47b | Puzzle 49. Hydrogen has a heavier isotope called deuterium, whose nucleus is made of one proton and one neutron. The mass of a hydrogen molecule made of two deuterium atoms is <LATEX>3 . 3 4 4 4 9 \times 1 0 ^ { - 2 7 } \mathrm { k g } .</LATEX> If we repeat our calculation of the entropy of hydrogen at standard temperature and pressure, changing only this mass, what do we get for the bits of entropy per molecule of this sort?
zio7 | THE ENTROPY OF HYDROGEN: EXPERIMENT
mty2 | The entropy of hydrogen at standard temperature and pressure has been measured to be 130.68 joules/kelvin per mole.
tbjy | One bit of unknown information per molecule corresponds to about 5.7631 joule/kelvin of entropy per mole.
mszq | Thus, each molecule of hydrogen at standard temperature and pressure has about 130.68 ~ 22.675 5.7631
i0p0 | bits of unknown information.
ok43 | Okay, let's compare our theoretical prediction to experiment.
qnqv | The experimental figure for the entropy of hydrogen at standard temperature and pressure is 130.68 joules/kelvin per mole, which translates into 22.675 bits per molecule. This is larger than our theoretical prediction of 21.848 bits per molecule by about 3.8%.
iwpq | That's not bad. We can say we solved our original problem fairly well. But the percentage error here is about 4 times worse than it was for calculation for helium. Why is it worse?
oial | I haven't studied this, but I can imagine two reasons. First, remember that quantum effects kick in when V/NA3 ceases to be large. This quantity is a bit smaller for hydrogen than for helium. Remember, for helium it was 279663 at standard temperature and pressure, while for hydrogen it's 113971. But that's still very large, so I imagine quantum effects are still quite tiny.
8xfx | Second, hydrogen molecules are not chemically inert like helium atoms, and they're larger, and diatomic rather than monatomic. So I'd expect them to interact more, making the ideal gas approximation worse. This feels like a more plausible explanation for the 3.8% discrepancy.
pgp5 | Puzzle 50. Do research to find more accurate calculations of the entropy of hydrogen gas. What are the main sources of error in the calculation we have done here?
8rz1 | WHERE DID WE GO?

vi9g | We're done! Or at least we reached our stated goal. But there is a lot more to say about entropy. In a way we've scarcely scratched the surface. For more on the mathematics of entropy, I recommend these books:
tyl7 | For classical and quantum statistical mechanics, I recommend these:
2hpu | The second one has an intense focus on our friend the box of gas. And for the principle of maximum entropy, I again recommend this insightful and opinionated text:
a10k | THE FIRST LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS
2pp5 | Suppose a system has some measure space X of states with functions called energy E : X -> R and volume V : X -> R.
l20h | Consider probability distributions on X maximizing the Gibbs entropy S subject to constraints on (E) and (V).
kfwj | Then as we vary (E) and (V) we have d(E) = TdS - Pd(V)
7hi1 | where T is called temperature and P is called pressure.
vpa2 | I said we were done. But what kind of course on entropy doesn't cover the three laws of thermodynamics? I talked a bit about the Third Law, but I haven't even mentioned the other two yet.
mtlg | Here's why: this wasn't a course on thermodynamics. In 'classical thermodynamics' there's a tradition of taking concepts such as energy, work and heat as primitive, and treating the laws of thermodynamics as axioms. I've instead been explaining a bit of 'classical statistical mechanics', where we start with probability theory and attempt to derive classical thermodynamics. In this approach the laws of thermodynamics are not fundamental. They actually look a bit odd: they become results that hold under various conditions, so each one becomes a collection of theorems and conjectures.
6rz3 | I'll state versions of the three laws of thermodynamics in the language we've devel- oped here. But please be aware that my versions are idiosyncratic and will make some people raise their eyebrows. I'm afraid you'll have to go elsewhere, like Reif's book, to learn these laws in their traditional form!
oxdb | We've been maximizing entropy subject to a constraint on the expected value of one quantity. What if we do two or more? Everything works the same way, but the fundamental relation between temperature, energy and entropy, d(E) = TdS, gets one extra term for each constraint. The resulting equation is a version of the 'First Law of Thermodynamics'.
v978 | I'll explain the case with one extra constraint. Suppose we've got a measure space X whose points are states of some system. Choose two functions on it. They could be anything, but let's call them energy and volume and write them as E: X -> R and V : X -> R. These terms are favored because thermodynamics arose in part from the study of steam engines, where you've got a cylinder of steam with some energy and some volume. For any probability distribution p: X -> [0, 0), we can write down a formula for its Shannon entropy
