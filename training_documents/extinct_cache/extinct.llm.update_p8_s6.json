        "content": "5bq3 | Assuming that anthropogenic extinctions are morally problematic, how should they be avoided? What are morally permissible (or even demanded) means of doing so? One way of morally responding to extinctions is to turn our attention to species that have not yet gone extinct, but which are at risk of extinction.\n\nezla | This relates to the much broader body of work on the conservation of species in which new means and policies are being developed and discussed from a multidisciplinary perspective. To give one example of philosophical discussion pertaining endangered species, consider 'assisted migration' or 'species translocation'. The discussion about such proposals originated in grassroots activism but was taken up by ecologists, and ethicists soon joined the debate. The idea is to transfer populations to more suitable habitats where those species did not exist before to prevent them from going extinct. This is a conservation approach that is meant to be appropriate because of climate change. There are different views on this matter. For example, there are discussions about how intentional translocation affects the value of the target species and its habitats. To Sandler, who focuses on the ethics of species, assisted colonisation is only justified in rare occasions in which 'the translocated species\n\nrsbu | would be ecologically or instrumentally valuable in the recipient site (and this can be reliably predicted in advance), or the species has final value.' From an animal rights perspective, in turn, Angie Pepper argues that 'the permissibility of practices like assisted migration hinges on whether or not we can justify imposing risks on animals in order to prevent rights violations further down the line.'\n\nmagd | Risk of extinction\n\ntb74 | For the purposes of moral theorising, 'risk' refers to the likelihood of a loss or harm taking place, which makes 'risk' a value concept referring to an unwanted outcome through human actions, in addition to an epistemological dimension where that outcome is likely to happen with a specific probability. If that probability is unknown, it is referred to as 'uncertainty' rather than 'risk', which often motivates a precautionary approach. With respect to species extinction, there are two main ways of discussing risks and extinctions: the first focuses on the risk of a single species facing extinction, and the second pays attention to broader systemic and accumulative risks, either in terms of mass extinction or in terms of a collapse of the biospheric system as we know it.\n\n8l69 | Regarding single species, risk is a premeditative concept that enables us to respond to near-extinction, such as when a species extinction is predicted to happen in the light of best ecological modelling, where the predicted quantity of extinctions has often been referred to as 'extinction debt.' Against this background, deliberations on employing concepts and ideas drawn from ecological sciences and population biology are taking place within environmental ethics and the philosophy of biology, which includes topics of ethical relevance such as decision-making under uncertainty and the applicability of the precautionary principle, land-use planning, protected area networking and prioritisation.\n\n1jyv | Risks have value dimensions, and what value is justifiably ascribed to a species will play a part in how it is to be prioritised. Most efforts to save near-extinct species require prioritising: global and national Red Lists of Threatened Species are examples of such a conservation policy, as is Bryan Norton's 'triage model.' Yet, prioritisations come with a range of philosophical problems. According to Norton, many of those challenges arise due to the difficulties of reducing the values of species to a single scale.\n\nolce | A broader perspective to the risk landscape emerges when we consider what kinds of systemic risks each extinction gives rise to. A common argument rests on an analogy between species extinctions and the loss of rivets on an airplane wing. It aims to show that the ethical significance of extinction is due to its potential effects on ecosystems.\n\nerx1 | 'rivets,' which in turn are prerequisites for human and nonhuman survival. When conjunct with uncertainty regarding the number of rivets, or species, that an airplane wing, or ecosystem, can dispose of without collapsing, it becomes essential to preserve species and avoid their extinction.\n\n0w8m | This expresses a form of precautionary principle, which has been discussed both critically and approvingly from different philosophical perspectives. The precautionary principle is also a part of the preamble of the Convention of Biological Diversity where it is stated that lack of full knowledge ought not to justify inaction, and it is mentioned in the framework of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services. The complexity and uncertainty pertaining to how ecosystems work provide support for a precautionary principle concerning environmental decision-making. Yet, some authors consider its policy implications problematic due to leading to logical contradictions by potentially recommending two opposing actions, failing to account for possible benefits, neglecting that precaution has costs and for lacking conceptual clarity.\n\nvcu3 | De-extinction\n\nhjzj | What should be done after extinctions have already occurred? Besides more conventional species conservation practices, there is a broader discussion on the ethics of developing and using biotechnologies for conservation purposes and beyond. Setting these larger concerns aside, more technology-focused conservation approaches - if justifiable in certain cases - should be seen as complementary rather than alternatives to conventional conservation practices. Accordingly, the subject of debate concerns whether there are certain cases where such technological means are appropriate and desirable at all.",
