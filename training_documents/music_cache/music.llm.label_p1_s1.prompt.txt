You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

06yq | Microdosing with psychedelics to self-medicate for ADHD symptoms in adults: A naturalistic study

8r5j | ABSTRACT
2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

o2kr | GENERAL HISTORY OF MUSIC
v6sk | From the Earliest Ages to the Present Period (1789)
1wj6 | by CHARLES BURNEY - Mus.D., F.R.S.
936l | VOLUME THE FIRST WITH CRITICAL AND HISTORICAL NOTES by FRANK MERCER
06yq | New York HARCOURT, BRACE AND COMPANY
dpv6 | INTRODUCTION
8r5j | IN preparing this edition of Burney's " General History of Music," my aim has been to make the work more valuable to the general reader; that is, the class of reader for whom the " History " " was intended. I have not attempted to bring it " up to date " in the sense of any tampering with the text, or softening or altering the opinions held by the author. Too many critics praise or censure Burney's work (and, indeed, all Histories) in accordance with the treatment, sympathetic or otherwise, meted out to their own particular period. Burney's History is not a period History-it is a General History, and it is an intensely personal one. I do not intend to embark upon a defence of Burney's opinions; they were his own, and they cannot be dismissed lightly; but I must draw attention to one thing that is frequently overlooked by many, and that is the necessity of appreciating the 18th century meaning of words such as barbarous and licentious, etc. The age of Burney was an age of frank speaking, and one must not ignore this fact when reading works of that period. Burney often uses words which have, since his day, received a more special meaning, and if this is kept in mind many of his so-called " savage and harsh strictures " will not appear unfair.
2taz | In the present edition, Burney's text and notes (with the original spelling) have been given in full and unaltered with the following exceptions :
o3ya | (1) The transcription of the musical tract by Tunsted in the second book has been punctuated correctly.
r5il | (2) A more correct version of Cutell's tract in Book 2 has been substituted.
5gui | (3) The titles of the early English Psalters have been given in more detail.
82qc | All the dates and corrections enclosed in square brackets [ ] are additions for which I am responsible. .
ls7d | The work has been re-indexed, and I trust that the new index will be found more useful than the original one.
tzt3 | The musical examples are also complete with the exception of a very dull example of a degree exercise, which will be found in Vol. III, p. 351, of the original edition. One or two examples of the difficulties to be found in Virginal music have been curtailed, but enough remains to show the nature of the difficulty. In his musical examples, Burney employs almost every variety of clef. I think that the only one I have not discovered is the old French
t8vv | A GENERAL HISTORY OF MUSIC
qvnu | violin clef. The unusual ones have been altered to modern usage, but I have retained the tenor and alto C clefs.
kggw | The question of the examples of Tudor music has given me considerable trouble. Burney not only alters that peculiar feature of the technique of the period, the so-called false relation or augmented octave, but in some cases his scansion of the words has made him change a semibreve into a dotted minim and a crotchet. All cases of wrong notes have been altered, but in the majority of cases I have allowed his arrangement of the words to stand.
xrd1 | For the sake of convenience Burney's volumes are called Books, so that Book 1 is Burney's Volume I, etc. When volume is mentioned it refers to the present edition.
5746 | My own notes are indicated by asterisks, and in selecting those inserted, from the large number I had prepared, I have been influenced by what might be most useful to the non-specialist.
7toz | If I endeavoured to thank publicly all those who have given information and help in the preparation of this edition, my intro- duction would be extended to an inordinate length, but I must give my thanks to Dr. Percy Scholes for sending me a proof copy of his valuable book, " The Puritans and Music "; to Miss Burney, of Wandsworth, for permission to copy and include letters from her collection of Burney MSS; to Richard Border, Esq., for the letter from Burney to Lady Banks; to Raymond Conrad, Esq., for information about the Troubadours; to the officials at the British Museum and the Music Library of the University of London; to G. Ceci for permission to photograph his copy of " A musical evening at Dr. Burney's "; to the Education Department of the Columbia Graphophone Company, Ltd., for the loan of records; and, above all, to my wife, without whose constant help my work in connection with the publication could not have been accomplished.

99fo | TO THE QUEEN [CHARLOTTE]
y5r7 | MADAM,
lrry | THE condescension with which your Majesty has been pleased to permit your name to stand before the following History, may justly reconcile the author to his favourite study, and convince him, that whatever may be said by the professors of severer wisdom, the hours which he has bestowed upon Music have been neither dishonourably, nor unprofitably spent.
hvhm | THE science of musical sounds, though it may have been depreciated, as appealing only to the ear, and affording nothing more than a momentary and fugitive delight, may be with justice considered as the art that unites corporal with intellectual pleasure, by a species of enjoyment which gratifies sense, without weakening reason; and which, therefore, the Great may cultivate without debasement, and the Good enjoy without depravation.
863b | THOSE who have most diligently contemplated the state of man, have found it beset with vexations, which can neither be repelled by splendour, nor eluded by obscurity; to the necessity of combating these intrusions of discontent, the ministers of pleasure were indebted for that kind reception, which they have perhaps too indiscriminately obtained. Pleasure and innocence ought never to be separated; yet we seldom find them otherwise than at variance, except when Music brings them together.
fj24 | To those who know that Music is among your Majesty's recreations, it is not necessary to display its purity, or assert its dignity. May it long amuse your leisure, not as a relief from evil, but as an augmentation of good; not as a diversion from care, but
uz3c | TO THE QUEEN
d5bi | as a variation of felicity. Such, Madam, is my sincerest wish, in which I can, however, boast no peculiarity of reverence or zeal; for the virtues of your Majesty are universally confessed; and however the inhabitants of the British empire may differ in their opinions upon other questions, they all behold your excellences with the same eye, and, celebrate them with the same voice; and to that name which one nation is echoing to another, nothing can be added by the respectful admiration, and humble gratitude of,
ba4l | MADAM,
ffx8 | your Majesty's,
s6su | most obedient
y219 | and most devoted Servant,
06ht | CHARLES BURNEY.
v3r2 | PREFACE
nv42 | T HE feeble beginnings of whatever afterwards becomes great or eminent, are interesting to mankind. To artists, therefore, and to real lovers of art, nothing relative to the object of their employment or pleasure is indifferent.
xags | Sir Francis Bacon recommends histories of art upon the principle of utility, as well as amusement ; and collecting into one view the progress of an art seems likely to enlarge the knowledge, and stimulate the emulation of artists, who may, by this means, be taken out of the beaten track of habit and common practice, to which their ideas are usually confined.
jc47 | The love of lengthened tones and modulated sounds, different from those of speech, and regulated by a stated measure, seems a passion implanted in human nature throughout the globe ; for we hear of no people, however wild and savage in other particulars, who have not music of some kind or other, with which we may suppose them to be greatly delighted, by their constant use of it upon occasions the most opposite: in the temple, and the theatre ; at funerals, and at weddings ; to give dignity and solemnity to festivals, and to excite mirth, chearfulness, and activity, in the frolicsome dance. Music, indeed, like vegetation, flourishes differently in different climates ; and in proportion to the culture and encouragement it receives ; yet, to love such music as our ears are accustomed to, is an instinct so generally subsisting in our nature, that it appears less wonderful it should have been in the highest estimation at all times, and in every place, than that it should hitherto never have had its progressive improvements and revolutions deduced through a regular history, by any English writer.
ko3c | Indeed, though time has spared us a few ancient histories of empires, republics, and individuals, yet no models of a History, either of Music, or of any other art or science, are come down to us, out of the many that antiquity produced. Plutarch's Dialogue on Music approaches the nearest to history ; but, though it abounds with particulars relative to the subject, it is so short and defective, that it rather excites than gratifies curiosity.
xek3 | Some of the writings of Aristotle and Aristoxenus that are lost, though they were not express histories of music, would, nevertheless, had they been preserved, have satisfied our doubts concerning several parts of ancient music, which are now left to conjecture.
bbpr | A GENERAL HISTORY OF MUSIC
5zyf | " Aristotle, the disciple of Plato," says Plutarch, " regarded melody as something noble, great, and divine." Now, as this passage is not to be found in the remaining works of Aristotle, it is imagined that Plutarch took it either from his Treatise on Music (a), or the second book of his Poetics, where he treated of the Flute and Cithara, both which works are lost. And yet Kircher, [1602-80] in his Musurgia (b),* speaking of the ancient writers on Music, whose works he had consulted among the manuscripts in the Jesuit's College Library at Rome, names Aristotle ;** but I sought in vain for the Treatise which he had written expressly on Music, nor could I find there any work by that philosopher relative to the subject, except his Acoustics (c).
9own | Almost all the ancient philosophers, especially the Pythagoreans, Platonists, and Peripatetics, wrote treatises on Music, which are now lost. Meursius, in his notes on Aristoxenus, enumerates, among others, the following ancient writers on music, of whom we have nothing left but the name: Agenor, of Mytilene, mentioned by Aristoxenus (d), from whom sprung a sect of musicians called Agenorians ; as from Eratocles, the Eratocleans ; from Epigonus, the Epigonians, and from Damon, who taught Socrates music, the Damonians (e).
bqfb | But of all the ancient musical writers, the name of no one is come down to us, of whose works I was in greater want than those of the younger Dionysius Halicarnassensis, who flourished, according to Suidas, under the emperor Adrian, and who wrote twenty-six books of the History of Musicians, in which he celebrated not only the great performers on the Flute and Cithara, but those who had risen to eminence by every species of poetry. He was, likewise, author of five books, written in defence of Music, and chiefly in refutation of what is alledged against it in Plato's Republic. Aristides Quintilianus (f) has, also, endeavoured to soften the severity of some animadversions against Music in the writings of Cicero (g) ; but though time has spared the defence of this author, yet it does not indemnify us for the loss of that which Dionysius junior left behind him ; as testimonies are still remaining of his having been a much more able writer than Arist. Quintilianus (h).
wwdt | But though all the musical histories of the ancients are lost, yet almost every country in Europe that has cultivated the polite arts, has, since the revival of learning, produced a history of Music, except our own. Italy can boast of two works under that title ;
