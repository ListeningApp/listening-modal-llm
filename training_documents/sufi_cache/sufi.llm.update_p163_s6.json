        "content": "u91m | These are among the reasons for a special and specialized school to preside over exposure to the Sufi materials.\nhx7e | Sufi materials, of necessity, are designed to be perceptible in real meaning to those who are at a stage or in a condition to profit from them. If people are not, they accept shallow, emotional, or misguided meanings from Sufic materials.\nv085 | This tendency is paralleled in the behavior of animals and people at different stages of understanding and states of mind. You can find such examples, showing the failure to use one's mind correctly, every day in equivalent situations in ordinary life. Many Sufi jokes reproduce such situations, but the newspapers are also full of them. Consider the following:\nt1w7 | THE PROTECTED MONUMENT\n468t | Councillors at Ryde, Isle of Wight, burst into laughter last night on hearing from Whitehall that Seaview Pier was officially listed as a building of historic or architectural interest. The pier was demolished in nineteen fifty-two.\nvuoh | Lack of accurate information and the underlying failure to seek it, coupled with the assumption that things were in the condition imagined by whoever drafted that scheduling order provided the protection of the non-existent pier. The same kind of thinking is involved when many people deal with ideas, literature, and personalities rather than buildings. The same kind of mental equipment approaches a different proposition in the same kind of way.\nvj46 | You do not even have to be a human being to assume things about something resulting in harm and uselessness to yourself. Look at this:\nafee | THE MONKEY AND THE HEAD\nc6gi | A man had to be given hospital treatment for a sprained neck in Kuala Lampur, Malaysia, when a monkey trained to pluck coconuts from high trees jumped onto his shoulders and began twisting his head.\nl507 | That monkey, no doubt, if trained, would have scheduled a non-existing building as of interest.\nw0ph | Communication has to take into account the person to whom something is to be communicated. Consider this and compare it with someone buying a book and reading it according to his own conceptions of what it is trying to convey:\nb724 | DOG AND DINNER\nzbpu | A Swiss couple told the newspaper Blick that they had taken their pet poodle into a Hong Kong restaurant and signaled to the waiter that they wanted it fed, making eating signs. The poodle was taken away. When the waiter came back with a dish under a\n9016 | silver lid, they found their dog roasted inside, garnished with pepper sauce and bamboo shoots.\n44qf | The couple were reported to be traumatized and to be suffering from emotional shock. Many Sufi teachers, such as Rumi, reflecting in his Fihi Ma Fihi and the Masnavi on how people behave with spiritual materials, have almost an equal air of traumatization.\npdpr | Impartiality as a Point of View\nv875 | Q: How do we reach impartiality?\nt22f | A: Most people's impartiality is not such at all, but a cover for a partial point of view.\n2otd | If you have a bias towards impartiality, your goal must be the control of bias, not the struggle towards impartiality - because you will never reach impartiality through bias.\n0mma | People who believe that they are impartial, however, seldom are.\nwv0u | To find impartial people is usually easy only for those who do not need them.\n36s3 | As the Anwar-i-Suhaili says:\n1pjl | If practice were verification, we would be able to discern liars by their faces.\nh97d | As an example of impartiality, remember the action of Bishr al-Hafi, quoted by Ghazzali, in his Book of Knowledge, who buried a large number of books, saying:\n50rd | I feel the urge to recount Traditions. But I will not do this until the desire abates.\ne8sa | Lack of experience and information causes lack of impartiality; but this does not stop people from believing that they are in fact objective. They believe this because they have a strong desire to be or to appear to be impartial. Hence Bishr's pointing to the disabling role of the emotion of desire.\njbo4 | We can illustrate what people do when they have too little information and too much desire in a safely objective case of an anthropological observation from New Guinea:\n0nsm | BUYING THE PRESIDENT\nlks2 | In April nineteen sixty-six some islanders refused to pay taxes because they were saving up to buy the President of the United States. They had already refused to vote as the President's name was not on the ballot paper.\nzfwf | To reach an impartial viewpoint, you have to be able to look at situations beyond their immediate message, so that you can eventually see things in the round.\nq3ze | If I were asked to illustrate this by a Western parallel, I would choose this tale:\no5tm | TWO MEN IN A MADHOUSE\nmpez | A guide in a certain madhouse was describing two cases to some visiting psychiatrists. In this padded cell, he said, we have a man who went mad when another man married the girl whom he was in love with.\n2ve6 | And in the next cell? asked a visitor.\nn98m | In that one we have the man who actually did marry the girl.\ny53g | Characteristics and Purposes of a Sufi Group\nu23b | Q: May we have some characteristics and purposes of a living Sufi group?\nnxwd | A:\nd74j | Appearance: May take any form consistent with the culture in which it is operating, the commanding principle being that certain people have to be related in some kind of a viable entity.\nzqe7 | Objective: To form and maintain, under appropriate guidance, the special conditions in which the Teaching can operate.\nqdm8 | Intention: To enable as many people as possible, in due order, to achieve the understanding which will facilitate the higher as well as the lower effects of the Teaching to give the maximum developmental help.\nauxu | Programme: To keep the group operating as a channel for the successively refined impulses from the Source, and to attune the members to be able to perceive these impulses.\ng70e | Characteristics: Enough serious-minded but not indoctrinated people; attitudes suitable for the transmission to act upon; an orientation suitable to accept and work with the materials provided or indicated by the Representative for the time being of the Teaching.\npzvj | Modus Operandi: Meetings, reading, audition, performances, practices, theoretical and practical study, organization of environment.\nii74 | Deterioration: Evidenced by the acceptance of simplifications, contraction of activity, messianic and panacea thinking, hierarchical behavior patterns believed to be sacrosanct, literal acceptance of the figurative and vice-versa, hagiography, providing social and psychological stimuli and or reassurances, offering scope for personality-projection, assuaging desires for attention, substituting itself for diversions of a political, organizational, religious, psycho-\nn74j | One hundred seventy-five\n0lss | Contrast this with the kind of group, that of the man of learning surrounded by others, of whom Al-Thauri says Be assured that he is an impostor and a fraud: because if he were to tell them the truth, they would hate him.\n0piz | Prerequisites for a Student of Sufism",
