You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

z8tt | Local Survey Data and the Determinants of Land Prices
9g22 | Thus far, the analysis has focused exclu- sively upon the larger CRG records, and we now turn to the more detailed data-set de- rived from the questionnaire survey. How- ever, because of the limited sample size, these data are usually analysed for the whole
41fx | sample, occasionally broken down either by colonia or into two groups-the 'Control Group', most of whom live in Las Lomas, and the 'Study Group' which comprise the other colonias and some (23 cases) from the unplatted area of Las Lomas (Santa Cruz 1 and NW Industrial Park).
7um8 | We will not repeat the findings from the household survey; suffice to say that the household data show an almost identical cyclical pattern in real (1983) prices (see Figure 3, pecked line) to that described above for the larger CRG database with a similar sharp peak in 1994/95. (The full line indicates nominal or unadjusted prices.) Overall, taking the real price of lots and land units from the late 1970s through to late 1990s, prices remained fairly 'flat' over time. Statistically, no correlation was found be- tween rising prices and the progression of years through the 1980s and 1990s, either for all cases combined, or differentiated between the 'Control' and the CRG-intervened 'Study' Groups. However, Control Group lots do appear to be slightly lower in price
uow2 | than those of the Study settlements and this is consistent with the generally lower price of land in Las Lomas (where most Control Group households lived) and the earlier pe- riod of that cluster of colonias' development (see also Table 3). Differentiating between the two groups continued to show a lack of any clear relationship between price and yearly progression and, although the corre- lation coefficient is positive (0.114), it is not statistically significant. Moreover, disaggre- gating the data by cohort or period of pur- chase does not seem to make any difference either: there is a low negative correlation for the 1989-94 period, and only if one takes the 1979-94 period does one observe a positive correlation of + 0.157 (significant at the 5 per cent level).
iat7 | Tracking prices since CRG intervention (1995 onwards). In summary, the survey data reveal some small hint of a real price in- crease over time, but only for the overall period 1979-94 and not for the rush of lot sales during 1989-94. Between 1995 and 2001, there is a negative correlation between prices-when they actually decline quite sharply (see Figure 3)-as we saw earlier. However, the number of cases is rather
ywwr | small: examining the price paid for land in the last few years (1995-2001) embracing the period of CRG intervention (1997-2002) we have a total of 35 cases, but with only 3-4 cases each year in the most recent pe- riod. Our conclusions are tentative, therefore. The results (not displayed here) show a sharp decline in 1997, picking up again from 2000 onwards, but not getting back to 1995 and 1996 levels. While it is possible that CRG intervention actually drove prices down- wards, it must be stated this is likely to have been in combination with a number of fac- tors, some of which were alluded to earlier (i.e. less well articulated price-setting, the reduction of scarcity by title clearance and the opening up of a supply of lots that were somehow previously impeded from being sold), but it is not possible to be conclusive.9 Further research is required to track prices for a much larger number of cases since 1997 and to analyse in detail whether the resulting changes are related to CRG intervention and titling. Prima facie it appears that the prom- ise, or the likelihood of title transfers being provided by the CRG, has not had an inflationary impact upon land values: indeed, the trend is in the opposite direction. But in order to be sure, it is necessary to analyse
0i6j | more cases exclusively for the post-interven- tion period since 1997 and to conduct further follow-up studies for the period 2001-05. Put simply, although it is probably too soon to ascertain definitively whether title provision has had a significant direct impact upon land prices, our initial assessment is that it has not had a significant effect.
87cq | The costs and affordability of land acqui- sition in Rio Grande City. Earlier in this article, we observed that Starr County is among the poorest in Texas and we were interested to know how far the land market was constructed in such a way as to ensure that even here land for self-help housing remained affordable. Lot prices and square foot prices are shown in Table 3. The overall trimmed mean (1983) price is $2552 (me- dian = $2122), equaling 45¢ and 42¢ per square foot respectively.10 (In order to ex- press in 2002 values, multiply by 1.735-see Table 3). These costs of land are broadly comparable in unit price terms with other Texas colonias studied using an almost identical methodology (Ward et al., 2000, p. 109). Where those other study colonias showed significantly lower unit prices, it was usually due to their much larger average lot sizes (reducing the overall bid prices). For example, Pueblo Nuevo colonia in Webb County (outside Laredo) had a trimmed mean price of 13¢ per square foot (excep- tionally low), but these were for average lots of almost 1 acre in size; while Sparks colonia in El Paso County had a median cost of 35¢ per sq ft on lots that averaged twice the size of those in Starr County (around 11 000 sq ft compared with 5000 sq ft). Cameron Park in Cameron County-a better point of compari- son, given its Lower Rio Grande Valley loca- tion and similar land properties-had a median of 39¢ per sq ft, with average lot sizes of 7000 sq ft. Thus, we are confident in concluding that Starr County unit land prices are broadly similar to equivalent colonia lots found elsewhere in the border area.
0qs3 | The data show that overall lot prices in Starr County are 'cheaper' (or more afford- able) than those of most other counties and
