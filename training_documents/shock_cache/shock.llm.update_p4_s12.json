        "content": "rut3 | Norepinephrine, epinephrine, phenylephrine, and dopamine are potent vasopressors and have comparable effects in increasing MAP. However, phenylephrine's exclusive alpha AR agonist activity renders it unable to improve cardiac output and therefore should be avoided as a first-line agent for hemodynamic support in CS. Unlike phenylephrine, norepinephrine, epinephrine, dobutamine, and dopamine (to a lesser extent) all augment cardiac output through stimulation of the myocyte beta one AR. However, in contrast with dobutamine, dopamine, and epinephrine, norepinephrine has the capacity to improve cardiac output, without significantly increasing heart rate, and therefore may limit increases in myocardial oxygen consumption and potentially attenuate vasoactive medication related myocardial ischemia and injury.\nm3cp | Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors\nmq4s | PDE three is an abundant enzyme in many tissues, including in cardiac myocytes and vascular smooth muscle. PDE three's biological actions include the hydrolysis of CAMP. Therefore, inhibition of PDE three through agents such as milrinone leads to increased cytosolic CAMP levels. Within cardiac tissue, elevated CAMP levels lead to increased inotropy, while vasodilation occurs within blood vessels. These effects serve to augment cardiac output, reduce afterload, and reduce systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance. The administration of milrinone, however, should be performed with caution in patients with severe renal impairment, as it is subject to renal elimination and runs the risk of toxic accumulation in this setting.\n95el | Calcium Sensitizers\na0a5 | Calcium sensitizers are a relatively recently developed novel class of inodilators. Levosimendan, a routinely used calcium sensitizer (not routinely available in the United States), has both peripheral vasodilatory effects and enhances myocardial contractility, mediated through vascular smooth muscle potassium channel binding and cardiac myofilament calcium sensitization by calcium-dependent troponin C binding, respectively. Levosimendan has similar hemodynamic effects to that of the PDE three inhibitor milrinone and interestingly has been shown to have significant PDE three inhibiting actions as well. Furthermore, levosimendan has an active metabolite with a half-life of greater than eighty hours, allowing the hemodynamic effects to persist following completion of the initial infusion.\ngocl | Arginine Vasopressin Antagonists\nob1z | Arginine vasopressin (vasopressin), an endogenous nonapeptide hormone, exerts its cardiovascular effects through the activation of G-protein coupled receptors V1a (in smooth muscle) and V2 (in the renal collecting tubules). Activation of the V1a receptor on vascular smooth muscle causes increased cytosolic calcium and resulting vasoconstriction, and the V2 receptor activation leads to water retention via the distal convoluted tubule.\nm4cb | The use of vasopressin in the management of CS is principally mediated through a dose-dependent increase in systemic vascular resistance. It has a limited impact on other hemodynamic parameters including cardiac output and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. Vasopressin may also have pleotropic effects that can ameliorate the underlying causes of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome mediated vasoplegia by\nm61y | Vasoactive Medications in Cardiogenic Shock\nu2ob | reducing nitric oxide production and attenuate catecholamine resistance due to adrenergic receptor downregulation. Furthermore, there are emerging data indicating that vasopressin, compared with catecholamines, may result in selective vasoconstriction in the systemic circulation and cause pulmonary arterial vasodilation, thereby reducing right ventricular afterload.\n2gnm | Guanylate Cyclase and Nitric Oxide Synthase Inhibitors\nemgw | Methylene blue is a repurposed agent, previously used in the treatment of methemoglobinemia, but has recently generated interest for use in refractory vasoplegic shock. In the setting of CS-related systemic inflammatory response syndrome, methylene blue's therapeutic effects are exerted through the inhibition of nitric oxide mediated cGMP production, resulting in increased smooth muscle vasoconstriction. Methylene blue should be used with caution in patients treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors as it may precipitate a serotonin syndrome and also in patients with known glucose-six-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency due to the risk of developing hemolytic anemia.\nxaqt | EVIDENCE FOR USE OF VASOACTIVE AGENTS IN CARDIOGENIC SHOCK\n5rcb | Current Societal Recommendations for Commencing Vasoactive Medications\n524j | Conducting randomized controlled trials in a population with CS has historically been challenging. Current societal recommendations have therefore been\nxd3m | Mediated through the stimulatory Gs component of the beta one adrenergic receptor, activation of the adenyl cyclase pathway occurs with a resulting increase in cAMP (cyclic adenosine monophosphate) and subsequent increased intracellular calcium cycling. The altered calcium handling results in a positive chronotropic response, increased myocardial contractility, and lusitropy. PLB indicates phospholamban; RyR, ryanodine receptor; SERCA, sarco/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase; and SR, sarcoplasmic reticulum.\n8qb6 | developed using data from small trials of variable quality, meta-analyses, and consensus opinion, resulting in equipoise with respect to the recommended first-line vasoactive agents to be used in the treatment of CS. A summary of the available randomized trial data pertaining to the use of vasoactive medications are presented in Table three. Despite limited high-quality data, French, German, Austrian, and the European Society Cardiology guidelines addressing CS management endorse the use of norepinephrine or dobutamine as the first-line vasoactive medications in CS. In the United States, current guidelines remain less definitive. The American Heart Association's\nwkbn | Vasoactive Medications in Cardiogenic Shock\nftfg | Heart Failure guidelines do not provide clear recommended first-line vasoactive medication, suggesting clinicians use agents that are readily available, easy to administer, and they are familiar. Furthermore, the American Heart Association's Scientific Statements on the contemporary management of CS recommends the use of dopamine or norepinephrine as first-line treatments, whereas the recently published guideline for the invasive management of AMI-CS suggests norepinephrine be used to support blood pressure in the initial stabilization period, unless further chronotropic support is required. These recommendations are summarized in Figure three.\n7xi5 | Stimulation of the alpha one adrenergic or vasopressin one receptors causes activation of the Gq (G-protein) subunit, resulting in downstream stimulation of the phospholipase C signaling pathway. Phospholipase C in turn activates inositol one, four, five-triphosphate leading to calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, resulting in vasoconstriction. Conversely, beta two-receptor stimulation activates the inhibitory G-protein (Gi) subunit causing vasodilation through increased cAMP (cyclic adenosine monophosphate) activation and resulting phospholamban-mediated calcium uptake into the SR. Similarly, activation of the ATP-sensitive potassium channel causes potassium influx that hyperpolarizes voltage-dependent calcium channels, reducing intracellular calcium and vasomotor tone. AMP indicates adenosine monophosphate; DAG, diacylglycerol; PDE three, phosphodiesterase three; and PLB, phospholamban.\nw8r5 | Treatment of Cardiogenic Shock With Associated Hypotension",
