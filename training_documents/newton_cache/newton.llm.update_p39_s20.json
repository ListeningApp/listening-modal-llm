Together, these results show that X subscript k in B of X subscript star comma Delta subscript c L S implies X subscript k plus one comma X subscript k plus two in X subscript star. This means that the iterates of our algorithm essentially \"look\" like unconstrained minimization in this subspace. Unfortunately, with the results we have so far, we cannot guarantee that the iterates continue to stay close enough to the minima beyond iteration k plus two. Lemma E point four will overcome this problem by using the second-order sufficient condition and adapting an unconstrained optimization result. The main idea is that the \"strict convexity\" on X subscript star induced by Assumption three point twelve implies that there exists a small \"basin\" restricted to X subscript star that the iterates will not leave once they enter. We can then use Lemma E point three to show that our iterates eventually enter X, and the corresponding basin.\nvlyz | Inexact Newton-type Methods for Optimization with Nonnegativity Constraints\n5034 | Lemma E point four. Let f satisfy Assumption three point one and X subscript star be a local minima satisfying Assumptions three point eleven and three point twelve. Let delta be chosen according to forty-four. If there is an iterate, X subscript k, of Algorithm four such that Script A of X subscript k comma delta equals Script A of X subscript k comma zero equals Script A of X subscript star comma zero and Script A of X subscript k plus one comma zero equals Script A of X subscript star comma zero i.e. X subscript k, X subscript k plus one in X subscript star then there exists a neighborhood restricted to X x of X subscript star comma Script N of X subscript star comma, such that if Xk in Script N of X subscript star and then X subscript k plus one in Script N of X subscript star. Additionally, Script N of X subscript star is independent of the iterates and can be chosen arbitrarily small, i.e., for any Delta greater than zero we have\n9lvu | Script N of X subscript star is a subset of B of X subscript star comma Delta.

We will show that this set is the desired neighborhood on X subscript star in the sense there exists an open ball in the relative interior of X subscript star.
