The E-L system plays a prominent role in cell-to-cell transmission of preformed alpha-synuclein filaments, leading to the spread of phospho-alpha-synuclein pathology. Internalization of fibrillar alpha-synuclein occurs via endocytosis (as well as tunnelling nanotubules) and follows the neuronal endosomal pathway to lysosomal degradation. Heparan sulfate proteoglycans, lymphocyte-activation gene three, alpha three isoform of sodium/potassium adenosine triphosphatase, and a few endocytic vesicle receptors are predicted to act as receptors for alpha-synuclein preformed fibrils. In vitro studies suggest that internalized alpha-synuclein fibrils are localized in both early endosomes and late endolysosomes. The lipid bilayer of endosomes restricts cytoplasmic spillage, so most endocytosed alpha-synuclein is degraded by lysosomes. How a fraction of alpha-synuclein preformed fibrils escapes this barrier and goes on to initiate seeding is still unclear. Studies of alpha-synuclein axonal transport predict that retrograde transport of alpha-synuclein preformed fibrils is mediated by endocytic vesicles and is twice as fast and more efficient than anterograde transport. This strengthens the notion that Parkinson's Disease pathology spreads retrogradely from the synaptic terminal to soma. The E-L system is also involved in exocytosis of fibrilized alpha-synuclein, facilitating its prion-like spread. An endoplasmic reticulum-bound enzyme with chaperone activity USP19 (Ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase nineteen) has been shown to deliver misfolded alpha-synuclein to late endosomes, which then fuses with the plasma membrane through a unique process called misfolding-associated protein secretion. Another recent study suggests that the DNAJ/Hsc seventy complex could facilitate alpha-synuclein exocytosis. Overexpression of ATP thirteen A two and glucocerebrosidase beta acid are also noted to increase exocytosis of alpha-synuclein. Together, these observations identify the E-L system as the primary conduit for the spread of alpha-synuclein-mediated pathology in Parkinson's Disease.\n9bz4 | Leucine-Rich Repeat Kinase two is a multidomain large protein with both GTPase and kinase activity along with other domains for protein-protein interaction. Epidemiological, histopathological, and clinical investigations have all established LRRK2 gene mutations as the most common genetic cause of Parkinson's Disease, with a considerable contribution to sporadic cases. Over eight identified LRRK2 mutations cause Parkinson's Disease. The mutation at\nyfv2 | G2019S is the most common and is known to increase LRRK2's activity. LRRK2 functions have been explored through Parkinson's Disease-related studies, in which increased G2019S kinase activity reveals its close association with the E-L system. LRRK2's role in vesicular trafficking, lysosomal homeostasis, and autophagy are well accepted. Phosphorylation by LRRK2 is essential for a subset of RAB GTPases' function of endolysosomal vesicular sorting and trafficking. In an overexpression system, RAB7L1 was noted to interact strongly with LRRK2 at the switch-two site, unlike seen in in vitro kinase assays. Several LRRK2 mutations significantly affect RAB pathways, where variations in Rab7L1's interactions with LRRK2 have been identified to increase the risk of sporadic Parkinson's Disease. In fact, recent genome-wide association studies identify RAB29 encoding RAB7L1 as an independent risk gene for Parkinson's Disease. Rab7L1 upregulation could attenuate LRRK2-induced toxicity in dopaminergic neurons. This is predicted to be functioning through VPS35 and VPS26. VPS35 also cooperates with LRRK2 to regulate synaptic vesicle recycling and dopaminergic synaptic release, thus suggesting a prominent role for the retromer complex in LRRK2-mediated Parkinson's Disease pathogenesis.\npujl | LRRK2 regulates lysosomal protein trafficking and morphology. In LRRK2 mutants, perinuclear lysosomal clustering was noted, mediated by increased phosphorylation of RAB7. Two-pore channels are the calcium channels present on acidic vesicles of the E-L system and help in regulating their trafficking and fusion of lysosomes with autophagosomes/endosomes. Abnormal lysosomal morphology and density seen in fibroblasts from patients with LRRK2 mutations could be reversed by inhibiting these two-pore channels. Thus, these channels might be one potential mediator of E-L system dysfunction in LRRK2-associated Parkinson's Disease. Lysosome-related proteins involved in Parkinson's Disease such as Gcase1, Lamp2A and ATP thirteen A two are also downregulated in Parkinson's Disease patients with LRRK2 mutations, suggesting lysosomes are one of LRRK2's prime targets.\n```",
