You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

ba4l | 20.4.1 - Filtering and Forecasting for Markov Chains
ffx8 | Definition 20.1. A discrete-time stochastic process X(0 : N) has the Markov property if its pdfs satisfy
s6su | fx(n:N)|x(0:n-1)(x(n: N)) = fx(n:N)|x(n-1)(x(n:N)), n=1, ... ,N, (20.13) for all x(n : N). A discrete-time stochastic process that has the Markov property is called a Markov chain.
y219 | Intuitively, the Markov property says that, to predict future observations X(n : N) of the stochastic process, it is sufficient to know the immediate past X(n-1). Additional knowledge of the more distant past X(0 : n-2) does not change the predictions of the future. An induction argument shows that the joint distribution of X(0 : n) can then be written as a product of conditional distributions,
06ht | fx(0:n)(x(0: n) = fx(0)(x(0))] [fx()|x(j-1)(x(j)), n=1,2, .... j=1 n (20.14)
v3r2 | The functions fx(i)\x(j-1)(x(j)) are called transition probabilities of the Markov chain. We shall also assume throughout that
nv42 | fx(1:n)x(:)(y(1 : n)=[fx()\x(j)(y(j), n = 1,2, ... j=1 n (20.15)
xags | This identity implies that, given the sequence of process variables X(0 : n), the observa- tions Y(1 : n) are independent of one another and their distributions do not depend on X(0). In particular, it follows that given x(i), the observation Y(i) is independent of all other observations Y(j) (j /i).
jc47 | We can now formulate a basic algorithm for filtering and forecasting of Markov chains.
ko3c | Algorithm 20.1 (Filtering and prediction). Given
xek3 | (i) a prior distribution fx(0)
bbpr | (ii) transition probabilities fx(i)x(i-1) (i =1, ... ,N) for the process variables, and
5zyf | (iii) conditional distributions fy(i)|x(i) (i=1, ... ,N) for the observations, the following algorithm gives the filtering distributions fx(i)y(1:i) and forecasting distributions fx(1)y(1:1-1):
9own | Step 1. Set
bqfb | C fx(1)y(1)(x(1)) x fx(1)|x(1)(y(1))fx(1)(x(1)),
wwdt | fx(1)(x(1)= fx(1)x()(x(1)fx()(x(0)dx(0),
mn1r | where the proportionality constant is chosen such that a pdf with respect to x(1) is generated.

s2g2 | <LATEX>f _ { \mathrm { X } \left( i \right) | \mathrm { y } \left( 1 : i - 1 \right) } \left( \mathrm { x } \left( i \right) \right) = \int f _ { \mathrm { X } \left( i \right) | \mathrm { x } \left( i - 1 \right) } \left( \mathrm { x } \left( i \right) \right) f _ { \mathrm { X } \left( i - 1 \right) | \mathrm { y } \left( 1 : i - 1 \right) } \left( \mathrm { x } \left( i - 1 \right) \right) d \mathrm { x } \left( i - 1 \right) ,</LATEX> <LATEX>f _ { \mathrm { X } \left( i \right) | \mathrm { y } \left( 1 : i \right) } \left( \mathrm { x } \left( i \right) \right) \propto f _ { \mathrm { Y } \left( i \right) | \mathrm { x } \left( i \right) } \left( \mathrm { y } \left( i \right) \right) f _ { \mathrm { X } \left( i \right) | \mathrm { y } \left( 1 : i - 1 \right) } \left( \mathrm { x } \left( i \right) \right) ,</LATEX> where the proportionality constant is chosen such that a pdf with respect to <LATEX>\mathrm { x } \left( i \right)</LATEX> is generated.
q1q2 | The correctness of this algorithm can be proved with induction. Step 1 is just the law of total probability (to obtain <LATEX>f _ { \mathrm { X } \left( 1 \right) }</LATEX> and Bayes' rule (to obtain <LATEX>\left. f _ { \mathrm { X } \left( 1 \right) | \mathrm { y } \left( 1 \right) } \right) .</LATEX> For the induction step, the formula for the forecasting distribution is again just the law of total probability, and the filtering distribution can be obtained from
cb7r | <LATEX>f _ { \mathrm { X } \left( i \right) | \mathrm { y } \left( 1 : i \right) } \left( \mathrm { x } \left( i \right) \right) = f _ { \mathrm { X } \left( i \right) | \mathrm { y } \left( i \right) , \mathrm { y } \left( 1 : i - 1 \right) } \left( \mathrm { x } \left( i \right) \right)</LATEX> <LATEX>\propto f _ { \mathrm { Y } \left( i \right) | \mathrm { x } \left( i \right) , \mathrm { y } \left( 1 : i - 1 \right) } \left( \mathrm { y } \left( i \right) \right) f _ { \mathrm { X } \left( i \right) | \mathrm { y } \left( 1 : i - 1 \right) } \left( \mathrm { x } \left( i \right) \right)</LATEX> <LATEX>= f _ { \mathrm { Y } \left( i \right) | \mathrm { x } \left( i \right) } \left( \mathrm { y } \left( i \right) \right) f _ { \mathrm { X } \left( i \right) | \mathrm { y } \left( 1 : i - 1 \right) } \left( \mathrm { x } \left( i \right) \right) .</LATEX> The last equation follows because the observations <LATEX>\mathrm { Y } \left( i \right)</LATEX> were assumed to be independent of the other observations conditioned on the <LATEX>\mathrm { x } \left( i \right)</LATEX> in Eq. (20.15).
68xu | Once the filtering distributions are known, the reanalysis distributions <LATEX>f _ { \mathrm { X } \left( i \right) | \mathrm { y } \left( 1 : N \right) } \left( \mathrm { x } \left( i \right) \right)</LATEX> can be obtained recursively for

epu7 | (ii) filtering distributions
7od1 | <LATEX>f _ { \mathrm { X } \left( i \right) | \mathrm { y } \left( 1 : i \right) } \left( i = 1 , \ldots , N \right) ,</LATEX> the following algorithm gives the reanalysis distributions

b780 | Step 2. Suppose <LATEX>i \in \left\{ 1 , 2 , \ldots , N - 1 \right\}</LATEX> and the reanalysis pdf <LATEX>f _ { \mathrm { X } \left( i + 1 \right) | \mathrm { y } \left( 1 : N \right) }</LATEX> is given. Set
ccmb | <LATEX>f _ { \mathrm { X } \left( i \right) | \mathrm { x } \left( i + 1 \right) , \mathrm { y } \left( 1 : i \right) } \left( \mathrm { x } \left( i \right) \right) \propto f _ { \mathrm { X } \left( i + 1 \right) | \mathrm { x } \left( i \right) } \left( \mathrm { x } \left( i + 1 \right) \right) f _ { \mathrm { X } \left( i \right) | \mathrm { y } \left( 1 : i \right) } \left( \mathrm { x } \left( i \right) \right) ,</LATEX> <LATEX>f _ { \mathrm { X } \left( i \right) | \mathrm { y } \left( 1 : N \right) } \left( \mathrm { x } \left( i \right) \right) = \int f _ { \mathrm { X } \left( i \right) | \mathrm { x } \left( i + 1 \right) , \mathrm { y } \left( 1 : i \right) } \left( \mathrm { x } \left( i \right) \right) f _ { \mathrm { X } \left( i + 1 \right) | \mathrm { y } \left( 1 : N \right) } \left( \mathrm { x } \left( i + 1 \right) \right) d \mathrm { x } \left( i + 1 \right) ,</LATEX> where the proportionality constant is chosen such that a pdf with respect to <LATEX>\mathrm { x } \left( i \right)</LATEX> is generated.
ma93 | The correctness of this algorithm is proved with backwards induction.
c6hh | Algorithms 20.1 and 20.2 provide a general framework for reanalysis, filtering, and forecasting. However, they are usually impossible to implement, due to multiple difficul- ties. For general process models, it is often not possible to obtain all the required transi- tion probabilities, even in very simple cases. In the case of a process described by differen- tial equations, a closed form solution would be required, followed by a complicated change of variables. Even if the transition probabilities were known, each step would require the computation of many integrals, one given explicitly in the algorithm and another to de- termine the proportionality constants. These integrations are usually impossible to do in closed form, and in the case of five or more state space dimensions they are also difficult to do numerically.
