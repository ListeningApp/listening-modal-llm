Will you do this? Will you here rise to your feet and testify that you will make God your trust and your helper? Congregation rises.\na278 | Praying I thank thee, Lord God of Israel. Accept this pledge of this Thy people. Put Thy Spirit upon them. Let Thy glory be seen in them. As they shall speak the word of truth, let us see the salvation of God.
