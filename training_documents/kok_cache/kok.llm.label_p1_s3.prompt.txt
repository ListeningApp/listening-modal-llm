You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

Arguably, this switch arises from light inhibition of respiration, allowing the Kok method to estimate day respiration <LATEX>\left( R _ { d } \right) .</LATEX> Recent analysis sug- gests that increasing proportions of photorespiration (quantified as <LATEX>\Gamma ^ { * } / \mathrm { C } _ { \mathrm { c } } ,</LATEX> the ratio of <LATEX>C O _ { 2 }</LATEX> compensation point <LATEX>\Gamma ^ { * }</LATEX> to chloroplast <LATEX>C O _ { 2 }</LATEX> concentration, <LATEX>C _ { c }</LATEX> with irradiance explain much of the Kok effect. Also, the Kok method has been modified to account for the decrease in PSII photochemical efficiency (@2) with irradiance.

82qc | The Kok effect refers to the abrupt change in the slope of the lin- ear relationship between net photosynthetic rate and irradiance that occurs at very low irradiances, as observed initially in unicellu- lar algae (Kok, 1948, 1949; Healey & Myers, 1971). The switch is reported later in leaves of many higher plant species (e.g. Ishii & Schmid, 1981; Sharp et al., 1984; Villar et al., 1994; Buckley et al., 2017). The slope decreases from the initial higher value to a lower value, mostly at an irradiance value around the light com- pensation point. This switch has been interpreted as a consequence of light inhibition of respiration, allowing the so-called Kok method to estimate respiration in the light, or day respiration <LATEX>\left( R _ { \mathrm { d } } \right) ,</LATEX> and quantum yield of CO2 assimilation <LATEX>\left( \Phi _ { \mathrm { C O 2 } } \right)</LATEX> (see Supporting Information Table S1 for all symbol definitions), using the part of the relationship with the lower slope. The absolute value of the estimated <LATEX>R _ { 4 }</LATEX> is lower than the respiration in the dark <LATEX>\left( R _ { \mathrm { d k } } \right)</LATEX> (Fig. 1). The cost of total respiratory activities accounts for c. 40% of gross photosynthetic productivity of whole plants (Gifford, 1995; Amthor, 2010). Light inhibition of respiratory activities also occurs at a stand scale (Gong et al., 2017), suggesting that it is a general phenomenon, and thus would have a significant impact on projecting the net ecosystem carbon fluxes in biomes across the globe (Heskel et al., 2013). For this reason, understanding the Kok effect and its related light inhibition of respiration has contin- uously received attention (Tcherkez et al., 2017a,b).
ls7d | The lower estimates of <LATEX>R _ { \mathrm { d } }</LATEX> by the Kok method, relative to <LATEX>R _ { \mathrm { d k } }</LATEX> have been confirmed by other gas exchange-based methods such as the popular Laisk method (Laisk, 1977). By applying the Laisk
tzt3 | New Phytologist
t8vv | method to different light intensities, it has been shown that <LATEX>R _ { \mathrm { d } } \mathrm { w a s }</LATEX> progressively inhibited by increasing irradiance (Brooks & Far- quhar, 1985; Villar et al., 1995). However, this light inhibition has been challenged by the direct measurement of <LATEX>R _ { \mathrm { d } } ,</LATEX> which exploits the differences in the time course of labelling by carbon isotopes of photosynthetic, photorespiratory and respiratory pathways. For example, using such techniques, Pinelli & Loreto (2003) suggested a significant refixation of respired and photorespired <LATEX>C O _ { 2 }</LATEX> and Loreto et al. (2001) calculated that there would be no significant difference between <LATEX>R _ { \mathrm { d } }</LATEX> and <LATEX>R _ { \mathrm { d k } }</LATEX> if the refixation of <LATEX>C O _ { 2 }</LATEX> released from respiration during illumination were taken into account. Similarly, a recent report using a direct method based on isotopic disequilibrium (Gong et al., 2018) showed that <LATEX>R _ { \mathrm { d } }</LATEX> was underesti- mated by the Laisk method. Owing to inconsistent reports of this kind, whether the Kok effect was a result of light inhibition of leaf respiration has been under debate over years.
qvnu | In fact, according to an extended form of the widely used model of Farquhar et al. (1980) for describing the electron trans- port-limited photosynthesis, several other mechanisms could also explain the Kok effect. The extended model expresses the net CO2 assimilation rate <LATEX>\left( A \right)</LATEX> as a function <LATEX>o f \quad t h e</LATEX> photosynthetically absorbed irradiance <LATEX>\left( I _ { \mathrm { a b s } } \right)</LATEX> as (Yin et al., 2004, 2006):
kggw | <LATEX>A = \frac { 1 - \Gamma _ { * } / C _ { _ { \mathrm { c } } } } { 4 \left( 1 + 2 \Gamma _ { * } / C _ { _ { \mathrm { c } } } \right) } f _ { \mathrm { a c t } } \left( \Phi _ { 2 } \rho _ { _ { 2 } } I _ { \mathrm { a b s } } \right) - R _ { \mathrm { d } }</LATEX> Eqn 1

7toz | <LATEX>\Phi _ { 2 }</LATEX> is the photochemical efficiency of photosystem II (PSII) elec- tron transport, <LATEX>\rho _ { 2 }</LATEX> is the fraction of the absorbed photons parti- tioned to PSII, and <LATEX>f _ { \mathrm { a c t } }</LATEX> is the factor accounting for fractions of alternative electron transport. So, the term <LATEX>\left( \Phi _ { 2 } \rho _ { 2 } I _ { \mathrm { a b s } } \right)</LATEX> is the flux of PSII electron transport. Parameters <LATEX>f _ { \mathrm { a c t } }</LATEX> and <LATEX>o _ { 2 }</LATEX> fied by the extended model as (Yin et al., 2006):

x972 | where <LATEX>\Phi _ { 1 }</LATEX> is the photochemical efficiency of PSI electron trans- port, <LATEX>f _ { \mathrm { c y c } }</LATEX> is the fraction of the PSI electron flux that follows the cyclic electron transport around PSI, and <LATEX>f _ { \mathrm { p s e u d c } }</LATEX> is the fraction of the PSI electron flux that follows the pseudocyclic electron trans- port (defined as all noncyclic electron-consuming pathways other than the Calvin cycle or the photorespiratory cycle).
cwrw | Eqn (1) suggests that changes not only in <LATEX>R _ { \mathrm { d } }</LATEX> (Fig. 2a), but also in <LATEX>\Gamma ^ { * } / C _ { \mathrm { c } }</LATEX> <LATEX>\Phi _ { 2 } ,</LATEX> <LATEX>f _ { \mathrm { a c t } }</LATEX> and <LATEX>\rho _ { 2 } ,</LATEX> with increasing <LATEX>I _ { \mathrm { a b s } } ,</LATEX> result in changes in the slope of <LATEX>A</LATEX> vs <LATEX>I _ { a b s } .</LATEX> Notably, Farquhar & Busch (2017) recently demonstrated that as a result of regulation of stomatal conduc- tance <LATEX>\left( g _ { s } \right)</LATEX> and mesophyll conductance <LATEX>\left( g _ { m } \right) ,</LATEX> <LATEX>C _ { \mathrm { c } }</LATEX> decreased (thus <LATEX>\Gamma ^ { * } / C _ { c }</LATEX> increased) sharply with increasing <LATEX>I _ { \mathrm { a b s } }</LATEX> within the range of low irradiances, and that this phenomenon accounted for much of the observed Kok effect (Fig. 2b). A similar argument might be applied to <LATEX>\Phi _ { 2 }</LATEX> (Fig. 2c), as <LATEX>\Phi _ { 2 }</LATEX> is not constant but decreases with increasing <LATEX>I _ { \mathrm { a b s } }</LATEX> (Genty & Harbinson, 1996), even within the range of low irradiances within which the <LATEX>\mathrm { K o k }</LATEX> method is used to estimate <LATEX>R _ { 4 }</LATEX> and <LATEX>\Phi _ { \mathrm { C O 2 } }</LATEX> (Yin et <LATEX>a l . ,</LATEX> 2011a, 2014).

The analysis using the modified method, now known as the Yin method (Tcherkez et <LATEX>a l . ,</LATEX> 2017b), indicates that the inhibition of <LATEX>R _ { \mathrm { d } }</LATEX> by light is less than the original Kok method suggests (Yin et al., 2011a).
