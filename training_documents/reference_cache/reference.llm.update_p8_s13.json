No matter which delivery model is used or what type of information organization is involved, information professionals have demonstrated that they are prepared to integrate intermediation services and technology skills with other parts of their organizations to pivot and address the information needs of users in and outside of those organizations.\nrhaz | The array of job titles other than the term \"reference librarian\" reflect the wide range of jobs that entail helping users find and access information that they need. For example, job titles can range from emerging technology librarian to community librarian to student success librarian. These emerging roles also can address interdepartmental responsibilities that range from managing learning resources centers in schools and institutions of higher educa-\nwak1 | tion to using learning management systems that provide access to digital resources and reference services.\nwtfz | It is important to understand that meeting specific users' information needs can and should proactively entail reaching out to users with services as varied as roving reference help and embedded librarianship on one hand to providing just-in-time technology help in person or online on the other. This also necessitates being able to develop tools to provide on-demand information via subject guides, pathfinders, LibGuides, and more. Behind the scenes, those same information intermediaries continue to help with the development of discovery tools, outreach and marketing, the evaluation, acquisition, and assessment of information to satisfy information needs, and the management of service points.\nqy1i | Conclusion\n1k9e | In the twenty-first century, the definition of information intermediation focuses on helping users access and acquire the information they need. Reference librarians are key to achieving this goal and must be forward-thinking in serving the needs of their communities. This entails the efforts of information professionals who are open and adept at identifying what is changing and adapting accordingly. As information professionals, reference librarians understand that they can no longer wait passively for patrons to come to use the library's services in person or online. Instead, reference librarians are proactively and energetically promoting the library and the value and significance of the library's services and resources to the communities served. This vision of reference services that is evolving in the twenty-first century focuses on new relationships with communities, but at the core, all types of information intermediators will continue to provide reference services that support their communities and satisfy their users' information needs through good customer service, creativity, innovation, and outreach that remains technologically relevant in the twenty-first century.\n5bjs | Information Intermediation and Reference Services\nuodj | Information Intermediation and Reference Services",
