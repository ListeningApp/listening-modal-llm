You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

57lp | Authentic samples of the products obtained by the MMO-catalyzed oxidation of substrates 1 and 2 were prepared in the following manner. trans-(2-Phenylcyclopropyl)methanol (1a) and its dideuterated analogue were obtained from the synthesis of 1, and alcohol 2a was available in the preparation of 2, as indicated above. Monodeuterated la was pre- pared by LiAID4 reduction of trans-(2-phenylcyclopropyl)methanal which, in turn, was obtained from the acid by sequential treatment with H3BSMe2 and pyridinium chlorochromate.35 1-Phenylbut-3-en-1-ol (1b) and 1,1-diphenylbut-3-en-1-ol (2b) were prepared by reactions of allyl- magnesium chloride with benzaldehyde and benzophenone, respectively.
ukth | An authentic sample of trans-2-(p-hydroxyphenyl)methylcyclopropane (1c) was prepared by the following sequence. Reaction34 of p-vinylanisole with ethyl diazoacetate gave a mixture of ethyl cis- and trans-2-(p- methoxyphenyl)cyclopropanecarboxylates, which was separated by col- umn chromatography and crystallization. The trans isomer, identified

The resulting trans-2-(p-methoxyphenyl)methylcyclopropane was demethylated36 with NaSEt in DMF to give the desired product, which was purified by preparative GC on a Carbowax 20M column. Authentic samples of the possible aromatic hydroxylated products from 2 were not prepared; no components consistent with these products were observed by GC mass spectral analysis of the oxidation mixtures.

4exe | Enzymatic Reactions. Reactions with MMO from <LATEX>M .</LATEX> capsulatus (Bath) were carried out at 45 ℃ with the reconstituted enzyme system in the following manner. Solutions were prepared that contained 1.2 mg (10 uM) of hydroxylase, 0.2 mg (24 uM) of coupling protein, and 0.4 mg (20 uM) of reductase, all in 25 mM MOPS [MOPS = 3-(N- morpholino)propanesulfonic acid], pH 7.0, in a final volume of 0.5 mL. A 0.5-uL portion of substrate was then added by means of a microsyringe to achieve a maximum concentration of ~8 mM, most of the substrates not being completely soluble prior to conversion to products. The reaction mixture was placed in a 10-mL glass vial and sealed with a Suba-Seal septum. After addition of a 25-uL portion of a 0.1 M stock solution of ethanol-free NADH to initiate the hydroxylation reaction, the vial was placed in a shaker-incubator maintained at 45 °C. Control reactions were performed in an identical manner except that no NADH was added. Reactions were allowed to proceed for 15 min, a time sufficient to afford at least 30 mol of product/mol of enzyme in those cases where authentic standards were available.
0myz | Studies with the hydroxylase from M. trichosporium OB3b and sub- strate 1 were carried out at 30 ℃ in one of two ways. Coupling protein and reductase from <LATEX>M .</LATEX> capsulatus (Bath) were incubated with the hy- droxylase in the presence of NADH. The protein and NADH concen- trations were the same as described in the preceding paragraph. Alter- natively, reactions were performed by using 10 mM hydrogen peroxide and M. trichosporium OB3b hydroxylase only, a known shunt for this enzyme.16 Substrate was added to the reaction mixture, which was then incubated as described above. Again, at least 30 turnovers were com- pleted before the reaction was terminated.
xh3i | Instrumentation. Products from enzyme oxidations were analyzed with a Hewlett-Packard (HP) Model 5890 gas chromatograph either equipped with an FID detector or interfaced to an HP Model 5971A mass spec- <LATEX>t r o m e t e r \left( E I , 7 0 \quad e V \right) .</LATEX> For GC and GC/MS analysis, either a cross- a cross-linked methyl silicon (HP) capillary column was employed, depending on which column gave better resolution of the reaction components. The column dimensions were <LATEX>1 0 m \times 0 . 5 m m \times</LATEX> 1.0 um for GC analysis and <LATEX>2 5 m \times 0 . 2</LATEX> mm x 0.33 um for GC/MS analysis. Slightly different instrumental conditions were used to analyze the different reactions, as indicated in Table SI (supplementary material).
syiw | Product Identification and Quantitation. Products were isolated by thorough extraction of the reaction mixture with diethyl ether or ethyl acetate. The septum of the reaction vial was removed, 5 mL of extracting solvent was added, and the septum was immediately replaced. The mixture was incubated for at least 10 min, the organic layer was then removed, and the entire procedure was repeated twice. The organic layers were combined, dried over anhydrous K2CO3, and then concen- trated by slow evaporation under Ar to a volume of ~ 100 AL. After the addition of an appropriate internal standard (vide infra), a 0.2-0.5-AL sample of concentrated extract was injected into the gas chromatograph. The retention times and mass spectra of the products were compared to those of authentic standards.
kg3t | Components of the hydroxylation reaction mixture for 1-3 were quantitated by constructing standard curves in the following manner. Solutions containing known concentrations of a given component and a constant amount of an internal standard dissolved in ethyl acetate or diethyl ether were injected into the GC. The ratio of the peak area corresponding to the component with that of the standard was then plotted against the concentration of added component in the sample. A linear plot was obtained and subsequently used as a calibration curve to determine the concentration of the component in extracts obtained from reactions with the enzyme. Plots were constructed in this manner for alcohols la-3a, rearranged alcohols 1b-3b and 3c, 2-(p-hydroxy- phenyl) methylcyclopropane (1c), and substrates 1-3. Since no 1b was detected in reactions of MMO from M. capsulatus (Bath) with 1 (vide
