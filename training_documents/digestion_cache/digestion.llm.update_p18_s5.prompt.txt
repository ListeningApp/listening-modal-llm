You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

epbj | These tubules are of two cell types, digestive cells and basophil secretory cells. Digestive cells are the most abundant type. They are columnar and vacuolated and are responsible for intracellular digestion of food. The free surface of the digestive cell is extended into microvilli and the cytoplasm is characterised by the presence of numerous cytoplasmic vesicles types. Particulate matter is taken up at the base of the microvilli by pinocytosis and is initially stored within small vesicles called phagosomes. Phagosomes fuse with lysosomes in their maturation process. Digestion takes place within these lysosomes which contain hydrolytic enzymes. The end products of digestion are released directly into the haemolymph system and waste products are contained in residual bodies within the digestive cells. The cells eventually rupture and the waste material is swept along the ciliated secondary and primary ducts of the ceca towards the stomach, and ultimately to the intestine.
nmn2 | The ducts of the ceca are divided longitudinally into inhalant and exhalant channels. Cilia provide an exhalant current which carries undigested material to the typhlosoles and intestinal groove; this current also draws undigested material into the inhalant channel. It is possible (Morton, 1983) that the currents alternate with time. Mathers (1973) has shown the existence of an interval between the time when the food arrives in the ducts and the return to the intestine of residues from the digestive process.
g3tm | 2.2 The intestine
tfra | The function of the intestine is primarily to form faeces. The intestine often passes through the pericardial coelom and is surrounded by the heart ventricle. It then passes dorsally over the posterior adductor muscle and terminates at the anus where faeces are discharged into the exhalant chamber at the base of the exhalant siphon.
5lm9 | 3. Digestive enzymes
wp2c | Both stomach and digestive ceca contain a variety of digestive enzymes, particularly carbohydrases. In bivalves, digestive enzymes are produced by the style, by the cells of the digestive ceca (diverticula) and, in some genera examined, in the midgut (Purchon, 1971). Bivalve molluscs show an evolutionary trend towards extracellular digestion, which is believed to provide the most efficient utilisation of food (Reid, 1968).
us5v | Digestive enzymes include amylase, cellulase, alginase, lipase, phosphatase and several proteases (including chymotrypsin and cathepsins) (Mathers, 1973; Morton, 1983).
rs2m | Kristensen (1972) examined carbohydrases from the crystalline styles of a number of bivalves, including the blue mussel (Mytilus edulis) and found less activity than in the digestive gland. However, Wojtowicz (1972) recorded a 40-times greater activity of a-amylase in the style than in the digestive gland of the scallop Placopecten magellanicus, but other carbohydrases (a-glycosidase, ß-glucosidase, ß-galactosidase, laminarase and chitobiase) were confined to the digestive gland. Cellulase has been recorded in the style and digestive glands of several filter feeding bivalves, including M. edulis (Crosby & Reid, 1971). The high activity of cellulase in the stomach contents suggests that this enzyme is produced by gut bacteria.
uz9y | The localisation of enzymes in the digestive tract of the Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) is shown in Table IV.
8ov0 | The activities of the carbohydrases (amylase, cellulase and laminarinase are located throughout the digestive tract in the epithelia, such as the lysosomal enzyme, N-acetyl glucosaminidase, which is particularly strong around the gastric shield and in the cells of the tubules of the digestive gland. Non-specific esterases are present in the canal of the digestive gland and the apical part of the stomach and intestinal epithelium. Acid phosphatase, a lysosomal enzyme, is very active in the digestive gland while alkaline phosphatase, which indicates active transport, is localized in the canals of the digestive gland and the base of the tubules.

94h3 | Protease activity, in the tubules of the digestive gland and some parts of the intestine, is low at the start of digestion but builds up towards the end. These enzymes have an optimum pH of 5.5, as with lysosomal enzymes; this is associated with intracellular digestion. Given their location on the apical zones of microvilli, these enzymes appear to be membrane-bound (Boucaud-Camou et al., 1985).
9jx1 | Data from Lebesnerais (1985). Lysosomal proteases (cathepsins) are also known as dipeptidyl peptidases (DPPs); they are classified according to letter or number (Agarwal, 1990). Most of the cathepsins become activated at the low pH found in lysosomes. Thus, the activity of this family lies almost entirely within these organelles.
c3lz | Similar distributions of enzymes within the digestive tract of other bivalve species have been identified: grooved carpet shell (Ruditapes decussatus) (Henry, 1987); blue mussel (Mytilus edulis) (Janssen, 1981) and king scallop (Pecten maximus) (Henry et al., 1993; Henry et al., 1991). The movement of food through the digestive tract of the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas and the sites of enzyme action and uptake of nutrients is shown in Fig. 19.
