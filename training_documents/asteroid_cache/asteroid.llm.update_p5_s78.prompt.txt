You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

ccmb | 4.2. U-Pb chronology of phosphates in the unbrecciated achondrites
ma93 | In Agoult, euhedral to rounded grains of F-rich apatite with sizes of 10-100 um were observed homogeneously throughout the studied section (Fig. S4). Their U-Pb age can be determined more precisely compared to those of the other brecciated eucrites. The seven grains with 10 spot analyses yielded a 238U_206Pb isochron

y7ea | Ibitira is characterized by numerous spherical vesicles with sizes of 100-500 um in its unbrecciated recrystallized area. On the wall of the vesicle, a ~150 um round-shaped grain of merril- lite was identified (Fig. S5). Smaller grains <LATEX>\left( \sim 2 0 \mu m \right)</LATEX> of merrillite were also found in its igneous textures. The five merrillite grains with seven spot analyses did not define a 238U_206Pb isochron or 207 Pb-206Pb isochron age with meaningful precision, primarily be- cause of the overlapping of the data. The model <LATEX>2 0 7 p b ^ { * } / ^ { 2 0 6 } p b ^ { * }</LATEX> age was calculated at 4563-4515 Ma, with a weighted mean of 4552.0 ± 8.8 Ma (Fig. 4).

gem8 | 5.1. Two ages in Juvinas: older apatite and younger merrillite
e8nr | Only Juvinas presents two distinctly different ages for apatite and merrillite. The model <LATEX>{ } ^ { 2 0 7 } \mathrm { P b } ^ { * } / ^ { 2 0 6 } \mathrm { P b } ^ { * }</LATEX> ages are <LATEX>4 5 1 6 . 9 \pm 1 0 . 4</LATEX> Ma for the apatite and <LATEX>4 1 5 0 . 3 \pm 1 1 . 6 \mathrm { M a }</LATEX> for the merrillite (Fig. 4). Most apatite (except for Juv-1 in Fig. 1a) and all merrillite grains are located in a close area, even though they recorded completely different timings. One possible explanation is that the U-Pb sys- tem in merrillite can more readily be reset than that in apatite so that only merrillite records the 4150-Ma event. Although we know the U-Pb closure temperature of apatite (discussed later), unfortunately, there is no available information for merrillite at this moment. Previous SIMS U-Pb studies have not found such age differences between meteoritical apatite and merrillite (Sano et al., 2000; Terada and Sano, 2002). It is likely that the U-Pb systems in apatite and merrillite record the same events in regular cases. Another, more plausible case is that the reheating temperature in the 4,150-Ma event was heterogeneous and that it locally reached higher temperatures. The relationship between the apatite/merril- lite and the adjacent silica polymorphs supports this interpretation. Tridymite is a high-temperature silica phase (stable at 870-1470 ℃ under 1 atm; Fenner, 1913). The tridymite in Juvinas has a smooth surface and euhedral to subhedral shapes (Fig. 1), suggesting that it recrystallized from primary mesostasis (or its partial melt) dur- ing a high temperature reheating (>870℃) and subsequent rapid cooling process. We assume this event to be identical to the mer- rillite <LATEX>2 0 7 p b ^ { * } / 2 0 6 p b ^ { * }</LATEX> age, because all of <LATEX>t h e</LATEX> merrillite grains are located close to the tridymite. It is likely that they suffered the local heterogeneous thermal metamorphism at 4150 Ma. Similar metamorphic origins of tridymite have been suggested for several basaltic eucrites (Yamaguchi et al., 1996; Liao et al., 2019). Con- versely, the porous and anhedral quartz may be a relic of igneous mesostasis, consistent with observations of other basaltic eucrites (Fig. 1; Liao et al. (2019) and references therein). Considering that the apatite is located close to the mesostasis quartz, as well as in the lithic clast, the apatite should be an igneous relic mineral.
k78w | 5.2. Brecciated eucrites are consistent with a continual collisional history
g9du | What do the two ages found in Juvinas mean? Both the ap- atite <LATEX>\left( \sim 4 5 2 0 \quad M a \right)</LATEX> and the merrillite (~4150 Ma) in Juvinas are significantly younger than the crystallization age of Juvinas whole rock dated by the Mn-Cr system at <LATEX>4 5 6 2 . 5 \pm 1 . 0 \mathrm { M a }</LATEX> (Lugmair and Shukolyukov, 1998). The U-Pb age of the Juvinas zircon recorded a thermal event at 4545 ± 15 Ma (Zhou et al., 2013), consistent with the ubiquitous crustal metamorphism of Vesta at 4554.5 ± 2.0 Ma (Iizuka et al., 2015). The 4520-Ma Juvinas apatite is ex- pected to have recorded either a slow cooling process subsequent
