You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

fj24 | Mechanism of eosinophil-mediated killing of helminth parasites

ffx8 | mediates by activated eosinophils. Interestingly, evi- dence suggests that there might be significant differences in the susceptibility to and mechanisms of eosinophil- mediated killing between different life-cycle stages of the same parasite. 54,55 Unlike protozoa, helminths are too big to be engulfed by phagocytes and can only be killed by these cells when the latter have been activated by products of the adaptive immune response.
s6su | Eosinophils, which frequently accumulate in tissues soon after worm invasion, might also play a role in innate defense against this type of parasitic pathogen. For example, L3 larvae of S stercoralis are killed within 72 hours when implanted in chambers in susceptible mice, 45,47 with eosinophils being prominent among the cells infiltrating the chambers. Larval attrition is greatly reduced when worms are transferred instead into IL- 5-deficient mice. This rapid and nonspecific eosinophilic response might be a barrier-limiting mechanism active against the invasion of many tissue-dwelling helminths.
y219 | EOSINOPHILS AND PATHOGENESIS
06ht | Eosinophils have also been implicated in the pathogen- esis of helminth infection (Table III). Similarities between the sequelae of hypereosinophilic syndrome, a syndrome characterized by extremely high levels of eosinophilia and eosinophil-mediated end-organ damage,56 and the pathologic consequences of infection with helminths, including loiasis and lymphatic filariasis57,58 and toxo- cariasis,59 suggest a primary role for eosinophils in the pathogenesis of these infections. The association between the severity of clinical manifestations and the degree of eosinophil activation, as exemplified by increased eosinophil responsiveness to platelet-activating factor in patients with sowda, a hyperreactive form of onchocerci- asis associated with severe dermal pathology,60 provides additional indirect support for this hypothesis.
v3r2 | Although eosinophils can cause tissue damage through a number of different mechanisms, including direct cellu- lar cytotoxicity, physical damage caused by tissue infil- tration (space occupying), and thromboembolic phenom- ena caused by eosinophil-induced hypercoagulability,56 it

jc47 | is the release of eosinophil granule proteins and other cytotoxic substances that has been best correlated with helminth-induced tissue damage. Eosinophil cationic pro- teins (including major basic protein, eosinophil cationic protein, and eosinophil-derived neurotoxin) are toxic to various normal tissues and cells both in vitro and in vivo.7,61,62 Other potentially toxic inflammatory media- tors that are released by activated eosinophils include leukotrienes,63 platelet-activating factor,64 reactive oxy- gen species,65 and lysosomal hydrolases.62 These media- tors not only damage the parasite and surrounding tissues (reactive oxygen intermediates66,67 and hydrolases) but play a role in the perpetuation of the local immune response (platelet-activating factor and leukotrienes).
ko3c | Serum and urine levels of eosinophil granule proteins provide an indirect measure of degranulation in the tissues and are markedly increased in many helminth-infected patients.68 Furthermore, deposition of eosinophil granule proteins in the affected tissues of patients with helminth infection has also been described.69,70 One of the charac- teristics of the posttreatment reaction in onchocerciasis is an increase in blood and tissue levels of eosinophils and eosinophil granule proteins that is temporally related to the onset of symptomatology71,72 and preceded by an increase in serum levels of IL-5.73 Although localization of eosinophils and their products in the skin is most pro- nounced at sites of microfilarial degeneration,71 which is consistent with the hypothesis that eosinophil-mediated parasite killing plays a major role in pathogenesis, the pos- sibility that recruitment of eosinophils occurs secondarily in response to parasite death cannot be excluded.
xek3 | More direct evidence that eosinophils contribute to the pathogenesis of helminth infection comes from animal models. Eosinophilic infiltration of the cornea and con- junctival tissue, a characteristic component of onchocer- cal sclerosing keratitis in human subjects, occurs within 72 hours of intrastromal injection of sensitized mice with onchocercal antigens.74 Attenuation of both the eosinophil response and ocular inflammation is observed in IL-4 knockout mice on a C57BL/6 background,74 whereas eosinophil infiltration and corneal opacification is increased in mice treated with IL-12 at the time of corneal sensitization to onchocercal antigens despite decreased local expression of TH2 cytokines, including IL-5.75 The presence of eosinophil infiltration in a TH1 environment could be accounted for by a marked increase in corneal chemokines, including RANTES and eotaxin.75 Taken together, these data suggest that eosinophils, rather than the cytokine milieu, are the cru- cial factor in the development of onchocercal keratitis.
bbpr | Although it seems clear that eosinophils play a role in some models of helminth-induced pathology, they do not appear to be essential to the development of pathologic sequelae in all cases. Liver granulomas in schistosomia- sis typically contain a high percentage of activated eosinophils, the major source of TH2-associated cytokines in the granuloma milieu.76 Despite this, anti- IL-5-treated mice infected with schistosomiasis produce normal-sized granulomas, despite the absence of
5zyf | eosinophils.77 Similarly, lung infiltrates in N brasilien- sis-infected mice treated with anti-IL-5 differ from those of N brasiliensis-infected control mice in the absence of eosinophils but not in size or number of lesions. 10 Final- ly, in contrast to the attenuation of ocular disease observed in IL-4-/- C57BL/6J mice, corneal opacifica- tion is exacerbated in sensitized IL-4-/- BALB/cJ, STAT6-/- BALB/cJ, and IL-5-/- C57BL/6J78,79 mice after intrastromal injection of onchocercal antigen and is accompanied by increased tissue infiltration by neu- trophils (but not eosinophils).79 Whether these findings reflect a true lack of involvement of eosinophils in the pathologic sequelae of natural infection with these para- sites or the induction of alternative mechanisms of patho- genesis in the setting of dysregulation of the cytokine milieu remains to be elucidated.
