You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

f4i3 | VALUE OFFER: THE THOUGHT PROCESS
avlk | THOMAS H. PALMER, TEACHER'S MANUAL
vi9g | I want to do an exercise with you right now. I want to show you the difference between convergent and divergent problem solving. Why? So that you can actually create the Grand Slam Offer that will become the cornerstones of your business.
tyl7 | Convergent & Divergent Thinking
2hpu | In simple terms, convergent problem solving is where you take lots of variables, all known, with unchanging conditions and converge on a singular answer. Think math.
a10k | Example:
2pp5 | You have 3 salespeople who can each take 100 calls per month each.
l20h | It takes 4 calls to create one sale (including no shows).
kfwj | You need to get to 110 sales . . .
7hi1 | How many sales people must you hire? Deduced Information:
vpa2 | 100 calls/4 calls per close = 25 Closes Per 100 Calls
mtlg | 25 closes per rep
6rz3 | Goal: 110 sales total / 25 sales per rep = 4.4
oxdb | Since you can't hire 4.4 reps, you decide you must have five.
v978 | ANSWER: And since you have 3, you hire two more.
uqzw | Math problems are convergent. There are lots of variables and a single answer. We are taught all our lives in school to think this way. That is because it's easy to grade.
56yl | But life will pay you for your ability to solve using a divergent thought process. In other words, think of many solutions to a single problem. Not only that, convergent answers are binary. They are either right or they are wrong. With divergent thinking, you can have multiple right answers, and one answer that is way more right than the others. Cool right?
r00c | Here's what life presents us for divergent thinking: Multiple Variables, Known & Unknown, Dynamic Conditions, Multiple Answers.
bhhp | As such, I want to do an exercise with you that will engage the part of your brain that you will need to use in order to make something magical.
byke | I call it the "brick" exercise. Don't worry, it'll only take 120 seconds.
z2w8 | The Brick Exercise
1l0m | Right now, I want you to set a timer on your phone for 120 seconds. What you need to do: Think of a brick. Write down as many different uses of a brick as you can possibly think of. How many different ways could a brick be used in life to provide value.
9ctx | Ready? Go. It's okay to write in the book.
yipb | Alright - stop. Now before I show you my list, did you consider the following . . .
a9dp | . . . How big is the brick? A tab of gum, <LATEX>3 - 5 / 8 ^ { \prime \prime } \times 2 - 1 / 4 ^ { \prime \prime } \times 8 ^ { \prime \prime }</LATEX> (Standard), 2 ft x 2 ft x 6ft? What is the brick made of? Plastic, Gold, Clay, Wood, Metal? . .
zso4 | .. . How is the brick shaped? Does it have holes in it? Does it have divots for interlocking?
4g5b | Now as you think about that, can you think of even more uses for the brick than you probably wrote down? Here's my list:
ddml | · Paper weight
ahtn | · Door stop
5jda | · Building things
q1jc | . Home for a fish in a fish bowl
ke6a | · Plant holder with dirt in the holes (holed brick)
c4gy | · As a trophy (painted brick)
lr9x | · Rustic decoration
jux5 | · To break window
be8m | · Make a mural (tiny bricks painted)
1lxd | · A weight for resistance training
z3ff | · A wedge under uneven platform
rv0j | · Pen holder (holed brick)
kv4p | · Children's toy (lego bricks)
g1v3 | · Floatation device (plastic brick)
7d2w | · Payment for goods (gold brick)
3b38 | · Stabilizer for leaning something against
il0a | · Retainer of value (gold brick)
mato | · Holder for flagpole (holed brick)
uas3 | · A seat (jumbo brick)
6hc3 | Every offer has building blocks, the pieces that when combined make an offer irresistible. Our goal is to use a divergent thought process to think of as many easy ways to combine these elements to provide value.
rkb7 | So if I were selling a brick, I would find out what my customer's desire was, and then devise how many ways I could create value with my "brick."
eu28 | Now let's do it for real.

2n9u | W hen I started my gym, I struggled. I wanted so deeply to be successful, prove my dad wrong about my decision to start my own business, and prove to myself that I was worth something. But try as I did, I couldn't even sell people into a $99/mo bootcamp. People would say, "LA Fitness is $29/mo. This is expensive." I even tried getting people to start for free. They said they wouldn't bother because $99/mo afterwards was still too much, and they didn't want to start something they wouldn't continue with.
xtmy | It's a new level of frustration when you can't even give your services away for free to people. I felt worthless, and I didn't know what to do. Thankfully, during this time, I was in groups with other gym owners, and I started hearing about marketers and books. I devoured everything I could. And as soon as I stumbled on Dan Kennedy's books, I was hooked.
mdfm | In his books, he talked about making "irresistible offers." Again, this theme of "making an offer so good people would feel stupid to say no" kept re-appearing. But this time, remembering what TJ had told me, I decided to go all in on this concept, rather than just do what everyone else was doing.
xjme | But how? Everyone else was selling $99/mo bootcamps. How was I going to compete? So I decided to look at what we did differently. I thought - what do they really want? No one wants a membership; they want to lose weight.
zb9k | Step #1: Identify Dream Outcome
5yws | I had heard of weight loss challenges, so I started there.
t3fi | · Lose 201bs in 6 weeks.
dyg0 | · Big dream outcome - lose 201bs.
3n0b | · With a decreased time delay - 6 weeks.
46bq | Step #2: List Problems
tocx | Next, I wrote down all the things people struggled with and their limiting thoughts around them. When listing out problems, think about what happens immediately before and immediately after someone uses your product/service. What's the "next" thing they need help with? These are all the problems. Think about it in insane detail. If you do, you will create a more valuable and compelling offer as you'll continually be answering people's next problem as it manifests ..
07f7 | So, let's go ahead and list out the problems from a prospect's perspective as you think about them. What points of friction exist for them? I like to think in the sequence that the customer will experience each of these obstacles. Again, channel insane detail (the more problems the better!).
