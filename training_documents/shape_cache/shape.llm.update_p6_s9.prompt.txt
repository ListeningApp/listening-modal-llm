You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

gxfd | two practitioners will likely use such alternative meas- urements - such as SizeUK - while attempting to rep- licate FFIT. Sokolowski and Bettencourt (2020) even modifies FFIT to address the underlying assumptions about measurement placement that cannot work on women over size 14. However, these placement assumptions are invisible to third-party practitioners who do not run studies 'hacking' the algorithm. If using alternative measurements reclassifies bodies into different shapes, then FFIT is unauthoritative out- side of its original application because of unreplicable measurement definitions. In such a situation, ergono- mists who attempt to use the FFIT system in their work may not, therefore, be able to compare their work to others - but they are unaware of these underlying issues.
s2v1 | We aim to assess the FFIT's suitability as a body classification system for scientific research and gar- ment construction purposes, considering how slight changes in measurement definitions may affect shape classifications. We use FFIT as the case by which to explore how body shape systems may provide unreli- able when used more broadly than specified systems and measurements extractions. In pursuing this aim, we consider the following hypotheses:
jkp9 | 1. Calculating the FFIT using alternative measure- ment definitions causes the same human shape to be categorised as alternative body shapes, with a low - below 50% - agreement between measure- ment definition groups.
z8tt | 2. Waist measurements decrease by a statistically significant amount - x = 0.05 - when taken at SizeUK's region of SoB + 4.0 cm compared to the FFIT's region of SoB + 6.35 cm: with a large effect size.
9g22 | 3. Waist heights increase by a statistically significant amount - xx = 0.05 - when taken at SizeUK's region of SoB + 6.35 cm compared to the FFIT's region of SoB + 4.0 cm: with a large effect size.
41fx | 4. A person's FFIT Body Shape classification can be predicted from shoulder measurements that the FFIT excludes - Shoulder-to-Shoulder (Horizontal), Shoulder-to-Shoulder (Calliper), and Shoulder Girth (Full) - through a statistically significant regression model; x = . 05.
7um8 | In investigating our hypotheses, we analyse 1,679 UK females' FFIT shape classification - and necessary measurements - through Kappa Measure of Agreement, T-test, Multinomial Logistic Regression, and ANOVA statistical tests.

iat7 | Study population
ywwr | 1,679 females participated in this study, obtained through convenience sampling. We achieved this by posting flyers and adverts on social media (Facebook and Twitter), inviting members of the public to attend open scanning sessions between 2011 to 2016 in Manchester <LATEX>\left( n = 9 0 0 \right) ,</LATEX> Nottingham <LATEX>\left( n = 2 0 1 \right) ,</LATEX> and London
0i6j | <LATEX>\left( n = 5 7 8 \right) .</LATEX> Our sampling frame required participants to be female, over 18 years old, have no physical or cogni- tive disabilities, and not be pregnant during data cap- ture. These measures ensure ethical compliance and reduce the sample's independent variables. We only sampled females because the FFIT body shape classifi- cation system relates explicitly to the female body. We gained participant consent before data collection, with full prior approval of the study by Manchester Metropolitan University's ethics committee. Personal identifiable data was collected, kept separately, and de-identified within the working data set.

We calculated our sample size for a one-way between-groups ANOVA with a small sample size.

baj1 | Data collection procedure
n1wo | Before participants attended scan sessions, they were provided with guidelines regarding the body scanning requirements concerning underwear, jewellery, and hair. All participants were asked to use non-padded
5bq3 | and non-compression underwear to avoid any distor- tion of their natural body shape. The research ethics prohibits scanning anybody without underwear and excludes any inspection because of privacy issues. To ensure underwear, jewellery, or hair did not distort body shapes, the research team visually inspected each subjects' collected (processed) scan data. Visual inspection ensured all landmark points and measure- ments were in locations according to the anatomy and surface, considering measurement standards for clothing. Scan data that provided inaccurate measure- ments of the participant was removed.
ezla | We used TC2's KX-16 body-scanner to collect partici- pant's body scan data, with all participants adopting the standard scanning posture as different standing postures significantly alters waist and hip placement (Gill and Parker 2017). The standard scanning posture is 'standing position <LATEX>\mathrm { A } ^ { \prime }</LATEX> according to ISO 20685 (ISO 2010a); see Figure 3 that aligns with Gill, Hayes, and Parker's (2016) scanning protocol. We used the anonymised body scan data for measurement extraction and analysis.
