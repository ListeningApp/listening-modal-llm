If you don't know how to do problems like this, it's time to learn about Lagrange multipliers. You can find this in any book on calculus of several variables. But the idea is in the picture above. Say we've got two smooth functions f, g: Rn maps to R and we have a point on the surface g equals constant where f is as big as it gets on this surface. The gradient of f must be perpendicular to the surface at this point. Otherwise, we could move along the surface in a way that made f bigger! For the same reason, the gradient of g is always perpendicular to the surface g equals constant. So Vf and Vg must point in the same or opposite directions at this point. Thus, as long as the gradient of g is nonzero, we must have\n171k | Vf equals lambda Vg\ngugp | for some number lambda, called a Lagrange multiplier. So, solving this equation along with\naxri | g equals constant\niqve | is a way to find the point we're looking for-though we still need to check we've found a maximum, not a minimum or something else.\no7st | We can write a formula that means the exact same thing as Vf equals lambda Vg using differentials:\njsfl | df equals lambda dg\n0px6 | This is what we'll do from now on. Gradients are vector fields while differentials are one-forms. If you don't know what this means, you can probably ignore this for now: the difference, while ultimately quite important, will not be significant for anything we're doing.\n9n3l | MAXIMIZING ENTROPY SUBJECT TO A CONSTRAINT\n09gz | To maximize the entropy\npppg | H equals negative summation i equals one to n of pi ln pi\nclpf | subject to a constraint on the expected value\ngazp | summation of Ai pi equals c\nospq | it's good to look for a probability distribution such that dH equals lambda d(A)\nl6fu | for some number lambda. This will then be a Boltzmann distribution:\n031c | exp of negative lambda Ai\ngrg5 | Pi equals\n0n4f | one over the summation of exp of negative lambda Ai\nwbhc | We've seen how to maximize a function subject to a constraint. Now let's do the case we're interested in: maximizing entropy subject to a constraint on the expected value of some quantity.\nkqsp | Suppose we have a finite set of outcomes, say one to n. Our 'quantity' A is just a number A1 to An depending on the outcome. For any probability distribution p on the set of outcomes, we can define its Shannon entropy and the expected value of A:\nhone | H equals negative summation i equals one to n of pi ln pi, and expected value of A equals summation i equals one to n of Ai pi.\nsngr | Here we are using base e for the Shannon entropy, to simplify the calculations. Let's try to find the probability distribution that maximizes H on the surface where the expected value of A equals c. We'll show that if such a probability distribution p exists, and none of the pi are zero, then p must be a Boltzmann distribution\nojot | Pi equals\nrg5s | exp of negative lambda Ai divided by summation i equals one to n of exp of negative lambda Ai\nyppk | for some lambda in R. If you're willing to trust me on this, you can skip this calculation.\n1svs | To use the method from last time-the Lagrange multiplier method-we'd like to use the probabilities pi as coordinates on the space of probability distributions. But they aren't independent, since\nizqt | summation i equals one to n of pi equals one. To get around this, let's use all but one of the pi as coordinates, and remember that the remaining one is a function of those. Let's use p2, p3, and so on, to pn as coordinates, so that p1 equals 1 minus the summation of p2 and so on to pn. Furthermore, the space of all probability distributions on our finite set is\nvub1 | the closed interval from zero to one for all pi where the summation i equals one to n of pi equals one. It looks like a closed interval when n equals two, or a triangle when n equals three, or a tetrahedron when n equals four, or some higher-dimensional version of a tetrahedron when n is larger. In its interior this space looks locally like Rn minus one, so we can use the Lagrange multiplier method, but it also has a boundary where one or more of the pi vanish, and then this method no longer applies. We'll see an example of that later.\nzfhy | So, let's assume p is a probability distribution maximizing the Shannon entropy H on the surface where the expected value of A equals c, and also suppose p has p1 to pn greater than zero. Suppose that not all the values Ai are equal, since that makes the problem too easy see why? Then the expected value of A is never zero, so from what I said last time, we must have\np9bw | dH equals lambda d(A)\n2l8i | at the point p. So let's see what this equation actually says.\nlocx | Since\nz2dl | H equals negative summation i equals one to n of pi ln pi\nvtxq | we have\n571b | dH equals negative summation i equals one to n of (1 plus ln pi) dpi.\nfg6a | Similarly, since\no873 | expected value of A equals summation i equals one to n of Ai pi\ntm0v | we have\nyusn | d(A) equals summation i equals one to n of Ai dpi.\n5cww | So, our equation dH equals lambda d(A) says\nvgpr | that negative (1 plus ln pi) dpi equals lambda summation i equals one to n of Ai dpi.\nxrda | For these to be equal, the coefficients of dpi must agree for each of our coordinates p2 to pn. But we have to remember that p1 equals one minus the summation of p2 to pn and thus dp1 equals negative of the summation of dp2 to dpn. Thus, for each i from 2 to n we have\nu0fl | (1 plus ln p1) minus (1 plus ln pi) equals lambda times (negative A1 plus Ai)\n1qe2 | and fiddling around we get\nof19 | exp of negative lambda times A1 divided by exp of negative Ai times P1 equals Pi.\nl0xs | This says something cool: the probabilities pi are proportional to the exponentials exp of negative lambda Ai. And since the probabilities must sum to one, it's obvious what the constant of proportionality must be: pi equals the exp of negative lambda Ai divided by the summation i equals one to n of exp of negative lambda Ai. So yes: pi must be given by the Boltzmann distribution!\nyrtf | In summary, we've seen that if there exists a probability distribution p that maximizes the Shannon entropy among probability distributions with expected value of A equals c, and if all the pi are positive, then p must be a Boltzmann distribution. But this raises other questions. When does such a probability distribution exist? If it exists, is it unique? And what if not all the pi are positive?\n9foe | In what follows we'll dive down this rabbit hole and get to the bottom of it. I'll just state some facts-you may enjoy trying to see if you can prove them. First, there exists a probability distribution p1 to pn with expected value of A equals c if and only if\n```",
