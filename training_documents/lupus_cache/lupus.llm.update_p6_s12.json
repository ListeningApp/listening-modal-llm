However, the diagnostic value of PCT and CRP in the identification of bacterial infection in SLE remains unsettled.\ntp8g | Mannose Binding Lectin\ngxfd | Mannose binding lectin is a protein produced by the liver that activates the complement system by an associated protease, the MBL-associated serine protease. MBL polymorphisms have been associated with SLE development in multiple populations and high MBL levels are predictive of disease activity especially lupus nephritis.\ns2v1 | CD64\njkp9 | CD64 is a receptor observed on monocytes, macrophages and on neutrophils. Peripheral nCD seventy-four index combined with elevated CRP improves the ability to predict bacterial infections.\nz8tt | High Mobility Group Box Chromosomal Protein one\n9g22 | High mobility group box chromosomal protein one is a nuclear non-histone protein and a damage associated molecular pattern protein. Their levels are notably higher in SLE patients, especially those with renal involvement. However, their levels are elevated after onset of sepsis and septic shock.\n41fx | two prime five prime Oligoadenylate Synthetase\n7um8 | two prime five prime oligoadenylate synthetase is an enzyme activated by Type I IFN which leads to the degradation of RNA and is important for the protection from vital infections. High OASL expression levels negatively correlate with the presence of certain infections and may provide useful information in differentiating disease lupus flare.\nuow2 | Soluble Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid Cells Type one\niat7 | The receptor TREM- one expressed on the surface of mature neutrophils and monocytes in response to bacterial and fungal infections lead to a higher level of the soluble form in lupus patients with flares and in those with infections, compared to quiescent disease or the general population.\nywwr | CD27\n0i6j | CD27 protein is a TNF receptor expressed on T- and B-lymphocytes where high expression of CD27 corresponds with high disease activity.\n87cq | Delta Neutrophil Index\n0qs3 | Delta neutrophil index is a measure of immature granulocytes and is determined by subtracting the number of mature polymorphonuclear leucocytes from myeloperoxidase reactive cells. When compared to CRP, a high DNI correlates better with sepsis and aids in early diagnosis.\nz8f7 | Cerebrospinal Fluid Biomarkers\n7w7j | Patients with neuropsychiatric lupus have elevated levels of interleukin-six, prostaglandin E2 and immunoglobulin G in their cerebrospinal fluid. However, in central nervous system infections, there are elevated levels of interleukin-six and prostaglandin E2 but not significantly elevated cerebrospinal fluid or immunoglobulin G.\n51vd | Sepsis Scores in SLE\nbaj1 | The high mortality of SLE patients with sepsis in the intensive care units used sepsis scores as good predictors of mortality. These include, Simplified Acute Physiology Score two, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation two.\nn1wo | Despite the discovery of new biomarkers to verify the infections in SLE, none of these biomarkers alone confirm or exclude an infection. A mixture of these tests may be more accurate in predicting the diagnosis and monitoring of infections in SLE patients.\n5bq3 | Nonetheless, these biomarkers require further reliability and validity studies in different SLE populations and long-term data in SLE patients with distinct types of infections. An optimal biomarker or combination of biomarkers of infections or lupus flares should be accurate and reproducible and should enhance the approach to early diagnosis, effective treatment, and improved clinical outcome.\nezla | Proposed Steps to Take When Challenged with Infection in SLE\nrsbu | Assessment of SLE patients remains crucial when confronted by a major diagnostic challenge of having a presentation with a febrile illness. The need to control lupus disease activity that requires suppression of the immune system to avoid lupus related organ damage and death complicates the care of lupus patients. Yet, crucial, and appropriate evaluation of infectious etiology and prompt initiation of antibiotics will evade serious life-threatening complications.\nmagd | Proposed steps to adopt when challenged by an infection in SLE are outlined and depicted in Table two.\ntb74 | Fever in SLE is infectious until proven otherwise. While the prevalence of fever in SLE has declined over the past decades related to the intake of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, glucocorticoids and broad-spectrum antibiotics, the source of fever must be identified. Thus, vigilance warrants efforts in identifying a latent or an opportunistic infection in febrile patients with SLE.\n8l69 | Initial assessment should focus on risk indices based on age, multi-morbidities, use of glucocorticoids, cytotoxic immune suppressive and immune modulatory therapy. High-risk lupus patients require hospitalization. It is vital to deal with evolving sepsis and its complications in the setting of quantitative or qualitative neutropenia be it related to SLE or a complication of cytotoxic immunosuppressive therapy or immune modulatory treatment.\n1jyv | Frameworks in the diagnostic work up of fever emphasize ongoing evaluations guided by cultures and clinical data including awareness of antimicrobial resistant infections. Applying the abovementioned clinical predictors of infection including CRP, procalcitonin and others is helpful. Molecular diagnostic assays may be useful if available including those combined with eighteen-F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron-emission tomography and computed tomography and next-generation sequencing. Nevertheless, the diagnostic yield of these tools in autoimmune disorders remains limited.\nolce | On the other hand, fever, in systemic autoimmune disorders like SLE is linked to adaptive immunity driven by interferon response during the lupus disease activity state and must be suspected when having negative infectious work-ups or\nerx1 | microbiological control of infections. It is imperative to determine disease activity in febrile illnesses in SLE and avoid possible overdiagnosis of lupus disease flare.\nb3bt | There are few examples of overdiagnosis of SLE and lupus flares, but it is important to approach those patients with the understanding of the risk of treatment with immune suppressive therapy and the risk of undertreatment.\n0w8m | The diagnosis of SLE and lupus flare should be based on diagnostic criteria that include patients with mild disease activity. SLE disease activity must be determined clinically employing clinical questionnaires including SLE disease activity index, British Isles Lupus Assessment Group disease activity index, Systemic Lupus Activity Measure, the Systemic Lupus Activity Index, European Consensus Lupus Activity Measurements index and the Systemic Lupus Activity Questionnaire for Population Studies.\nvcu3 | Clinical features like the presence of scleritis, cytoid bodies on eye examination, lupus dermatitis, splinter hemorrhages, cutaneous vasculitis or livedo pattern, friction rub of pericarditis and leg edema suggesting myocarditis, and pulmonary hypertension or renal disease of glomerulonephritis are clues to advocate for lupus disease activity.\n```",
