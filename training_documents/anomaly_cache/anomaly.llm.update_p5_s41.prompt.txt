You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

o9sc | We discard the x and y coordinates due to the low infor- mative content and use only the depth component z in cen- timeters. Missing depth values are repeatedly filled by us- ing the average value of valid pixels from an 8-connected neighborhood for 3 iterations. We model the background as a 2D plane by interpolating the depth of the 4 corner pix- els. A pixel is assumed as foreground if its depth is further than 7mm distant from the background plane. As an in- put to our models, we first resize the masks to 192 × 192 pixels via bilinear downsampling and then perform pixel- unshuffling [56] with d = 8 as described in Section 3 to match the feature map resolution. In order to detect anoma- lies at the edge of the object and fill holes of missing values, the foreground mask is dilated using a square structural ele- ment of size 8. We subtract the mean foreground depth from each depth map and set its background pixels to 0. The bi- nary foreground mask M with ones as foreground and zeros as background is downsampled to feature map resolution to mask the loss for student and teacher. This is done by a bi- linear interpolation f1 followed by a binarization where all entries greater than zero are assumed as foreground to mask the loss at position (i, j):

zh03 | 4.2.3 Teacher
1mvw | For the normalizing flow architecture of the teacher, we use 4 coupling blocks which are conditioned on a positional en- coding with 32 channels. Each pair of internal subnetworks Si and ti is designed as one shallow convolutional network ri with one hidden layer whose output is split into the scale and shift components. Inside ri we use ReLU-Activations and a hidden channel size of 1024 for MVT2D and 64 for MVT3D. We choose the alpha-clamping parameter o = 3 for MVT2D and Q = 1.9 for MVT3D. The teacher net- works are trained for 240 epochs for MVT2D and 72 epochs for MVT3D, respectively, with the Adam optimizer [26], using author-given momentum parameters 31 = 0.9 and 32 = 0.999, a learning rate of 2 . 10-4 and a weight decay of 10-5.
6d4s | 4.2.4 Student
mqah | For the student networks, we use nst_blocks = 4 resid- ual convolutional blocks as described in Section 3.2. The Leaky-ReLU-activations use a slope of 0.2 for negative val- ues. We choose a hidden channel size of nhidden = 1024 for the residual block. Likewise, we take over the number of epochs and optimizer parameters from the teacher. The scores at feature map resolution are aggregated for evalua- tion at image level by the maximum distance if a foreground mask is available, and the average distance otherwise (RGB only).
xxr8 | 4.3. Evaluation Metrics
rl4j | As common for anomaly detection, we evaluate the per- formance of our method on image-level by calculating the area under receiver operating characteristics (AUROC). The ROC measures the true positive rate dependent on the false
vz32 | positive rate for varying thresholds of the anomaly score. Thus, it is independent of the choice of a threshold and in- variant to the class balance in the test set. For measuring the segmentation of anomalies at pixel-level, we compute the AUROC on pixel level given the ground truth masks in the datasets.
ncb0 | 4.4. Results
8mp0 | 4.4.1 Detection
xjyk | Table 2 shows the AUROC of our method and previous work for detecting anomalies on the 15 classes of MVT2D as well as the averages for textures, objects and all classes. We set a new state-of-the-art performance on the mean de- tection AUROC over all classes, improving it slightly to 99.2%. This is mainly due to the good performance on the more challenging objects, where we outperform pre- vious work by a comparatively large margin of 0.9%, ex- cept for PatchCore [36]. The detection of anomalies on tex- tures, which CS-Flow [39] has already almost solved with a mean AUROC of 99.8%, still works very reliably at 99.3%. Especially compared to the two student-teacher approaches [7, 51], a significant improvement of 6% and 3.6% respec- tively is archieved. Moreover, our student-teacher distances show to be a better indicator of anomalies compared to the likelihoods of current state-of-the-art density estimators [22, 39] which, like our teacher, are based on normalizing flows.
mt0f | Even though MVT2D has established itself as a stan- dard benchmark in the past, this dataset (especially the tex- tures) is easily solvable for recent methods, and differences are mainly in the sub-percent range, which is only a mi- nor difference in terms of the comparatively small size of the dataset. In the following, we focus on the newer, more challenging MVT3D dataset where the normal data shows
awab | more variance and anomalies only partly occur in one of the two data modalities, RGB and 3D.
