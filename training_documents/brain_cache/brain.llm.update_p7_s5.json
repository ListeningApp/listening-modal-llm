        "content": "9own | The adult nervous system has the capacity for plasticity, and the structure of the brain can change in response to training. It is generally assumed that the increased gray matter results from repeated activation of a brain region and previous studies have shown activation during meditation in brain regions identified here. The cellular mechanisms underlying training-induced neuroanatomical plasticity are not yet understood, however. An extensive body of research during the last decade has established that MBSR leads to improvements in psychological health and well-being. Demonstrating morphological increases in regions associated with mental health, the data presented here suggest a plausible underlying neural mechanism, namely, that such increases represent enduring changes in brain structure that could support improved mental functioning. Knowledge of the neurobiological mechanisms of behavioral interventions is indispensable to their effective and targeted use.",
