You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

m61y | Impact of insulin and insulin resistance on brain dopamine signalling and reward processing - An underexplored mechanism in the pathophysiology of depression?
u2ob | 1. Introduction
2gnm | Insulin is a peptidergic hormone mainly produced by the beta-cells of the pancreas and was initially thought to regulate blood glucose con- centrations only by binding to its receptor and promoting glucose uptake into cells in the periphery. However, when insulin receptors were identified in multiple brain areas, the essential role of central insulin signalling in the regulation of whole-body glucose metabolism was recognized. Amongst other regions, insulin receptors (IR) are highly expressed in the dopaminergic (DA) midbrain (Figlewicz et al., 2003; Jones et al., 2017; Milstein and Ferris, 2021; Pardini et al., 2006a), which encodes reward-seeking behaviour, so that a further role of cen- tral insulin signalling - the regulation of reward-related behaviour - has
emgw | ABSTRACT
xaqt | Type 2 diabetes and major depressive disorder (MDD) are the leading causes of disability worldwide and have a high comorbidity rate with fatal outcomes. Despite the long-established association between these conditions, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unknown.
5rcb | Since the discovery of insulin receptors in the brain and the brain's reward system, evidence has accumulated indicating that insulin modulates dopaminergic (DA) signalling and reward behaviour. Here, we review the evidence from rodent and human studies, that insulin resistance directly alters central DA pathways, which may result in motivational deficits and depressive symptoms. Specifically, we first elaborate on the differential effects of insulin on DA signalling in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) - the primary DA source region in the midbrain - and the striatum as well as its effects on behaviour. We then focus on the alterations induced by insulin defi- ciency and resistance. Finally, we review the impact of insulin resistance in DA pathways in promoting depressive symptoms and anhedonia on a molecular and epidemiological level and discuss its relevance for stratified treatment strategies.
524j | been progressively unravelled in recent years. Due to the alterations observed in DA-encoded reward-related behaviour, it has been proposed that impaired DA signalling in conditions of central insulin resistance might be causally related to depressive and anxious symptoms (Cai et al., 2018b; Dutheil et al., 2016a; Ho et al., 2012a; Kleinridders et al., 2015). In recent years, a wave of fundamental rodent studies has revived the old debate regarding the comorbidity, and causality, of diabetes and depression, offering new opportunities to investigate underlying mech- anisms and use them to improve treatment efficacy.
xd3m | In this review, we explore the role of insulin in regulating DA sig- nalling in the midbrain - with a focus on the projections from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) (see 2.1) to the ventral striatum (see 2.2) - and consequently in reward-related behaviour encoded by the mesolimbic
8qb6 | pathways (2.3 and 2.4). Further, we review how central insulin resis- tance affects DA signalling (3.1 and 3.2) and reward-seeking behaviour in rodents (3.3) as well as humans (3.4) and as an outlook discuss the clinical importance of (impaired) insulin signalling in depression and its therapeutical implications (3.5).
wkbn | 1.1. Encoding of reward-related behaviour in the DA midbrain
ftfg | The DA midbrain including the VTA and the substantia nigra (SN) is the major source of DA neurons in the brain. DA neurons are organized in subpopulations, which are heterogeneous in their anatomical loca- tion, projection site, electrophysiological properties, and function (German and Manaye, 1993; Roeper, 2013). While DA neurons in the SN (pars compacta) mainly project to the dorsal striatum (nigrostriatal pathway) and are involved in movement control, different sub- populations of DA neurons projecting from the VTA to the prefrontal cortex (mesocortical pathway) and the ventral striatum (mesolimbic pathway), in particular the nucleus accumbens (NAc), encode multiple aspects of reward-seeking behaviour, such as reward-driven (rein- forcement) learning and motivation to work for reward (Beier et al., 2015; Tobler et al., 2005). Palatable food, sex, and social contact are considered as primary rewards that are strongly encoded in this system. According to the currently dominant theory of reward learning, reward-driven learning is guided by reward prediction errors (PE), which reflect the discrepancy between an expected reward and the actual level of the obtained reward. These PEs function as learning signals and are encoded by dopamine (DA) cell spiking in the VTA causing phasic DA release in the NAc in case of a bigger reward obtained than expected (positive PE) and by a decrease of DA spiking if a smaller than expected reward is gained (negative PE) (Mohebi et al., 2019). As learning progresses, phasic DA release shifts from responding to the obtained rewards to responding to the perception of a learned cue pre- dicting an upcoming reward (Schultz, 2001; Schultz et al., 1997). Both the cue and reward-associated DA signals are essential for consolidating learned associations so that inhibition of either cue- or reward-related

w8r5 | DA signals impairs the expression of learned associative behaviour (Van Zessen et al., 2021). The reward PE theory has currently been challenged by Jeong et al. (2022), who developed an algorithm for retrospective causal learning and found that mesolimbic dopamine release conveys retrospective causal associations but not prospective reward PE. While these theories diverge conceptually and propose different biological frameworks of DA action, they both consolidate the relevance of DA signals in association learning, which guides adaptive behaviour.
ybik | Additionally, DA not only encodes learning signals but also moti- vates action initiation to obtain a reward. As such, DA release ramps up when we approach a reward, reflecting reward expectancy (Mohebi et al., 2019). The amount of DA released during this phase is locally controlled in the NAc without corresponding changes in VTA DA cell spiking (Mohebi et al., 2019) and provides information about the value of the anticipated reward, motivating the initiation of action to obtain it (Hamid et al., 2016; Howe et al., 2013; van Swieten and Bogacz, 2020). In this constant feedback circle, the actions initiated upon the perception of a potential reward shape future reward behaviour, as NAc DA release is attenuated unless a correct action to obtain the reward is initiated (Syed et al., 2016).
