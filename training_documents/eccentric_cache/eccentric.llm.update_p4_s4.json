For links with length ratios less than two point zero the first term will govern; however, for longer links the second term is dominant. In order to meet the objectives of the capacity design approach, it is necessary to estimate the maximum shear force that can develop in a link during an intense loading, i.e. V max. Consequently, other structural members shall be designed to remain essentially elastic and resist the loads developed by the fully yielded and strain hardened link. Any underestimation of the maximum link force may lead to unfavorable failures in other members. To have a reliable estimate of V max the link overstrength concept is generally utilized as follows:\nwp2c | V max equals nine two times R sub y V sub e equals Q times V sub e.\nus5v | where R sub y is the ratio of expected to nominal yield stress, considered for each steel grade based on statistical data, V sub e is the expected or actual shear capacity of the link, and Q is the overstrength factor due to strain hardening. Early experimental studies by Popov and his colleagues suggested the value of Q equals one point five for design purposes, which is still implicitly in use in most seismic design specifications. The link overstrengths observed in the previous experimental studies on horizontal I-shaped links are presented in Figure four. The traditional line of Q squared equals one point five is also depicted in this figure. It should be mentioned that the value of V sub e for every data point is calculated using the measured properties reported in the original reference. Only cyclic test results for links with F sub y greater than two hundred mega Pascal are included in the figure. A summary of the experiments conducted between nineteen eighty three and two thousand two on EBF links is also presented by Richards in his dissertation. Most of the links tested by Popov and his colleagues were constructed from A thirty six steel, while links with higher strength steels such as A seven zero nine and A nine nine two were tested later by other researchers such as McDaniel, Okazaki and his colleagues, Mansour et al., and Dusicka et al. Shear links constructed from low-yield-strength steels were also tested more recently by Dusicka et al. and Ji et al.\nrs2m | As can be seen in Figure four, the value of Omega equals one point five seems like a reasonable upper-bound for links with rho greater than one. However, this overstrength value overestimates V sub m a x for some intermediate links one point six less than rho less than two point six and drastically underestimates V sub m a x for very short links rho less than one. There are several reasons for these discrepancies, which can be summarized as follows.\nuz9y | Using a constant value of one point five for the overstrength factor neglects the effect of moment-shear (M-V) interaction. However, the study by Engelhardt and Popov proved that this interaction can be important for intermediate links where Omega values lower than one point five were observed (Figure four).\n8ov0 | The nominal shear capacity of short links is generally calculated based on the web area, neglecting the contribution of the flanges. However, as mentioned by McDaniel et al., in short links with relatively thick flanges, there is a significant shear force carried by the flanges. Manheim and Popov and Richards have proposed methods for determining the link plastic shear capacity considering the flange effect. Through nonlinear F E analysis of isolated links, Richards demonstrated that the overstrength factor of one point five is a reasonable limit even for very short links, provided that the flange effect is included in determining V P. However, the same conclusion was not reached when previous test results on short and very short built-up links were examined. The calculated overstrengths for these links decreased slightly by including the flange effect in determining V I; however, they were still significantly higher than one point five for most cases. Richards attributed this discrepancy to the presence of other factors, beside the flange effect, in experimental studies. In two thousand seven, Okazaki and Engelhardt reported the test results for a total of thirty-seven links constructed from A S T M A nine nine two steel. Although not very short, some of the specimens had very high ratios of flange to web area A sub f over A sub w. These specimens however did not exhibit overstrengths substantially higher than one point five. On the contrary, other recent results by Ji et al. indicated that very short links with even lower flange to web area ratios could achieve remarkably high overstrengths, in some cases even over two point zero. A further numerical investigation by Ji et al. revealed that for the tested specimens the shear contribution of flanges could be as much as zero point two V P. However, it was concluded that other factors in addition to the flange effect are influential in causing the observed high overstrengths. Thus, it can be deduced that the numerical and experimental studies are inconclusive about the contribution of flanges to the link overstrength.\nmj9m | If axial restraints are present at the link ends, tension can develop during shearing, due to nonlinear geometric effects, especially at high rotation angles. In two thousand twelve, this crucial issue was investigated by Della Corte et al. using detailed F E analyses considering both geometric and material nonlinearities. Based on the numerical results it was concluded that the presence of axial restraints can significantly increase the overstrength up to fifteen percent increase was reported in some models, especially for short links. In a more recent study, Ji et al. also mentioned that restraining axial deformations of very short links by adjacent members can create non-negligible axial forces in these links and affect their behavior significantly.\n94h3 | Another possible cause for the very high overstrengths observed in some tests is the excessive cyclic hardening of steel due to very large plastic strains. This idea was introduced recently by Ji et al. on the basis of an experiment conducted by Kasai et al. on stocky short steel panels in which hardening continued to very large shear angles. Based on this observation, Ji et al. proposed that the very high overstrengths reported for very short links are related to their high rotation capacities. These links experience large plastic rotations substantially higher than zero point zero eight radians and consequently their webs are subjected to excessive shear strains which may lead to excessive cyclic hardening. A refined F E analysis by Ji et al. on very short links revealed that for a link plastic rotation of the order of zero point one five radians the cyclic hardening effect can increase the shear strength by about seventy percent.\n```",
