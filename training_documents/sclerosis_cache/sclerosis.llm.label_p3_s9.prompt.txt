You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

wzno | Meninges in MS patients include inflammatory B cell infiltrates, and a greater load of these injects to the severity of cortical lesions, neurodegeneration, and clinical impairment. B cells may serve as Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) reservoirs [53,54]. After EBV infection, B cells transform into antigen-processing cells, resulting in a more precise presentation of antigens. Recombinant human myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein was shown to be internalized and cross-presented by EBV-infected B-cells, which were efficiently identified by cytotoxic CD8+ T-cells. Furthermore, B cells obtained from MS patients had more CD40 on their surface, indicating that B cells deliver antigens more effectively [24]. Increased expression of B cell activation markers in individuals with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) was related to a high degree of neurodegeneration, as indicated by a rise in the number of T1 hyperintense lesions and a decrease in brain

pxbq | volume. In addition to B-cell-related diseases, loss of normal functioning in the effector T-cell population can contribute to the course of MS [24]. In healthy people, CD8+ cytotoxic T cells that eliminate EBV- infected lymphoblastoid cell lines keep EBV infection under control. Since particular cytotoxic CD8+ cells are prepared to identify and kill infected cells that express EBV latent proteins, they will be referred to as "latency-specific T cells" from now on. During MS exacerbation, the EBV-specific T-cell population expands, and the latency-specific CD8+ T-cell activity increases. However, as MS progresses, latency-specific CD8+ T- cells exhibit a fatigued phenotype and cannot inhibit the proliferation of latently infected cells. This results in a vicious loop in which an increased number of infected cells inhibits the autoregulatory system and further depletes T cells. Recurrent relapses can be linked to poor management of EBV reactivation, leading to increased infection of naive B cells and viral generation [24].
jfsr | Antigen presentation to T cells and releasing chemicals that may harm oligodendrocytes are additional pathogenic pathways involving B cells in MS [54]. Microglia and macrophages release many cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-«, and interleukin (IL)-1ß, which can contribute to neurodegeneration through cytokine-induced cell death, inhibition of astrocytic glutamate reuptake, and induction of dysfunctional ribonucleic acid-binding proteins. Microglia and macrophages can also release glutamate, which might contribute to glutamate excitotoxicity and neurodegeneration. Microglia and macrophages produce reactive oxygen/nitrogen species, which can contribute to dementia by generating oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage. Microglia can also express anti-inflammatory phenotypes, promoting remyelination [54].
u15r | Clinical presentation
lq35 | When a patient arrives with a clinically isolated condition, MS is often assumed. Depending on the location of the eloquent lesion, it could be uni- or multisymptomatic. Brainstem, spinal cord syndrome, and optic neuritis are the most common presentations; nevertheless, there are various other, less typical presentations, including cortical presentations such as dominant parietal lobe syndromes [57]. Relapses of MS often develop subacutely over hours or days, plateau for many weeks, and then recover gradually. In early MS, gross clinical recovery after relapse typically looks complete; however, most relapses leave behind damage [58]. For instance, gross visual acuity may improve after acute optic neuritis, but impairments in color vision, contrast sensitivity, and depth perception remain. As the neuronal reserve is depleted, recovery from relapses becomes insufficient, and neuron deficiencies accumulate, resulting in permanent impairment [59]. On magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), approximately 10 "asymptomatic" lesions are seen for each clinical attack. A minor lesion in the eloquent region is likely to produce symptoms. Macroscopic or MRI-visible lesions are only the tip of the iceberg; many more lesions are apparent at the microscopic level, and many more are in deep and cortical gray matter. Secondary progressive MS occurs approximately 10-15 years after the beginning of RRMS, with a steady progression from isolated relapses to a slowly progressing disease. There is no clear transition between the disease categories; relapses occur against a backdrop of gradual progression until passage becomes predominant [59]. Cognitive impairment and an increase in MRI atrophy in early MS imply neurodegeneration from the outset of clinical symptoms. In 5 to 15% of cases, primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) is characterized by the slow accumulation of progressive impairment that affects the dominant neural system [57]. Progressive spastic paraparesis is the most prevalent manifestation of PPMS, although sensory ataxia, cerebellar ataxia, cognitive impairment, and advanced visual failure are well-described variations. There has been a decline in the percentage of individuals with PPMS [57,58].

d09o | McDonald's criteria are widely used in both clinical and research settings. In light of scientific advancements over the past seven years, these guidelines may no longer offer the most current information for physicians and researchers [60,61]. MS Diagnosis examined the McDonald criteria and suggested modifications

McDonald's standards in 2017 continue to apply primarily to patients with a specific clinically isolated disease, define what is necessary to fulfill the spread in time and space of CNS lesions, and highlight that there must be no alternative explanation for the presentation [60,61] (Table 1).

d6r4 | Management and treatment
9mrz | Current therapy options focus on treating acute episodes, alleviating symptoms, and decreasing biological activity. The predominant therapy for MS is disease-modifying medications such as dimethyl fumarate, interferon-beta, natalizumab, and fingolimod. When the diagnosis of MS is obtained, immediate treatment should proceed. Short-term objectives include reducing MRI lesion activity. Long-term goals involve preventing secondary progressive MS. After beginning the medication, patient compliance and drug toxicity monitoring are the key concerns [3,62].
pk06 | Ocrelizumab selectively depletes CD20-expressing B cells while retaining preexisting humoral immunity and the ability to reconstitute B cells. B cell depletion is associated with potent interruption of B-cell trafficking from the periphery to the CNS, decreased presentation of B cell antigens to T cells, modulation of proinflammatory cytokine secretion by B cells, and reduced activation and differentiation of immunoglobulin-secreting plasma blasts. Ocrelizumab is administered every 24 weeks by intravenous infusion. The initial results of the phase 3 trial suggested a low potential risk of increased malignancies, including breast cancer; however, prolonged follow-up showed cancer rates that were consistent with the expected epidemiological rates. Although significant herpes virus infections are now a documented side effect, post-marketing research is typically consistent with clinical trials [63,64]. It is indicated to cure relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS) and PPMS. According to the label, two 300 mg initial doses are delivered two weeks apart, followed by 600 mg every six months. To prevent infusion reactions, patients should be premedicated 30-60 minutes before ocrelizumab infusion with 100 mg of methylprednisolone and antihistamine. Observe patients for 60 minutes after injection of ocrelizumab injection [62-64].
7wn9 | Rituximab is an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody that, based on early studies and real-world experience, seems equally effective against RMS and PPMS, although it has never received regulatory clearance [65,66]. Rituximab was approved in 1997 for the cure of lymphoma but is also used off-label for treating several neurological diseases, such as myasthenia gravis and MS. Various dosing regimens have been used. Patients receive 500 or 1000 mg of rituximab intravenously every 6 to 12 months, sometimes after two initial applications conducted two weeks apart [65,66].
wcd0 | Natalizumab is an inhibitor of @401 integrin, an adhesion protein produced on the surface of lymphocytes and involved in transmigration via endothelial to the CNS. Compared with placebo or interferon 1a, natalizumab significantly reduces relapses and delays disease progression in patients with RMS advantages retained long-term in real-world investigations [67]. Once every one month, natalizumab is administered as an intravenous infusion [67,68] (Table 2).

yeoh | Dimethyl fumarate is recommended for treating RMS, such as clinical syndrome, relapsing-remitting disease, and secondary progressive disease [7,84]. Dimethyl fumarate is generally well tolerated, but some risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy [85]. Most of these individuals were lymphopenic; therefore, lymphopenia should be monitored every 6-12 months [84,86]. Fingolimod was the first oral treatment for RMS to be authorized. It prevents lymphocytes from leaving secondary lymphoid organs, thus preventing the infiltration of autoreactive lymphocytes into the CNS [87]. Fingolimod is well tolerated; however, regular laboratory tests have shown mild side effects. Patients having a baseline absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) of 952/ml on the day following the initial dose were higher likely to develop lymphopenia following fingolimod therapy [87,88]. Also, heart block and bradycardia occur when medication is started; therefore, a six-hour observation period is recommended for all individuals receiving their first dose [87,88]. Ozanimod, a newly licensed selective S1P receptor modulator, demonstrated efficacy and safety

lrry | Teriflunomide inhibits dihydroorotate dehydrogenase, an enzyme involved in pyrimidine production. Teriflunomide suppresses the proliferation of lymphocytes considered autoreactive that have been activated [102]. Teriflunomide can treat MS and prevent brain atrophy [102]. Boxed warnings include warnings of hepatotoxicity and teratogenicity. Headache, diarrhea, nausea, alopecia, and a rise in hepatic alanine transferase are typical side reactions. Cholestyramine may be used to quickly remove teriflunomide if necessary [102]. Glatiramer acetate is the acetate salt of a combination of four amino acid-based polypeptides. Its mode of action may include a favorable adjustment of the ratio of proinflammatory to regulatory cytokines [103]. Glatiramer acetate slightly reduces recurrence rates and some disease severity indicators and is considered an equally effective alternative to interferon in RMS [103,104]. Interferon-ß moderately decreases the rate of recurrence and MRI disease parameters and delays disability buildup [105]. Interferon-ß adverse effects include flu symptoms, subtle laboratory abnormalities, and injection site responses to subcutaneous treatment [105,106] (Table 4).

ba4l | Conclusions
ffx8 | MS is a disease of immune-mediated inflammation that attacks myelinated axons in the CNS, causing different degrees of damage. Lidwina of Schiedam recorded the first MS case. After that, Augustus d'Este spent years writing about how his MS symptoms progressed. Currently, its prevalence and incidents are on the rise across the world. Low levels of vitamin D in the blood, genetics, smoking, and infection have been linked to the development of MS. MS patients may be recognized at an earlier and earlier stage of the condition as diagnostic techniques and criteria advance. Furthermore, as a consequence of advances in our knowledge of the pathophysiology and course of MS, extraordinary progress has been made in its treatment. Introducing extremely effective medications has resulted in near-total control of recurring diseases and localized brain inflammation. However, effective progression treatment remains unfulfilled, as existing drugs provide limited protection against the neurodegenerative aspects of MS. MS is often treated with disease-modifying medications such as fingolimod, siponimod, interferon beta, rituximab, natalizumab, and dimethyl fumarate. These medications are effective but have some side effects. Although studies imply that the long-term course of the disease has improved dramatically with the therapy age, more clinical and real- world evaluations are required to obtain evidence of these medications' long-term effectiveness and safety.
