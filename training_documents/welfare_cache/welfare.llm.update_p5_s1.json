More empirical work, especially with a longitudinal and comparative view, is needed to understand the long-term trends.\n0myz | Comparison of welfare state reforms raises the question of whether there are general patterns in terms of \"convergence\" or \"divergence\". While convergence implies the reforms are moving in the same direction, divergence means that they are moving apart. In this paper, divergence and convergence are terms used to describe the directional relationship of the reforms in the two welfare administrations and of the current delivery systems in the two countries. For a long time, the welfare state literature has largely concentrated on substantive policies rather than pathways of reform and administrative styles. In general, the public management literature has considered prominent patterns of transnational convergence toward New Public Management; though with different types and degrees in adopting New Public Management ideas in welfare administrations. These differences are usually subscribed to variation in the institutional context, e.g. between unitary and federal states; liberal and social-democratic political traditions. It has been suggested that differences in the way national labor markets are governed and in the role of social partners can be explained by institutional legacies and ideological preferences.\nxh3i | Different pathways are also noticed when it comes to how New Public Governance ideas for collaborative, integrated services have influenced reform. A large comparative study distinguishes two reform paths of welfare administrations in Europe: a comprehensive model where case management transcends various policy areas and where services and organizations are merged; and a second, more voluntary model of service\nsyiw | integration with considerable freedom for local decisions and variation. The study points to the relevance of the institutional context to understand these differences, suggesting the first pathway requires a base of highly developed services and a strong public administration (e.g. Germany, Ireland, United Kingdom, and the Basque Country) while in the second type of reform, New Public Governance ideas are embedded in existing institutional frameworks with services less developed and constitutional barriers or limited capacity of public administration (e.g. France, Switzerland, Romania). Although neither Norway nor the Netherlands were part of the study, the authors suggest that Norway would fit the extended New Public Governance variant, while the Netherlands may represent the more voluntary model. So not only patterns of convergence are observed, but also those of significant divergence in reform of welfare administrations.\nkg3t | In this paper, we examine convergence and divergence in two welfare administrations and analyze how New Public Management and New Public Governance can be recognized in reforms over three decades. We compare reforms in two ways: in each country over time and between the two nations. Our longitudinal study evaluates the process and administrative consequences of the New Public Management and New Public Governance reforms that are controversial in theory and still little known in practice.\nlvae | Methods\no9sc | Data for this paper are derived from key studies of both authors in analyzing welfare state reforms in their respective countries between nineteen ninety and twenty twenty.\n121u | The studies mainly use qualitative methods and are based on literature, interviews and documents. To illustrate, in a recent study of regional network governance in the Dutch welfare administration, thirty-seven group interviews with sixty-four managers, professionals and stakeholders were\nzh03 | conducted. In Norway, we drew for recent data on the two thousand nineteen evaluation of the implementation of the white paper \"NAV in a new era\", involving interviews with employees and managers from frontline organizations and regional administrations (ninety-four persons in total). For our studies on welfare governance reform in both countries, we also extensively reviewed public documents, such as government proposals to parliament, reports from public committees, and monitoring and evaluation reports.\n1mvw | Our analytical approach draws on a narrative strategy, in which we sought to construct a detailed story as a way of obtaining an overall understanding of the reform processes in each country over three decades. We used the governance models as described in the theory section to gain an understanding of whether the reform trajectories reflect New Public Management and New Public Governance ideas. The following step in our data analysis was a cross-national comparison of reform ideas in different phases of the reforms and in the current welfare administrations, to identify convergence and/or divergence.\n6d4s | Next, we first analyze the major reforms over the past three decades in both countries and then compare their impact on the current welfare administrations.\nmqah | Growing convergence in reform paths\nxxr8 | Since the nineteen nineties, remarkable changes can be mentioned in both countries. Although there lately is growing convergence in reform (since two thousand eight), significant divergence characterizes the earlier phases. The main shifts over three decades are shown in Table two.\nrl4j | We elaborate on the reform process below.\nvz32 | Norway\nncb0 | In the nineteen nineties, before the NAV reform, the national insurance administration and the public employment service were separate hierarchies; the national insurance administration more a traditional public administration type organization, instructing the local national insurance administration offices, and the public employment service more a New Public Management governed administration.\n8mp0 | Labor market programs were outsourced through a buyer-supplier model, in the expectation that this would allow for easy upscaling and downscaling of services, parallel to the economic situation. Tasks left with the public employment service were assessment and referral to programs. During the same period, efforts were made to transform sheltered workshops into vocational/reintegration service providers. Their services were increasingly subject to competition and tenders.\nxjyk | The NAV reform followed earlier incremental efforts to stimulate local cooperation between the national insurance administration, public employment service and the municipalities. These were hampered by bureaucratic boundaries at the national level, leading parliament to direct the government to propose reform. The first proposal contained only minor changes; it was rejected by parliament and sent back to government, where the new minister argued that a merger at the national level between public employment service and national insurance administration was necessary to achieve cooperation at the local level. So we see here incremental steps leading to an impasse, followed by political pressure for a more radical shift.\nmt0f | Characterizing the Norwegian reform trajectory since two thousand, Breit et al. identify three phases. The first phase two thousand through two thousand seven involves the establishment of the new NAV organization, and experimentation with integrated work forms. The NAV reform included a merger between the two state administrations for National Insurance and Labor Market and municipal welfare services in one-stop local agencies, and the public employment service moved from a buyer-supplier model to integration and some decentralization. With its weight on horizontal coordination and autonomy at the local level, the NAV reform displayed traces of a New Public Governance paradigm that frontline managers during the reform process operationalized in a more integrated office.\nawab | In two thousand eight through two thousand fourteen, a broader reform followed to increase efficiency, e.g. by re-centralization of the national insurance administration, digital standardized work tools for client services and performance indicators and requirements regarding documentation. This second phase involved a roll back and a return to New Public Management ideas, an effort to turn the frontline offices into single purpose organizations for employment services only (preferable",
