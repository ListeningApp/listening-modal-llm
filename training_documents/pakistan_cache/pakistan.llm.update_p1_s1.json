        "content": "```\nqvnu | As of my last knowledge update in September twenty twenty-one, Pakistan has implemented several legal measures to address hate speech and its impact on society. It's important to note that legal frameworks can evolve, so I recommend checking with up-to-date sources to get the most current information. Here are some of the key legal measures that were in place or under consideration:\nkggw | One. Pakistan Penal Code:\nxrd1 | The Pakistan Penal Code contains several provisions that can be used to address hate speech and incitement to violence. Sections one hundred fifty-three A, two hundred ninety-five A, two hundred ninety-eight, and five hundred five deal with offenses related to promoting enmity between different groups on the grounds of religion, race, ethnicity, or language, and deliberate acts intended to outrage religious feelings. These provisions criminalize hate speech that incites violence or promotes hostility. The Pakistan Penal Code has been in place since its enactment in eighteen sixty during British rule. The specific sections related to hate speech, such as Sections one hundred fifty-three A, two hundred ninety-five A, two hundred ninety-eight, and five hundred five, have been part of the code since its inception.\n5746 | Two. Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act twenty sixteen:\n7toz | PECA, enacted in twenty sixteen, includes provisions aimed at regulating online activities and combatting cybercrimes, including hate speech and incitement. Section ten of PECA deals with offenses related to glorification of an offense and hate speech. The Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act was enacted by the Pakistani government on August eleventh, twenty sixteen. It outlines various offenses related to cybercrime, including provisions to address hate speech and online harassment.\nj346 | Three. Anti-Terrorism Act nineteen ninety-seven:\nv8uq | Certain forms of hate speech that incite violence or promote terrorism can also be dealt with under the Anti-Terrorism Act. This law provides mechanisms for identifying and prosecuting individuals or groups that engage in hate speech that is linked to terrorism or extremist activities. The Anti-Terrorism Act was enacted in nineteen ninety-seven as a response to terrorism and extremism. It provides legal mechanisms to combat terrorism-related offenses, which can include hate speech that incites violence or promotes extremism.\nx972 | Four. Defamation Laws:\ncwrw | While defamation laws primarily focus on protecting an individual's reputation, they can also be used to address hate speech that targets an individual or a group based on their characteristics, beliefs, or identity.\n4i0e | Five. Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority:\nh2l3 | PEMRA is responsible for regulating electronic media, including television and radio broadcasts. It has the authority to take action against content that promotes hate speech, violence, or incitement on electronic media platforms. PEMRA was established in two thousand two, and its regulatory role over electronic media, including addressing hate speech on television and radio broadcasts, has been ongoing since its inception.\ndfzb | Six. Cybercrime Reporting Portals:\nu6ty | Government agencies and bodies such as the Federal Investigation Agency provide online portals where citizens can report instances of hate speech and cybercrimes. These platforms allow individuals to report offensive content for investigation and potential legal action.\nawvu | Seven. National Action Plan Against Terrorism:\non9b | The National Action Plan includes provisions for countering hate speech and extremism. While not solely focused on legal measures, it encompasses various strategies to address radicalization and hate speech through education, awareness campaigns, and the promotion of tolerance.\na8ge | It's important to note that the effectiveness of these legal measures can vary based on factors such as enforcement, societal attitudes, and evolving challenges presented by digital communication. In recent years, concerns have been raised about potential misuse of these laws for silencing dissent or curbing freedom of expression. Balancing the need to combat hate speech while preserving democratic values remains a challenge.\n```",
