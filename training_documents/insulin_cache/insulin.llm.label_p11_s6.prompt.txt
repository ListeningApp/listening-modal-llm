You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

mror | Kleinridders et al. (2015) reported that brain/neuron IR knockout (NIRKO) mice, show age-dependent depressive and anxious behaviour due to impaired mitochondrial function and increased DA turnover by MAO, which is normally suppressed by insulin. Insulin receptor knock-out in glial cells, in turn, reduces ATP exocytosis, resulting in decreased purinergic signalling on DA neurons and subsequently anxi- ety- and depressive-like behaviour (Cai et al., 2018a). Mechanistically, a subsequent hyperdopaminergic state within the amygdala is probably responsible for the increase in anxiety observed in insulin-resistant and diabetic rats (Rebolledo-Solleiro et al., 2016). Interestingly, down- regulation of the IR in the hypothalamus can also induce depressive-like behaviour in rodents (Grillo et al., 2014) indicating that insulin signal- ling in the hypothalamus might also affect DA signalling in the midbrain.
zlxc | 4.2. Therapeutic approaches targeting insulin pathways
k0bw | Based on the molecular evidence for the role of (impaired) insulin signalling in the development of depressive and anxious symptoms, these behavioural changes (see Section 3.3.) respond to treatments altering metabolic state and/or DA signalling: In NIRKO-mice depressive and anxious behaviour is reversed by MAO inhibitors (Kleinridders et al., 2015). In STZ-induced diabetes, depressive symptoms were reduced by insulin therapy, with some (but not all) studies indicating the same impact on anxiety (Gupta et al., 2014; Ho et al., 2012b). Furthermore, physical activity and food restriction, as well as the insulin sensitizers rosiglitazone or pioglitazone alleviated depressive-like behaviour in insulin-resistant rodents (Gilak-Dalasm et al., 2021; Para- shar et al., 2018; Shimomura et al., 1990). Despite these promising animal results, the therapeutic link between insulin, DA and depression has hardly been examined in humans. Mansur et al. (2019) demon- strated, that being overweight moderated the association between reduced effort spending (which is DA-dependent) and MDD. Moreover, a single intranasal insulin administration has been shown to improve mood in overweight/obese women <LATEX>\left( n = 1 7 \right)</LATEX> without psychiatric condi- tions (Schneider et al., 2022). Equally, repeated administration of intranasal insulin across eight weeks improved mood in obese <LATEX>\left( n = 1 5 \right)</LATEX> and normal-weight participants without depression <LATEX>\left( n = 1 9 \right)</LATEX> (Benedict et al., 2004; Hallschmid et al., 2008). Furthermore, diabetes and over- weight attenuate the responsiveness to classical antidepressants (Miyata et al., 2003; Rizvi et al., 2014) and adjunctive therapies that enhance insulin sensitivity including both lifestyle (exercise) and dietary inter- vention improve antidepressant treatment response, even if peripheral insulin resistance is not used for treatment stratification (Jeremiah et al., 2020). A similar effect has been reported for adjunctive therapy with

sc5y | insulin sensitizers (Colle et al., 2016; Lin et al., 2015; Rasgon et al., 2010). Moreover, in the state of insulin resistance, different classes of antidepressants show distinct treatment efficacy and suppressing or enhancing effects on blood glucose levels and body weight (Anderson et al., 2002; Srisurapanont et al., 2022) indicating that the choice of antidepressant therapy should be influenced by the metabolic state. However, clinical trials targeting this question are still lacking. Overall, current data regarding the association between antidepressant-specific mechanism-of-action and effects on metabolic state and depressive symptoms, remain inconclusive but imply that SSRIs might have the best anti-depressive effect in the state of insulin resistance and have a beneficial effect on insulin sensitivity (Markowitz et al., 2011; Silva et al., 2012).
0yab | Notably, altered DA signalling is only one potential pathway that links insulin resistance and depression. There are several other factors, that contribute to this bidirectional link including impairments in serotonergic transmission, HPA-axis, neurogenesis, (neuro-)inflamma- tion, opioid-mediated pathways, gut microbiome and gut-brain signal- ling (Carr, 1994; Zou et al., 2020), which are important, but beyond the scope of this review. Nevertheless, these presented findings are collec- tively of high (pre)clinical relevance as they point toward a metabolic subtype of depression, in which increased insulin resistance might function as a state marker. Targeting insulin resistance in depression might serve as an important avenue toward a personalized medicine approach in psychiatry.
w95z | 5. Conclusions
0i1k | Overall, DA signalling in the midbrain and consequently the DA encoded reward behaviour is modulated by insulin signalling. The effect of insulin on DA release, turn-over, and firing rate might seem contra- dictory at first glance, but this is due to the differential effects of insulin on the somato-dendritic spines in the midbrain and the axonal terminals in the striatum. Different rodent models of insulin resistance have pro- vided clear evidence that insulin resistance leads to altered DA signal- ling and impaired reward behaviour. This might represent one critical mechanism in the bidirectional link between insulin resistance and depression. Hence, a detailed molecular understanding of the regulation of DA signalling by insulin will lay the basis for therapeutic advances in the metabolic treatment of depressive disorders.
