You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

sk5m | DISCUSSION
qws8 | Our study provides insights on trends in the SES research field in terms of the terminology used, journals being published in, the type of research, where it is being done and by whom, topics being investigated, and the methods being used. Although a number of reviews (Brandt et al. 2013, Droste et al. 2018, Herrero-Jáuregui et al. 2018, Partelow 2018, Colding and Barthel 2019) exploring
877u | similar issues have recently been published, our analysis takes a particularly broad view, and specifically focuses on the methods used in SES field through a list of method "categories" or typologies, also assessing the extent to which they account for the underlying organizing principles of CAS. Here we discuss five broad conclusions from these results, and their implications for advancing SES research.
rzhj | SES research is growing rapidly, but is still unevenly distributed Similar to other reviews on SES and related fields (Brandt et al. 2013, Herrero-Jáuregui et al. 2018, Colding and Barthel 2019), we note significant increases in SES research over the last three decades, relative to the growth of scientific publications overall (Fig. 2). SES research is clearly spanning the social and natural sciences in terms of the subject fields of the main journals in which this research is being published (Fig. 3). The interdisciplinary journal Ecology and Society has become a dominant outlet, especially in recent years (Fig. 3). Its dominance may be partly attributed to being one of the earliest open access, online-only journals in the SES field. More recently (and not reflected in our results because of the time span analyzed), a number of new journals have been established in the SES field, including People and Nature (British Ecological Society), Ecosystems and People (Taylor & Francis), and One Earth (Cell Press). These provide further evidence of the maturing of the SES field, and potentially broadening the core set of journals publishing SES research. This maturation is perhaps also evident from the analysis of key SES research terms, which reveals a variety of common terms used to describe the interactive relationship between human societies and the natural environment, and appears to currently be consolidating around the terms "nature society relations,""social- ecological," and "socio-ecological" (Fig. 1). Consolidation around key terms and concepts is central to the development of new research fields (Guo et al. 2011).
bfax | SES research is dominated by a few institutions, notably Stockholm University in Sweden, Arizona State University
f2y8 | (USA), Wageningen University (Netherlands) and James Cook University (Australia). The top 20 research institutions conducting SES are all based in the Global North (mirroring the results of Herrero-Jáuregui et al. 2018), but SES being studied are more globally distributed (Fig. 4). Nevertheless, there are still large parts of the Earth where relatively little SES is being undertaken (Fig. 5). These include island regions such as the Caribbean, Indian Ocean Islands, Oceania, and inaccessible regions such as Antarctica. However, several populous regions are also little studied, including Central Africa, East Africa, West Africa, Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa. Several of these regions are undergoing rapid population growth and environmental change, experiencing pressing sustainability issues, and increasingly influencing regional and global changes in nature society relations. Better understanding context-specific SES dynamics in these regions to inform local and regional sustainability-related policies and actions is therefore a priority. Encouragingly, however, some of the places with the most SES research include Southern Africa and Asia, regions that are often not that well represented in environmental and social research more generally (Rodríguez-Pose 2006, Trimble and van Aarde 2012).
o7qm | SES research is dominated by place-based research at local to regional scales
d52l | Our results point to the frequent use and development of new frameworks in SES research. Of all 5098 published papers assessed, 15.18% were framework papers, and only 1.39% were purely theoretical. The bulk (13.79%) proposed frameworks that
qlbb | were applied to place-based systems, which may also suggest that the popularization of the term "social-ecological" systems was probably influenced by explicitly place-based frameworks (Colding and Barthel 2019). Although the high number of framework studies might be an indication that SES research is still in a developmental phase (counter to our earlier point), the strong place-based focus in the development of these frameworks suggests that customizing frameworks for new social-ecological contexts may be a characterizing feature of SES research. Colding and Barthel (2019) assert that many frameworks used in SES research are adaptations of three core frameworks; that of Ostrom (2007, 2009), Folke and Berkes (1998) and Berkes et al. (2003), and the robustness framework (Anderies 2004, 2007). All three of these have an explicit CAS-based underpinning.
nhsg | Although a CAS lens is by no means the only way to conceptualize SES, it has become the most popular (Herrero-Jáuregui et al. 2018, Preiser et al. 2018). Our timeline analysis shows the most significant inflection point in the rise of SES research to lie between 1999 and 2000, which coincides with the establishment of the Resilience Alliance in 1999 (Folke 2006, Parker and Hackett 2012), and the initial publication of their affiliate journal Ecology and Society, which has published more SES research than any other journal (Fig. 3). The Resilience Alliance in particular, and Ecology and Society by association, relies heavily on CAS and resilience as key guiding frameworks (Herrero-Jáuregui et al. 2018, Preiser et al. 2018, Colding and Barthel 2019). Our results thus align with other studies that have highlighted the dominance of a CAS framing in influencing SES research (Herrero-Jáuregui et al. 2018, Preiser et al. 2018). Given the theoretical maturity of CAS (Preiser et al. 2018), we argue that a definition of SES as CAS, as attempted by Preiser et al. (2018), offers a pragmatic step toward a more universal definition of SES, often lamented as missing in the field (Herrero-Jáuregui et al. 2018, Partelow 2018, Colding and Barthel 2019). This is not to say, however, that CAS thinking is sufficient to support SES research, or that it excludes the use and integration of other frameworks.
hy0l | SES research is centered on pressing sustainability issues
4jmz | Key words identified in our study, similar to those found in related reviews (Brandt et al. 2013, Capstick et al. 2015, Droste et al. 2018, Herrero-Jáuregui et al. 2018), emphasize a focus of SES research on pressing sustainability issues such as climate change, biodiversity loss, livelihoods, poverty, policy, land use change, water, and social and environmental justice (Fig. 6). Our change point analysis shows notable inflection points around 1990 and 2000, years that follow calls to address global Earth system changes and move toward "sustainable development of the Biosphere" (Clarke and Munn 1986, Keeble 1988). The smaller upsurge post-2010 can likely be attributed to the integration of SES with broader sustainability initiatives (Herrero-Jáuregui et al. 2018), such as the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the Future Earth initiative and its core research programs such as the Program on Ecosystem Change and Society (PECS), and the Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES).
