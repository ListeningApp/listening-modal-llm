Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

Obtaining the spectrum <LATEX>E _ { n }</LATEX> and <LATEX>p _ { n } \left( x \right)</LATEX> may be complicated by the fact that the actual Schrödinger potential <LATEX>\bar { U }</LATEX> (35) can develop temperature dependent features as the temperature is decreased- see Fig. 15.

The increasing energy gap between the two minima indicates that, for a fixed initial condition, higher order terms in the spectral expansion can become important as the temperature is lowered.

This error is computed by comparing the truncated expansion to the numerical solution of the Fokker-Planck equation. At early times, the error asso- ciated with keeping only two terms is larger than when

ppx4 | 50 terms are kept, as one would expect, the discrepancy being more pronounced at lower temperatures. As the system relaxes, the contribution form the higher order terms decreases and the errors of the two truncations converge, until they are essentially indistinguishable at later times, as expected. This decay of the contribution from the higher eigenvalues occurs faster for the higher temperature, making the two-term truncation more ac- curate earlier. This observation reinforces our inference from the previous paragraph that as temperature is low- ered, higher order terms in the spectral expansion become more important for accurately describing the evolution, at least for a fixed initial condition. Crucially, this offers an explanation for why the the <LATEX>\mathrm { L P A } + \mathrm { W F R }</LATEX> offers poorer agreement as temperature is lowered since it would be ex- pected to most accurately describe circumstance where the lowest order terms in a spectral expansion dominate.
qf11 | The relation between the spectral expansion and the

6zah | range of validity of the effective action's derivative expan- sion is not entirely straightforward however, as it would also depend on the initial condition. The quantification of this relation would be an interesting undertaking which we leave for future work.
4v5o | VIII. SUMMARY
ha9e | Collecting results scattered in the existing literature, we have recalled how Brownian motion can be formally described by a path integral involving a Euclidean Su- persymmetric action and how an effective average ac- tion functional <LATEX>\Gamma \left[ \chi \right]</LATEX> of the average position <LATEX>\chi ,</LATEX> incor- porating the effects of the fluctuating force and encod- ing all statistical properties of the process, can be cal- culated using functional Renormalisation Group (fRG) methods. We emphasised the importance of utilising the underlying symmetries of the problem, paying attention to the boundary terms which are often dropped, and showed how these can correctly incorporate any initial condition and, correspondingly, non-equilibrium evolu- tion. The fRG flow equations were written down for the first two orders of the widely used derivative expansion of the effective action, referred to as the Local Poten- tial Approximation (LPA) and Wavefunction Renormali- sation (WFR). We used a particular type of regulator, the frequency independent Callan-Symanzik regulator, for which the flow equations take on a relatively simple form, and further recalled that obtaining flow equations within the supersymmetric framework is convenient for ensuring compatibility with the Boltzmann equilibrium distribution, something that is not a priori obvious or guaranteed if one starts with the Onsager-Machlup form of the action (30) and considers it a Euclidean <LATEX>N = 1</LATEX> scalar theory in one dimension with the Schrödinger po- tential <LATEX>\bar { U } = \Upsilon / 4 V ^ { \prime \prime } - 1 / 4 \left( V ^ { \prime } \right) ^ { 2 } .</LATEX> We also reviewed how Brownian motion can be solved using a spectral expan- sion method of the Fokker-Planck (F-P) equation in a standard way.
xrnt | The Effective Action (EA) I allows one to derive ef- fective equations of motion (EEOMs) for the average po- sition <LATEX>\chi \left( t \right) \equiv \langle x \left( t \right) \rangle</LATEX> and variance <LATEX>\langle x ^ { 2 } \left( t \right) \rangle</LATEX> in an analogous manner to the classical equations of motion, by taking variational derivatives. We used the LPA and WFR to compute the elements entering the EEOM, for instance the dynamical effective potential. We verified the accu- racy of the equilibrium limit to these equations, further emphasising the physical significance of certain aspects of the effective potential <LATEX>V _ { k = 0 } :</LATEX> namely how the mini- mum of <LATEX>V _ { k = 0 }</LATEX> corresponds to the equilibrium position and its second derivative evaluated at this point to the vari- ance through equation (128). We noted here that while the LPA reproduces these equilibrium quantities, the ac- curacy of covariance's temporal evolution diminished as temperature was lowered.
c8ra | Going beyond equilibrium, we examined how LPA+WFR handle relaxation towards it for the
p1l0 | average position x(t) in potentials such as a polynomial, a doublewell comprised of two LJ type interactions, or a bare x2 plus gaussian bumps. The latter potential clearly demonstrates that the fRG is capable of capturing the effect of the non-trivial local features of this potential. In fact, the fRG could still offer reasonable approximations even in those cases where the Fokker-Planck numerics failed to converge. We have also shown how the fRG can closely match the relaxation of the variance (x2(t)) to its equilibrium value: for both the unequal Lennard-Jones type potential and the x2 plus gaussian bumps, the LPA variance has reasonable accuracy and still cap- tures highly non-trivial behaviour such as the variance overshooting its equilibrium value before settling to it. This is in a system where numerically solving the Fokker-Planck equation failed to provide good results, at least using standard methods. Again, we find that accuracy decreases with decreasing temperature.
1i8b | A clear conclusion that can be drawn from the above investigations is that decreasing the temperature nega- tively impacts the accuracy of using the LPA + WFR derivative expansion for the fRG to describe Brownian motion in the potentials we examined. This appears to correlate with the increasing importance at lower tem- peratures of higher order terms in the spectral expan- sion; indeed, it is expected that the lowest order terms in the derivative expansion (LPA + WFR) are best placed to describe evolution dominated by the lowest non-zero eigenvalues of the Fokker-Planck spectral expansion. It would seem that the derivative expansion of the fRG for studying thermal fluctuations has utility in the range from moderate temperatures (roughly when the classi- cal force is comparable to the noise), up to the very high temperature regime where the small local features of the potential become less relevant.
5sfj | Although our conclusions on the temperature depen- dent relation between the spectral expansion and the derivative expansion of the fRG are suggestive, and rea- sonable given the premise of the latter, a more precise quantitative comparison would be called for and should be addressed in future work. The insights gained from a more detailed, quantitative understanding of the fRG's range of validity when applied to the dynamical studies of thermally driven systems may lead to interesting and im- portant applications. There are also issues relevant to the technicalities of applying the fRG programme and which may lead to better convergence properties. For example, the recent findings of [47, 48] suggest that an appropri- ately optimized regulator, which also excludes the regime w > k from contributing to the flow, can ensure good con- vergence properties and a sizeable radius of convergence. Comparisons with [47, 48] are non-trivial because the su- persymmetry of the Brownian motion problem makes the structure of the flow equations different to that of a sim- ple scalar theory. This is an important question to be resolved however and we hope to return to it in future work.
vk4h | Future work could also examine if higher order approx-

jdfw | imations beyond the WFR offer any advantage, as these might better capture higher order terms in a spectral ex- pansion. One could further investigate an ensemble of initial conditions and try to quantify better the compu- tational time gain the fRG offers. It is worthwhile trying to see if there is a more concrete way to determine a priori which systems will be well described by the fRG before having to compare to numerical simulations or do- ing a spectral expansion analysis. An interesting appli- cation that we didn't touch upon here might be thermal barrier escape, which in this formulation seems to be more akin to tunnelling in the corresponding euclidean quantum mechanics [49-51]; it would indeed be interest- ing to flesh out any analogies, if they exist. Most im- portantly, further understanding the application of fRG techniques to stochastically driven systems may allow ex- tension to systems with more degrees of freedom, such as field theories and/or systems with a large number of particles. Advances in the above directions may lead to progress in theoretically tackling a broad range of physi- cal phenomena with large separation between fundamen- tal timescales of thermal fluctuations and long emergent timescales of macroscopic change, addressing what is now a major barrier for predictive simulations across scien- tific and engineering disciplines including materials sci- ence [52], drug design [53], protein folding [54], and cos- mology.
