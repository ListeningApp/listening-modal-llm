So, at temperature T, the typical wavelength of a free particle of mass m is roughly\n7xmx | square root of three m k T.\nspty | Particles are waves! Their wavelength is shorter when their momentum is bigger. And the warmer they are, the bigger their momentum tends to be. So there should be a formula for the typical wavelength of a warm particle. And here it is! It helps us visualize the world: particles are a bit blurry, with a characteristic wavelength that depends on temperature.\nfosi | We get this formula from a blend of ideas. Classical mechanics says kinetic energy is E equals p squared over two m. Classical statistical mechanics says E equals two k T. Quantum mechanics says X equals h over p. It's pretty optimistic to put these formulas together and see what we get. But the result is approximately correct, though subject to limitations.\ntsuw | We derived E equals k T using classical statistical mechanics. But it's close to correct for a single quantum particle in a big enough box at high enough temperatures. Otherwise quantum effects kick in.\nl0hr | Another problem is that the expected value of E equals two k T and E equals p squared over two m do not imply the expected value of p equals square root of three m k T, even if p here means the magnitude of the momentum vector. The arithmetic mean of a square is not the square of the arithmetic mean! Really the 'root mean square' of p is square root of three m k T. Similarly, even if the root mean square of p is square root of three m k T and quantum mechanically X equals h over p, we cannot conclude that the root mean square of X is h over square root of three m k T. Again, you cannot pass a root mean square through a reciprocal!\n5jk8 | So, our derivation above is dodgy-but it's okay as an order-of-magnitude approximation for a warm enough particle in a big enough box.\n4cms | THE PARTITION FUNCTION AND THE THERMAL WAVELENGTH\niynx | The partition function of a classical free particle of mass m in a one-dimensional box of length L is\nub6m | Z equals integral from negative infinity to infinity integral from negative infinity to infinity the length L e to the power of negative beta p squared over two m\na67b | dp dq over h.\n8ibh | equals L\nelv7 | divided by square root of two pi m divided by beta.\noazo | where\nl85h | Lambda equals h over square root of two m pi.\nhe3v | two pi m.\ny1kq | is called the 'thermal wavelength'.\nclin | Last time we saw that at temperature T, the typical wavelength of a free particle of mass m is roughly\nhiag | h over square root of three m k T equals h y over beta times three m.\nwfg5 | But the partition function of a classical particle of mass m in a box simplifies a lot if we introduce a slightly different distance scale, which people call the thermal wavelength.\nf5sm | Lambda equals h over square root of two pi m k T equals hv over\nyw9n | square root of two pi m k T.\n8u3s | Then the partition function is just the length of the box divided by Lambda. The thermal wavelength Lambda is a bit smaller than X: we have Lambda approximately zero point six nine. But we probably shouldn't worry about this too much, since our calculation of X was so rough. Of course, all these details are worth thinking about. But the thermal wavelength will turn out to be very useful!\nhmg7 | FREE ENERGY AND THE THERMAL WAVELENGTH\np0a7 | In thermal equilibrium, a classical free particle of mass m in a one-dimensional box of length L has free energy\nochb | F equals negative k times T times natural logarithm of\npcum | L divided by h\nbu0s | square root of two pi m over beta.\njr8i | beta.\n7mby | F equals negative k T natural logarithm of\na1ha | where\ngkfg | two pi m over beta.\nv9o7 | A equals h y.\ngq1l | is the thermal wavelength.\n90in | Since the partition function of the classical free particle in a one-dimensional box is\n8zn4 | and free energy is related to the partition function by\nexk3 | F equals negative k times natural logarithm of Z,\ntx5q | we have\nly5j | Expressing this in terms of temperature rather than coolness, we have\nh2rq | F equals negative k T natural logarithm of\n9shl | ENTROPY AND THE THERMAL WAVELENGTH\nrur1 | In thermal equilibrium, a classical free particle of mass m in a one-dimensional box of length L has expected energy\n7ai3 | The expected value of E equals k T.\nxoe3 | and free energy\nldca | F equals negative k T natural logarithm of Lambda L.\npten | where Lambda equals h over square root of two pi m k T is the thermal wavelength.\n2aah | But entropy S is the expected value of E minus F divided by T, so\n5ww2 | S equals k natural logarithm of\n89h3 | Now that we have clean formulas for the expected energy and free energy of the classical free particle in a one-dimensional box, we can get a nice formula for its entropy. This is equivalent to the formula we saw before, but it's easier to understand. It's a sum of two terms:\ntbgj | S equals k times the natural logarithm of Lambda plus two.\nba14 | Let's make sure we understand this! We've seen that for any system in thermal equilibrium, the entropy is the sum of two parts:\n72rs | 1. The free energy part. For the classical particle in a one-dimensional box, this is\nkb97 | S equals k times natural logarithm of L over Lambda.\n1jn0 | divided by\n8q4r | 2. The expected energy part. For the classical particle in a one-dimensional box, this is\ny60y | The expected value of E.\n14cu | equals two k.\nsxgl | The free energy part is always k times the logarithm of the number of accessible states, and for the particle in a one-dimensional box the number of accessible states is L over Lambda. The expected energy part is two k, by the equipartition theorem, because the particle's expected energy depends on one degree of freedom.\nv1id | Let us think a bit more about why the number of accessible states is L over Lambda. The most rigorous approach is simply to compute the number of accessible states that is,\nospk | the partition function:\nayzb | Z equals\nyid2 | equals L times\n0tro | equals L divided by h times square root of two pi m over beta.\nfkdd | equals L divided by Lambda.\negd7 | A more hand-wavy approach is to imagine the space of states of the particle, meaning the space of position-momentum pairs (q, p) inside the range zero to L times R. When it comes to counting accessible states, each region of area h holds one state. The 'accessible' states are those where the energy is not too big compared to k T, so the probability density e to the power of negative E divided by k T is fairly large. This is a bit vague, as it must be, because 'accessibility' is not really a yes-or-no matter. But let's just pretend it is, and demand E is less than or equal to k T. Then the 'accessible' region of state space is where p squared over two m is less than or equal to k T, or\num9s | p is less than or equal to square root of two m k T over beta.\nit25 | This region is\n3mfz | the set of all (q, p) such that zero is less than or equal to q is less than or equal to L, and negative square root of two m k T over beta is less than or equal to p is less than or equal to square root of two m k T over beta.\n0vyw | It has area L times two times square root of m k T over beta, so the number of states it holds is this divided by h, or\nrf9l | two L\nhycc | square root of two m over h beta.\nl8ni | This is just thirteen percent more than the exact value of Z. More importantly, I hope this calculation gives you a mental picture of number of accessible states for the particle in a one-dimensional box. A mental picture can be helpful even if it's oversimplified. I like to imagine counting the little rectangles of area h that can fit into the 'accessible' region of state space.\nipcw | In fact, this idea is related to Bohr and Sommerfeld's early approach to quantum physics, the 'old quantum theory', which was later subsumed by the theory of 'geometric quantization'. In Bohr and Sommerfeld's approach, when we quantize a classical system with one position and one momentum degree of freedom, there should be approximately one quantum state for each region of area h in the qp plane. More generally, when we quantize a classical system with n position and n momentum degrees of freedom, there should be approximately one quantum state for each region R inside R to the power of two n with\nadu9 | the integral over R of dp dq is equal to h to the power of n.\npq8y | So, delving into more quantum mechanics, and geometric quantization, would shed more light on the calculations we're doing now.\n8fpu | PARTICLE IN A three D BOX: PARTITION FUNCTION\n```",
