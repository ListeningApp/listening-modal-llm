You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

337o | 9. You are working with a 10-year-old girl who loves and excels at many sports. She has academic difficulties related to dyslexia and attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder. You have noticed that when anyone gives her an assignment that is slightly more challenging than what she is used to, she reacts immediately by not even looking at it, and instead says she doesn't get it. At the same time, if she discovers an even more challenging as- signment on her own, she often completes it without errors. It is clear to you that the client is capable of doing the slightly upgraded assignments that you are recommending, but she gives up before even attempting them. Today is not different than any other day. When you present the client with a slightly more advanced assignment that you know she is capable of completing, she quickly claims she does not understand it. Please rank-order each response according to the following scale:
cuth | a. Assume a clear leadership role by providing the client with information, struc- ture, guidance, or constructive feedback (e.g., give the client feedback that you have noticed that she completes more challenging assignments that she gives herself, but when given assignments by others, she says she does not understand it before she even reads the directions and considers how she might complete it).
09z2 | b. Normalize the client's experience or connect her with social or physical re- sources that will enable her to have equal access and opportunities (e.g., tell the client that it is normal for people to say that they can't do something when they are feeling challenged; provide her with self-advocacy language so that she can tell others what she needs when she is given more challenging assignments).
13fv | c. Provide the client with hope or positive feedback and generally show a positive attitude or emotions (e.g., remind the client how well she did on a similar as- signment the previous week; tell her you know she can do it).
v5pj | d. Give the client total and complete control over the situation (e.g., invite the client to share what she thinks would be most helpful the next time she is given something new to work on).
trab | A scoring key and interpretation map for this assessment are presented on the following pages. So that you will have a better understanding of the strengths and limitations of each mode, it is recommended that you read this chapter before scoring your self-assessment.
grxs | Scoring for Exercise 4.1: Determining Your Therapeutic Style
u9dn | To determine your therapeutic style (i.e., the modes you are more or less inclined to use), you should first record your responses to the Self-Assessment of Modes Question- naire, Version III, on the Modes Scoring Key by circling the response you chose for each question. Then, add up the number of times you chose responses corresponding to each mode and record them at the bottom of each column. The total possible number of responses for each mode is 6. You may calculate your percentage score for each mode by dividing the total number of actual responses for each mode by the total number of response possibilities (6) and then multiplying by 100. The higher your score for each mode, the more comfortable you may feel with using the mode.
t25w | You may plot your profile on the Therapeutic Style Form by darkening each area in the arrows that fall inside the concentric circle that corresponds to your mode scores. This will provide a visual representation of the therapeutic style you are most likely to use during therapy.

ghbe | Examining Your Therapeutic Style
1lkf | The Therapeutic Style Form indicates the relative amount of comfort you have with each mode. In the end, however, you should reflect on and plan your own therapeutic style. A good beginning is to think about:
uobn | Your natural modes and their strengths and cautions
3194 | The modes you want to incorporate into your therapeutic style (including the modes with which you may wish to become more comfortable and proficient)
r22o | Your Natural Modes and Their Strengths and Cautions
nupw | By examining your Therapeutic Style Form and reflecting on the descriptions of the modes provided in this chapter, you should first decide for yourself the extent to which you are comfortable with each mode. To facilitate this process, you can use the following table to think carefully about the six modes and decide your degree of comfort with each of them.
37xs | Next, go back and review Table 4.1, looking at the potential strengths of your preferred mode(s). Each person uses a given mode in different ways, so the actual strengths of your use of a mode depend on how you typically use it. So, reflecting on the particular way that you use your preferred mode(s), list five key strengths of your therapeutic style.
hoi0 | Exercise 4.3
tffb | Modes You Want to Incorporate Into Your Therapeutic Style
ewwt | Now, examine the strengths of the modes that are not your preferred modes (either those you listed as "Mode(s) I can use when I need to" or "Mode(s) with which I am less comfortable/less able to use"). Consider whether the strengths of these modes are a good counterbalance to the liabilities of your preferred modes. Based on this consideration, identify the mode(s) you wish to use more naturally and regularly. Record them here.
2tj1 | If the mode(s) you wish to incorporate into your therapeutic style fall in the category of "Mode(s) I can use when I need to," you may wish to make plans for the situations in which you want to practice these modes and monitor your use of them. Record your thoughts here.
nbhq | If the mode(s) you wish to incorporate into your therapeutic style fall in the category of "Mode(s) with which I am less comfortable/less able to use," you may wish to seek supervision, training, or other kinds of support that would help you develop the ability and comfort with using that mode.
