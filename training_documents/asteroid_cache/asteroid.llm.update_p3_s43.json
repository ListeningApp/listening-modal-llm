        "content": "nhsg | Agoult is a monomict unbrecciated basaltic eucrite that was found in Morocco in two thousand. It is composed of fine-grained granulitic textures with one hundred twenty degree triple junctions, indicating significant recrystallization. Its pyroxenes are chemically well equilibrated between homogeneous low-calcium pyroxene and augite. The trace element patterns of this meteorite are similar to those of the Main Group-Nuevo Laredo trend eucrites, even though Agoult is thought to have undergone partial melting during thermal metamorphism. Both Uranium-Lead and Potassium-Argon systems in Agoult have preserved ancient thermal processes. The two hundred seven Lead-two hundred six Lead isochron ages of zircons and oxides in Agoult are dated at four thousand five hundred fifty-four point five plus minus two point zero million years and four thousand five hundred thirty-two point two nine plus minus zero point eight seven million years, respectively. Its plagioclase presents a young forty Argon-thirty nine Argon plateau age at four thousand four hundred ninety-four plus minus nine million years. Such chronological variations may be associated with slow cooling.\nhy0l | Iizuka et al. estimated the cooling rate of the Agoult host rock at eleven plus minus two degrees Celsius per million years after thermal metamorphism at four thousand five hundred fifty-four point five million years.\n4jmz | Two point five. Ibitira\nb7cq | Ibitira was found in Brazil in nineteen fifty-seven. The mineralogical and chemical features of Ibitira are indistinguishable from those of recrystallized basaltic eucrites. However, its several unique features, such as vesicle-rich textures and alkali element depletions, suggest that Ibitira came from a parent body other than Vesta. The oxygen three-isotopic composition of Ibitira is reported to be delta seventeen O equals negative zero point zero seven, significantly higher than the known eucrite fractionation line. The pyroxenes in Ibitira were thermally well equilibrated, suggesting a metamorphic grade of five. Similar to Agoult, the chronologies of Ibitira indicate ancient processes. Short-lived Manganese-Chromium systems have indicated an age of four thousand five hundred fifty-six point three million years. Its identical pyroxene age has been precisely determined at four thousand five hundred fifty-six point seven five plus minus zero point five seven million years. Its forty Argon-thirty nine Argon age has been reported at four thousand four hundred eighty-seven plus minus fifteen million years, which overlaps the ages of some unbrecciated eucrites.\n0b39 | Three. Methods: NanoSIMS Uranium-Lead dating\nqecd | Polished thick sections of the five meteorites were carbon-coated and observed using SEM-EDS and EPMA to locate apatite and/or merrillite minerals with analyzable grain sizes greater than or equal to ten micrometers and study their petrological features. After NanoSIMS dating, the major element compositions of these phosphates were analyzed using a JXA-eight five three zero F at the Department of Earth and Planetary Science, University of Tokyo, Japan. The mineral phases of adjacent silica minerals were also observed following the NanoSIMS analyses using a Raman spectrometer JASCO NRS-one thousand at the National Institute of Polar Research, Japan. The detailed conditions and results of the observational studies are described in the supplementary information.\n1o7p | All samples were slightly re-polished less than approximately zero point three micrometers after the initial SEM-EDS observations and then gold coated and baked at approximately one hundred degrees Celsius in the NanoSIMS air-lock system prior to the isotopic",
