You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

afyn | 6.4. Use of EBFs or links in Reinforced Concrete Structures
8sye | Providing a thorough review of this topic is out of the scope of this study; however, the main applications of EBF configurations in reinforced concrete (RC) structures are mentioned here for the sake of completeness. Steel eccentric braces with or without vertical links can be connected to existing RC frames for seismic rehabilitation. This concept was numerically and experimentally studied by Bouadi and Engelhardt [219], Ghobarah and Abou Elfath [220], Bouwkamp et al. [221], Perera et al. [222], D'Aniello [223], Mazzolani et al. [224], Pina et al. [225], Durucan and Dicleli [226], Özel and Güneyisi [227], Varum et al. [228], and Wang and Yu [229] in the past few decades. Steel links are also utilized as energy dissipating coupling beams between adjacent RC wall piers in hybrid coupled wall (HCW) systems. A comprehensive review of the research on the behavior, analysis, and design of these systems as well as particular topics such as link-to-wall connections can be found in El-Tawil et al. [230].
r04h | 6.5. Progressive Collapse of EBFs
orpr | In 2009, the gravity-induced progressive collapse of EBFs was studied by Khandelwal et al. [108] utilizing validated numerical analyses. To this end, the alternate path method (APM) was used, i.e. critical columns and adjacent braces were instantaneously removed from a ten-story EBF, properly designed based on the U.S. specifications [69, 231] for high seismic risk. The limited numerical results demonstrated that EBFs are less vulnerable to progressive collapse compared to special CBFs, mainly because of their improved system layout. The beneficial effect of locating EBFs at the perimeter of the structure was also noted.
k36m | 6.6. Fragility Functions for Links
wnuz | The damage states and fragility functions for EBF links were developed recently by Gulec et al. [232]. Based on a precise evaluation of the test data of 82 links (reported previously in the literature) a
sy14 | total of 9 damage states, such as web yielding, flange local buckling, flange fracture, damage to concrete slab, etc., were indicated. Furthermore, the methods of repair (MoR) were categorized into 4 groups (i.e. cosmetic repair, concrete replacement, heat straightening, and link replacement) and each damage state was related to a certain MoR. Fragility functions were also developed for short and long links based on statistical analyses to specify the probability that a specific MoR will be required as a function of Yp.
ghss | 6.7. Other Applications
3s61 | In a number of studies by Bruneau and his colleagues [233-237], the concept of EBFs with horizontal or vertical links has been used in steel bridge superstructures in order to introduce energy dissipation in end-diaphragms instead of the common approach which relies on the energy dissipation of the substructure. This can be fruitful for instance in cases where stable and ductile behavior of the substructure is doubtful. Results of the extensive numerical and experimental studies as well as design procedures are presented by these researchers.
s3rm | The applicability of stainless steel in EBFs was studied by DiSarno et al. [238] in 2008. The results of nonlinear pushover and time-history analyses of a sample structure revealed that using members made from stainless steel can enhance the energy dissipation and structural overstrength of the system compared to regular EBFs while reducing the roof drift and the probability of local buckling in members.
pqxb | In addition to EBFs, HCWs, and bridges, the concept of dissipative link segments has also been utilized in other structural systems. For instance, Moghaddasi B. and Zhang [118] studied the seismic behavior of diagrid structural frames with replaceable shear links, in 2013. In another recent study, the concept of linked column frames (LCF) was proposed and numerically studied by Malakoutian et al. [116]. The use of buckling-restrained braces (BRB) in eccentric configuration was studied by Prinz and Richards [239, 240]. The energy dissipation mechanism in this system is however substantially different from that of EBFs since yielding is concentrated in the braces rather than in the links.
08qc | 7. Summary and Future Research Needs
hdj2 | A comprehensive review of the research conducted on the behavior and design of eccentrically braced frames has been presented in this study which has covered both component level and system level responses. Experimental and numerical studies that address the main characteristics of links as well as link detailing have been presented. Different numerical techniques for link modeling have also been discussed. Furthermore, studies which focused on the seismic behavior and design of EBF systems have been summarized with an emphasis on the capacity design approach. Finally, the special applications of EBF systems or link segments have been discussed. For the improvement of EBF design and applications, the following items have been identified in the course of this review study as important research needs:
a57g | · Further research on the behavior of very short links (p < 1) is required in order to take advantage of their excessive inelastic rotation capacity in EBF systems. In contrast, considering the doubtful performance of very long links (p > 3~3.5) reported in some numerical studies, additional research for identifying their deficiencies and limitations would appear to be beneficial.
g8m3 | · The use of a single link overstrength factor (§2) for all link length ratios in the EBF design process can lead to significant underestimations of internal forces developed in other members due to the yielded and strain hardened links, especially when very short links are utilized. Thus, further research is needed to develop simple methods for estimating the actual link overstrength factor for different link length ratios considering the effects of moment-shear interaction, link flange shear resistance, axial restraint provided by the adjacent members, and excessive cyclic hardening. A similar concern is also valid for the case of built-up tubular links. Furthermore, the unusually high overstrengths (of the order of 5.0) which have been reported recently for some unstiffened very short links also need further attention.
a9av | . There is a substantial research need for investigating the effect of high axial load on the behavior of intermediate and long links. In addition, the effect of tensile axial force on increasing the link overstrength requires further attention, as mentioned in a number of recent studies.
73l3 | · The increase in the link overstrength due to the presence of a concrete slab has not been adequately investigated. This effect can be hazardous particularly from the capacity design point of view. Methods for estimating this increase are required which can be conveniently applied in practice.
ornm | · Additional investigation is required to validate whether the recent relaxation in the flange slenderness requirements of shear links by the AISC Seismic Provisions [3] can also be considered for shear links subject to high axial loads.
u2z1 | · Several issues have recently been reported for the spacing requirements of links per AISC 341-10 [3] which need further consideration. Research is required to investigate the possibility of any relaxation in the stiffener spacing requirements of I-shaped shear links. On the contrary, the observed poor performance of some intermediate links, which is attributed mostly to their stiffener spacing requirements, should be studied carefully to come up with appropriate solutions.
atmh | · Many novel web stiffening details for reducing the probability of premature fracture and improving the link rotation capacity including, but not restricted to, the sandwich, horizontal stiffener, and diagonal stiffeners details have been proposed which require further research. In addition, the feasibility of other approaches, such as links without intermediate stiffeners, should be studied. Furthermore, if approved, the development of design guidelines for employing these details is essential.
