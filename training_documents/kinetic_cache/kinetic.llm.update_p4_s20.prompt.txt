You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

u8nw | were originally derived for ET reactions, they can be extended to concerted PCET reactions. The BV model assumes a linear free energy relationship, where the ET free energy barrier is proportional to the ET driving force,24 and can be generalized to concerted PCET reactions by replacing the redox potential with the proton-coupled redox potential in the expressions. Moreover, we have shown that the MG theory can be extended to describe concerted PCET reactions within the framework of our vibronically nonadiabatic PCET theory19,36 by including the transitions between all reactant and product vibronic states. Figure 2b shows the potential-dependent kad and kopp as functions of pH at a given electrode potential. The oxidation apparent rate constant has a slope of 90%." = 1, whereas the reduction apparent rate constant has a slope of 0.63, which is less than unity, indicating that the reduction reaction has a weaker pH dependence. In general, both reduction and oxidation reactions can exhibit weak pH dependence in this model. A detailed analysis of this figure is provided in the SI.
l2v9 | There are also multiple ways to define a potential- independent rate constant. The standard rate constant ks is defined as the rate constant when E = Eº.24,25 At this potential, the reaction free energy AG = F(E - Eº) = 0 so kRed = kox= ks. Alternatively, if the reaction rate constant saturates at very negative or positive potentials, maximum rate constants kmax for reduction and oxidation can be defined at E -> ± 00 24, 32-35 Similarly, we can define the potential-independent apparent standard rate constant and apparent maximum rate constants as
afbe | Ks,app = kapp (Eapp) = k, .Ox Px(Eapp) (11a)
78r8 | = k Red( Kapp (E -> -0) (11b)
320g | (11c)
tp8g | Here, Eapp is the apparent standard potential defined in eq 4. In practice, kmax,app can also be defined at the experimental potential limits. The apparent standard or maximum rate constants can then be obtained by substituting the expressions for kRed(E) and ko (E) into Equations 9a and 9b and setting E = Eapp or ±00. The general expressions for ks,app and Kmax,app provided in the Supporting Information. For the BV and MG kinetic models, the results are presented in Table 1. Representative illustrations of these cases are shown in Figure 2c,d, and detailed analyses are provided in the SI.
gxfd | To conclude this section, we summarize the expressions for the apparent rate constants for both homogeneous and electrochemical PCET reactions in Table 1. Note that these equations are not limited to the four-channel case shown in Figure 1. Certain channels can be shut down by excluding the corresponding form of Ox; and Red; or setting certain k; = 0. For example, if we exclude all concerted pathways in Figure 1 and apply the equation for BV kinetics ksapp? s,app, this model is reduced to Laviron's model, and we obtain the same expression for the apparent standard rate constant (see the SI). More generally, other channels could be added, such as concerted pathways with buffer as the proton donor or acceptor, and the assumption of equilibrium for PT and complex formation could be removed, leading to more complex kinetic equations.

jkp9 | ■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
z8tt | We applied our model to an electrochemical PCET reaction, namely, PCET to a Ru-based water oxidation catalyst37-44 attached to an ITO surface. As discussed above, the apparent rate constant of an electrochemical PCET reaction is not only pH-dependent but also potential-dependent. Kessinger et al. studied the interfacial ET and PCET reactions in a Ru-based water oxidation catalyst, <LATEX>\left[ \mathrm { R u } ^ { \mathrm { I I } } \left( \mathrm { t p y } \right) \left( b p \mathrm { y } \right) \left( \mathrm { H } _ { 2 } O \right) \right] ^ { 2 + } ,</LATEX> <LATEX>\mathrm { R u } ^ { \mathrm { I I } }</LATEX> -OH2, <LATEX>\left( t p y = 2 , 2 ^ { \prime } : 6 ^ { \prime } , 2 ^ { \prime \prime } \right. ,</LATEX> bpy= 2,2'-bipyridine), attached to ITO.19 Photoexcitation of <LATEX>\widetilde { \mathrm { R u } } ^ { \mathrm { I I } } - \mathrm { O H } _ { 2 }</LATEX> results in rapid electron transfer to the ITO electrode, producing <LATEX>\mathrm { R u } ^ { \mathrm { I I I } }</LATEX> -OH2/OH with a protonation state that is dependent on the solution pH. The resulting back electron transfer reaction from ITO to <LATEX>\mathrm { R u } ^ { \mathrm { I I I } } - O \mathrm { H } _ { 2 } / \widetilde { O H } ^ { - }</LATEX> that regenerates <LATEX>R u ^ { I I } - O H _ { 2 }</LATEX> therefore occurs via an ET and/or a PCET pathway. This reduction reaction was monitored using transient absorption spectroscopy by measuring the recovery of the metal-to-ligand charge-transfer (MLCT) absorption peak of
