You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

v3lu | Summary
ogxy | In this chapter, you learned how to use Quick Filters and Dashboard Actions not only to provide greater interactivity for users, but also to provide an efficient user experience. You also learned how to create parameters to filter single and multiple data sources, as well as to govern the visualizations that appear on a dashboard. You studied the implications in dashboard performance when using different methods of filtering, all of which will give your dashboard users a greater control over the data points that they choose to explore. It will also create a more personal, relevant, and compelling data story.
7i6d | In the next chapter, we will discuss publishing your work, which is the last step to creating and distributing your work in Tableau Public.
w7sa | Publishing Your Work
y91y | Publishing your work on the Cloud with Tableau Public is the core of the application's value proposition, and with Tableau Public 9.0, it's easy to save and share your work. There's more to publishing than just locating a file on a web server. Publishing your work and managing your author and workbook profiles is the best way of helping people browse through your visualizations to create more personal connections with your data story. When people are personally connected and relate to you and your work as a human, they are more likely to share it.
53a1 | In this section, we'll discuss the following topics:
p032 | · Saving your work and logging in to Tableau Public
5ts2 | . Opening your work from the Cloud on your computer
gomt | · Managing your profile
ni7z | · Viewing your work online
p68u | · Sharing your work with others
kxq9 | · Managing workbook details
6aag | Saving your work and logging in to Tableau Public
luhe | Since Tableau Public does not have autosave, we recommend that you save to the Cloud frequently.
bhf8 | Publishing Your Work
ue9y | In the File menu, you can save your work by clicking on the Save to Tableau Public ... option, which is present halfway down the list. Alternatively, you can use the same shortcut keys that other applications use (Ctrl + S):
u01l | Once you opt to save your work, you will need to sign in to Tableau Public. Use the same credentials that you used to download Tableau Public initially, as shown in the following screenshot:
7fuj | Once you have signed in successfully, you can save your work on the Cloud with a name of your choice.
9j6k | Chapter 9
azkg | Giving your analysis a good name is critical. First, it's the title that other people will see when they look at your profile on Tableau Public. Also, the name of the workbook and individual dashboards are a part of the URL of the file. It's important not to include special characters, such as ampersands, question marks, and periods, because they can disrupt the format of the URL. It's fine to include numbers though. You can name your workbook as shown in following screenshot:
tkwl | If you want to replace an existing file with the one that you have opened now, you can perform the following steps:
o4qt | 1. Select Save to Tableau Public As ... from the File menu.
a0vw | 2. From the dropdown list of the existing files, select the file that you want to overwrite.
y259 | 3. Click on Save.
xueh | Opening work from the Cloud
9v46 | If you'd like to make changes to your work, you need to perform the following steps:
rqly | 1. Open Tableau Public on your computer.
73dx | 2. Navigate to the Tableau Public home screen.
npd9 | 3. Click on the orange Open from Tableau Public link on the upper-right corner.
qn13 | 4. Log in with the credentials that you used to create your account, which was covered previously in this chapter.

vkyq | In order to view your work on the Internet, you need to go to Tableau Public's website and log in. From there, you can share your work with others, download it, promote it on social media, and also delete it, should the need arise.
ka4r | 1. On your Internet browser, go to http://public.tableau.com.
ar1t | 2. In the upper-right corner, click on SIGN IN, as shown in the following screenshot:
nopx | 3. Enter the credentials that you used to create your account.
93e7 | Chapter 9
ko9u | The destination page that you reach when you login is your profile page. This is where all the dashboards that you created are organized. It is also a great place for you to add information about yourself. You can add links to your Twitter and LinkedIn accounts as well as the blogs or corporate websites that you would like to promote. (It's important to make sure that you have the permission before presenting URLs of organizations of which you're not an associate).
b56g | My profile is shown in the following screenshot:
i59k | You can change settings related to specific workbooks by hovering over them. As your catalogue of work grows, you should curate it by being selective about which visualizations are featured.
j690 | When you roll over any of the thumbnails for a specific visualization, you can do several things; the following are a few of these things:
fm81 | 1. First, on the upper right-hand side, select MAKE FEATURED to make it the featured visualization, which will move it to the upper-most left spot on your profile.
lspi | 2. On the upper right-hand side, you can change the visibility settings.

7383 | notes. This does not prevent people from searching for your visualization, and you also cannot control the permissions regarding who can see it.
wqqd | 3. On the lower right-hand side, you can delete workbooks. This is a good idea in case you would like to delete the earlier iterations of a finished product, but keep in mind that you don't have the file saved on your computer. So, be judicious when using the Delete button.
fjn8 | 4. On the lower right-hand side, you will see the workbook name and the number of views that it has.
hfnl | 1
pndl | A view is each visit to the page by a browser. So, if you go to the workbook five times a day, that's five views. Note that this is not the number of unique visitors.
jd7k | 5. Then, above the workbook name, you can download the workbook.
m8zb | 6. At the center, you have the View option in case you wish to view the workbook, as shown in the following screenshot:
