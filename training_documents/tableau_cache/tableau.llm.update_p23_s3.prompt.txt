You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

mqu9 | As humans, we relate our experiences to each other in stories, and data points are an important component of stories. They quantify phenomena and, when combined with human actions and emotions, can make them more memorable. When authors create public interest story elements with Tableau Public, readers can interact with the analysis, which creates a highly personal experience and translates into increased participation and decreased abandonment. It's not difficult to embed Tableau Public visualizations into websites and blogs. It is as easy as copying and pasting the JavaScript that Tableau Public automatically renders for you.
i0lj | Using Tableau Public increases accessibility to stories too. You can view data stories on any mobile device with a web browser and then share it with friends via social media sites such as Twitter or Facebook using Tableau Public's sharing functionality. Stories can be told with text as well as popular and tried-and-true visualization types such as maps, bar charts, lists, heat maps, line charts, and scatterplots. Maps are particularly easier to build in Tableau Public than most other data visualization offerings because Tableau has integrated geocoding (down to the city and postal code) directly into the application. Tableau Public has a built-in date hierarchy that makes it easy for users to drill through time dimensions just by clicking on a button. One of Tableau Software's taglines, Data to the People, is a reflection not only of the ability to distribute analyses sets to thousands of people at once, but also of the enhanced abilities of nontechnical users to explore their own data easily and derive relevant insights for their own community without having to learn a slew of technical skills.
fdab | Telling your story with Tableau Public
07he | The Tableau Software was originally imagined in the Stanford University Computer Science department, where a research project sponsored by the U.S. Department of Defense was launched to study how people can rapidly analyze data. This project merged two branches of computer science - the understanding of data relationships and computer graphics. This mash-up was discovered to be the best way for people to understand and sometimes digest complex data relationships rapidly and, in effect, help readers consume data. This project eventually moved from the Stanford campus to the corporate world, and Tableau Software was born. The usage and adoption of Tableau has since skyrocketed. At the time of writing this book, Tableau is the fastest growing software company in the world and now, Tableau competes directly with older software manufacturers for data visualization and discovery, such as Microsoft, IBM, SAS, Qlik, and Tibco, to name a few.

jw4n | Tableau Software's flagship program, Tableau Desktop, is a commercial software used by many organizations and corporations throughout the world. Tableau Public is the free version of Tableau's offering, and it is typically used with nonconfidential data either from the public domain or the one that we collected ourselves. This free public offering of Tableau Public is truly unique in the business intelligence and data discovery industry. There is no other software like it - powerful, free, and open to data story authors.
9qfg | There are a few terms in this book that might be new to you. You, as an author, will load your data into a workbook, which will be saved into the Tableau Public Cloud.
ssph | A visualization is a single graph. It, typically present on a worksheet. One or more visualizations can be on a dashboard, which is where your users will interact with your data.
dves | One of the wonderful features about Tableau Public is that you can load data and visualize it on your own. Traditionally, this has been an activity that was undertaken with the help of programmers at work. With Tableau Public and new blogging platforms, nonprogrammers can develop data visualization, publish to the Tableau Public website, and embed the data visualization on their own website. The basic steps to create a Tableau Public visualization are as follows:
3d6a | . Gather your data sources, usually in a spreadsheet or a . csv file
li84 | · Prepare and format your data to make it usable in Tableau Public
y06n | · Connect to the data and start building data visualizations (charts, graphs, and other objects)
sipr | . Save and publish the data visualization to the Tableau Public website
yuxx | . Embed your data visualization in your web page by using the code that Tableau Public provides
dbah | Tableau Public is used by some of the leading news organizations across the world, including The New York Times, The Guardian (UK), National Geographic (US), the Washington Post (US), the Boston Globe (US), La Informacion (Spain), and Época (Brazil). In the following sections, we will discuss installing Tableau Public. Then, we will take a look at how we can find some of these visualizations out there in the wild so that we can learn from others and create our own original visualizations.
