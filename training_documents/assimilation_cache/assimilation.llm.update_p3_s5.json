        "content": "gipz | This function reaches its minimum at X sub two star equals left parenthesis Y sub two plus alpha Y sub three right parenthesis divided by left parenthesis one plus alpha squared right parenthesis, so X sub two star is the reanalysis value of X sub two. The corresponding filtering value of X sub three is X sub three star equals alpha X sub two star, the forecast value of X sub four is X sub four star equals alpha X sub three star equals alpha squared X sub two star, and the reanalysis value of X sub one is X sub one star equals alpha to the power of negative one X sub two star. We obtain the same values if we use the process model relation X sub three equals alpha X sub two to eliminate X sub two from the cost function twenty point three and minimize with respect to\nb4wj | X sub three. These solutions do not give any uncertainty estimates confidence sets for the reanalysis and filtering values. In this case, such estimates can be inferred from the data model twenty point two and the explicit form of the solution. However, in the general case, the reanalysis and filtering values are obtained numerically and uncertainty estimates are not immediately available. If the process error terms five do not vanish, the cost function must be extended with additional terms. We refer the reader to for a more detailed discussion of the variational approach and its relation to the probabilistic approaches discussed in the next sections.\n5xlt | Twenty point two point two. Maximum Likelihood Approach\n9bz4 | Next we demonstrate a maximum likelihood approach to the same example. Assume that the process error variables Xi sub j are random and have standard normal distributions. Assume for the moment that X sub one has a fixed but unknown value X sub one, which we wish to estimate from the observations Y sub two and Y sub three. This is therefore a reanalysis problem. Probability theory shows that\nyfv2 | Y sub two is distributed as N left parenthesis alpha X sub one, one plus tau squared right parenthesis, Y sub three is distributed as N left parenthesis alpha squared X sub one, one plus tau squared plus alpha squared right parenthesis, cov Y sub two, Y sub three equals alpha. The joint distribution of left parenthesis Y sub two, Y sub three right parenthesis is Gaussian with density\npujl | f sub Y sub two, Y sub three left parenthesis Y sub two, Y sub three right parenthesis proportional to exp left parenthesis negative one divided by two left parenthesis Y sub two minus alpha X sub one, Y sub three minus alpha squared X sub one right parenthesis Sigma to the power of negative one left parenthesis Y sub two minus alpha X sub one, Y sub three minus alpha squared X sub one right parenthesis transpose, twenty point five\n3rqe | where Sigma is the covariance matrix,\nnsi3 | Sigma equals left parenthesis one plus tau squared, alpha, alpha, one plus tau squared plus alpha squared right parenthesis. The proportionality constant implied in Equation twenty point five does not depend on the unknown parameter X sub one. If Y sub two and Y sub three are actual observational data, the maximization of the expression on the right-hand side of Equation twenty point five leads to the maximum likelihood estimate\nnil3 | X hat sub one equals alpha left parenthesis one plus tau squared right parenthesis Y sub two plus alpha squared tau squared Y sub three divided by alpha squared plus alpha squared tau squared plus tau to the power of four, twenty point six\n68a1 | The reanalysis estimate X hat sub one is a linear combination of the observations Y sub two and Y sub three. If zero less than alpha less than one, Y sub two has the larger weight. If, furthermore, the observation errors Zeta sub i have very small standard deviations left parenthesis tau much less than one right parenthesis, the weight for Y sub three is very small, so the reanalysis estimate depends mainly on the observation that was made right after the unknown state. One can show that the expectation of X hat sub one equals X sub one, so the estimate is unbiased, and it is not hard to show that X hat sub one has a normal distribution and to find its variance.\nseik | Approaches to estimating X sub two reanalysis and X sub three filtering from observations using the maximum likelihood method are discussed in the exercises. We next introduce a general Bayesian approach to data assimilation and then return to this example.\noq7c | Twenty point three - Bayesian Approach\nz4mi | Chapter twenty. Data Assimilation",
