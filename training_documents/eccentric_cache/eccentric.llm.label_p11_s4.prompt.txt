  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

ylhz | 2.5. Effect of Loading History
a3td | Popov and his colleagues (e.g. [6, 18]) noticed that the applied loading history (or protocol) during an experimental study has a major effect on the observed plastic rotation capacity of EBF links. A comprehensive study on this effect was, however, conducted recently by Richards and Uang [66, 67].
ex5k | Okazaki et al. [29] reported unexpected link web fractures for a number of tested short links prior to reaching the code-specified 0.08 rad rotation limit. Richards and Uang [66, 67] attributed this issue
9d4o | mainly to the utilized loading history and stated that the loading protocol used by Okazaki et al. [29] (based on Appendix S of AISC 341-02 [68]) was significantly more severe than the loading sequences used in the 1980s tests on short links. Nonlinear time-history analyses were conducted by Richards and Uang [66, 67] on three prototype EBF structures subjected to 20 large-magnitude-small-distance Los Angeles ground motions. The obtained cumulative rotation demands were used to come up with a new protocol which was adopted by AISC 341-05 [69] for the cyclic testing of link-to-column connections. The proposed protocol has fewer cycles with large rotations compared to the old protocol.
cjq2 | Okazaki et al. [29] retested the specimens which failed to reach the code-specified plastic rotation limit under the AISC 341-02 [68] old protocol using the new (revised) loading protocol. All of the newly tested specimens exhibited rotation capacities higher than the code-specified limit, with an average increase of 52% in ymax. Further studies by Okazaki and his colleagues [31, 33] also confirmed the conclusion that the old protocol is overly demanding compared to the revised protocol for shear links. It is worth noting that other loading protocols, for instance, random loading protocols, loading protocols available in specifications other than the U.S. standards, or more severe loading histories than the AISC 341-02 [68] old protocol have also been used in some studies (e.g. [14, 31]) to demonstrate the sensitivity of the rotation capacity of shear links to the applied loading sequences.
5esx | As explained by Richards [40], if the revised protocol is used for testing intermediate or long links, a modest increase in ymax for intermediate links and a modest decrease in y"ax for long links might be observed. Okazaki et al. [33] also noted that the cyclic demand imposed on flexural links by both protocols is somewhat similar. The revised protocol was used in a number of experimental and numerical studies on intermediate and long links (e.g. [13, 31, 70]). Daneshmand and Hashemi [13] demonstrated the sensitivity of the rotation capacity of intermediate links to the employed loading protocol. The value of ymax obtained via nonlinear FE analysis for an intermediate link reduced by 18% when the link was loaded based on the old protocol instead of the revised protocol.
m5ka | 3. Detailing of Links
byu8 | 3.1. Flange and Web Compactness
76b0 | The link flange slenderness limit is needed to prevent severe strength degradation due to flange local buckling during intense loadings. Kasai and Popov [10] calculated the link flange stress at the ultimate shear of <LATEX>1 . 5 V _ { P }</LATEX> and its associated moment for 156 links with four different yield stresses and two length ratios, <LATEX>\rho = 1 . 6</LATEX> (short) and <LATEX>p = 2</LATEX> (intermediate), with and without axial force. The obtained maximum flange stresses were compared to a conservative critical plastic buckling stress determined based on Haaijer's method [71]. Kasai and Popov [10] did not detect flange buckling for the links with <LATEX>\rho = 1 . 6</LATEX> with no axial force when the flange slenderness (i.e. <LATEX>\left. b _ { f } / 2 t _ { f } \right)</LATEX> was limited to <LATEX>0 . 3 8 \sqrt { E / F _ { y } }</LATEX> , where <LATEX>b _ { f }</LATEX> and <LATEX>t _ { f }</LATEX> are the flange width and thickness respectively and <LATEX>E</LATEX> is the elastic modulus of the steel material. However, if these links were subjected to axial force, the stringent flange slenderness limit of <LATEX>0 . 3 \sqrt { E / F _ { y } }</LATEX> was suggested to prevent flange buckling. On the other hand, some of the intermediate links with <LATEX>\rho = 2 ,</LATEX> especially if subjected to axial force, were prone to flange buckling even if the flange slenderness was kept below the more stringent limit of <LATEX>0 . 3 \sqrt { E / F _ { y } } .</LATEX> Based on these, it was recommended to limit the flange slenderness of links to <LATEX>0 . 3 \sqrt { E / F _ { y } } .</LATEX> This limit was adopted by the early EBF specifications [12, 72, 73] and was in use prior to the 2005 edition of AISC 341 [69].
zxz6 | Adhering to the flange slenderness limit of <LATEX>0 . 3 \sqrt { E / F _ { y } }</LATEX> disqualified several efficient wide-flange rolled sections constructed from A992 steel from being used as links. A992 steel has become the most widely used steel material in the U.S. and has replaced A36 steel after the 1994 Northridge earthquake [51]. Using heavier sections to satisfy this requirement would be the common approach in practice, but this is not fruitful from the capacity design point of view. Richards and Uang [51] conducted a comprehensive numerical study to further investigate this issue. After verifying the FE modeling procedure using the experimental data reported by Arce [23], a total of 112 isolated I-shaped link models were analyzed considering different flange slenderness values. The numerical results demonstrated that the flange slenderness limit can be relaxed from <LATEX>0 . 3 \sqrt { E / F _ { y } }</LATEX> to <LATEX>0 . 3 8 \sqrt { E / F _ { y } } .</LATEX> Although some of the intermediate links could not achieve the code-specified rotation limit, this issue was related to the stiffener requirements and not the flange slenderness limit [51]. In addition to the
xnth | numerical investigation of Richards and Uang [51], subsequent experimental studies by Okazaki and his colleagues [29, 31] on wide-flange links constructed from A992 steel confirmed that the above relaxation can be safely applied to short links. However, Okazaki et al. [29, 31] observed strength degradation due to flange buckling in some of the intermediate link specimens. Taking into account previous studies [10, 29, 31, 51] it was permitted as per AISC 341-05 [69] to use moderately ductile flanges for I-shaped links with the slenderness limit of <LATEX>0 . 3 8 \sqrt { E / F _ { y } }</LATEX> only in short links <LATEX>\left( \rho < 1 . 6 \right) .</LATEX> It should be noted that in the numerical study of Richards and Uang [51] and also the recent tests of Okazaki and his colleagues [29, 31] no axial force was imposed on the links. Nevertheless, the above relaxation in the flange slenderness requirements includes all shear yielding links regardless of the level of axial force.
vafm | Based on the results obtained from an exhaustive numerical parametric study containing more than 200 analyses as well as a subsequent experimental study, Berman and Bruneau [48, 49] concluded that the flange slenderness of built-up box links should be limited to <LATEX>0 . 6 4 \sqrt { E / F _ { y } }</LATEX> . Until 2005, this limit was the seismically compact limit for walls of rectangular HSS members as per AISC 341 [69]. However, in 2010 the more stringent limit of <LATEX>0 . 5 5 \sqrt { E / F _ { y } }</LATEX> was adopted by AISC 341-10 [3] for flanges of highly ductile built-up box sections, which is the case for tubular links.
2zmw | In general, compact webs are used in links to prevent or delay the deteriorative effect of web buckling [3]. Berman and Bruneau [48, 49] suggested that the web slenderness for built-up box shear links should be limited to <LATEX>1 . 6 7 \sqrt { E / F _ { y } } .</LATEX> However, this limit was reduced to <LATEX>0 . 6 4 \sqrt { E / F _ { y } }</LATEX> for intermediate and long built-up box links in which local buckling of both webs and flanges can cause strength degradation [48, 49].
bf9k | 3.2. Web Stiffeners
otkr | The proper use of end and intermediate web stiffeners in links is a major parameter for achieving stable and controlled hysteresis behavior. End stiffeners are usually full-depth stiffeners provided for all link length ratios located on both sides of the web at link ends. In 1977, Roeder and Popov [4] provided the rationale for the necessity of using end stiffeners to ensure local stability at a brace-link-
ibgs | beam connection panel. In the previous and current EBF specifications (e.g. [12, 72-74]) the use of end stiffeners has always been mandatory with an aim of improving the link shear force transfer to reacting elements as well as preventing premature local buckling in links.
colo | In the early experiments by Popov and his colleagues (e.g. [6, 75]) it was observed that in short links tearing of web and severe strength degradation usually occurred shortly after web buckling. Although in some tests (e.g. [6]) a considerable amount of energy was also dissipated by the link in the post-buckling phase, since post-buckling behavior and its subsequent failure are difficult to predict and more hazardous, web buckling is generally considered as the design ultimate state for short links [6, 7, 75]. Popov and his colleagues [6, 18, 75] demonstrated that providing intermediate stiffeners could substantially improve the strength and energy dissipation capacity of links. In 1983, Hjelmstad and Popov [7] proposed the first relation for determining the required intermediate stiffener spacing based on the expected energy dissipation of a link. However, later tests by Kasai and Popov [10] demonstrated that such a relation does not exist and instead, the required intermediate stiffener spacing is dependent upon the expected ultimate link rotation, Yu. In 1986, Kasai and Popov [75] proposed a conservative spacing formula for intermediate stiffeners using a cyclic plastic theory and the experimental data obtained from tests [15] on short links constructed from A36 steel. The stiffener spacing was expressed as a function of the depth of the I-shaped link and its web thickness for three different ultimate rotations. The maximum spacing allowed for the intermediate stiffeners of short links per AISC 341-10 [3] is based on this proposal with slight modifications. It is worth noting that a number of recent studies [31, 34] have mentioned that the shear link stiffener spacing requirements of the AISC Seismic Provisions [3] are somewhat conservative and might be relaxed if justified by further experimental research.
d6r4 | Malley and Popov [9] investigated the required area and moment of inertia of link intermediate stiffeners using Basler's theory for plate girders [76] and the approach adopted by Bleich [77]. The requirements proposed by Malley and Popov [9] were not included in AISC 341 [3, 68, 69], and instead, the regular requirements of plate girder web stiffeners were recommended for determining the required moment of inertia of link stiffeners with the addition of a minimum thickness limit. Bruneau et al. [50] further discussed this issue and mentioned that the previous reasonable performances of
9mrz | 15
pk06 | EBFs designed as per AISC 341 [3, 68, 69] indicate that the recommendations of Malley and Popov [9] were based on overly conservative assumptions.
7wn9 | Intermediate stiffeners are also required in links with flexure-dominant behavior. The comprehensive experimental study by Engelhardt and Popov [11, 64] on long links revealed that, unlike shear links, local buckling of flanges will not necessarily cause strength degradation in stiffened long links. It was concluded that placing stiffeners at a distance of 1.5bf from each end of the link, while not preventing flange buckling, would limit the strength loss due to flange buckling [64]. The large scale pseudo-dynamic tests by Tsai et al. [65] indicated that such stiffeners may still be beneficial if substantial axial force is also available in the link. Engelhardt and Popov [64] also mentioned the beneficial effect of placing stiffeners outside the link region, in the brace-link-beam connection panel. Furthermore, it was concluded that intermediate links, which will experience both shear and flexural yielding, should have intermediate stiffeners at 1.5bf from the link ends, and also equally spaced additional stiffeners through the link length based on the requirements of short links. These recommendations have generally been adopted by AISC 341-10 [3]. However, the provisions require no intermediate stiffeners when the link length ratio (p) is larger than 5.0.
wcd0 | Previous and recent experimental studies [9, 10, 29, 64] have demonstrated that, unlike end stiffeners, intermediate stiffeners can also be one-sided in links with various lengths. The numerical study of Daneshmand and Hashemi [13] revealed that using one-sided stiffeners can reduce the rotation capacity of intermediate and long links, however, this reduction rarely decreases ymax below the code-specified rotation capacity. Furthermore, the reduction was reported to be more pronounced for links in the range of 1.8 < p < 2.2. Nevertheless, AISC 341-10 [3] permits the use of one-sided intermediate stiffeners for links with a depth of less than 635 mm. Malley and Popov [9] demonstrated that partial depth intermediate stiffeners can also be used in shear links, provided that a concrete slab properly restrains the top flange. However, as required by AISC 341-10 [3], it is more advisable to use full-depth intermediate stiffeners welded to the web and both flanges since these stiffeners can enhance the stability of the link against flange local buckling as well as against lateral torsional buckling [7, 64, 78].
caos | Recent tests and the probabilistic analysis of Bulic et al. [52] suggested the use of at least two couples of properly designed web stiffeners in short I-shaped links to achieve enough reliability according to Eurocode 0 [79] for the mean recurrence interval of 50 years.
