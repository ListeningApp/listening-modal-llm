The genetic variations determining flesh firmness and crispness retainability are not well understood. The objectives of this study are to identify gene markers based on quantitative trait loci and to develop genomics-assisted prediction models for apple flesh firmness and crispness retainability. Phenotype data of two thousand six hundred sixty-four hybrids derived from three Malus domestica cultivars and a Malus asiatica cultivar were collected in twenty sixteen and twenty seventeen. The phenotype segregated considerably with high broad-sense heritability of eighty-three point eight five percent and eighty-three point six four percent for flesh firmness and crispness retainability, respectively. Fifty-six candidate genes were predicted from the sixty-two quantitative trait loci identified using bulked segregant analysis and RNA-seq. The genotype effects of the markers designed on each candidate gene were estimated. The genomics-predicted values were obtained using pyramiding marker genotype effects and overall mean phenotype values. Fivefold cross-validation revealed that the prediction accuracy was zero point five five four one and zero point six zero one eight for retainability of flesh firmness and crispness, respectively. An eight-base pair deletion in the MdERF3 promoter disrupted MdDOF5.3 binding, reduced MdERF3 expression, relieved the inhibition on MdPGLR3, MdPME2, and MdACO4 expression, and ultimately decreased flesh firmness and crispness retainability. A three-base pair deletion in the MdERF118 promoter decreased its expression by disrupting the binding of MdRAVL1, which increased MdPGLR3 and MdACO4 expression and reduced flesh firmness and crispness retainability. These results provide insights regarding the genetic variation network regulating flesh firmness and crispness retainability, and the genomics-assisted prediction models can assist in apple breeding.\nxb13 | Introduction\ncxqi | Fruit softening after ripening is important for plant survival and reproduction. However, optimal flesh firmness and crispness are important fruit quality traits determining consumer choice. The retention of these texture attributes during cold storage is critical for long-term maintenance of fruit quality. Although many quantitative trait loci have been identified and several genes have been reported to be involved in fruit storability, molecular insights regarding fruit firmness and crispness retention are currently limited.\nqfmx | Fruit firmness and crispness are quantitatively inherited and are genetically controlled by polygenes with minor effects. In apple, a number of quantitative trait loci for fruit firmness and flesh texture were repeatedly mapped on chromosomes one, five, six, eight, ten, twelve, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, and seventeen, which explained ten to forty-nine percent phenotypic variance.\nrut3 | \nm3cp | Post-harvest fruit softening, which counteracts flesh firmness and crispness retention, is a complex physiological process involving the biosynthesis of or response to phytohormones and the degradation of cytoskeletons such as polysaccharide. Ethylene biosynthesis is generally considered a primary factor leading to fruit softening. One-aminocyclopropane-one-carboxylic acid synthase and one-aminocyclopropane-one-carboxylic acid oxidase are the two well-studied ethylene production-related genes. Quantitative trait loci-based markers on MdACO1 and MdACS1 have been shown to be responsible for apple fruit firmness and shelf life. However, the markers on MdACS1 and MdACO1 explained only eight point three to eleven point four percent of phenotype variance, indicating that other genes may contribute to the overall effect of low ethylene production in certain apple lines.\nmq4s | The rapid increase in internal ethylene concentration triggers the transition from the initial slow softening phase to the rapid softening phase in apple. A functional single-nucleotide polymorphism marker on polygalacturonase gene MdPG1, which explains up to ten point seven percent phenotypic variance, was developed from a quantitative trait locus for fruit post-harvest firmness. Flesh firmness loss is usually associated with mealiness. The MdPG1 also contributed most to apple flesh mealiness. A significant locus spanning pectin methylesterase was associated with apple fruit crispness and mealiness in a genome-wide association study. Apples of cultivar 'Scifresh' soften slowly because of the relatively low MdPME and MdPG activities throughout fruit development and ripening.\n95el | In addition to the genes for ethylene biosynthesis and pectin degradation, many transcription factors are involved in fine controlling fruit firmness and crispness. Ethylene response factors, MdERF2 and MdERF3, should be MdERF1A in NCBI, bind to the MdACS1 promoter and oppositely regulate its transcription during post-harvest ripening in apple. Nevertheless, the genetic regulatory network mediated by these genes and the relationship between them were not clear.\na0a5 | In the last decade, empirical marker-assisted selection for apple crispness has been practically used in breeding programmes, enabling breeders to design the perfect hybrid cross and to select the best seedlings from large populations. Breeders have noticed that the efficiency of marker-assisted selection is often not satisfactory for traits involving many loci with minor effects. Genomic selection emerged as an innovative paradigm twenty years ago in animal breeding and was soon adopted and rapidly studied in fruit plants. In apple, genomic selection or genomic prediction was pioneered by Kumar et al. in twenty twelve and has been used in simulative selections for fruit quality traits, harvest date, and scab resistance.\n```",
