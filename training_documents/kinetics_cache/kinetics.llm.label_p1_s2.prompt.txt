o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

o2kr | Genome-wide inference reveals that feedback regulations constrain promoter-dependent transcriptional burst kinetics
v6sk | Received July 01, 2022; Revised November 06, 2022; Editorial Decision November 26, 2022; Accepted December 06, 2022
1wj6 | ABSTRACT
936l | Gene expression in mammalian cells is highly vari- able and episodic, resulting in a series of discontin- uous bursts of mRNAs. A challenge is to understand how static promoter architecture and dynamic feed- back regulations dictate bursting on a genome-wide scale. Although single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA- seq) provides an opportunity to address this chal- lenge, effective analytical methods are scarce. We developed an interpretable and scalable inference framework, which combined experimental data with a mechanistic model to infer transcriptional burst ki- netics (sizes and frequencies) and feedback regula- tions. Applying this framework to scRNA-seq data generated from embryonic mouse fibroblast cells, we found Simpson's paradoxes, i.e. genome-wide burst kinetics exhibit different characteristics in two cases without and with distinguishing feedback reg- ulations. We also showed that feedbacks differently modulate burst frequencies and sizes and conceal the effects of transcription start site distributions on burst kinetics. Notably, only in the presence of positive feedback, TATA genes are expressed with high burst frequencies and enhancer-promoter in- teractions mainly modulate burst frequencies. The developed inference method provided a flexible and efficient way to investigate transcriptional burst ki- netics and the obtained results would be helpful for understanding cell development and fate decision.

o3ya | cupation for investigating gene regulation (1,2). Genes are stochastically transcribed often in a discontinuous burst- ing manner (3,4). Transcriptional bursting is regarded as a primary proxy of stochasticity in gene expression and con- tributes to cell-to-cell variability (5-7), but the molecular mechanisms governing transcriptional bursting kinetics still remain elusive. Many experimental studies have provided evidence for linking static promoter architecture and se- quence to transcriptional bursting and, therefore, to the re- sulting variability in gene expression (5,8). This variability can propagate from mRNA to protein and further to the downstream target genes via a complex regulatory network (9,10). This raises important issues: On the genome-wide scale, how do static promoter regulatory sequences encode transcriptional burst kinetics, and how do dynamic gene regulatory networks shape burst kinetics?
r5il | An intuitive view is that there is an indispensable link of gene-expression variability to promoter architecture (11,12). This link is due to the fact that a basic step of RNA synthesis is to copy the genetic information from the gene promoter. Much effort has been devoted to rational- izing the promoter-architecture encoding of transcriptional burst kinetics on genome-wide scales. For example, genes with TATA boxes increase variability in expression levels, whereas the presence of CpG island significantly lowers the variability (13-15). The sharp distributions of transcription start sites (TSS) lead to higher gene-expression variabil- ity than the broad TSS distributions (13). A recent study (16) has revealed that the increases in burst sizes are depen- dent on the presence of TATA box and initiator elements (characteristics of the core promoter), and burst frequencies are regulated by enhancer-promoter (E-P) interactions. All these studies and others (17-21) indicate the importance of promoter architecture in modulating transcriptional burst kinetics.
5gui | Another viewpoint is that feedback regulations modu- late transcriptional burst kinetics by creating a higher-level
82qc | structure regulatory pattern (10). In fact, feedback regula- tions exist extensively in biological systems, and their func- tions may be reflected by the circuits of interacting genes and proteins (22). In particular, auto-regulatory feedback loops have been identified in various regulatory systems, where transcription factors directly or indirectly regulate the corresponding gene expression (23). In general, feed- backs can be categorized into positive and negative ones. Experimental investigations for a few genes or transcripts have demonstrated that different kinds of feedback played diverse roles (10). For example, negative feedback limits large expression variability and accelerates responses (24- 26). Conversely, positive feedback amplifies expression vari- ation, induces bimodal expression, and stimulates genes to 'active' states (27-30). In addition, negative feedback with a long delay loop can display increased variability (31). Theoretical analysis has also shown that different feed- back mechanisms modulate burst kinetics in different man- ners (32,33). All these studies indicate the important roles of feedback regulations in mediating gene expression, in- cluding transcriptional bursts, but it is unclear whether the results obtained for case-by-case studies can hold on a genome-wide scale.
ls7d | The above two viewpoints are not solitary but are com- plementary to each other. A challenging task is to investi- gate how static promoter architecture and dynamic feed- back regulation coordinate transcriptional burst kinetics on a genome-wide scale. Previous studies of transcriptional bursting were limited to low-throughput experimental ap- proaches, where observed experimental results could not be generalized across different genes or cell types (34- 40). Recently, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has enabled the in-depth measurement of expression lev- els within cell populations, providing an opportunity to study genome-wide transcriptional mechanisms (41). An important step toward this study is to develop mathemat- ical models for the genome-wide inference of burst kinetics. The models for inference should satisfy some requirements. First, these models should be interpretable, i.e. they can cap- ture essential gene-expression dynamics and convey kinetic information about transcriptional bursts (16,42-44) (https: //doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.06.459173). Previous studies re- lied on inferring the direct correlations between features across molecular scales (13,45). However, these correlations are insufficient to uncover the mechanisms of gene expres- sion. Second, the inference models should be tractable, i.e. they can effectively treat a large number of cells and genes. In general, a complex mechanistic model incorporating reg- ulatory factors is difficult to analyze on the one hand (46), and a genome-wide inference needs expensive computa- tional cost on the other hand. Therefore, an interpretable and tractable inference framework integrating experimen- tal data and molecular mechanisms is strongly demanded.
tzt3 | Here we developed a statistical framework based on the model-driven and data-driven combination to perform a scalable genome-wide inference. This framework used the static snapshots of scRNA-seq data to infer the regula- tory mechanisms underlying transcriptional burst kinetics. Specifically, it integrated the expected information on gene- expression variability, burst frequencies, burst sizes, and feedback regulation forms. Applying this inference method to the scRNA-seq data generated from embryonic mouse

qvnu | fibroblast cells (16), we showed that feedbacks differently modulate burst frequencies and sizes, TATA genes are ex- pressed with high burst frequencies only in the presence of positive feedback, feedback regulations conceal the effects of TSS distribution on transcriptional burst kinetics, and E- P interactions mainly modulate burst frequencies only in the presence of positive feedbacks. Briefly, we found that char- acteristics of genome-wide transcriptional burst kinetics in the case without feedback regulations were different from those in the case with feedback regulations, implying Simp- son's Paradox, an interesting statistical phenomenon.

5746 | A mechanistic hierarchic model for statistical inference
7toz | The observed counts in a scRNA-seq experiment reflect a combination of the true expression level and the measure- ment level of each gene in each cell. We describe the ob- served counts by a two-level hierarchical model (See details in Supplementary Text 1.1, Figure 1D, and Supplementary Figure Sla-c):
j346 | P(Y= y) = | 0 Pmeas (y |n) Pgene (n)dn, (1)
v8uq | where Pmeas(y|n) is for a measurement model and Pgene(n) for a gene expression model.
x972 | The first level represents the measurement process for the observed count Yeg conditional on the true expression level Neg of gene g in cell c, with a conditional probability distri- bution (Supplementary Figure S1b):
cwrw | (2) Ycg| Neg ~ Pmeas (y |n ) .
4i0e | The Pmeas(y|n) describes all aspects of the technical noise produced in the measurement process for a given true ex- pression level Neg, and is suggested as a Binomial distribu- tion or Poisson distribution which is supported by empirical analyses and theoretical arguments in many existing meth- ods (47,48). By adding an extra sampling probability Àcg in the sequencing process, we characterize the sequencing depth and assume that intercellular molecules are indepen- dent of each other and only the proportional products are captured and sequenced using Binomial distribution
h2l3 | Ycg | Neg ~ Binomial (n, 1cg) . (3)
dfzb | In our calculations, we set the sampling probability Àcg = 1 = 0.5 without loss of generality since the setting of Acg does not influence our qualitative results.
u6ty | The second level is the true expression level of gene g across cells, which is assumed to follow a probability dis- tribution
awvu | Neg ~ Pgene (n) . (4)
on9b | The underlying model describes the intrinsic dynamics of stochastic gene expression. How an appropriate gene- expression model Pgene(n) is chosen is critical. In general, this choice needs to satisfy two basic requirements: (i) the model should capture the essential gene-expression dynam- ics of interest (e.g. transcriptional burst kinetics); and (ii) the inference based on the model should be effective and scalable to large numbers of cells and genes. As combin- ing mechanistic models to infer the entire gene regulatory

h27a | network would lead to sophisticated models that become intractable, we simplified the gene regulatory network to a feedback loop, which is the most common form existing in gene expression systems. For these purposes, we adopt a model of stochastic gene expression (Supplementary Text 1.1, Figure 1B and Supplementary Figure S1c), which si- multaneously characterizes transcriptional burst kinetics and auto-regulatory feedbacks with the below distribution
pdjh | Pgene (n) = N N
xmgs | 0 ∞ Poisson (n |x) xa(1+€)-1e-x/b (1 + (x/k) }) - a/ dx, (5)
bd9h | where N is a normalization factor. Note that the discrete gene expression distribution (Equation (5)) is a Poisson rep- resentation in form, i.e. Pgene(n) = " Poisson(n\x) f(x)dx, where f(x) is a kernel density function that has the same form as the continuous distribution of proteins in (49). As il- lustrated in Figure 1B, this kernel function f(x) can extract several kinetic parameters, denoted by 0 = (a, b, c, k, h), of the steady-state gene-product distribution from a dy- namic model with auto-regulatory feedback described by some meaningful kinetic parameters: switching rates be- tween inactive and active state (kon, koff), mRNA transcrip- tion rates (Ksyn) and degradation rates (kdeg). Here, a is the number of bursts per cell cycle (burst frequency), and b is the mean number of gene products generated per burst (burst size), and h is a vital parameter of capturing the feed- back regulation dynamics of gene products, which is ac- tually a Hill coefficient. Furthermore, this model can de- scribe two most common feedback loops in gene expres- sion: positive-feedback loop (i.e. hlt; 0) and negative feed- back loop (i.e. h > 0). It should be noted that the auto- regulatory feedbacks involve gene products, which directly or indirectly regulate the corresponding target gene itself through feedback loops, resulting in a repressing or activat- ing expression. The small leakiness proportion of the pro- moter & contains the information on the baseline bursts in the absence of regulation, and k contains the information on the equilibrium binding constant (see details in Sup- plementary Text 1.1). Overall, Equation (5) is a mecha- nistic model, which can simultaneously describe the burst- production and feedback-regulation processes of gene ex- pression. More importantly, as a special case of this model, h = 0 corresponds to the negative binomial distribution of gene expression Pgene(n) (i.e. non-feedback).
m047 | By combining Equations (3) and (5) and substituting into Equation (1), the discrete probability distribution of Yeg can be computed but is expressed in an integral form (see details in Supplementary Text 1.1):
gy8c | P(Y = y ;- )= 10 00 Pmeas (y |n ) Pgene (n)dn

vpgq | =N. .00
ousl | (1x) -1x2a(1+€)-1e-x/b(1 +(x/k)})~/ dx. (6) y!
m4ju | For the case of non-feedback, we employ the negative bi- nomial distribution, which is then given by

ki8m | Maximum likelihood estimation of parameters
km8w | Here we introduce a method of estimating the kinetic pa- rameters in our hierarchical model using the expression data of each gene. For a given expression read of observed cells, the most common parameter estimation method is the maximum likelihood estimation, which can be formulated as the following optimization problem of five parameters 0 = (a, b, c, k, h) in our case

iwn5 | Because of the complex integral and unnormalized prob- ability mass function in Equation (6), calculating the inte- gral directly through the MCMC method (50) would be at a high cost of computation, and in particular, it is hard to use in the analysis of genome-wide data. Therefore, we ap- ply the Generalized Gauss-Laguerre Quadrature Rules (51) to Equation (6) instead of the use of the MCMC method, realizing a rapid calculation in inference:
