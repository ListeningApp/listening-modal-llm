But please be aware that my versions are idiosyncratic and will make some people raise their eyebrows. I'm afraid you'll have to go elsewhere, like Reif's book, to learn these laws in their traditional form!\naq9q | We've been maximizing entropy subject to a constraint on the expected value of one quantity. What if we do two or more? Everything works the same way, but the fundamental relation between temperature, energy and entropy, d(E) equals TdS, gets one extra term for each constraint. The resulting equation is a version of the 'First Law of Thermodynamics'.\ndc5c | I'll explain the case with one extra constraint. Suppose we've got a measure space X whose points are states of some system. Choose two functions on it. They could be anything, but let's call them energy and volume and write them as E: X maps to R and V: X maps to R. These terms are favored because thermodynamics arose in part from the study of steam engines, where you've got a cylinder of steam with some energy and some volume. For any probability distribution p: X maps to [zero, zero), we can write down a formula for its Shannon entropy\n9diq | H equals negative integral p of x ln p of x dx\nc10k | and also the expected values\nf8yn | E equals integral E of x dx, V equals integral V of x dx.\nahrs | Let's not worry now about whether these integrals converge.\nk7hf | Suppose we only know E and V, and we are trying to choose the 'best' probability distribution p with these expected values. What should we do? Following the principle of maximum entropy, we seek the probability distribution p that maximizes H subject to our constraints on E and V. If we do this, we are led to a Lagrange multipliers problem, much as in the the simpler case of one constraint. But now we need two Lagrange multipliers: let's call them Beta and Gamma. We get this equation:\nwl64 | dH equals Beta dE plus Gamma dV.\nqrks | This is the First Law!\nm9te | But this isn't the way physicists usually write it. To get the First Law in its usual form, first let's switch to using Gibbs entropy S equals k H, and emphasize the role of energy by solving for dE:\nqpsk | dE equals TdS minus PdV.\nsx3l | Then, to simplify the look of this equation, let's introduce variables called temperature and pressure:\nzm2g | T equals k Beta inverse, P equals Beta.\nui7p | Now the First Law of Thermodynamics looks like this:\nubys | dE equals TdS minus PdV.\nhphn | It says that as we move around among probability distributions that maximize entropy subject to constraints on expected energy and volume, the change in expected energy is the sum of two terms:\nves3 | heat, meaning TdS\nh4py | work, meaning -PdV.\np612 | For example, if we have a cylinder of steam with pressure P and we increase its expected volume by a little bit delta V, its expected energy goes down by about P delta V: that's how we understand the minus sign. In this situation the external world has done an amount of work -P delta V on the cylinder of steam, but most people say the cylinder of steam has done an amount of work P delta V on the external world.\n2ll3 | Here are a few puzzles if you want to dig deeper. In the first two, I ask you to generalize ideas from our earlier work on maximizing entropy subject to a single constraint.\nroki | Puzzle fifty-one. Let X equal one, to n and let E, V: X maps to R be two functions whose values at i element of X we call E sub i and V sub i. Suppose p is a probability distribution maximizing the Shannon entropy H on the surface where\nxzvf | E equals e, V equals v,\nvw6g | and also suppose p sub one, to p sub n greater than zero. Show that at p we have\n5ltn | dH equals Beta dE plus Gamma dV\nvqad | for some Beta, Gamma element of R. Hint: first do the case where not all the E sub i are equal and not all the V sub i are equal. This guarantees that dE and dV are nonzero. You can handle the other cases separately.\n2xj0 | Puzzle fifty-two. Under the conditions of Puzzle fifty-one show that\n567t | n exp of negative Beta E sub i minus Gamma V sub i\nsk0p | p sub i\nvwq7 | sum of exp of negative Beta E sub i minus Gamma V sub i\nbeyn | Puzzle fifty-three. Generalize the results of Puzzles fifty-one and fifty-two to the case of any finite number of constraints.\njwlq | Puzzle fifty-four. Generalize the results of Puzzle fifty-three to the case of a system with a countable infinity of states, or an arbitrary measure space of states. You will need to add assumptions to ensure that the sums or integrals converge.\nf8ht | THE SECOND LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS\nq2it | Suppose a system has some measure space X of states and at any time t there is a probability distribution p of t on X.\npiqi | We say the second law of thermodynamics holds if t sub one less than or equal to t sub two implies S of p of t one less than or equal to S of p of t two.\nmjsy | This seems to be widely true, yet the conditions under which it holds are subtle and much-argued.\n01g9 | The Second Law of Thermodynamics, as commonly stated, says that the entropy of a closed system never decreases. This appears to be a profound fact about our universe. A huge challenge to physics is to understand where this law comes from. Can it be derived from some realistic assumptions? One problem is that the laws of classical mechanics are invariant under time-reversal. Thus, if we evolve probability distributions on some space of states according to these laws, for any probability distribution whose entropy is nondecreasing, there is a time-reversed one whose entropy is nonincreasing.\n7cm1 | This is called the problem of the arrow of time: briefly, why does the future look so different from the past? Quantum mechanics makes the problem subtler, but does not provide an easy resolution. The solution may be that we happen to live in a universe a particular solution of the laws of physics-where entropy was very low at the Big Bang, making it easy for entropy to increase after that. But if you get ten physicists in a room and ask them to explain the arrow of time, you are likely to hear ten different opinions. Thus, I will not attempt to resolve it here. For more on that, I recommend this book:\noyk6 | Instead, let's see how the Second Law sheds light on the meaning of temperature. You'll notice that in our course I never talked about systems evolving in time, and I never talked about two systems interacting: always just a single system. Now let's imagine two systems, each in thermal equilibrium, but at possibly different temperatures. Say the first has entropy S one, expected energy E one and temperature T one. As usual, these are related by\n3qp5 | dS one equals dE one divided by T one.\nguux | Say the second system works similarly, with\nfhkp | dS two equals dE two divided by T two.\nur19 | We can define the total entropy of the two systems by\nytow | S equals S one plus S two\nozjl | and the total expected energy by\nxux5 | E equals E one plus E two.\n53mt | Suppose now that the two systems can exchange energy with each other, but in a slow and gentle way, so we can approximately treat each one as in thermal equilibrium at any moment. If no energy flows in or out of the combined system, the total expected energy is conserved, so dE dt equals zero\nowo1 | and thus\nzz70 | dE one dt\nslcr | What does the Second Law give us in this situation? It implies\nz9at | dS dt greater than or equal to zero or\n7dov | dS one dt plus dS two dt\nznos | dS two dt\nbngy | It follows that\nxja2 | one divided by T one dE one dt plus one divided by T two dE two dt greater than zero or\nb9a5 | one divided by T one dE one dt\nthi8 | one divided by T two dE one dt greater than or equal to zero.\nentm | We can rewrite this as\nknql | negative T one inverse\nez57 | \n```",
