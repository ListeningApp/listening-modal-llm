You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

h27a | Webster resolved this dilemma by turning to the discourse of geogra- phy, in particular the spelling of place-names. He assured his readers that a geographical lexicon could overcome local differences. Commenting in the Grammatical Institute, Webster writes that "the advantage of pub- lishing, in a work of this kind, the names of the United States, the coun- ties in each, etc. will not be disputed by any American." Thus, while the opacity surrounding the English language was fueling the regionally moti- vated debates over the proper wording of the Republic's basic document, Webster imagined that the "undisputed" pronunciation of geographical words could provide a sense of clarity and a practical code when imagin- ing a unified community.11
pdjh | The assertion that the consensual pronunciation of geographic place- names was the nation's neutral linguistic ground provided Webster with a formula through which he simultaneously decolonized and nationalized his speller. Webster's self-assigned challenge was to displace the British schoolbook A New Guide to the English Language, by Thomas Dilworth, a speller that had dominated the classrooms and homes of British Ameri-

bd9h | cans since the 1740s. On first sight, Webster's book hardly differed from his imperial predecessor. Both were written in the English language; both endorsed the alphabetic pronouncing-form method. But by focusing on Dilworth's textbook, Webster chose to compete against one of the more popular spellers that promoted geographical literacy. Dilworth's speller emphasized place-names as the literary context through which his British reading subjects would facilitate communication in the British common- wealth as well as uphold its imperial economy on a global scale; or, as Dil- worth put it, it is only "by this means a Briton holds correspondence with his friend in America or Japan, and manages all his business." Webster targets this section, offering, instead of "twelve or fifteen pages devoted to names of English, Scotch and Irish towns and boroughs," eight pages of "the names of the United States, the counties in each, etc." Whereas Dilworth had been rehearsing primarily the place-names found in En- gland, Webster now offered those of the new American nation-state.12
m047 | Indeed, in transforming his speller into an agent of national unifica- tion, Webster incorporated a spelling exercise that anticipated the found- ers' signing ritual. As if projecting the visual form of the United States map of 1783, he introduced the students to the proper spelling of Ameri- can toponyms by including district and city names of all thirteen states. In print the alphabetic assembly of the national map looked like this:

iwn5 | The effect of this spelling table was to establish the geographical order of the national map as an alternative to the alphabetical order of English. Names of states and cities were organized according to their geographical coordinates from north to south rather than from A to Z.13
uooz | Given the table's role in securing a "standard of pronunciation," it meshed the textual structure of the national map with the practice of oral alphabet lessons. The pronunciation of American place-names imi- tated the typographic hyperextension of place-names on maps. Just as the written word "Massachusetts" implied a larger territorial unit by be- ing stretched across the face of a map, so too did the pronunciation of "Mas-sa-chu'-setts" imitate the territorial form of the geographic referent. Being sounded aloud, the place-name now signaled spatial demands, invoking territorial rights and borderlines for both readers and listeners. Moreover, as the chorus of students rehearsed its lines of geographic location, its tonal scale subordinated regional differences to the largest common territorial denominator. In Webster's lineup, pupils voiced the words "The United States of America" before those of the states. For the duration of these pronunciation exercises, as place-names wafted through American classrooms or parlors, students learning to spell also learned how to noisily claim the national map as the soundscape encom- passing a common linguistic identity.
pxbq | Having folded the pronunciation of the national map into his alphabe- tic spelling book, Webster uses geographical literacy as the touchstone of his language reform. Initially, his Grammatical Institute warned the reader that the American community was not so much threatened by the flex- ibility of the English language per se, but that the English variants and dialects were infinitely more debilitating to the project of unifying the national reader through one linguistic standard. Yet, toward the end of his introduction to the Grammatical Institute Webster concludes that spellers and grammars were not in need of improvement, but that lan- guage reformers needed better geographical primers. "The accounts from several states, are yet imperfect," he writes, "but care will be taken to collect, by the best means of information, such accurate accounts from

u15r | the several states, as to correct any errours and supply any defects, that the present imperfect and fluctuating state of geography in this country may unavoidably occasion."14
lq35 | Describing the state of geographic literacy becomes Webster's way of describing the state of literacy instruction in America. During the first three decades of nationhood, as his spelling books rapidly replaced those of a colonial make, lessons in geographic literacy seeped into spell- ing exercises. For example, new editions of former colonial classics such as George Fisher's handbook The Instructor; or, Young Man's Best Com- panion (1794) appended their chapters on language instruction with a re- hearsal of American place-names. For Enos Weed, the alphabetization of the map became the principal method of spelling instructions; his American Orthographer, part 2, The Geographical Spelling-Book (1798) had students practice their alphabetic skills in tables containing lists of place-names that, broken down into their syllabic components, imitated the stress and pauses of speech and also used the hyperextended printing of letters to demarcate geopolitical and cultural spaces on the map. With the emergence of schoolbooks like these, Webster's mapping gam- bit had succeeded beyond merely instituting place-names as a method- ology of language instruction. As a result of his spellers and reading books, an entire generation of American citizens studied the English lan- guage through the geographer's lexicon and the cartographer's mode of projection.15
3g9w | As much as the initial reading lessons of the early Republic revolved around Webster's oral approach, language instructions also depended on the visual pedagogy of the picture primer. In order to achieve an unmedi- ated, transparent relationship between words and the material world, or between signifiers and their signifieds, proponents of English language reforms embraced and emphasized pictorial instruction schemes. In fact, after the Revolution the programmatic dissemination of dozens of newly conceived illustrated primers became the disciplinary site through which
d09o | This content downloaded from 154.59.124.74 on Thu, 17 Aug 2023 21:53:33 +00:00 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms
ylhz | the new citizens sought to train students into models of republican vir- tue and self-discipline. For such reformed primers, it was not only ques- tionable orthography or slippery grammatical systems that rendered lan- guage inherently volatile and therefore open to factious appropriation, but the very nature of written language itself. Pictures, instead of serving as supplements to written text, became a second language. Authors re- peatedly engaged a visual code to reimagine language and hoped to forge the new nation through this new language.16
a3td | By taking the pictorial turn, American educators worked in the tra- dition of revolutionary linguistic movements dating back to the mid- seventeenth century. Following the Thirty Years' War and the English Rev- olution, European linguists and political theorists blamed much of the social violence on miscommunications resulting from the variety and ambiguity of national languages. After decades of political instability and the related loss of meaningful forms of signification, Europeans searched for an ideally prelapsarian or Adamic universal language. As the idea of a universal language became the common goal of linguistic reform, pic- tures in particular were tapped for their ability to transmit meaning con- cretely, unambiguously, and free from verbal interferences.17
ex5k | In the context of the post-Revolutionary United States it was thus not a surprise that American educators rediscovered the seventeenth-century philosopher Johann Amos Comenius, who created pedagogic schemes that first anchored the political order in the pictorial and only then turned to the written word. In his primer Orbis Sensualium Pictus: Visible World; or, A Picture and Nomenclature of All the Chief Things That Are in the World (originally published in 1659 and reissued in the United States as late as 1810), difficult abstract subjects, such as "Philosophy" and "Humanity" as well as geopolitical constructs like "Kingdom" and "Region," were represented through illustrations of material objects. "The Kingdom and the Region," for example, was established in a concrete and stable form through a woodcut with a neatly modeled landscape depicting the various elements of the early modern state (Figure 27). Through the picture, the student learned to read and comprehend the social order. The corre- sponding text is in the service of this image:

He hath his toll-places upon navigable Rivers 4. and High-Roads, 5. where Portage and Tollage is exacted of them that Sayl, or Travell.
byu8 | The picture thus functions not only as a mnemonic device for learning a basic political vocabulary but also like a map, illustrating the spatial orga- nization of the state. The messy realities of human existence and com- plexities of political order vanish in the tidy graphic simplicity of the landscape overview.18
76b0 | In American hands, picture primers assumed a dual function. First, just as in their European context, primers carried forth a latent ideology of universal language schemes. Second, and more particular to the post- Revolutionary order, pictorial primers worked to negotiate the repre- sentational tensions spurred by the Federalist debate; the picture, more powerfully than the word, was able to reconcile the political concepts of "union" and "states." But, while the pictorial primers like Comenius's were adopted because of their availability and status of promoting a uni- versal language, these primers' European heritage entailed historic and practical limitations. Although picture primers paved the way for the en- trance of the visual into America's language handbooks, the primer's tra- ditional representation of words and images relating geopolitical spaces like the "kingdom" was no longer applicable. The invention of a new type of nation-state with a precarious and experimental relationship of the parts to the whole could not, many feared, be given proper expression through the pictorially mediated letters of the English language. More- over, federalist educators feared that the sustainability of this new politi- cal form depended not so much on written decrees and charters and international treaties as it did on citizens' absorbing and comprehending the social relationships of this political hybrid.
zxz6 | Maps, themselves a hybrid form of word and image, provided primers with this language. Map images were not new to picture primers; after all, Comenius's Visible World contained maps showing the world as a

2zmw | "Terrestrial Sphere ... divided into 5 Zones" and Europe, containing "the chief Kingdoms." Eighteenth-century American primers and ABC books, following in Comenius's footsteps, incorporated the textual materials of the geographer into the display of alphabetized objects. For instance, primers such as The Child's Museum, Containing a Description of One Hun- dred and Eight Interesting Subjects, following the schoolbook definition that "a Map is a picture of the earth," included the picture of a globe (and the written subtitle, "A Globe") in the array of alphabetized objects (Figure 28). The seemingly arbitrary inclusion of the globe into the primer is a first comment on the materiality and availability of cartographic texts in the early American linguistic stock.19
bf9k | More than simply illustrating the alphabet, the figure of the map worked conceptually to teach abstract principles of literacy. This is sug- gested by the primer The Mother's Gift; or, Remarks on a Set of Cuts for Children (Figure 29). This primer presents the student reader with a pic- ture of a map, a subtitle spelling out the words, "A Map," and a narrative description: "MAP. As you get forward in the study of geography you will find great entertainment in maps. How pleasant is it to trace the progress

colo | of a traveller of whom we read; and still more interesting where a friend is on a voyage or journey." Here, map literacy is taught as a reading skill and a life skill: maps are understood to inform the student's future geography lessons; they are considered textual companions of the leisured reader who consumes travel narratives and novels; maps provide the material link through which friends and families communicate with each other. As the titles of primers like The Mother's Gift suggest, alphabetic literacy was the product of a domestic ideology in which the child was the focus of alphabetic instructions provided by the ideal republican mother; in this context the map was introduced to the child reader by the most intimate member and designated disciplinarian of the early national household.20
