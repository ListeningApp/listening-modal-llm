You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

z8f7 | Methods for understanding social-ecological systems: a review of place- based studies
7w7j | ABSTRACT. In recent years, social-ecological systems (SES) have emerged as a prominent analytical framing with which to investigate pressing sustainability issues associated with the Anthropocene era. Despite the growth of SES research, the lack of a delineated set of methods commonly contributes to disorientation for those entering into a field where methodological pluralism is the norm. We conduct a review of SES research, focusing particularly on methods used in this field. Our results reflect the rapid growth in SES research relative to other publications in relevant subject areas, and suggest a maturation of the field. Whilst institutions investigating SES have been mostly based in the global north, focal SES has been more globally distributed, although key regions, especially island regions, remain poorly studied. Key problems addressed in the studies related to policy, trade, conservation, adaptation, land use change, water, forests, sustainability, urban problems, and governance and institutions. We identified 311 methods, which we grouped into 27 method categories that can serve as a guide to SES research methods for newcomers to the field. We also performed an exploratory assessment of the ability of these methods to account for key features of SES as complex adaptive systems. We found that methods do better at accounting for the relational and context-dependent nature of SES, and least well with complex causality. Our study highlights the plurality of methods used in SES research, and helps highlight key areas in need of further methodological development.
51vd | INTRODUCTION
baj1 | Human activities are changing the ecosystems upon which humanity depends in unprecedented and profound ways (Rockström et al. 2009). In the fast-changing and ever-more- connected era of the Anthropocene (Rockström et al. 2009, Steffen et al. 2011), the environmental and social challenges we face demand better understanding of the complex and evolving links between ecosystems and human societies (Rockström et al. 2009, Fischer et al. 2015). The concept of social-ecological systems (SES) has emerged as a key conceptual and analytical framing with which to understand the connections and feedbacks between social and environmental interactions in real-world systems (Carpenter et al. 2012, Fischer et al. 2015, Colding and Barthel 2019). The concept has helped facilitate increased recognition of the dependence of humanity on ecosystems (Díaz et al. 2006, Summers et al. 2012, Wu 2013), has improved collaboration across disciplines and between science and society (Carpenter et al. 2012), has increased methodological pluralism that has led to improved systems understanding (Levin et al. 2013, Tengö et al. 2014, Lade and Niiranen 2017, Preiser et al. 2018), and has manifested in major policy frameworks and initiatives, such as Future Earth (Rockström 2016) and the Sustainable Development Goals (Díaz et al. 2015a, Fischer et al. 2015). Recent years have also seen the emergence of new research areas (Folke 2006), modeling approaches (Schlüter et al. 2012), and analytic frameworks (Turner et al. 2003, Janssen et al. 2006, Collins et al. 2011, Bodin and Tengö 2012, Schlüter et al. 2019).
n1wo | Despite progress, SES research remains challenging (Fischer et al. 2015, Turner et al. 2016, Haider et al. 2018). Central to this challenge is the recognition that SES research represents an emergent "third" space that transcends the mere sum of social and ecological research practices and disciplines (Walker et al. 2006, Liu et al. 2007a, Folke et al. 2016). Many methods and
5bq3 | approaches used in SES research do not fall within the realms of traditional social and natural sciences, or any singular discipline, and as a result SES as a research field lacks its own coherent methodological identity, instead drawing strongly on methodological pluralism (Tengö et al. 2014, Folke et al. 2016). Fluidity of identity is also evident in the multiple terms used to describe SES (e.g., coupled human-environmental systems, man- environmental systems), varied definitions for what SES are (Herrero-Jáuregui et al. 2018, Colding and Barthel 2019), and the different ways that SES are spoken about in academic literature, ranging from a boundary object to bridge disciplines (Hertz and Schlüter 2015) to describing real epistemic systems that can be understood using empirical methods (Becker 2012).
ezla | Although a variety of conceptual and methodological ambiguities plague this emerging research area, there is sufficient coherence to enable analysis of key dimensions of this research field. All SES research has in common a nomenclature that designates the object of study as having integrated social and ecological components, as is also reflected in the names of prominent journals in the field. Indeed, several recent reviews have attempted such analyses of the SES field (Binder et al. 2013, Turner et al. 2016, Herrero-Jáuregui et al. 2018, Partelow 2018, Colding and Barthel 2019). From these reviews, it is clear that SES research, which is often approached alongside concepts such as ecosystem services, sustainability science, and transdisciplinary research (Brandt et al. 2013, Turner II et al. 2016, Haider et al. 2018, Herrero-Jáuregui et al. 2018, Partelow 2018), has grown over the past 20 years (Droste et al. 2018, Herrero-Jáuregui et al. 2018, Colding and Barthel 2019). Having its origins in place- based, local resource management studies (Colding and Barthel 2019), the field is still largely characterized by place-based studies, especially at the local scale (Norberg and Cumming 2008, Becker 2012, Angelstam et al. 2013, Hertz and Schlüter 2015, Folke et
rsbu | al. 2016). Meta-approaches/comparative analyses and framework development are, however, also often conducted (Partelow 2018). Indeed, several large databases now exist to collect case studies for meta-analyses, e.g. SESMAD, SESGO, IFRI (Partelow 2018). SES research derive from a broad range of disciplines, including the environmental, social, agricultural, biological, Earth and planetary, and computer sciences, as well as medicine and the humanities (Colding and Barthel 2019). Although the focus of SES research has shifted slightly over time (Droste et al. 2018, Herrero-Jáuregui et al. 2018), studies on adaptive management, governance, restoration, and poverty alleviation in sectors such as fisheries, forestry, and watersheds have been popular throughout (Droste et al. 2018, Herrero-Jáuregui et al. 2018, Partelow 2018).
