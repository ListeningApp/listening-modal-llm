You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

dpv6 | 1. Introduction
8r5j | The female component of the reproductive process is more complex than that of the male. While the male is responsible for production of the male gametes (sperm) and their transportation to the female reproductive system, the female, in addition to gamete production, must transport oocytes to sperm and also provide a site for fertilization, embryo implantation, and maintenance of the developing fetus to occur. To increase the efficiency of these reproductive responsibilities, the female produces fertilizable oocytes in an intricate monthly pattern, the menstrual cycle.
2taz | This chapter will begin with a review of female anatomy and histology. The next section will describe the physiological principles involved in oocyte formation (oogenesis) and growth of the oocyte and follicle during their morphological development (folliculogenesis) after activation. Section three examines the events required for final maturation of the oocyte, followed by a description of the endocrinological role of the menstrual cycle in these processes. Physiological principles involved in clinical manipulations of the menstrual cycle for assisted reproduction are discussed in a separate chapter. The female also undergoes hormone-driven changes of the mammary glands during pregnancy in preparation for the early nurturing of the baby. Although the roles of lactation and the late stages of pregnancy are of paramount importance in the success of reproduction, these topics are not covered in this chapter. Evaluation and treatment of the infertile female will be presented in the final section of this chapter. Female infertility will occur if the pattern of hormone production becomes disrupted and gamete production fails to proceed normally. Infertility may also result if the reproductive tract is blocked, or damaged due to disease or abnormal formation, making it impassable or inhospitable to the male and female gametes, or the embryo.
o3ya | 2. Anatomy and Histology
r5il | Fetal sex is determined genetically. The Sry gene located on the Y chromosome encodes a DNA- binding protein that regulates the transcription of genes on autosomes and on the X chromosome that instruct testis formation. For many years, the development of a female fetus was observed as the "default" sex, in the absence of a Y chromosome. However, there is good evidence showing that expression of the Wnt4 gene is required to provide a key signal that channels the developmental fate of the indifferent mammalian gonad toward the ovary (Vainio et al., 1999). Development of the fetal ovary can be described as having four stages; 1) an indifferent gonad stage, 2) the stage of differentiation, 3) a period of oogonial proliferation and oocyte formation, and 4) the stage of follicle formation. Paired gonads can be identified at about 5 weeks of gestation composed of primitive germ cells intermingled with coelomic surface epithelial cells surrounding an inner core of medullary mesenchymal tissue. These gonadal ridges overlie the mesonephros and it is likely that the somatic cells of the gonad are derived from both coelomic epithelium and mesonephric cells. The primordial germ cells originate within the primitive ectoderm (specific cells of origin have not been distinguished) and can only survive in the genital ridge. The germ cells migrate from the yolk sac, around the hindgut to the gonadal ridges after 4-6 weeks of
5gui | gestation and begin mitotic proliferation during this migration. This indifferent gonad stage lasts about 7- 10 days by which time the germ cell number has increased to approximately 10,000. Gonadal differentiation is directed by a genetic program involving hundreds of genes initiated in the indifferent gonad. Oogonial proliferation and oocyte formation requires expression of the WNT4 and RSPO1 genes that activate the beta-catenin signaling pathway leading to loss of cell-cell adhesion between the female germ cells, thus allowing them to enter meiosis (discussed below). In the male, the Sry gene inhibits Wnt4 gene expression in the indifferent gonad and promotes the male sexual development program. In the female fetus, the wolffian duct regresses and the müllerian duct differentiates in a cranial to caudal (head to tail) direction into oviduct, uterus, cervix, and upper one-third of the vagina. The developmental processes that occur to bring about this organogenesis are under the control of steroid hormones that regulate key developmental genes. Since the anatomy of the female reproductive system (Figures 1 and 2) is a reflection of its physiology, this chapter will commence with a review of female anatomy.
82qc | The major organs of the female reproductive system include:
ls7d | · Genital Tract
tzt3 | · Ovaries
t8vv | · Pituitary
qvnu | A. The Genital tract
kggw | The genital tract is composed of the vagina, cervix, uterus and oviduct. These organs share the same basic structural anatomy.
xrd1 | a) A protective outer serosal layer
5746 | b) A middle wall of smooth muscle
7toz | c) An inner mucosal layer
j346 | The characteristics of the muscular and mucosal layers vary greatly between the three organs and undergo dramatic changes in response to the cyclic secretions of the ovarian hormones.
v8uq | I. The Vagina
x972 | The vagina forms the entrance into the female reproductive tract. It consists of a muscular canal approximately 10 cm in length that connects the uterus to the exterior (Figures 1 & 2). The superior portion is called the fornix and meets the protruding uterine cervix.
cwrw | · The vaginal wall is lined by an outer, fibrous adventitia and is amazingly elastic, allowing it to function as:
4i0e | > the birth canal during parturition
h2l3 | > an excretory duct for the passage of menstrual components
dfzb | A the site of sperm deposition after coitus
u6ty | . Smooth muscle layers lie under the inner mucosal layer and are arranged in poorly defined circular and longitudinal layers with the majority of the fibers orientated longitudinally. The smooth muscle assists in the parturition process and in the subsequent involution of the vagina after
