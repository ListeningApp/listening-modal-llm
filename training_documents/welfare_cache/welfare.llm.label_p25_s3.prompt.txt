You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

06yq | Microdosing with psychedelics to self-medicate for ADHD symptoms in adults: A naturalistic study

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

meyw | present Dutch welfare administration compared to Norway, but studying their role exclusively between 2000 and 2013/2015 would have shown that the social partners were virtually absent in the Dutch welfare administration (except pension fund boards). These are important arguments for longitudinal studies to draw more balanced conclusions about public sector reform.
2e62 | Our study also raises some further questions for future research. For example, in 2015, well after the crisis of 2008, a reform followed in both countries with a 'revival' of NPG ideas and a focus on decentralization. This raises the question of whether NPG-type reforms are contingent on relatively favourable economic conditions? Another fundamental issue is how different NPG reforms actually are from TPA and NPM? As Lapuente and Van der Walle (2020) argued: "Post-NPM represents a reassertion of old public administration values as well an attempt to remedy some of the disintegrating tendencies associated with NPM, and not an abandonment of NPM reforms." (p.463). Other scholars have theoretically questioned if the models are internally consistent: NPM has at least two faces: market and management (Pollitt and Dan 2011; Mongkol, 2011); and also NPG would have many meanings (Reiter and Klenk 2019; Lapuente and Van der Walle 2020). However, we have shown in this paper that despite internal variety, the NPM and NPG models can be used to uncover convergence and divergence in reform characteristics and their impact on welfare administrations over time.
75y3 | A final issue for further study is about radical - versus incremental reform. Pollitt and Dan (2011, p.47) argued that "The structure of political system may be facilitating or inhibiting for rapid or large-scale reform. The incremental decision-making process in, say, Norway or the Netherlands is more likely to inhibit such reform whereas the centralized, majoritarian system in the UK and a more consensual one is more likely to facilitate reform" (see also, Pollitt and Bouckaert 2017). We found the opposite effect in Norway and the Netherlands, where large- scale reform took place despite the incremental process. Or should we say that radical, large-

q1q2 | scale reform follows up on incremental decision-making that did not lead to consensus? Then it is the stalemate that facilitates a quite sudden, large-scale reform, especially when a political majority wants to leave behind the previous system (see also, Van Gestel and Hillebrand 2011).
cb7r | To foster understanding of public sector reform, these issues need more attention in future comparative research.
