        "content": "3xrq | Secondly, because when a person is given something to do as an assigned or expected activity, how he does it, whether he does it at all, the degree of competence or activity without constant exhortation: all these are diagnostic. One can tell, and the individual himself should be able to tell by self-examination, whether he is progressing or whether he is behaving in an automatic manner. If he finds that he needs constant stimulus of threat or promise, he is not attuning himself in the right manner. If he will conduct himself in a certain manner only providing that he receives a certain amount of attention, he is placing the demand for attention before the study.\n71ji | The many different outward forms which the Teaching has assumed through the generations has had two main reasons behind it\nio2u | First, that according to the time and culture involved, the Teaching must be projected afresh.\nyzkp | Second, and more to our point at this moment, the 'new' forms are adopted partly in order to prevent automatic conformism.\nmww6 | In a real teaching situation the individual is tested and can test himself against the degree of activity, leading to personal volition, which he is able to maintain without indoctrination, repetition, constant appeals.\nb228 | In order to show that they are not \"trained and constantly stimulated', as you call it, and to show that conduct is of inner as well as outer significance, Sufis have adopted the Malamati\nsgdc | (Blameworthy) method of behaviour. A Sufi may deliberately court opprobrium, not for masochistic or attention-arousing purposes, but in order to show others how readily they will respond to outward signals which may have no meaning at all.\nbheg | Similarly, some people working in the dervish path have been called Beshara (Without Law) because they have chosen down the centuries to practise their training privately, and to avoid public stimuli, to indicate that appearances can mean only superficiality.\nf1b7 | TALE OF THE FLY\nzxtk | Saadi reports one quite characteristic example of conduct-teaching, from the life of Hatim al-Asamm: 'The Deaf. Some didacticians, he says, hold that Hatim of Balkh was deaf: do not believe it. One day he saw a fly caught in a web and spoke to it, for the edification of those present, saying that it had been deceived by something attractive and desirable, but had only managed to get itself caught\n0oyk | But this analogy of the human condition was further given point by the audience when they realised that Hatim's attention had been attracted to the buzzing of the fly, which other people could hardly hear: and yet it was he who was supposed to be deaf.\n7uia | Hatim explained that he was not deaf at all. He pretended that he could not hear because then he would not be expected to listen to praise or opposition intended to influence him. If people thought him deaf, those who surrounded him would say what they really thought about him.\n5gs2 | An interesting difference between Sufis and others is that, like sociologists and other scientists carrying out tests, Sufis are able to pretend-to deceive, as some will always have it-while the convention is that people should never pretend to be what they are not: in this case, of course, to be deaf. But the Sufi always points out that while he may pretend to a purpose, to point out a fact, the ordinary person will pretend because he wants people to accept and respect him. His pretence, therefore, is far worse and far less productive, except of deception and self-deception.\nzs60 | The study-course laid down by the teacher for his student, in Sufism, may have degenerated into conformism and automatism in various imitative communities and supposed 'schools', but they are easy to identify. The guidance which the teacher gives, no matter what form it takes and how it may conflict with other people's assumptions of what it is or should be, is the method of learning from a Sufi.\nslkd | The teacher's role is to render himself superfluous to the learner, by helping him to escape from the toils of lesser ideas and of the shallow mind. Until that moment comes, like a guide to a path which is invisible to the learner, the teacher is followed with absolute trust.\nz8m5 | The great Sufi Abdul-Qadir of Gilan stresses, in the seventeenth address of his Futuh al-Ghaib, that this is like the role of the wet-nurse, who has to cease suckling the infant when it is able to eat solid food. When secondary and low-level attachments have vanished, the Seeker goes into a relationship with objective Reality. At this point, continues the Sheikh, there is no further need of the disciple relationship.\nxpwx | Knowing one's own Sincerity\n2gw5 | Q: How can a person know whether he is sincere or not?\nkmws | A: To be a hypocrite is perhaps the worst thing there is. But I can think of something more destructive than that: it is to imagine that one is not false in 'good resolutions'. Neither imagine that you are false, nor lash yourself, for both may be forms of self-indulgence.\nacm4 | Have the courage to recognise that, no matter how many people are impressed by the seeming humility and self-reproach of pious people, the real effort is in knowing about oneself, so that one can do something about it. Once you yield to the comparatively easy way of assuming personal guilt, you may become guilty of amusing yourself, revelling in your worthlessness.\n3ohe | If you do that, people may admire you, they may point you out as a good example, traditional texts may support your thoughts and actions, society may believe that it benefits from your existence - but you could yourself be nowhere.\ng32v | The real people of knowledge can be said to exist for the purpose of indicating to really earnest seekers that a man is really self-deceived when he feels that he is being righteous. They do not exist to paper over the cracks by agreeing that a certain train of thought or series of actions or both are invariable indications of genuine belief and practice.\ncj4f | One of the great Sufis said: 'A saint is a saint unless he knows that he is one.'\ndpfm | The Sufis have throughout the centuries, commanded the respect and understanding of the majority of religious people by insisting that sincerity can never be simply assumed, in oneself or in anyone else. People know the sincerity of themselves and others by observations of acts and study of thoughts, and testing of words against performance.\n8wzw | The superficially religious apply 'tests' for sincerity which enable ignorance and misunderstanding to continue.\nsjud | THE BEDOUIN TEACHER\n9tsv | Rumi brings us a fine analogy of this, showing how people in judging things from ignorance of the facts, come to false conclusions.\njfnw | In this tale, a bedouin was listening to another man saying prayers. He began by repeating a passage from the Koran, where it is said, in Chapter Nine ('Repentance') verses ninety-seven onwards:\nks3n | 'The Arabs of the desert are the worst in unbelief and hypocrisy ... '\ndn5k | Infuriated, the Arab gave him a blow on the head.\nmckq | The man at prayer continued the quotation, coming to the passage:\npyyq | ... But some of the desert Arabs believe in God and in the Last Day ..\ngo3k | That's better!' said the bedouin, 'now I have taught you how to behave .. . '\n2guv | Here the bedouin stands for the superficial and assumption-prone part of the mind of the literalist religious person, whose 'faith' seems demonstrably based on conduct, and whose assessment of the faith of others is based on his own imagination of what the other person's beliefs mean.\nc0a6 | Rumi's bedouin-and our questioner about sincerity - could have made this test, had they known of it, to think of the aphorism:\njhhh | 'If you think that you are not self-deluded, just check whether you think well of yourself or not.'\nwbtk | The Would-Be and Should-be people",
