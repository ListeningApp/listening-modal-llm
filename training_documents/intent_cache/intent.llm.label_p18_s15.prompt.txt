You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

w1w1 | Sustaining the therapeutic relationship is an ongoing task that does not focus solely on interpersonal events. The therapeutic relationship process that occurs outside of the interpersonal events is the macro dimension of the inter- personal process of therapy.
h8gv | Responding to the immediate events that occur during therapy is the micro dimension. Responding to these in- terpersonal events of therapy requires that the therapist detects the occurrence of an event, reads the client's re- action to the event, and decides on an appropriate way to address the event with the client.
kwkp | Both the micro and macro scales of therapeutic inter- action play a critical role in the overall process of occu- pational therapy. Moreover, they are interrelated. That is, the nature of the therapeutic relationship has an influence on how the client interprets and how the therapist re- sponds to interpersonal events; and, in turn, interpersonal events and their resolution either enhance or detract from the therapeutic relationship.
yj0m | In some cases, the two scales of interaction are difficult to differentiate. For example, some therapy relationships last only one or two sessions. In these cases, a therapist must work to respond to a client and to interpersonal events with much more vigilance and self-control be- cause a more stable underlying therapeutic relationship does not yet exist. Moreover, the interpersonal events and their resolution during the therapy sessions are the major

oczy | In most cases, however, therapy continues during a period of weeks or months, allowing the development of some kind of predictable pattern or usual way of interact- ing within the therapeutic relationship. That therapeutic relationship is infused and shaped by interpersonal events that occur in the moment-by-moment therapy process. It is also influenced by the characteristics and behaviors the client and therapist bring to the relationship as well as by the circumstances surrounding the relationship. These circumstances include such factors as the nature and unfolding of the client's impairment and the context (e.g., school, rehabilitation setting, home, work) in which the therapy takes place.
2ttg | It is the therapist's responsibility to manage and con- tinually strive to fortify the therapeutic relationship and to seek optimal resolutions to interpersonal events in therapy. The stability and success of a therapeutic rela- tionship cannot be assumed. Rather, it begins early in treatment with attempts by the therapist to build rapport, followed by other efforts to develop a relationship that meets the client's immediate interpersonal needs and is appropriate in terms of the circumstances of therapy and the demands of the treatment setting. Recognizing and sustaining a successful therapeutic relationship might in- clude such things as:
his3 | Sharing certain interpersonal rituals that facilitate bonding (e.g., paying a visit to a garden or other favor- ite locale within the client's setting each time before the ending of therapy)
m50z | Witnessing the client enjoying or benefiting from therapy
me84 | Sharing mutual feelings of respect, admiration, or appreciation
o56m | Feeling interested and engaged in the therapy process
slz6 | Â· Being open and comfortable digressing during therapy for discussion, venting, or advice-seeking about events in his or her personal life (without interfering with progress toward goals)
90k5 | Being able to discuss and overcome the interpersonal events that might otherwise challenge the relationship
9m8s | Â· Having a long-standing private joke with a client
893y | Sharing a certain intensity of eye contact that commu- nicates mutual trust
favz | Noticing a certain way a client laughs that conveys her
7szx | Chapter 3 A Model of the Intentional Relationship 69
hx9e | These are only a few examples among myriad factors that might contribute to a successful therapeutic relationship. It is the responsibility of the therapist to be vigilant to explore, identify, and sustain the factors that contribute to a relationship that supports positive therapy outcomes.
ywn2 | This is not to say that the client does not make posi- tive contributions to the therapeutic relationship. In most instances, clients bring important or essential character- istics and behaviors into the relationship. However, the fundamental difference is that it is the therapist who must assume the ultimate responsibility for ensuring that the relationship is positive. By assuming this responsibility, the therapist creates a space in the relationship wherein a client can be vulnerable, distressed, frustrated, or angry without fearing that the relationship will be ruptured. Moreover, this does not mean that the therapist assumes an expert or authoritative stance in the relationship. Rather, it means that the therapist must assume responsi- bility for the caring within the relationship.
a63r | The enduring aspects of the therapeutic relationship are systematically built and fortified because of naturally occurring variables in the relationship (similar interper- sonal styles or interpersonal chemistry or other optimal circumstances and timing) and because of the therapist's consistent efforts to build the relationship in the face of the inevitable interpersonal events and challenges that occur. If the therapist's efforts to build a relationship are successful and the client is not particularly sensitive, untrusting, or otherwise vulnerable, the therapeutic re- lationship becomes stronger through time and is more likely to withstand interpersonal events that would other- wise challenge or strain the relationship.
dqvj | For any number of reasons, however, the therapeutic relationship may not develop adequately to endure threats caused by the interpersonal events that routinely emerge during therapy. Signs that there is difficulty in the ther- apeutic relationship may include, but are not limited to:
r17u | Â· Change in affect, attitude, or interpersonal behavior
3c47 | Becoming disengaged from therapy
g345 | Appearing or feeling impatient, irritable, or angry
svhz | Experiencing therapy as "boring"
oaen | Questioning the utility of the therapy
5u67 | Â· Feeling questioning or criticism is excessive
dvms | Dreading or becoming apprehensive about the next

tf43 | Having a desire to refer or terminate prematurely
fcco | Developing conflict with the client
8uji | Â·Noticing client's attendance pattern changes or declines
df3e | There are several potential reasons that difficulty may emerge within the therapeutic relationship. For example, a client may bring a particular interpersonal history into the treatment relationship that makes it difficult for the therapist to establish rapport in ways that usually work. Conversely, the client may be mistrustful of the thera- pist because of the circumstances under which he is being seen. For example, a client may have been mandated by an insurance company to receive an evaluation for work potential, and the client perceives that the therapist has tremendous power to influence his life (i.e., whether he continues to receive disability support). Alternatively, a therapist may have a negative reaction to a client because the client reminds the therapist of someone with whom the therapist has had a difficult relationship in the past. General sources of difficulty within the relationship may include, but are not limited to:
53eu | Client brings a difficult interpersonal history into the relationship or has an Axis II diagnosis.
a5u1 | Circumstances under which client is being seen are threatening or pressured (i.e., an evaluation is being conducted for the purpose of verifying disability to an insurance company).
ry7u | There is a poor match between client's and therapist's interpersonal styles.
5mda | There is an inability to overcome challenges caused by differences in culture, values, or worldview.
i4li | Client or therapist reminds the other of someone with whom he or she had a negative experience.
r8sm | Client or therapist disappoints or fails to meet expectations.
cuin | Client or therapist inadvertently says or does some- thing that is perceived as injurious, and the situation is not processed and resolved.
n1i7 | These and other obstacles to a more stable enduring re- lationship with a client are only intensified by inevitable interpersonal events. Examples of events that are likely to further stress an already-vulnerable therapy relationship include such things as a therapist's unanticipated absence for a period of time, a common misunderstanding that
0r5m | occurs between client and therapist, a comment or ques- tion that is perceived by the client as insensitive or in- appropriate, or an unexpected personal crisis that causes the client to regress or temporarily relinquish treatment goals. Although they are normal and inevitable examples of difficult aspects of therapy, the way in which the ther- apist responds to them is a powerful mediator of the final outcome.
ne2o | Irrespective of the extent to which the therapeutic relationship process is stable and strong, the process of therapeutic responding to interpersonal events is essential to good therapy. If a therapist does not respond adequately to interpersonal events or challenges to the relationship, the process of occupational engagement may suffer, and the therapeutic relationship process quickly erodes.
sqxn | For the duration of the therapy process, the therapist must engage in a process of interpersonal reasoning. In- terpersonal reasoning is the process by which a therapist consciously and reflectively monitors both the therapeu- tic relationship and the interpersonal events of therapy in order to decide on and enact appropriate interpersonal strategies. Chapter 7 discusses the interpersonal reason- ing process in detail.
6pmo | Intentional Relationship Model: 10 Underlying Principles
195r | The IRM defines the most critical components of the client-therapist relationship as it occurs in occupational therapy. In addition to its central elements and mecha- nisms, 10 fundamental principles underlie the concep- tualization of this model (Box 3.1). They are explained in the following sections. Each principle specifies unique assumptions about how the client-therapist relationship is approached. Collectively, the principles should be kept actively in mind anytime the model is applied during an interaction with a client.
kqmi | Principle 1: Critical Self-Awareness Is Key to the Intentional Use of Self
g8rd | Developing critical self-awareness involves having a work- ing knowledge of your interpersonal tendencies while interacting with clients of different interpersonal styles and under different conditions and circumstances. These interpersonal tendencies may manifest in one's emo- tional reactions to others and in one's verbalizations and

wjuz | nonverbal behavior. Critical self-awareness also requires understanding how your interpersonal reactions and be- haviors change, become attenuated, or become amplified in awkward, tense, or stressful situations. Understanding yourself in these highly detailed and variegated ways is not easy to achieve. Nevertheless, this understanding is critical to developing interpersonal skills that are per- ceived as therapeutic by clients.
3yxv | The difficulty involved in achieving critical self-awareness is illustrated by research findings that ther- apists are usually not accurate in their self-estimation of the extent to which they convey an attitude of care and empathy toward their clients (Burns & Auerbach, 1996; Orlinsky, 1994). In studies of psychotherapy, empathy was linked to positive outcomes only if it was perceived by the client; therapist self-ratings of empathy were not associ- ated with positive outcomes (Burns & Auerbach, 1996).
d8zj | Chapter 3 A Model of the Intentional Relationship 71
ywxn | Because therapists are not always accurate self-estimators of their own interpersonal capacities, merely considering oneself to be a caring and empathic therapist does not offer adequate assurance that an effective interpersonal process has occurred in therapy. Many of us have proba- bly had the opportunity to know someone whose caring behavior toward us was fully spontaneous, sincere, and heartfelt but nevertheless largely missed what we most needed at the time.
uxhs | Truly effective use of self hinges on ongoing criti- cal awareness of your interpersonal behavior and emo- tional reactions to clients. This includes a mindfulness concerning:
ed6e | Â·What you are communicating verbally (content, choice of words, types of questions asked)
6qqm | Â· What you are communicating nonverbally (stance or sitting posture, positioning of arms and legs, angle of torso and head in relation to the client, gestures, extent and pace of body movements)
onum | Â· What you are communicating emotionally (tone, tenor, and volume of voice; facial expression; extent to which emotion is shown or shared)
3iir | Â· What you are withholding, limiting, or otherwise not communicating and the implications of these kinds of noncommunication for the therapeutic interaction
7a0a | Principle 2: Interpersonal Self-Discipline Is Fundamental to Effective Use of Self
o1qp | Achieving critical self-awareness is necessary for effective therapeutic relationships, but it is not sufficient. Thera- pists must also have the courage to seek and respond to interpersonal feedback from clients in a manner that re- flects a dynamic, second-by-second recognition of what the client needs at any given moment. These abilities to anticipate, measure, and respond to the effects of ongo- ing communications with a client is most succinctly char- acterized as interpersonal self-discipline. Interpersonal self-discipline is fundamental to the use of self because it allows a therapist to develop stable, predictable relation- ships with clients. It allows a client to trust that the ther- apist has the ability to place his or her own interpersonal reactions and expectations aside to best fulfill what the client wishes to take from the relationship.

xv78 | 72 Part 1 Theoretical Foundations and Guidelines for Practice
sdks | A critical aspect of interpersonal self-discipline in- volves acting on your awareness of your reactions to interpersonally challenging clients whose interpersonal behavior does not meet your expectations or tends to be negative. These clients may be particularly emotional, hy- persensitive, defensive, demanding, critical, manipulative, difficult to manage, or otherwise vulnerable. Therapists differ among and within themselves regarding:
y8fb | Â·What kinds of client behaviors and emotions are expe- rienced as difficult
521q | The extent to which they feel comfortable managing these different types of difficult interpersonal behaviors
yogo | Some therapists find it easier to work with an emotionally sad client than an angry client, whereas the opposite may be true for another therapist. Interpersonal self-discipline involves knowing the types of client and the situations that are most likely to test your interpersonal resolve and emotional perspective. Once you are familiar with your own vulnerabilities, you can more effectively prepare yourself emotionally and psychologically before interact- ing with these clients. In addition, you can more read- ily seek support, advice, and guidance from mentors and peers when treating difficult clients.
2285 | Collectively, the actions you take toward self- preparation and self-management in the face of inter- personally difficult clients helps ensure that the ways in which you choose to interact with these clients will be optimally therapeutic. This decreases the likelihood that you will unwittingly act out your own negative feelings toward a difficult client. For example, a therapist once shared that she felt less guilty about precipitously chang- ing an appointment with a client in order to meet an out-of-town friend for lunch because the client tended to behave in demanding ways and had recently ques- tioned her approach. Changing an appointment with a client for a nonurgent matter is not a disciplined way of managing one's feelings toward a client. Moreover, changing the appointment with an already-difficult client may lead to increased tension in the relationship. Another example is the extent to which one may make special efforts on behalf of a client. It is generally easier to make these extra efforts for clients whom one likes and sees as investing a great deal in the therapy. How- ever, depriving the difficult client or the client who is not invested in therapy of one's extra effort is not justified ethically.
ys0g | Table 3.4 contains additional examples of difficult in- terpersonal behaviors that clients commonly exhibit, typ- ical emotional reactions a therapist might have to such behavior, and undisciplined versus disciplined ways in which therapists can behave in response.
