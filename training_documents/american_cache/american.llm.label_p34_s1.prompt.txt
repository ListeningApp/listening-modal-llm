You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

ccpt | page. The maps of Delaware and Rhode Island covered as much paper space as did the maps of Maine and Pennsylvania. Optically, then, the state maps repeated the same cartographic designs that initially had been reserved for the national map. Like the national map, the state map turned on a binary structure of territorial representation, privileging the state's visual outline over its verbal identification, its geographical over its political anatomy, its interior over its exterior relations.
0fpw | United States atlas maps here seem to confirm the Federalist and Anti- federalist fear that even those writing systems that ceased to subordinate the reading experience to an exclusively alphabetical order were still inca- pable of representing the idea of a new nation-state in immediate and unambiguous terms. While the image of the national map seemed to uphold the constitutional principle of checks and balances (maps repre- sented states optically in equal terms), the state map appeared to under- cut the Federalist ideal of national unity by projecting the thirteen (or more) states as separate nations and unrelated to the larger union. The pictorial rhetoric of the national map failed to offer a design that estab- lished a hierarchical relationship between the union and state. Unable to give precedence to either unit, the medium of the map potentially under- cuts its symbolic power by signifying opposite values: even as its visual rhetoric could serve as a tool of national integration, it also could promote the union's disintegration.
dqn8 | The ambiguity surrounding the image of the national map grew out of the post-Revolutionary debates over the issue of statehood. Federalists, Antifederalists, and local patriots like Thomas Jefferson were equally in- vested in the rhetorical trope of the national map, but for very different reasons. If we turn to the constitutional debate first, the national map appeared in the two opposing literatures-John Jay's Federalist No. 2 and the Agrippa Letters by James Winthrop-that were influencing both public opinion and the text of the Constitution itself. Jay invoked the map as a metaphor in order to persuade his audience of the Republic's natural predisposition to unity. As if he were reading one of the schoolbook maps, Jay traces out the geographical body of the new nation-state:
cop0 | It has often given me pleasure to observe, that independent America was not composed of detached and distant territories, but that one connected, fertile, wide-spreading country was the portion of our west- ern sons of liberty. Providence has in a particular manner blessed it with a variety of soils and productions, and watered it with innumer-

82ju | able streams, for the delight and accommodation of its inhabitants. A succession of navigable waters forms a kind of chain round its borders, as if to bind it together.
y2qo | In Jay's word map, natural boundaries become indistinguishable from the artificially imposed political ones. In a move that anticipates Fichte's call for the "external frontiers" of the state to become the "internal fron- tiers" of the citizen, Jay transforms his cartographic vision of connected- ness into a vision of cultural uniformity: "With equal pleasure I have as often taken notice, that Providence has been pleased to give this one connected country to one united people-a people descended from the same ancestors, speaking the same language, professing the same reli- gion, attached to the same principles of government, very similar in their manners and customs." Implicit in his word map is the dialectical as- sumption that, by mapping the territory of the nation, the latter's inven- tory consisting of language, religion, and custom becomes inflected by the terms of the national map. Just as the word map upholds the imagi- nary fusion of "one connected country to one united people," Jay suggests that in order for Americans to imagine the United States they would have to interweave two different linguistic systems: if English was the language spoken by the "people," the word map emerged as the second language of "the country."33
1piq | The motive of Jay's deferral to geographical literacy is his desire to shorten the enormous distance separating many of the new Republic's constitutive parts. Jay's word map seeks to deflect the Antifederalist ar- gument that, as a federal union that models itself upon the classical re- public, the United States would be ungovernable because of its over- extended size. Geographical dimension was the standard argument made by Antifederalists like James Winthrop, who invoked the image of the national map to dismantle the Federalist argument of unity. "The idea of an uncompounded republick, on an average, one thousand miles in length, and eight hundred in breadth, and containing six millions of white inhabitants all reduced to the same standard of morals, or habits,
7fqw | This content downloaded from 154.59.124.74 on Thu, 17 Aug 2023 21:53:33 +00:00 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms
rhaz | and of laws, is in itself an absurdity, and contrary to the whole experience of mankind." For Winthrop, the new nation's geography was politically debilitating, and the national map was the proof demonstrating the flaw in the Federalists' argument. It illustrated in certain terms how the geo- graphical or, rather, natural dimensions of the United States would un- dermine the union's political structure and seriously impede the forma- tion of a republican government. Because large distances separated the states from each other, it would prohibit political participation inside the union; looking at the national map revealed that distance would prevent the equal application of federal power, hindering the union's task to su- pervise the new citizens or to reconcile federal and state interests.34
wak1 | But, while both Jay and Winthrop cited the national map in the forensic sense as proof of the feasibility or unfeasibility of a greater continental polity, the map's rhetorical clout had already become seriously defused in the writings of local patriots like Thomas Jefferson. His Notes on the State of Virginia (1785) reveals how, through the practice of cartographic writ- ing, the state of Virginia emerged as a geopolitical construct sharing the identical symbolic and discursive attributes that Webster, Morse, and the authors of the Federalist papers ascribed to the national map.
wtfz | From the start, Jefferson locates the Notes inside the map image of Virginia; he opens his first query with the verbal recitation of the "Bound- aries of Virginia," which corresponded to a manuscript map that had accompanied the original draft. Acknowledging that both his own notes and map drawings might be compromised, Jefferson grounds the author- ity of his Notes in two specific cartographic texts. When he states in his fourth query, "For the particular geography of our mountains I must refer to Fry and Jefferson's map of Virginia; and to Evans's analysis of his map of America for a more philosophical view of them," Jefferson refers the reader to his father's Map of the Most Inhabited Part of Virginia (1753) and the mapmaker's manual Geographical, Historical, Political, Philosophical, and Mechanical Essays (1755) by Lewis Evans.35

5bjs | In the chapter "On Rivers" Jefferson presents yet another argument for the way in which post-Revolutionary Americans embraced the map as a writing system superior to the English language and conventional literary forms, in this case the practice of note-taking and verbal description. Before describing the rivers of Virginia, Jefferson deliberately cautions the reader against his verbal efforts, because "an inspection of a map of Vir- ginia, will give a better idea of the geography of its rivers, than any descrip- tion in writing." Jefferson encourages readers to consult maps rather than his own text because, unlike any other form of "description in writing," only maps are capable of communicating the idea of rivers in ways that normal language could not-immediately and yet mediated, undistorted and yet artificially represented. Ever wary of language as a means of com- munication, Jefferson indicates that in order to ensure the proper repre- sentation of the state of Virginia he must defer his own writing to the signs and script of cartographic writing.36
uodj | While the map thus answered Jefferson's authorial scruples in much the same vein as it did for the framers of the Constitution a few years later, it also enabled Jefferson to appropriate the greater discourse of cartogra- phy as the foundation of state representation. In Query 13, writing on "the constitution of the state, and its several charters," Jefferson invokes the figure of the map as the state's original text. By citing the cartographically represented space of Virginia rather than history as the state's genealogi- cal source of origin, he points to the language of cartography as the ideal agent of political mediation and representation. Moreover, when Jeffer- son concedes that the state's founding document was written at a time when "we were new and unexperienced in the science of government," he is quick to add that it was due to cartographic writing that Virginians discovered "very capital defects" in the constitution.37

b2lm | By the end of this query, the implied map image of Virginia, though invisible throughout the Notes as such, has fulfilled the demand of eighteenth-century national ideologies. Jefferson's rhetorical use of the map facilitated the narrative fusion of the state's external boundaries with those of the individual citizen. The implied map image had succeeded in dividing the state into local working units (counties); its writing system implicitly was preventing "injury" among the state's citizens; and, more important, it had laid the groundwork for depicting Virginia as a homoge- nous culture working the land collectively (a point Jefferson further elabo- rated in Query 19). Jefferson's Notes thus illustrates how during the early decades the very terms surrounding the idea of nation were flexible. For Jefferson, the semantic application of "nation" was as dynamic and con- stitutive a concept as that of "state." Cartographic writing allowed Jeffer- son to keep alive this definitional uncertainty. As the word map of Virginia furthered Jefferson's sectionalist argument, it also prepared the argu- ment for one of Jefferson's future political goals: the guarantee of auton- omy for the individual state inside the proposed unified superstate.38
ti7f | What neither Jay, Winthrop, nor Jefferson had foreseen was the fact that the national map as a specialized print form controlled its potential for divisiveness; it functioned like a proleptic device, asserting the pri- macy of the union while anticipating and containing the local desire for self-definition. During the period marked by the constitutional debate and the tumult over states' rights, commercial mapmakers as well as ordinary map readers developed the nation's cartographic image into a hieroglyphic sign consisting exclusively of the nation's territorial outline. Indeed, as I will show below, in the hands of American statesmen and students alike the national map became what Benedict Anderson has identified as an avatar of modern nationalism, the "map-as-logo."39

wtow | In the United States, one of the first examples showing the nation as a pure sign and logo appeared in William McMurray's wall map, The United States according to the Definitive Treaty of Peace Signed at Paris (1784) (Fig- ure 39). In this map the nation's topographic image enters into a com- parative dialogue with an inset map (on the lower right) showing the North American continent and its division into geopolitical units. The inset map distinguishes the new political nation-state from the continent by outlining its territory as a blank space bearing the bold print label "UNITED STATES." While the inset map thus announces the map title in lieu of a cartouche, when placed in relation to the larger national map the dialogue shifts the reader's attention from the comparatively locative stance (how do I find myself on the map?) to the more competitive and possessive stance (this map shows my country!). Its blankness erases local knowledge, regional claims, and above all the fact that the national space was not fully under federal control (west of the Allegheny Mountains, Native American nations were still officially masters of their domains). Through the map's metanarrative between the geographic and the inset parts, McMurray illustrates the way in which the nation's bare, skeletal outline functioned in the sphere of politics as a signifier of reconciliation and containment: the map simultaneously maintained and closed the gap between the nation and the states. 40
o22k | While McMurray's map reached only a limited audience, the material proliferation of the national map vastly aided the dissemination of the United States map as a logo. In particular, the image of the logo map pervaded the self-representational culture of the educated middle class. Examining Ralph Earl's portrait of Mrs. Noah Smith and her family, a closer look reveals that the nation's outline becomes the direct prop of the young man holding the geography book (Figure 40). The pervasiveness of
