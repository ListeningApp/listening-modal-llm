        "content": "l1qt | Traveling - The Ultimate Tone Up While You Travel Eating and Workout Blueprint for getting amazing workouts in with no equipment so you don't feel guilty enjoying yourself.\n183q | How to actually stick with it - The \"Never Fall Off\" Accountability System, the unbeatable system that works without your permission. It's even gotten people who hate coming to the gym to look forward to showing up.\nvdw3 | How To Be Social - The \"Live It Up While Slimming Down\" Eating Out System that will give you the freedom to eat out and live life without feeling like the \"odd man out.\"\n8whh | Total value: Four thousand three hundred fifty-one dollars. All for only five hundred ninety-nine dollars.\niywu | Author Note Most of our facilities now sell this bundle for longer periods of time for two thousand four hundred to five thousand two hundred dollars. Wild. As we got better at creating and monetizing value, the prices and profit of our facilities skyrocketed. Once you start down this value creation process, each additional piece of value you create stacks on top over time. This is why it is important to begin.\nqn1v | Can you see how much more valuable this is than a gym membership? The bundle does three core things:\no9ng | One. Solves all the perceived problems (not just some).\n6od4 | Two. Gives you the conviction that what you're selling is one of a kind (very important).\njx1z | Three. Makes it impossible to compare or confuse your business or offering with the one down the street.\nhrlm | Whew! We finally have what we are going to deliver in all its glory. That being said, it is unlikely we would present it in this way. Depending on whether we sell one on one or one to many, we would present this differently. I will address how to present each of these bundled items in the bonus section (next section).\nwfjt | Summary Points\ng779 | We went through this entire process to accomplish one objective: to create a valuable offer that is differentiated and unable to be compared to anything else in the marketplace. We are selling something unique. As such, we are no longer bound by the normal pricing forces of commoditization. Prospects will now only make a value-based rather than a price-based decision on whether they should buy from us. Hoorah!\nby5l | Now that we have our core offer, the next section will be dedicated to enhancing it. We will employ a combination of psychological levers: bonuses, urgency, scarcity, guarantees, and naming.\nwye3 | SECTION FOUR: ENHANCING YOUR OFFER\noc7w | SCARCITY, URGENCY, BONUSES, GUARANTEES, AND NAMING\nk5k4 | SECTION TWO: PRICING\nwngq | SECTION ONE: HOW WE GOT HERE\nudft | SECTION TWO: VALUE OFFER\nfoay | PROBLEMS SOLUTIONS -> BUNDLE\n43mx | SECTION ONE: EXECUTION\nld7j | SECTION FOUR: ENHANCING\nmf5v | ENHANCING THE OFFER: SCARCITY, URGENCY, BONUSES, GUARANTEES, AND NAMING\nf31w | May twenty nineteen. Arnold Schwarzenegger's home.\nyofz | After School All Stars Fundraiser. The line of cars outside Arnold's house was around the corner ... and we were in one of them. We were sitting in our Uber when a security guard with an earpiece, black suit, and black sunglasses knocked on the driver's window. It was like straight out of a movie.\n4mdw | The driver rolled down the window. \"Name?\" \"Alex and Leila Hormozi.\"\n49f1 | He scanned the list on his clipboard, nodded, then checked off our names. \"Great,\" he said. His demeanor transformed from stern to inviting. \"Welcome to the fundraiser. Stay in this line. You'll make a left, then security will escort you the rest of the way.\"\ncsae | The security guard talked into his walkie talkie to the next post down the road, signaling our car was approved.\nc29v | Pulling up to the front of the estate was like entering into a Bond movie. Lamborghinis, Bugattis, Ferraris, and brands of cars that are too expensive to even speak of. Old guys with young, scantily-clad girls. A-List Actors. Celebrities with millions of followers who were recording themselves as they arrived, talking through their iPhones to their audiences. And us.\ngkgm | The fundraiser was twenty-five thousand dollars per ticket to attend, with an invite list of only one hundred. There was a red carpet and all. Every year, the fundraiser culminated in a big auction for memorabilia and items some of the business owners in the audience gave away for charity.\nswmm | We walked around looking at the entertainment stations purposely devised to get donors in the \"giving mood.\" We saw ten thousand dollar scotches, five hundred dollar cigars, pre-released items from major brands that wouldn't be available to the public until months later. And, of course, the most expensive cuisine you could imagine. Leila and I were just soaking it all in. It was a wonderful night. We definitely felt like cool kids.\ndak5 | Ben, the CEO of the charity, saw us looking lost and walked over. He took me by the arm to introduce me to some of the other donors. These were all men who were older than me and donating one hundred thousand dollars and up without a second thought.\n57sj | The man he introduced me to was one of the charity's biggest donors. He had built an ultra-high end jewelry and watch business. I'm talking one hundred thousand, five hundred thousand, two million dollar plus rare status symbols that people buy only so other zero point zero zero one percenters know they belong. He had donated upwards of seven hundred thousand dollars in merchandise as prizes for the fundraiser that evening.\nqdqk | \"Alex and Leila, meet George,\" Ben said. \"He's been very generous with his time and money to the cause. George, this is Alex and Leila Hormozi. They're donating one million dollars tonight to ASAS. I figured you are both good people and wanted to connect you two.\"\nemd4 | \"Nice to meet you both,\" George said with calm, weathered eyes. He was in his late sixties, tall and sturdily built. You could hear his eastern block origins in his accent. He sounded like a man who had fought tooth and nail to be here, but had softened his demeanor for gatherings such as these. But the tiger with teeth and claws remained under the surface, ready to be called upon at a moment's notice. I felt like I understood this guy.\nm9fu | Ben broke the ice. \"So ... George was the one who got me to raise the price from fifteen thousand dollars per ticket to twenty-five thousand dollars. We had more demand than ever this year. But I took his advice. I cut the amount of tickets we sold and raised the prices.\"\nb3ph | \"That's right,\" said George, content that his sage business advice had been followed.\n9j3h | \"When demand increases, cut supply.\" He perked up slightly as we talked about money.\nq1lo | This man had built his business from nothing and had found ways to sell things for extraordinary profits by understanding human psychology. I had long learned about supply and demand, but this guy was using its psychological underpinnings to fuel a fundraising. You could take the tiger out of the jungle, but not the jungle out of the tiger.",
