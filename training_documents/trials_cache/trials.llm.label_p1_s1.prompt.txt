You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

06yq | Microdosing with psychedelics to self-medicate for ADHD symptoms in adults: A naturalistic study
dpv6 | ARTICLE INFO
8r5j | ABSTRACT
2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

o2kr | 1 Objectives

936l | · Understand the importance of the size of a trial to provide reliable results
06yq | . Explain the key factors in determining the required size for a particular trial
dpv6 | · Discuss the importance of power for sample size calculations

r5il | 2 Introduction
5gui | In previous sessions the focus has been on the importance of randomisation, control groups and blinding (where appropriate) to avoid bias in the results from a clinical trial. A further key issue in the design of a clinical trial is ensuring there are sufficient numbers of patients.
82qc | The aim of a trial should be to provide reliable evidence of the effectiveness and safety of a treatment. To achieve this, enough patients are needed in our trial to give a good chance of detecting a clinically important treatment difference if such a difference exists, while being able to reasonably conclude that no such difference exists if our results do not show it.
ls7d | Given the importance of sample size there are several approaches that can be taken to answer the question "How many patients do we need?". For example:
tzt3 | (1) Statistical/scientific approach. This approach is concerned with determining how many patients are needed to get firm evidence of a treatment difference if it exists, and to estimate any difference precisely (i.e. within a sufficiently small confidence interval (CI)).
t8vv | (2) Economic/pragmatic approach. In reality, other constraints will impact on the ability to recruit the numbers required from a purely statistical approach. For example, how many patients are available, and how much time, effort and cost is involved?
qvnu | (3) Ethical approach. In many clinical trials decisions need to be made as to how long it is ethical to continue a trial. The question that might be asked here is "How soon can we stop a trial to avoid some patients getting inferior treatment?". This will be dealt with in detail in session 4: "Data Monitoring".
kggw | (4) Credibility. If a trial is very small, it's results may not be seen as providing believable evidence.
xrd1 | 3.1
5746 | In determining the required size of a trial all of the above approaches are usually considered, but this session is mainly concerned with (1) the statistical approach. The compromises to be made between purely scientific objectives and practical constraints, and the implications of trials which are too small will also be considered.
7toz | In order to appreciate the impact of sample size for interpreting trial results consider the table below showing the results from two placebo-controlled trials assessing the impact of streptokinase for reducing mortality in patients who have experienced a myocardial infarction (MI).
j346 | Table 1: Results from the 1st Australian and ISIS-2 trials for reducing mortality post-MI
v8uq | <LATEX>p < 0 . 0 0 0 1</LATEX> <LATEX>R i s k \quad r a t i o = 0 . 7 7 \left( 9 5 C I \quad 0 . 7 0 \quad t o \quad 0 . 8 4 \right)</LATEX> The estimated treatment effect is very similar in the two trials. Further, the proportions of patients who die in the two trials are also very similar. However, while the ISIS-2 trial provides very strong evidence of a treatment effect with <LATEX>\mathrm { p } < 0 . 0 0 0 1</LATEX> and a tight confidence interval, the 1st Australian trial is unconvincing with <LATEX>p = 0 . 3 2</LATEX> and a wide confidence interval. Even though more than 500 patients were recruited, the trial was too small in these circumstances.
x972 | 3 Key factors in determining the required sample size
cwrw | The previous section indicated the impact the size of a trial can have on the interpretation of results. In particular, trials which are too small lead to results which are inconclusive. There are a number of key factors that determine the required size of a trial and in particular there are five key questions that need to be asked. In order to illustrate these factors, the UK PACE study in fitting a dual chamber vs. single chamber pacemaker for patients with atrioventricular block is used.
4i0e | Note that while questions (2) and (5) are more technical these are fairly standard whereas questions (3) and (4) are perhaps the most important and difficult to address. The answers to these two questions will have the most impact on the required size as will be shown later in the session.
h2l3 | (1) What is the principal outcome measure of the trial?
dfzb | In designing a trial, a suitable primary outcome measure is chosen to reflect the main purpose of conducting the trial. The sample size requirements need to be based on this outcome measure in order to reliably address the prime purpose of the trial.
u6ty | For example, in the UK PACE trial the purpose was to assess whether dual chamber pacing could reduce mortality compared to the more usual single chamber by comparing mortality at four years.
awvu | 3.2
on9b | (2) How will the data be analysed to detect a treatment difference?
a8ge | Some thought should be given to the appropriate analysis for the outcome being measured. For example, is the outcome the occurrence of some event (e.g. death) or a continuous outcome (e.g. blood pressure). In addition, the level of statistical significance that will be accepted as indicating evidence of a treatment difference should also be considered. This is usually set at 5% i.e. if the final p-value <0.05 then this would be accepted as there being some evidence for a real treatment effect.
h27a | For, example, the simplest analysis for the UK PACE trial is a comparison between the groups of the percentage of patients who die within four years of randomisation using a <LATEX>x ^ { 2 }</LATEX> test. A 5% significance level was used.
pdjh | (3) What results are expected in the control group?
xmgs | Clearly the results that will be observed in the control arm will not be known. However, there may well be information from previous trials or observational studies as to what might be expected.
bd9h | For example, in the UK PACE trial it was expected that 24% of patients would die by four years in the single chamber group.
m047 | (4) How small a treatment difference, if it exists, is important to detect?
gy8c | This is perhaps the key decision that needs to be taken in determining sample size. If a very large treatment difference exists, then this can be detected with relatively few numbers. For example, in the UK PACE trial if the dual chamber pacing reduced mortality by three-quarters (i.e. from 24% to 6%) then relatively few patients are needed (in fact less than 200). Of course, such a difference is unlikely and, more importantly, a difference much smaller than this would be clinically very important to detect if it were true.
y4mj | It could be argued that any difference would be important to detect but this is unrealistic as huge trials would be required (an example of this will be given later). What needs to be decided upon is the smallest clinically relevant difference that would be important to detect if it were true.
vpgq | For example, in the UK PACE trial it was decided that a one quarter reduction (i.e. from 24% to 18%) would be clinically important to detect.
ousl | (5) What degree of certainty is needed to be able to detect the treatment difference in (4)?
m4ju | In a clinical trial conclusions are based on observed treatment effects rather than the true, unknown effects. These observed effects could be larger (i.e. further away from the null hypothesis of no effect) but could also be smaller (i.e. closer to the null hypothesis of no effect) than the true effects. The trials need to give a good chance of providing evidence for a treatment difference even if the observed effects are smaller than the true effects. The chances of this can be improved by increasing the numbers in our trial.
a0mb | For example, the investigators in the UK PACE trial wanted to be 90% sure of picking up a statistically significant (at <LATEX>\left. p < 0 . 0 5 \right)</LATEX> result if a true difference of 24% vs. 18% existed.
ki8m | 3.3
km8w | In total, the UK PACE trial needed to recruit approximately 2000 patients to satisfy the above criteria as will be seen in later sections.
wzno | 4 Type I and type II errors
xagm | Note the true population values in each treatment group are not known but in calculating the sample size some estimate of these values are needed based on the alternative hypothesis. In the following sections the observed and anticipated percentages will be distinguished using the following notation:
iwn5 | p1 = the observed percentage in those on standard treatment <LATEX>p _ { 2 } = t h</LATEX> observed percentage in those on 'new' treatment
uooz | i.e. <LATEX>p _ { 1 } - p _ { 2 }</LATEX> is the observed treatment effect (observed absolute percentage reduction on 'new' treatment)
pxbq | <LATEX>\pi _ { 1 } =</LATEX> percentage in those on standard treatment <LATEX>\pi _ { 2 } =</LATEX> anticipated percentage in those on 'new' treatment
jfsr | i.e. <LATEX>\pi _ { 1 } - \pi _ { 2 }</LATEX> is the true difference which has been decided it is important to detect
u15r | Further notations are as follows:
lq35 | α = significance level for detecting a difference (usually set at 0.05 (or 5%))
3g9w | 1-ß = degree of certainty that a true difference of <LATEX>\pi _ { 1 } - \pi _ { 2 }</LATEX> would be detected i.e. the power (often aim for 1- <LATEX>\beta = 0 . 9</LATEX> (or 90% power))
d09o | Consider the table below. Ideally, the results of the trial should fall either:
ylhz | (i) in the top left hand cell of the table, i.e. if, in truth, no difference exists (the null hypothesis), then no evidence for a difference is observed in the trial, or
a3td | (ii) in the bottom right hand cell of the table, i.e. if, in truth, a difference of <LATEX>\pi _ { 1 } - \pi _ { 2 }</LATEX> does exist (the alternative hypothesis), then evidence for a difference is observed in the trial.
ex5k | These are marked by <LATEX>X</LATEX> in the table.
9d4o | Table 2: Observed trial results compared to the 'truth' of (i) no difference
cjq2 | (ii) a true <LATEX>\pi _ { 1 } - \pi _ { 2 }</LATEX> difference
5esx | Truth
m5ka | No significant difference observed Significant difference observed
byu8 | <LATEX>X</LATEX> 3.4
76b0 | However, there are two particular types of errors that can be made in interpreting trial results. These are referred to as type I and type II errors.
zxz6 | · Type I error. A type I error is when a treatment difference is claimed based on a statistically significant observed result when in truth no such difference exists i.e. a false positive result.
xnth | . Type II error. A type II error is when in truth there exists a difference of T1 - 72 but the observed results fail to reach statistical significance, i.e. a false negative result.
vafm | Alternative ways of describing a and B are as follows and represented in the table below:
2zmw | a is the risk of a type I error ß is the risk of a type II error. As mentioned previously, 1- ß is termed statistical power.
bf9k | Table 3: Risk of type I and type II errors based on (i) the null hypothesis being true
otkr | (ii) the alternative hypothesis being true
ibgs | No significant difference observed
colo | Significant difference observed a
d6r4 | It needs to be decided in advance what levels will be set for a and 1-ß and in the following sections the influences of the choice of these on the required sample size will be demonstrated.
9mrz | 5 Comparing two percentages (or proportions) - power calculation
pk06 | 5.1 Sample size formula using 5% significance and 90% power
7wn9 | Up to now the key factors needed in calculating a sample size have been considered and the concept of power in this process has been introduced.
wcd0 | In the UK PACE example the intended power was set at 90%. This means that if the true underlying percentages are 24% and 18%, there is a 10% probability that the observed results will give p>0.05. This will occur if the observed difference is less than the true difference to the extent that it is more compatible with the null hypothesis of no difference. Some risk of a false negative result has to be accepted (otherwise an infinitely large study is needed).
caos | Note that some risk of a false positive result also has to be accepted: it is quite possible that p<0.05 might be observed even if there is no true treatment difference.
qrvy | 3.5
pn9j | Common choices for a (significance level) and 1-ß (power) are 0.05 and 0.90 respectively as already stated. Based on these choices, the equation to calculate the required sample size in each group for the comparison of two proportions is given below:
1pmc | There are two key notes that you need to be aware of given below.
5z6q | Note 1: The above equation calculates the required number of patients required in each group. Therefore for a trial with two treatments (with equal numbers planned for each group), the required number of patients in total is double this amount.
yeoh | Note 2: Up to this point the outcomes have been considered as percentages. If proportions are preferred in the calculation of the sample size then the above equation must be adapted by substituting '1' in place of '100' throughout.
b8hf | By using the sample size formula above, the total sample size required for the UK PACE trial is 1926 (963 in each group). In practice the UK PACE trial aimed to recruit 2000 patients.
hntf | Note that the aim of a sample size calculation is to approximate the number of patients required rather than provide exact figures. There are several assumptions that need to be made including the anticipated true values which of course cannot be known.
99fo | 5.2 More general formula for any combination of significance and power
y5r7 | The formula given for the comparison for two proportions is based on a type I error of <LATEX>\alpha = 0 . 0 5</LATEX> (equating to a significance level of 5%) and a type II error of <LATEX>\beta = 0 . 1</LATEX> (equating to 90% power). However, a more general formula for different values of <LATEX>\alpha</LATEX> and <LATEX>\beta</LATEX> is needed.
lrry | A more general formula is as follows:
hvhm | where <LATEX>\mathrm { f } \left( \alpha , \beta \right)</LATEX> is a function of a and B. The table below provides the value of <LATEX>\mathrm { f } \left( \alpha , \beta \right)</LATEX> for different values of <LATEX>\alpha</LATEX> and B.
