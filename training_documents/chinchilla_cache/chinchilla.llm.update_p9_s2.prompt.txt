You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

iest | Based on our analysis in Section 3, the optimal model size for the Gopher compute budget is somewhere between 40 and 70 billion parameters. We test this hypothesis by training a model on the larger end of this range-70B parameters-for 1.4T tokens, due to both dataset and computational efficiency considerations. In this section we compare this model, which we call Chinchilla, to Gopher and other LLMs. Both Chinchilla and Gopher have been trained for the same number of FLOPs but differ in the size of the model and the number of training tokens.
cox8 | While pre-training a large language model has a considerable compute cost, downstream fine- tuning and inference also make up substantial compute usage (Rae et al., 2021). Due to being 4x smaller than Gopher, both the memory footprint and inference cost of Chinchilla are also smaller.
ppqi | 4.1. Model and training details
oxou | The full set of hyperparameters used to train Chinchilla are given in Table 4. Chinchilla uses the same model architecture and training setup as Gopher with the exception of the differences listed below.
495n | . We train Chinchilla on MassiveText (the same dataset as Gopher) but use a slightly different subset distribution (shown in Table A1) to account for the increased number of training tokens.
awri | . We use AdamW (Loshchilov and Hutter, 2019) for Chinchilla rather than Adam (Kingma and Ba, 2014) as this improves the language modelling loss and the downstream task performance after finetuning.8
bl28 | . We train Chinchilla with a slightly modified SentencePiece (Kudo and Richardson, 2018) tokenizer that does not apply NFKC normalisation. The vocabulary is very similar- 94.15% of tokens are the same as those used for training Gopher. We find that this particularly helps with the representation of mathematics and chemistry, for example.
d5bz | . Whilst the forward and backward pass are computed in bfloat 16, we store a float32 copy of the weights in the distributed optimiser state (Rajbhandari et al., 2020). See Lessons Learned from Rae et al. (2021) for additional details.
ap5o | In Appendix G we show the impact of the various optimiser related changes between Chinchilla and Gopher. All models in this analysis have been trained on TPUv3/TPUv4 (Jouppi et al., 2017) with JAX (Bradbury et al., 2018) and Haiku (Hennigan et al., 2020). We include a Chinchilla model card (Mitchell et al., 2019) in Table A8.
7zvf | 4.2. Results
mov9 | We perform an extensive evaluation of Chinchilla, comparing against various large language models. We evaluate on a large subset of the tasks presented in Rae et al. (2021), shown in Table 5. As the focus of this work is on optimal model scaling, we included a large representative subset, and introduce a few new evaluations to allow for better comparison to other existing large models. The evaluation details for all tasks are the same as described in Rae et al. (2021).
ks7m | 4.2.1. Language modelling
w1w1 | Chinchilla significantly outperforms Gopher on all evaluation subsets of The Pile (Gao et al., 2020), as shown in Figure 5. Compared to Jurassic-1 (178B) Lieber et al. (2021), Chinchilla is more performant on all but two subsets- dm_mathematics and ubuntu_irc- see Table A5 for a raw bits-per-byte comparison. On Wikitext103 (Merity et al., 2017), Chinchilla achieves a perplexity of 7.16 compared to 7.75 for Gopher. Some caution is needed when comparing Chinchilla with Gopher on these language modelling benchmarks as Chinchilla is trained on 4x more data than Gopher and thus train/test set leakage may artificially enhance the results. We thus place more emphasis on other
h8gv | tasks for which leakage is less of a concern, such as MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2020) and BIG-bench (BIG-bench collaboration, 2021) along with various closed-book question answering and common sense analyses.
