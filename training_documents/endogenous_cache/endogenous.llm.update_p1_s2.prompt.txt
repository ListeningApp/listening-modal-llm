You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

rxkz | 1 Dysregulation of neuroproteasomes by ApoE isoforms drives endogenous Tau aggregation
5va3 | 24 Neuroproteasomes are a subset of 20S proteasomes that are localized to the neuronal plasma
iqdo | 25 membrane and degrade newly synthesized proteins. To date, the molecular composition of
6rzq | 26 neuroproteasomes is undefined, and moreover, whether neuroproteasomes can influence protein
rjyh | 27 aggregation with relevance to neurodegenerative disorders remains unexplored. Using a Cre-
64js | 28 dependent conditional knock-in mouse line to endogenously tag the proteasome, we find that
84do | 29 neuroproteasomes co-purify with ApoE, the most significant risk factor for late-onset
n581 | 30 Alzheimer's Disease (AD). We discover that neuroproteasome membrane localization is
xjjq | 31 differentially modulated by ApoE isoforms (E4<E3<E2) in vitro, in vivo, and in human 32 postmortem samples. We synthesized selective, neuroproteasome-specific inhibitors and
ozp5 | 33 discovered that neuroproteasome inhibition induces aggregation of endogenous mouse and
df15 | 34 human Tau, without the need for seeding or pathogenic mutations. Using hApoE-KI/hTau-KI
tuu3 | 35 crosses, we find that ApoE isoforms differentially shift the aggregation threshold for Tau.
4lo0 | 36 Neuroproteasome inhibition in vivo is sufficient to induce sarkosyl-insoluble and Thioflavin-S
yskz | 37 positive endogenous Tau aggregates in only three days, which are completely abrogated by co-
1y6b | 38 application of cycloheximide. Newly synthesized Tau levels increase threefold after
ihhb | 39 neuroproteasome inhibition, leading us to posit that newly synthesized Tau is uniquely
xvgt | 40 susceptible to aggregation due to neuroproteasome dysfunction. Overall, our data define
k2yr | 41 neuroproteasomes as a pivotal proteostasis mechanism underlying the formation of endogenous
y5vm | 42 Tau aggregates, which is directly regulated by the largest genetic risk factor for late-onset
graj | 43 Alzheimer's Disease.
stgo | 44 Introduction
r4hn | 45
7nts | 46 Protein homeostasis mechanisms define the cellular capacity to handle protein synthesis, folding,
68kv | 47 and clearance while minimizing the accumulation of deleterious protein misfolding and
0b1o | 48 aggregation events. While many factors contribute to protein homeostasis, protein degradation
xogx | 49 serves as a critical and non-redundant determinant of cellular proteostatic capacity. In canonical
cusa | 50 models of protein degradation, proteins are either degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system
yrit | 51 or the endo-lysosomal and autophagic systems(1, 2). In contrast to the established paradigms of
xwzi | 52 protein degradation, we recently described the neuroproteasome, which is localized to the
7rjv | 53 neuronal plasma membrane, exposed to the extracellular space, and degrades intracellular
daj4 | 54 substrates across the membrane(3). We interpret this to mean that the neuroproteasome is
dt0u | 55 functionally transmembrane(3). In addition, neuroproteasomes are composed of the 20S core
iroe | 56 proteasome and lack the canonical 19S cap and therefore, cannot recognize ubiquitylated
m9bf | 57 substrates or unfold them for degradation. Instead, neuroproteasomes co- or peri-translationally
44d4 | 58 degrade newly synthesized proteins without the need for ubiquitylation(4). While multiple
5rgr | 59 reports have demonstrated the existence of neuroproteasomes in diverse systems(5), the
a1gl | 60 molecular composition of neuroproteasomes, the regulation underlying neuroproteasome
vxin | 61 membrane localization, and the function of neuroproteasomes in vivo are poorly defined. 62
vj4s | 63 Failures in protein homeostasis are linked to accumulation of protein inclusions and aggregates.
x4c3 | 64 Indeed, Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and many other neurodegenerative diseases are linked by the
jhyp | 65 accumulation of protein aggregates(6, 7). Tau aggregates are among the most common
1dwr | 66 intracellular aggregates in AD and are characteristic of more than 20 neurodegenerative diseases,
0acx | 67 termed Tauopathies(8). Multiple mutations that render Tau more prone to aggregation have been
9ejb | 68 identified in patients(9) and these have been extensively modeled in transgenic lines and iPSC-
3dzn | 69 derived neurons(10-13). While these studies have provided important insights into the
tnh4 | 70 mechanisms of Tau aggregate clearance, genetic variants in MAPT only make up less than 5% of
cn2s | 71 the total population with AD and Tauopathies(14-18). Instead, endogenous Tau aggregates are
seh0 | 72 found in the absence of overexpression or mutations in MAPT in the majority of patients with
l0vz | 73 sporadic AD(19, 20). The protein quality control mechanisms in neurons that prevent
ko4g | 74 endogenous Tau from aggregating remain elusive.
c25g | 75
3i2y | 76 Moreover, aggregated Tau can induce the further aggregation of otherwise normal Tau, creating
qo5h | 77 a feed-forward prion-like propagation referred to as Tau seeding(12, 21, 22). Studies delineating
vg7d | 78 the principles of Tau seeding and propagation have provided new insights into the development
768z | 79 of Tau pathology. Yet, the mechanisms underlying the initial aggregate formation in this
8ant | 80 pathological context are unclear. Therefore, identifying mechanisms by which endogenous Tau
ub5e | 81 aggregates form could provide a unique therapeutic opportunity for intervention before Tau
ec6h | 82 seeds can promote further templating and propagation.
w6yy | 83
3cxo | 84 While failures of the endolysosomal and autophagic systems can exacerbate Tau aggregation(23-
zxlu | 85 26), whether and how proteasomal dysfunction affects Tau aggregation is contested. Multiple
165g | 86 reports demonstrate that proteasomes can degrade Tau in vitro and in heterologous cells (27-30).
o7vc | 87 However, follow up studies demonstrated that proteasome inhibition in neurons neither increases
ikzp | 88 Tau levels nor does it induce endogenous Tau aggregation(31-34). In fact, somewhat
o2co | 89 counterintuitively, proteasomal inhibition leads to the reduction of soluble Tau due to the
932d | 90 compensatory induction of autophagy in neurons(31-34). However, proteasomes can be involved
eab8 | 91 in clearing already aggregated Tau but require the help of ATPases such as VCP to unfold the
78uf | 92 aggregates(35). The mechanisms by which protein degradation machineries determine both the
d4u8 | 93 formation and clearance of endogenous Tau aggregates are still debated. The discovery of the
hi2c | 94 neuroproteasome provides a new mechanism to interrogate how protein degradation could
xhx2 | 95 contribute to the formation and clearance of protein aggregates in neurons.
64tz | 96
myvp | 97 While the precise mechanisms underlying Tau aggregation remain a subject of intense
nr73 | 98 investigation, one major genetic factor that influences Tau aggregation and many other
a2o9 | 99 phenotypes in neurodegeneration is ApoE(36-38). The most significant risk factor for sporadic 100 Alzheimer's Disease is the ApoE4 isoform of the ApoE gene, while the ApoE3 isoform is neutral
e4rj | 101 and the ApoE2 isoform is protective(39, 40). The mechanisms by which ApoE isoforms confer
7u2p | 102 dramatic differences in the risk for AD remains unclear, but it is well established that ApoE4 is
l5og | 103 associated with increased Amyloid ß and Tau pathology(37, 41, 42). More specifically, it
x06y | 104 remains mechanistically vague how ApoE isoforms influence Tau aggregation and
lhv3 | 105 neurodegeneration. Gaining the biochemical and cell biological insights connecting ApoE
d14u | 106 isoforms and Tau turnover could be invaluable to revealing the mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration.

mv86 | 109 Here, we discover an unexpected link between ApoE and endogenous Tau aggregation through
8miy | 110 the neuroproteasome. Using a transgenic mouse line to endogenously and conditionally tag the
h5l3 | 111 20S proteasome coupled with quantitative proteomics, we found that neuroproteasomes co-
77nj | 112 purify with ApoE. Neuroproteasome localization at the plasma membrane is differentially
wa9j | 113 regulated by ApoE isoforms, with ApoE4 reducing localization and ApoE2 increasing
pj74 | 114 localization relative to ApoE3, in vivo, in primary neurons, and in humans. Using an unbiased
tv7e | 115 quantitative proteomic screen, we identify neuronal responses to neuroproteasome inhibition in
cicu | 116 the soluble and insoluble proteome. Neuroproteasome dysfunction leads to deficits in
m5cf | 117 proteostasis and induces aggregation of endogenous Tau in primary neurons and in vivo. We find
