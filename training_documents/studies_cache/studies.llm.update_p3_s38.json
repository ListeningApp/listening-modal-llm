        "content": "d0ik | \"middle aged,\" \"aged,\" and \"child\" because these were associated with social-ecological critical theory in psychology, which is different from the SES focus of this article. We also restricted the search to the subject areas of environmental science, social\n0x0s | science, agricultural and biological science, Earth and planetary science, economics, econometrics and finance, energy, \"multidisciplinary,\" and decision sciences. We excluded environmental education because the overlaps with the health and psychological literature produced a lot of nonrelevant studies. Further, we restricted our search to journals, books, and book series, and to publications in English, and items published or in press. Our final search, conducted on twenty-two July two thousand fifteen, yielded a result of five thousand two hundred twenty-two documents. In addition to the abstracts and (index and author) key words, we downloaded the year published, journals published in, number of citations, and the institutions and geographical locations of authors.\n4exe | First screening and coding\n0myz | The next step was to screen abstracts for inclusion or exclusion in the study. We characterized papers as follows:\nxh3i | · Review: a review of papers about SES, theoretical concepts, and/or frameworks;\nsyiw | · Framework: papers that explicitly proposed a framework for understanding SES;\nkg3t | · Framework and place-based: papers that proposed a framework, and also used this framework to analyze a place-based system;\nlvae | · Theory: articles that did not propose a framework, but focused on understanding an aspect of thinking about SES, or developing SES theory, without focusing on a particular place-based SES;\no9sc | · Place-based article: empirical studies that focused on place-based SES;\n121u | · Irrelevant: studies that very clearly did not make reference to SES as integrated social and ecological systems and were not relevant to the focus of this study, e.g., studies focusing on the psychological social-ecological theories that were not filtered out in the initial search. These articles (one hundred twenty-four) were not further considered in our review. Removing these articles brought our total database to five thousand ninety-eight records.\nzh03 | Second screening and document analysis\n1mvw | In the second screening of abstracts, we focused only on the documents that were classified as place-based articles (four thousand four hundred seventy-nine articles). Of these four thousand four hundred seventy-nine, thirty-seven point four percent contained the term \"social-ecological\" in their title, abstracts, and key words, while sixty-one point four percent contained the term in their full texts. To keep the analysis manageable, we randomly selected two thousand of these place-based articles, and read the abstract, title, and key words. For each article, we recorded the scale of the SES studied (local, regional, national, multinational, and global), as well as research methods used (as could be derived from the abstract and key words). We did not classify articles where we could not infer methods used from the abstract (two hundred ninety-three of the two thousand surveyed documents). This left one thousand seven hundred seven read and classified articles. Scopus records the research affiliations and countries of researchers affiliated with papers; we thus had these data for the full dataset, i.e., four thousand four hundred seventy-nine articles. However, we also recorded, in the subset of data (n = one thousand seven hundred seven), the names of countries mentioned in the abstract and key words, i.e., the location where the research took place.\n6d4s | Data analysis\nmqah | Growth and types of SES research\nxxr8 | To track the development of the SES research field, we analyzed the growth of all SES publications (n = five thousand ninety-eight) as a proportion of the total number of publications in Scopus within the same disciplines. We investigated the significance of the relationship between year and relative publications with a Spearman-rank test, and used both change point analysis and Bayesian change point analysis, to detect significant inflection points. We used a chi-squared test to statistically analyze the different types of SES papers (namely \"theory,\" \"framework,\" \"place-based research,\" \"review\") across all years, against a null hypothesis of equal proportions.\nrl4j | Hotspots of SES research\nvz32 | From the full place-based data set (n = four thousand four hundred seventy-nine), we used the names of countries and institutions associated with each research paper (as denoted by Scopus) to calculate the number of SES publications produced by each country and research institution over time. We weighted these totals by a notional research capacity for each country (number of universities per country as reported in the database of the International Association of Universities). We compared the average research output per capita per year using ANOVA tests.\nncb0 | To identify hotspots of SES research sites, we calculated the number of place-based studies conducted in each country (n = one thousand seven hundred seven). We created a graduated heat map in ArcGIS ten point five using raw frequencies, as well as normalized frequencies, accounting for surface area. Countries were assigned to regions. After normalization of country frequencies, data were normally distributed, and we performed a one-way ANOVA to test for statistical significance between regions.\n8mp0 | Popularity of journals over time\nxjyk | To assess the development of journals publishing SES research over time, we focused on the five most popular journals over all years. Here we used the full dataset (n = five thousand ninety-eight). We recorded the proportion of total publications in each time period (nineteen ninety to nineteen ninety, two thousand to two thousand eight, two thousand nine to two thousand twelve, two thousand thirteen to two thousand fifteen). Time periods were informed by the results of the change point analysis. We performed a Kruskal-Wallis test to analyze differences in average annual number of SES publications between journals.\nmt0f | Thematic topics in SES research\nawab | We used word cloud and frequency analysis of author key words to extract major topics of SES research. We removed all spaces between words of key word terms (e.g., \"ecosystem services\" became \"ecosystemservices\"), so that we could run word cloud analysis on terms, rather than single words, using the word cloud package in R (version three point zero one). We extracted the most frequent terms (see Appendix two) from which we constructed a list of thematic topics for place-based SES research. We then searched the abstracts and author key words of all four thousand four hundred seventy-nine place-based studies to obtain the frequency with which these terms were used in the abstracts and key words of studies in our dataset. Finally, we constructed a two-by-two matrix of methods, highlighting main associations.\nixcc | Method extraction and categorization\n8p6h | We manually screened key methods from two thousand abstracts of place-based SES studies, one thousand seven hundred seven of which mentioned a research method.\npmgl | Abstracts varied in the number and detail of methods provided, for example, some would note that they had employed \"modeling,\" while others detailed the type of models they used. This was particularly true for statistical methods, and data collection. In the first instance, we listed methods as they were listed in the abstract. We cleaned the resulting method list (six hundred thirty-two individual methods, after removing of duplicates) by merging very similar methods. We also removed \"methods\" that we considered broader approaches, e.g., resilience assessment, adaptive management, transdisciplinary. This process produced a list of three hundred eleven methods.",
