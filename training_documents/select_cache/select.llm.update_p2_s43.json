        "content": "06ht | Three-alkynyl imidamide, reactions of n-decyl- and homobenzyl-substituted one, three-diynes with piperidine were performed, resulting in the corresponding three-alkynyl imidamides Two A C prime and Two A C prime prime in fifty-seven percent and forty percent yields, respectively. Reaction with phosphoryl azide and alkyl-substituted diynes predominantly generated three-alkynyl imidamides Two A B prime, Two A B prime prime, and Two B B in moderate forty-five to sixty percent yields. Electron-rich one, three-diynes with silyl substituents selectively delivered three-alkynyl imidamides. T E S, T I P S, and T B S-substituted one, three-diynes provided the corresponding alkynyl derivatives Two F A prime to Two F A prime prime prime in eighty-five to ninety-four percent yields. Reactions of T I P S-substituted one, three-diyne with phosphoryl and mesyl azide also generated three-alkynyl imides Two F B prime prime and Two F C prime prime exclusively in fifty-nine percent and eighty-two percent yields, respectively. It is evident from Scheme Two that reactions with cyclic amine, phosphoryl azide, and electron-rich silyl-substituted one, three-diynes tend to generate three-alkynyl imidamide predominantly or exclusively.\nv3r2 | Next, we examined reactions of different one, three-diynes to selectively form two, three-dienyl imidamide Three (Scheme Three). On the basis of the initial observation with propargylic alcohol-containing diyne One E that selectively generated two, three-dienyl imidamide, we further tested the reactivity of structurally diversified propargyl alcohols, (thio)ethers, amines, and\nnv42 | amides. One, three-diynes containing secondary or tertiary alcohols afforded two, three-dienyl imidamides Three G A, Three G A, Three G A prime prime, Three G A prime prime prime, Three J A, Three I A prime, Three I A prime prime, and Three K A as a predominant or exclusive product in sixty-five to seventy-six percent yields. The selectivity between the allenyl and alkynyl isomer depends on the substituent, but no clear trend has been found. One, three-diynes with a tertiary alcohol and a cycloalkyl substituent delivered two, three-dienyl imidamides Three L A, Three L A prime, and Three L A prime prime in seventy to eighty percent yields with a roughly ten to one selectivity. Carvone-containing one, three-diyne afforded allene Three M A (seven to one allene:alkyne ratio) in sixty-nine percent yield with a one point four to one diastereomeric ratio. While a vinyl-conjugated one, three-diyne containing a free hydroxyl group provided allene Three N A in forty-six percent yield with a low selectivity (four to one), one, three-diynes with benzyl-, three-MeO-Ph-, and T H P-protected primary alcohols exclusively generated allene derivatives (Three O A, Three O A prime, and Three O A prime prime, respectively) in fifty-four to seventy percent yields. Similarly, a cholesteryl ether-substituted one, three-diyne generated allene Three P A in fifty-six percent yield with an eight to one allene:alkyne ratio. On the contrary, the corresponding thioether afforded Three Q A contaminated with the alkyne isomer (seven point five to one allene:alkyne). One, three-diynes containing aniline and tosylamido substituents at the propargylic position selectively generated allenes Three R A and Three S A in fifty-eight percent and eighty-eight percent yields, respectively. A gem-dimethyl, however, decreased the yield and selectivity for Three S A prime (sixty-eight percent, eight point five to one). An indole-substituted one, three-diyne provided only allene Three T A in sixty-eight percent yield, and N-allyl tosyl-substituted one, three-diyne provided single isomer Three U A in sixty-seven percent yield. On the contrary, phenyl- and four-MeO-phenyl-substituted one, three-diynes provided moderate yields and selectivity provided allenes Three V A (sixty-four percent, four point six to one) and Three V A prime (sixty-four percent, three point six to one).\nxags | Although the selectivity of forming allenyl imidamides is good, the formation of alkyne isomer could not be suppressed in many cases. At this juncture, we surmised that trapping the ketenimine intermediate with alcohols may have different product distributions. Indeed, under identical conditions except for the replacement of I-Pr-two-NH (one point two equivalents) with MeOH (ten equivalents) and Et-three-N (two equivalents), the reaction of one, three-diynes selectively provided two, three-dienyl imidates without a vestige of the alkyne isomer (Table Two).
