You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.

These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

b0d0 | 3. Extending the range of linear response with synthetic forcings. We discuss in this section the notion of synthetic forcings, and how they can be used to extend the regime of linear response. We start by describing the notion of synthetic forcings in Section 3.1, and give examples in Section 3.2 for both overdamped and underdamped Langevin dynamics. Then, we provide a methodology for choosing the magnitude of the forcings in Section 3.3. Finally, we briefly discuss how to linearly combine multiple extra forcings in Section 3.4.
d7eu | EXTENDING LINEAR RESPONSE WITH SYNTHETIC FORCINGS
xndr | 3.1. Notion of synthetic forcings. As discussed in Section 2.1.1, a system with a nonequilibrium perturbation has a generator of the form
m6hi | (3.1) Cn = Lo + n Õ,
vpkf | where L is the generator of some perturbation to the reference dynamics with gener- ator Lo. We considered in Section 2 only the case where L is Lphys - in other words, the perturbation corresponds to some physical perturbation on the system, which is the typical scenario in the context of statistical physics. We now consider, in addition to the physical perturbation, some possibly nonphysical extra perturbation, which we denote by Lextra, so that £ in (3.1) is replaced by
4d67 | Č = Čphys + aČextra,
e7j2 | for o E R. We call the resulting perturbation a synthetic forcing.
lqzt | The key requirement of synthetic forcings is that the the addition of the extra forc- ing should preserve the invariant measure of the reference dynamics, thus preserving the linear response. In other words, the dynamics with generator
1ocm | Ln,a = Lo + n (Čphys + aČextra)
527v | has the same linear response as the dynamics associated with Ln,o = Lo + nCphys when
lrri | Čextra 1 = 0.
5cl9 | (3.2)
u7a3 | We denote by Un,a the invariant measure for the dynamics associated with the gen- erator Ln,Q, i.e. the solution to the stationary Fokker-Planck equation
w409 | (3.3) Ch, aUn, a = 0.
m04y | When there is no indication of the value of a, e.g. Vn, it means that a = 0.
23jk | From the definition (2.26) of the linear response 01, it is indeed easy to see why the linear response is preserved with the addition of Lextra: the conjugate response S defined in (2.10) is preserved, and so is f1 in view of (2.24), which allows us to conclude by Lemma 2.2. Let us emphasize that (3.2) is the key condition to be satisfied for extra forcings to be admissible. We provide various examples of admissible extra forcings in Section 3.2. For technical reasons, the extra forcings we consider should satisfy the same conditions as Lphys in Assumption 4.
oa63 | One practical interest is to optimize the extra perturbation in order to increase the regime of linear response. As made precise in Proposition 2.4, the variance of the estimator (2.38) is of order O(n-2). A larger linear regime therefore means that larger values of n can be considered without introducing too much bias on p1. This leads in turn to a smaller statistical error, and hence shorter simulation times to reach the same accuracy. One idea in particular is to look for Lextra which minimizes 02, the leading order n2 of the nonlinear response, as a proxy for minimizing |En(R) - pin|, i.e. the nonlinear portion of the response. This is discussed in detail in Section 3.3. This also naturally suggests that one could further combine k forcings in order to cancel the first k + 1 orders of the response, as discussed in Section 3.4.
e3lv | Another approach to optimizing the perturbation is to increase the range of n for which the nonlinear response is within some desired distance from the linear regime, in relative error, also discussed Section 3.3.
rqv6 | 3.2. Examples of synthetic forcings. To make synthetic forcings more con- crete, we now go over some examples of extra forcings. We first outline in Section 3.2.1 the general classes of operators we consider. We then discuss more precisely examples for overdamped Langevin dynamics in Section 3.2.2 and for underdamped Langevin dynamics in Section 3.2.3.
oa48 | 3.2.1. General classes of extra forcings. When considering possible extra forcings, we restrict ourselves to differential operators of at most second-order in order to realize them in Monte Carlo simulations. We consider the following classes of differential operators:
3fp1 | (1) First-order differential operators Lextra = GTVr, with G: X > Rd such that div(Gyo) = 0. The latter condition ensures that (3.2) is satisfied since Lextra = - GTV. r;
557x | (2) Second-order differential operators of the form Lextra = - 0* dzi or more gen- erally -ot Dijoxi for some (nonnegative) function Dij: X -> R+. In the case Cextra = - Ox Ox;, the operator is self-adjoint, i.e. Cextra = L'extra, so that (3.2) is easily seen to hold. For Lextra = - Og Dijoxi, it holds that Lextra = - Og Dijox;, which also satisfies (3.2).
