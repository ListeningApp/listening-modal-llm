        "content": "3194 | Recall from Section two point three, and in particular in Proposition two point four, that the estimator P-hat sub eta comma t defined in two point three eight has asymptotic variance of order sigma sub R comma eta squared over eta squared. Indeed, two point four two suggests that this asymptotic variance is of the same order as the one associated with the equilibrium estimator, i.e. sigma sub R comma zero squared over eta squared, up to a small bias of order\nr22o | eta: four point nine.\nnupw | This suggests that the asymptotic variance sigma sub R comma eta squared has sufficiently small variations in n, which validates increasing eta as a way to substantially reduce the variance.\n37xs | For each synthetic forcing and a fixed value of alpha, we compute sigma sub R comma eta squared over eta squared with\nhoi0 | EXTENDING LINEAR RESPONSE WITH SYNTHETIC FORCINGS\ntffb | na defined in three point one five, i.e. the first value of n at which the response curve departs and in relative error relative to the linear response. For the results here presented, we use epsilon equals zero point zero five. For each of the dynamics, the scaled asymptotic variance as a function of n is illustrated in Figure six, where the values of na epsilon are represented as dashed vertical lines to highlight the great reduction in variance potential. As expected, Figure six is consistent with four point nine, and it shows that increasing the regime of linear response has a dramatic effect on the variance.\newwt | In order to quantify the variance reduction, we define the gain as the ratio of the variance of the equilibrium system and its synthetic counterpart:\n2tj1 | gain equals no epsilon squared O R, no epsilon squared.\nnbhq | na epsilon squared O R, na epsilon.\nw251 | four point ten.\n1vgx | For each of the cases presented in Table one, namely the modified-fluctuation dissipation, Feynman-Kac forcing and divergence-free vector field, a is chosen to be a* or a+ epsilon, and the associated quantity na epsilon is computed, where no epsilon equals zero point zero five for all three dynamics. Note that for Langevin dynamics, the results here presented for the modified fluctuation-dissipation and the Feynman-Kac forcing both correspond to their p counterparts.\nyjnk | The results in Table one show that the variance can be dramatically reduced with the use of synthetic forcings. Although no choice of extra forcing is universally better, we can achieve reduce the variance by a factor of over one thousand in all cases.\n9zmh | Five. Extensions and perspectives. Let us conclude this work by discussing potential extensions of our approach and practical applications to real molecular dynamics systems. The notion of synthetic forcings, as here presented, can be applied to a number of actual systems to assist in the computation of transport coefficients, e.g. Lennard-Jones fluids for the computation of shear viscosity, or systems of atom chains for the computation of thermal transport.\nmi3g | The methodology here presented, however, must undergo some adaptation to be applied to actual systems. The numerical method we rely on, namely discretizing and solving the associated PDEs, does not scale well to higher dimensions and thus cannot be used as such. One typically relies on Monte Carlo simulations, which normally limits the number of values of n used due to the high computational cost. Additionally, the computation of the optimal values of o, presented in Section three point three, also cannot be done as such, as it relies on either the PDE approach, or the computation of full response curves.\nntjg | One preliminary idea for the computation of o in real systems is the notion of prescreening. Transport coefficients are intensive quantities, i.e. they do not depend\n86at | too drastically on the system size. This suggests, in practice, that one performs two simulations with small system sizes, with o one, from which the value of a* can be extrapolated, which can then be used in a large scale simulation. The results here presented suggest that such an adaptation, which is work in progress, is worth the effort.\nbpd2 | Quantifying the magnitude of An,Q.
