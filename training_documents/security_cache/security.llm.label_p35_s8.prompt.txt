You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

06yq | Microdosing with psychedelics to self-medicate for ADHD symptoms in adults: A naturalistic study

8r5j | ABSTRACT
2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

bl28 | In summary:
d5bz | . You can't always prevent Incidents - but you can take responsibility for how you respond to them
ap5o | . Incidents and crises don't 'just happen'. They develop over time, and the earlier you are aware of potential problems, the more effective you will be as a security manager
7zvf | . Complexity is the enemy of clarity. Do not allow your systems to become overly complex - especially if that doesn't add to your operational capability
mov9 | . Even the largest and most high profile operations fail for simple reasons - breakdowns in communications, breakdowns in command structures, lack of leadership
ks7m | . Security management is not a single event, but is a never-ending process - review your own operations on a continuous basis, and keep on improving them
w1w1 | 35
h8gv | 7.11 Self-assessment exercises
kwkp | Exercise 1: Identify an incident that has been the direct result of organisational complexity (it can be one of the incidents mentioned in this module, or another one of your own choosing), and analyse how and why the incident happened, and what steps could have been taken to prevent it.
yj0m | Exercise 2: Take an organisation that is known to you, and design an Annual Security Review that will allow you to assess the level of security within the organisation, identify potential weak spots, and allow you to make recommendations as to how the system can be improved over the next management cycle.
ewfp | Exercise 3: Identify three 'Normal Accidents' that could be indicators of systemic weakness within the security management programme, and show how the underlying causes can be dealt with in order to prevent those Normal accidents from occurring, and potentially escalating into full-blown crisis status.

me84 | 8 Adding Value
o56m | As should already be clear from the previous sections of this module, for security management to be truly effective it should be embedded into the very heart of an organisation, intricately connected with every aspect of its' operations and general management culture. However, the truth is that in many, if not most, organisations security management lacks the status of other aspects of the organisations management processes, and in many ways is seen as being something that can be considered once a year at an annual review. There are a number of reasons why that happens, which will be touched upon in this section, but it is certainly the case that the way that security management represents itself often causes it to be seen as a 'poor cousin', one lacking the status and respect that it deserves. In many organisations, security managers are seen as being involved with operational matters, rather than strategic decision makers. As such, they are considered in the same group as facility managers, fleet hire managers and other members of the 'back room staff'. If security management is to be given the central role that we believe it should, then security managers in turn must make sure that they have the skills and capabilities that will allow them to fulfil that role in an effective and appropriate manner.
slz6 | 8.1 Cost or Investment?
90k5 | One of the fundamental reason that security is not given the place it merits at the directors boardroom is that, rather than being seen as 'adding value' to an organisation, it is considered to be a 'non-productive cost'. This, in turn, causes it to become a 'grudging spend', rather than a well-supported investment. Security management is undoubtedly spend-driven - there is a need for a high level of technology, whether CCTV, fencing, lighting, control rooms, vehicles, personnel, etc, which needs to be both maintained and upgraded on a regular basis. However, there is also a case that could be made that effective security management can rationalise the security management programme, and especially in a larger organisation where security functions are spread across different sites, and can find effective cost savings without compromising security. In many cases, there is a business case to be made that by upgrading and taking advantage of newer technology, real savings can be made across the organisations' security spend.
9m8s | 8.2 Business Manager
893y | The power of the above argument demonstrates another basic truth about the modern security manager - he or she is a Business Manager of a significant division within the organisation, and therefore should be able to bring all of the skills to the business management aspect of their role as would the equivalent head of any other division. This should be reflected in the language used to describe the value of the security division to the organisation, the way that it is presented and the supporting material that is produced. The security manager should be able to identify strategic objectives for their department, recruit the right people, develop effective protocols and manage the budget, at all times being aware of how that fits in with the wider strategic objectives of the company as a whole.
favz | 8.3 Competitive Advantage
7szx | In many situations, security management is seen as a business inhibitor rather than an opportunity enabler. For many people within the organisation, the only contact they have with the security operation is when they arrive in the building in the morning, or have a problem with their pass card. However on a wider perspective, the security management programme should be a business enabler, allowing the organisation to gain a competitive advantage over its competitors. This may be because they can gain 'First Mover Advantage' by expanding into new markets where their competitors cannot - this is especially true in what might be seen as high risk areas that could be an inhibitor to business development by organisations with less well-developed security management capabilities.
hx9e | A Risk Management Framework such as shown in Figure 19, allows an organisation to assess whether it is viable to develop operations in a high-threat environment: (note the use of terminology previously covered in this module: risk assessment, likelihood and impact, avoid or transfer risk, acceptance of risk, standard operating procedures, regular review, contingency plans).
ywn2 | 38

dqvj | 8.4 Subject Matter Expertise
r17u | The security manager's role has traditionally seen to have been relatively unskilled when compared to the level of professional capability expected from the heads of the finance division, business development division, marketing and branding division, etc. This is a hangover from the era when security managers were traditionally hired on the basis of their previous police experience, and the function that they fulfilled was often little more than in-house policeman. However, that has been changing over the last ten years, and there are now a wide range of professional and academic security management training programmes available. If the security manager is to achieve the same status as comparable managers in other divisions, it is necessary for them to show that they are able to bring the same level of expertise and professional development as their equivalents would. The security manager should expect to be the point of reference for all issues relating to security within their organisation, whether it is personal, as in foreign travel, operational, as in day to day management of security operations, or strategic, as in contributing to the organisation's continued growth and development.
3c47 | 8.5 Proactive Risk Management
g345 | Whilst a large part of a security manager's function will naturally be involved with managing the routine tasks associated with the security team, it is also necessary for them to become part of the 'Over the Horizon' thinking that is an essential part of any strategic management project. The nature of the present world means that the risks and threats facing any organisation are radically different than those that would have been faced in previous generations. Whether it is natural disasters, technological breakdowns, political upheavals, or the 'unknown unknowns' that could strike at any time, the role of the security manager is to bring these threats to the attention of strategic decision makers and to ensure that appropriate risk management procedures are in place.
svhz | 39
oaen | 8.6 Crisis Management
5u67 | In the event that a genuine crisis does occur, it will be the security team that will be expected to draw up immediate response plans, to explain these to the rest of the organisation, and to take responsibility for the delivery and management of these programmes in order to realise a successful conclusion to the situation. The success or otherwise of such solutions will depend on the development of previous crisis management plans that will allow appropriate options to be created and managed in the face of high-pressure, potential catastrophic losses, breakdowns in normal communication and lines of command, and possible total disruption of normal operating capabilities. Crisis management capability is something that is developed, maintained and improved over time, through training, exercises and a high level of personal connection between the significant take-holders within an organisation. This is one area where the competent security manager can demonstrate real value to an organisation.
dvms | 8.7 Business Continuity Management (BCM)
qrd3 | One of the clearest aspects of a security manager's function in relation to crisis management is to ensure that the organisation has the capability to maintain viable functionality even at the time of greatest disruption. Although this is not limited to the security management team, and will require genuine multi-division collaboration, it should be a function of the security managers to contribute their specialist expertise in terms of risk management, contingency planning and general project leadership. BCM is widely recognised as being a significant indicator as to the general level of effective organisational management, and is one place where the security management team can rightfully claim to have a level of expertise unmatched in any other division in the company.
rxrg | 8.8 Education and Training
tf43 | Given that security awareness is something that should be an integral part of every aspect of an organisation's operations, it is clear that the security division has a role to play in developing both the appropriate corporate culture as well as specific skills and capabilities. It is the security manager's responsibility to ensure that everyone within the organisation is aware of their security role, how they can contribute to general organisational safety, and what specific steps should be taken in the event that potential threats are detected or actual incidents occur. Whilst it is easy for these up-skilling programmes to become tick box exercises, if they are seen as genuinely contributing to the development of a more effective organisation, then they will be valued as an integral part of the organisation's on-going corporate development process.
fcco | 8.9 Point of Contact
8uji | As well as proactively raising the role of the security division, an effective security manager will develop the relationship with other divisions that will allow them to approach the security team for advice and guidance in areas where otherwise they might just have made a best guess and carried on. To a large extent it is a sign of a successful security management system if managers from other divisions feel comfortable dropping in to have a chat.
df3e | 8.10 Summary
53eu | You have now completed the first, introductory module of this programme. Rather than giving detailed analysis of the specific skills that are an integral part of an effective security manager's portfolio, which will be covered in the following modules, the purpose of this module was to provide a basic understanding of the fundamental concepts that are the foundation of any security management programme. The concepts covered here will come up time and again in the rest of the course material, often within different contexts or with slightly different labels. However, if you understand the relationship between risk and security, understand how to create an effective command structure, can interact with the other divisions within the organisation, and perhaps most of all, can clearly demonstrate the added value that you bring to any organisation that you might be associated with, then you can be confident that you will be able to play a full part in creating an effective security management system that will provide the appropriate level of protection for the people, assets and operations in your company.
a5u1 | It may well be that as you go through this course there might be specific areas that take your interest. It could be in risk analysis, security auditing, overseas development, facilities management or crisis management. Whatever it might be, it is the duty of the modern security manager to be able to offer a level of knowledge,
ry7u | 40
5mda | experience and professional capability that will be at least equal to the equivalent experts in every other division of the organisation.
i4li | In summary:
r8sm | . In order to add value to the overall organisational management structure, the security manager must have the same level of personal and professional capabilities as any other senior manager of equivalent division.
cuin | . To make an effective contribution to the organisations security, and long-term success, he security manager should be seen as part of the strategic decision-making process, rather than 'merely' as part of the back-room support staff.
n1i7 | . In order to be valued, the security manager should be able to demonstrate that they are adding to organisational capability, and competitiveness, rather than being an unproductive cost.
0r5m | . Security managers should be valued for the level of subject matter expertise that they offer, in the same way that the managers of other business divisions would be.
ne2o | · Security managers should be seen as making a contribution to the success of every other division within the organisation, rather than being isolated as a separate, and relatively unimportant, adjunct to the organisation.
