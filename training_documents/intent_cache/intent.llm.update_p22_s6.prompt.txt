You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

0lfu | Collectively, the actions you take toward self- preparation and self-management in the face of inter- personally difficult clients helps ensure that the ways in which you choose to interact with these clients will be optimally therapeutic. This decreases the likelihood that you will unwittingly act out your own negative feelings toward a difficult client. For example, a therapist once shared that she felt less guilty about precipitously chang- ing an appointment with a client in order to meet an out-of-town friend for lunch because the client tended to behave in demanding ways and had recently ques- tioned her approach. Changing an appointment with a client for a nonurgent matter is not a disciplined way of managing one's feelings toward a client. Moreover, changing the appointment with an already-difficult client may lead to increased tension in the relationship. Another example is the extent to which one may make special efforts on behalf of a client. It is generally easier to make these extra efforts for clients whom one likes and sees as investing a great deal in the therapy. How- ever, depriving the difficult client or the client who is not invested in therapy of one's extra effort is not justified ethically.
cnjl | In addition, Exercise 3.1 in the Activities section of this chapter provides a blank copy of this table so that you can furnish your own examples of difficult interpersonal situa- tions, note your own reactions, and judge for yourself what would be a disciplined versus an undisciplined response.
rtdl | Another important aspect of interpersonal self-discipline is that therapists avoid viewing the relation- ship as a potential source of self-esteem or as a barometer by which to measure their own interpersonal competence. Regardless of whether a relationship is successful or un- successful, the extent to which a therapist can truly con- trol what occurs during a clinical interaction is limited. Therapists must keep their successes and failures in per- spective and work to manage their needs to feel connected with, approved of, or celebrated by clients. Investing too much of one's own interests in having a relationship with a client can result in deep feelings of disappointment when a positive connection does not occur. Importantly, more intuitive clients may detect subtle hints toward the thera- pist's need for connection or approval and may withdraw further because they feel pressured or emotionally suffo- cated. When clients do not meet a therapist's expectations, some may detect underlying feelings of disappointment or frustration in the therapist. Through time, not keeping therapeutic relationships in perspective can also lead to emotional exhaustion or burnout in therapists.
norp | A final aspect of interpersonal self-discipline in the therapy process involves perspective and responsibility- taking. According to the IRM, it is the therapist's respon- sibility to manage the more challenging aspects of the re- lationship and continually strive to fortify the relationship with the client. This aspect of interpersonal self-discipline is particularly relevant to working with more frustrating clients who are interpersonally sensitive, difficult, or oth- erwise vulnerable. Even if a client misperceives a ther- apist's good intentions, attempts to break professional boundaries, or becomes upset with the therapist for no apparent reason, it is the therapist's responsibility to re- spond to the client in a way that is ethical and maximally therapeutic given the client's interpersonal characteristics and the circumstances of therapy. More information about therapeutic responding is provided in Chapter 7.

sfcf | Principle 3: It Is Necessary to Keep Head Before Heart
nuxs | Responding to clients from the heart-that is, intuitively, spontaneously, and emotionally-should be considered an indulgence and a privilege earned by therapists rather than an entitlement. Responding from the heart must be accompanied by sufficient development of critical self-awareness and interpersonal self-discipline. With suf- ficient experience and practice, therapists become aware of the various types of positive therapeutic communica- tion of which they are capable. By the same token, ther- apists become familiar with the many potential ways in which their communication (or lack of communication) has the potential to become nontherapeutic, psycholog- ically risky, ambiguous, or (at worst) emotionally harm- ful to clients. With sufficient practice, a disciplined and systematic process of therapeutic responding becomes automatic and intuitive. Through time, therapists feel as if they are responding to their clients spontaneously
umx0 | communications is accompanied by a sophisticated pro- cess of interpersonal reasoning (Fig. 3.10).
o306 | According to this principle, it is incorrect to assume that so long as your heart is in the right place you natu- rally react and behave appropriately in therapy. Instead, it is important to know that each of us has certain tendencies that do not always play out positively for a client simply because we care, have compassion, or can appreciate the client's life story. To be sure, these are all important atti- tudes for a therapist to sustain, but they are not a replace- ment for thoughtful self-knowledge and self-discipline.
qm1b | Principle 4: Mindful Empathy Is Required to Know Your Client
n9ms | As reviewed in Chapter 1, the centrality and importance of empathy to the client-therapist relationship is supported by several occupational therapy scholars and practitioners. A therapist's capacity for empathy is a prerequisite for a functional client-therapist relationship. However, the IRM differs from prior discussions of empathy in the
icdp | occupational therapy literature in that it treats empathy as a mindful process rather than a predominantly affec- tive one. The concept of mindful empathy was developed based on Heinz Kohut's (1984) underlying theory of self-psychology.
wtse | Mindful empathy is an objective mode of observation in which the therapist comes to feel and understand a client's underlying emotions, needs, and motives while at the same time maintaining an objective viewpoint. Kohut labeled the empathic process of accessing a cli- ent's internal world "vicarious introspection," and he consistently emphasized the importance of evaluating each client's experiences and behaviors from the client's unique perspective (Gardner, 1991; Kohut, 1984). The idea of mindful empathy, which was influenced by some
bm7g | the meanings that he or she attaches to his or her expe- riences in therapy (Fig. 3.11).
jr68 | According to the IRM, mindful empathy is funda- mental to interpersonal reasoning. It guides both the therapist's response to interpersonal events and the ther- apist's efforts to sustain the therapeutic relationship. For instance, mindful empathy is necessary to interpret accu- rately a client's reactions to a given interpersonal event. Achieving an understanding of the client's cognitive inter- pretation and emotional and behavioral reactions to the event must be accomplished through empathically based listening and questioning. Although the client's interper- sonal characteristics are likely to play a role in his or her interpretation and reactions to the event, assumptions about a client's reaction and needs should not be made until the client's reactions have been verified through
axix | reflective listening and an explicit conversation about the event that has occurred. Assumptions should not be based entirely on prior knowledge of the client's interpersonal characteristics. Mindful empathy is an advanced skill in the therapist's interpersonal knowledge base. More infor- mation about this skill and examples of how therapists have employed mindful empathy in practice is presented in subsequent chapters of this book.
05y4 | Principle 5: Grow Your Interpersonal Knowledge Base
2fb0 | Interpersonal communication is as complex as the limits of human understanding. From client to client, commu- nication is as variegated and unique as are the differences between and within individuals, families, social networks, communities, neighborhoods, nations, cultures, geog- raphies, climates, and governments. For these reasons, therapists benefit from knowing as much about human behavior as possible, particularly as it pertains to more commonly occurring events in the client-therapist relationship.
