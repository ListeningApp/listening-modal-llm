        "content": "0bqy | Prior to silver electrodeposition, the glassy carbon or gold electrodes were polished with zero point three micrometer aluminum oxide and subsequently sonicated for at least five minutes in water, zero point one molar potassium hydroxide in ethanol, bidistilled water, five percent nitric acid, and finally rinsed with bidistilled water and dried. These substrates with a deposited silver layer are denoted in the text as glassy carbon/silver or gold/silver. Before the reference membrane casting, the surfaces of the silver, glassy carbon/silver, or gold/silver were rinsed with methanol and tetrahydrofuran. The reference cocktails were allowed to dry for at least twenty-four hours, and after that the quality of the dry reference bromide membranes was inspected using an optical microscope to check for possible faults, namely, adhesion to the substrate, compactness of the membrane layer, the presence of cracks, and uncovered substrate areas,\nb780 | and to select the membranes without faults for further experiments.\nccmb | Apparatus. The potentiometric measurements were performed using a homemade sixteen-channel setup. The input impedance was greater than ten to the power of thirteen ohms and the input current was lower than twenty femtoamperes for each of the sixteen inputs as well as for the reference electrode input. The multichannel potential-meter was coupled with a personal computer equipped with a sixteen-bit resolution data acquisition card PCI DAS six thousand fourteen and custom-made software. In typical conditions, the potential resolution was better than zero point zero two millivolts.\nma93 | In the potentiometric measurements the double junction reference two hundred fifty-one reference electrodes were used. All the experiments were performed at room temperature, twenty-two to twenty-four degrees Celsius. Stirring up to five hundred revolutions per minute did not significantly affect the readouts.\nc6hh | RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\ny7ea | One. The rate of standard potential stabilization and its repeatability. Freshly prepared electrodes with dry reference bromide membranes were immersed in two molar potassium bromide and their potential changes were recorded. The shortest soaking time, usually several tens of seconds, was needed for electrodes with reference bromide nanomembranes. A longer soaking, several hundreds of seconds, was required for the electrodes with reference bromide photo membranes, while the longest was for the electrodes with reference bromide quantum dot membranes. The short-time behavior of the electrodes is similar for the metallic silver and the substrates with a deposited silver layer on nonsilver electronically conducting substrates, for example, glassy carbon, as shown in Figure one.\nnav4 | The results show the convergence of the short-time potentials, for the five electrodes used, to less than three millivolts after a few minutes of soaking. The mean potential after twenty minutes is negative one hundred fifty-seven point six three plus or minus one point zero nine millivolts.\ngem8 | Two. Long-Term Potential Stability of the Electrodes with Reference Bromide Reference Membranes. For several hundreds of all the types of reference bromide membranes studied, the stable and reproducible potential readouts collected are all located in a rather narrow potential range to the mean potential negative one hundred fifty-seven plus or minus ten millivolts. No systematic lifetime experiments were undertaken. However, for the same subtypes of electrodes, typically in a series of five to sixteen electrodes, the potentials were reproducible within plus or minus two millivolts during continuous measurement for ten days in two\ne8nr | molar potassium bromide. These were the electrodes with the reference membranes deposited on silver substrate embedded in a polyvinyl chloride body. This design facilitates the adhesion of polyvinyl chloride membrane to the polyvinyl chloride body which is advantageous to the electrodes' lifetime.\nk78w | Three. Substrate Influence on the Standard Potential Value and Its Stability. Excellent potential reproducibility and long-term potential stability were observed for all reference bromide membranes deposited on silver substrate or with glassy carbon or gold substrate covered with the silver layer. The membrane was unattached from the substrate and the presence of silver, potassium, and bromide was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy/energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy on both sides of the membrane, Figure two.\ng9du | The largest amount of silver and bromide were determined on the side of the membrane in contact with silver substrate, whereas for the other side, mainly bromide and potassium signals were detected.\nf682 | If the reference membranes were placed directly on glassy carbon or gold substrate, unpredictable and unstable potential values were recorded.\nli1k | Four. Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy Spectra for Electrodes with Reference Bromide Membranes Deposited on Silver or Nonsilver Substrate. The influence of the silver phase was inspected by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.\npbea | A striking difference in the impedance spectra for electrodes with reference membranes deposited on silver substrate or nonsilver substrate was observed. Namely, the difference is manifested by a disappearance of a low-frequency branch for the membranes deposited on silver substrate which is present if the substrate is a nonsilver one. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy results indicate a slower electrochemical process rate in the membrane without dispersed silver. The appearance of Warburg type behavior at lower frequencies can be attributed to a slower ion-transport in the membrane. It can be hypothesized that dispersed silver facilitates the overall electrochemical process.\nccpt | The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy spectra illustrating this effect, recorded for electrodes with reference bromide photo membranes deposited on a bare glassy carbon substrate and for the glassy carbon substrate covered with silver are presented in Figure S-2.\n0fpw | Five. Mechanism of the Bromide-Reference Response. Undoubtedly, the fact that the metallic silver, both as the layer on the substrate and in the form of dispersed nanosilver in the membrane, significantly contribute to stabilizing the potential of the reference bromide systems is of general importance to solid contact",
