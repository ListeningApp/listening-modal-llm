        "content": "jfsr | economic compulsion-will be investigated later on in this study. But it is especially important to recognize that this particular controversy is just one example of the debate between profreedom and antifreedom approaches to development that has gone on for many centuries. That debate is still very active in many different forms.\nu15r | INSTITUTIONS AND INSTRUMENTAL FREEDOMS\nlq35 | Five distinct types of freedom, seen in an \"instrumental\" perspective, are particularly investigated in the empirical studies that follow. These include political freedoms, economic facilities, social opportunities, transparency guarantees and protective security. Each of these distinct types of rights and opportunities helps to advance the general capability of a person. They may also serve to complement each other. Public policy to foster human capabilities and substantive freedoms in general can work through the promotion of these distinct but interrelated instrumental freedoms. In the chapters that follow, each of these different types of freedom-and the institutions involved-will be explored, and their interconnections discussed. There will be an opportunity also to investigate their respective roles in the promotion of overall freedoms of people to lead the kind of lives they have reason to value. In the view of \"development as freedom,\" the instrumental freedoms link with each other and with the ends of enhancement of human freedom in general.\n3g9w | While development analysis must, on the one hand, be concerned with objectives and aims that make these instrumental freedoms consequentially important, it must also take note of the empirical linkages that tie the distinct types of freedom together, strengthening their joint importance. Indeed, these connections are central to a fuller understanding of the instrumental role of freedom.\nd09o | A CONCLUDING REMARK\nylhz | Freedoms are not only the primary ends of development, they are also among its principal means. In addition to acknowledging, foundationally, the evaluative importance of freedom, we also have to\na3td | Introduction\nex5k | understand the remarkable empirical connection that links freedoms of different kinds with one another. Political freedoms (in the form of free speech and elections) help to promote economic security. Social opportunities (in the form of education and health facilities) facilitate economic participation. Economic facilities (in the form of opportunities for participation in trade and production) can help to generate personal abundance as well as public resources for social facilities. Freedoms of different kinds can strengthen one another.\n9d4o | These empirical connections reinforce the valuational priorities. In terms of the medieval distinction between \"the patient\" and \"the agent,\" this freedom-centered understanding of economics and of the process of development is very much an agent-oriented view. With adequate social opportunities, individuals can effectively shape their own destiny and help each other. They need not be seen primarily as passive recipients of the benefits of cunning development programs. There is indeed a strong rationale for recognizing the positive role of free and sustainable agency-and even of constructive impatience.",
