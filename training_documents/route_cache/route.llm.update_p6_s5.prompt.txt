You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

0b39 | Additional synthetic utility of enediyne 13d bearing ethynyl and <LATEX>\mathrm { M e } _ { 2 } \mathrm { N }</LATEX> groups at the ortho-position of a benzene ring was illustrated by electrophile-induced cyclization 27 that led to 2- triazolyl-3-iodoindole 16 (Scheme 7).
qecd | <LATEX>1 6 \left( 7 4 \right)</LATEX> In summary an efficient and convenient one-step approach toward 1-substituted 4-ethynyl-5-iodo-1,2,3-triazoles was developed based on CuAAC of 1-iodobutadiynes with organic azides using a <LATEX>C u I \left( P P h _ { 3 } \right) _ { 3 } / 2 , 6</LATEX> catalytic system. The reaction is tolerant to various functional groups and allows alkyl, aryl, hydroxyalkyl, ethoxycarbonyl, and dialkylamino functional groups to be introduced into different positions of target triazoles. 4-Ethynyl-5-iodo-1,2,3-triazoles were demon- strated to be useful building blocks for the synthesis of triazole- fused enediyne systems and 5-aryl-4-ethynyltriazoles, which are of great interest because of their further synthetic utility.
1o7p | EXPERIMENTAL SECTION
cp13 | General Information and Methods. Solvents, reagents, and chemicals (2-methylbut-3-yn-2-ol, iodoarenes) used for reactions were purchased from commercial suppliers. Catalyst Pd(PPh3)4 was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Solvents were dried under standard conditions, and chemicals were used without further purification. Catalysts <LATEX>\mathrm { C u } \left( \mathrm { P P h } _ { 3 } \right) _ { 3 } \mathrm { I } ^ { 1 2 8 }</LATEX> and CuCI(IPr), chloro[1,3-bis(2,6- diisopropylphenyl)imidazol-2-ylidene ]copper(I),129 were synthesized by known procedures without any modification.

57lp | Evaporation of solvents and concentration of reaction mixtures were performed in vacuo at 35 ℃ on a rotary evaporator. Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) was carried out on silica gel plates (Silica gel 60, UV 254) with detection by UV or staining with a basic aqueous solution of KMnO4. Melting points (mp) determined are uncorrected. 1H and 13C{1H} NMR spectra were recorded at 400 and 100 MHz, respectively, at 25 ℃ in CDCl3 without the internal standard. The 1H NMR data are reported as chemical shifts (8), multiplicity (s, singlet; d, doublet; t, triplet; q, quartet; m, multiplet; br, broad), coupling constants (J, given in Hz), and number of protons. The 13C NMR data are reported as the chemical shifts (S) and type of carbon (p, primary; s, secondary; <LATEX>t ,</LATEX> tertiary; q, quaternary) determined from DEPT experiments with coupling constant <LATEX>J _ { \mathrm { C - F } }</LATEX> for F-containing compounds. Chemical shifts for 1H and 13C are reported as <LATEX>\delta</LATEX> values (ppm) and referenced to a residual solvent <LATEX>\left( \delta = 7 . 2 6 \mathrm { p p m } \right.</LATEX> for 1H; <LATEX>\delta =</LATEX> 77.16 ppm for 13C). High-resolution mass spectra (HRMS) were determined using electrospray ionization (ESI) in the mode of positive ion registration with a TOF mass analyzer. High-resolution mass spectra of compound 7e (methanol solution) were recorded on a Bruker maXis Q-TOF instrument equipped with an atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI-MS) ion source in positive ion mode. IR spectra were recorded for tablets with KBr. The single- crystal X-ray diffraction studies were carried out on a diffractometer at 100 K using Cu Ka radiation (1 = 1.54180 Å). Using Olex 2, 37 137 the structure was solved with the Super flip structure solution program138 using Charge Flipping and refined with the ShelXL refinement package using least-squares minimization.
