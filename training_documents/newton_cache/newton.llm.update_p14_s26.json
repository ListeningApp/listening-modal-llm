We remark that computing an expansion of the basis requires a single Hessian-vector product, H Vt. The basis for the Krylov subspace allows us to significantly simplify eight. Indeed, let St be a solution to eight at iteration t. By St in Kt(H, g), we have st equals Vt yt for some yt in Rt. Hence, the residual can be written as\n8z32 | rt equals negative g minus Hst equals negative g minus H Vt yt equals negative g minus Vt plus one Tt yt equals negative Vt plus one absolute value of g e one plus Tt yt.\n0yaq | In the final equality, we applied the orthogonality of the basis vectors and v one equals g over norm of g. Applying this expression to eight and using the orthogonality of Vt plus one, we obtain the reduced tridiagonal least-squares problem\no21p | absolute value of g e one plus Tt yt norm zero one.\n0g5c | min\nql4n | fourteen\neyg6 | where thirty-one equals norm of g.\n00l8 | QR Factorisation. The next step in the MINRES procedure is to solve fourteen by computing the full QR factorisation Qt Tt equals Rt where Qt in R(t plus one) by(t plus one) and Rt in R(t plus one) by t. Because It is already close to being upper triangular, we form the QR factorisation using a series of Householder reflections to annihilate the sub-diagonal elements. Each Householder reflection affects only two rows of Tt. We can summarise the effect of two successive Householder reflections\nojx3 | fourteen\n7o0d | Inexact Newton-type Methods for Optimization with Nonnegativity Constraints\n7atk | for three less than i less than t minus one as",
