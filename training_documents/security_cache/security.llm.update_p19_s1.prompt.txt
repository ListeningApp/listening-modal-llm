You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

d8zj | Additional security can be created by increasing the distance from the FPoC and the main area that is being protected, and by the introduction of additional barriers. The basic principles behind Security in Depth (figure 10) are the same whether it is limiting access to the backstage area at a concert, the VIP room of a club, the Chairman's office in a major corporation or the research laboratories in a technology company.
ywxn | 5.3 Principle 2: Total Cover: Everyone is Responsible for Security
uxhs | One of the fundamental principles of both Disney World and El Al is that security is not just a single event - you show your pass to someone, and then the security checks are finished - but that security is in-built into every aspect of that organisation's functions. For example, whilst the security teams in both systems are highly-trained, extremely professional and well-resourced, they are not the only people responsible for security. The car park attendants, the toilet cleaners, the peanut-sellers, the people taking the rubbish out of the kitchen are all considered to be part of the security management programme. In this way, it is possible to have total cover of an organisations' territory, where someone will be bound to spot any potential problem before it becomes an actual danger. The role of that person is then to inform the security team that something is not quite right, and they will then be able to respond in an appropriate manner, assess the situation and take the necessary actions.
ed6e | 5.4 Principle 3: Tight Management
6qqm | David Veness, the former head of Metropolitan Police Special Operations Unit, who was later a Special Adviser to the United Nations Commission on Security, used to have only one sign on his desk. It read 'Security is the management of complacency'. Any effective security management programme has to be one which can be maintained over time, without any loss of capability. Although this is a simple idea to put into words, it is possibly one of the hardest aspects of security management to actually control.
onum | People are lazy, systems that are considered too intrusive are switched off, good practices are left to wither, systems are not maintained, and often after a certain amount of weeks or months, things return to how they were. It is well recognised that to create genuine organisational change is one of the hardest things to achieve, and yet to a large degree that is the purpose of the security manager. After all, if everything was OK, there would be little need for the security manager in the first place.
3iir | Although there are often limits in what a security manager can achieve (it is often true that the security manager is relatively low in the organisational power chain), there are a number of basic rules that will make it easier to achieve organisational change, and introduce an effective security management system that will at least move towards the creation of a safe organisation.
7a0a | The first is that it is better to have a few rules that everyone follows, rather than many rules which are mainly ignored. The purpose of the security management programme is to support the overall activities of the organisation, so any rules that are introduced should be simple, easy to adhere to and understood by everyone. If there is a system of access passes, that should be used by everyone. If there is a rule that lone workers should log where they are going to be, and then confirm that all is well in a final call before they go home, that should be adhered to.
o1qp | The second rule is that the security management system needs to be supported by everyone, from the Chairmen to the toilet cleaner (as outlined in principle 2, above). Security is not just the responsibility of the security team, but is one of the basic functions of everyone who works within that organisation.
jrik | And the third rule is that security is for ever. It is the role of the security management to ensure that the level of security awareness and readiness is maintained, and that standards are not allowed to slip. The Second Law of Thermodynamics (also known as Entropy) states that unless extra energy is put into a system, it will tend to slow down, lose effectiveness and generally come to a halt. This is equally true of security management. Effective security management is not a natural state. It is the role of the security manager to ensure that the necessary protocols are adhered to, just as much as writing the initial security management programmes in the first place.
xv78 | 5.5 Kaizen ....
sdks | Having taken two examples from American and Israeli organizations, we can finish off this Module with another concept, this time from Japanese management systems. Kaizen is the idea of 'Continuous Improvement', and has become one of the leading general management theories in the last twenty years. In its simplest terms, Kaizen is built on the principle of incremental improvement - identify a weakness, find a way of improving it, implement it. It is a philosophy as much as a method, and believes that everyone has expert knowledge of their own field - the car-park attendant is as expert at being a car park attendant as the chief scientist is as being a research manager. They might also be aware of ways in which the security of the car park might be improved which no one else in the organisation has. Arsene Wenger, the Arsenal manager, put it another way: 'If you improve a hundred things by one per cent, you get a hundred per cent improvement'. Whilst this may not be strictly true from a mathematical perspective, it is an excellent way of managing security kaizen.
y8fb | 5.6 Summary
521q | Security has to begin and end somewhere, and that point is decided by how we define the territory that we accept responsibility for. Security in Depth describes the way that we can utilise our own resources in order to
yogo | create progressively more secure environment. These simple principles of security management are used by two of the most well-respected organisation in global security management, each of which is facing completely different potential threats.
2285 | These principles are easy to understand, simple to implement, and can be adapted to almost any security situation.
ys0g | In summary:
7zvp | . Total Security Management (TSM) allows you to be proactive in developing a safe organisation, rather than responding to individual risks / threats
ww6u | . TSM can be Vertical - as in Supply Chain Management - or Horizontal , through control of Territory
hpi6 | . Territory is Space which is defined by Boundaries, and for which you have Information and Control
4uhb | . Safety is increased by Security in Depth,
epyi | . Everyone in an organisation is part of the Security Management Programme
y51p | . Kaizen allows for a culture of continuous improvement across the organisation
x95m | 5.7 Self-assessment exercises
yfum | Self-assessment 1: An organisation has been identified as being involved in an oil spill in Alaska. The Board have decided that the security system around its HQ offices on the 13th-20th floors of an office block in Canary Wharf need to be reviewed, and if necessary improved. Using the principles covered in this module, what recommendations could you make to the Board?
ppx4 | Self-assessment 2: Your Chairman has returned from a visit to Japan, where he has heard about Kaizen. He has requested you give a presentation to the next Board meeting, identifying how Kaizen can be of use to the overall security management of the organization. Put together a PowerPoint briefing (about twenty minutes), that could be given to the Board, together with notes that could be distributed to the Board at the meeting.
qf11 | Self-assessment 3: Your company has taken over a production factory in Ukraine. It stands in its own area within a larger industrial park. As Head of Security EMEA, you are going to visit the facility to assess the level of current security, and to identify possible areas that might need improvement. Put together a checklist of points that you would need to cover during your visit to the facility.
