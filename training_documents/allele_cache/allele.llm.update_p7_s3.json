        "content": "gii5 | ASBs is non-reproducible between studies and arise either from particular ChIP-Seq data sets or from unique procedures of different ASB calling pipelines.\nq5eu | To study in detail why ADASTRA failed to capture ASBs found in other studies, we used the set of ASB SNPs identified by one of the most advanced methods for ASB calling, BaalChIP. ASB event could be missed at the SNP calling stage, could fail to pass the read coverage thresholds, or fail to pass the significance threshold for FDR-corrected P value estimated against BAD. To assess the contribution of different stages of our pipeline to ASB calling sensitivity, we performed a stage-by-stage analysis of the underlying SNP set. It turned out that the fraction of BaalChIP ASB SNPs recovered by ADASTRA was different for different cell types, with most of ASBs recovered for the cell types with the deepest sequencing coverage.\na7ao | On the one hand, the basic coverage filters significantly reduced the number of SNPs under consideration resulting in a major loss in the fraction of recovered ASBs. On the other hand, we did not observe critical effects from any of the subsequent stages. For all cell types, the number of BaalChIP ASB SNPs recovered by ADASTRA decreased monotonously, suggesting that there was no particular bottleneck defining the sensitivity of the whole pipeline except the basic coverage filters. As more sites were recovered for cell types with better coverage, one can predict that the difference between different ASB calling pipelines would decrease as soon as more ChIP-Seq data would become available for analysis.",
