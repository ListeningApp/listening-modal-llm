You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

ppqi | It must be remembered that <LATEX>G \left( d \right)</LATEX> is based on a variable that is positive and has a natural origin. Thus, for example, it is inappropriate to use <LATEX>\mathrm { G } \left( d \right)</LATEX> to study resid- uals from regression. Also, for both <LATEX>I \left( d \right)</LATEX> and <LATEX>G \left( d \right)</LATEX> one must recognize that trans- formations of the variable <LATEX>X</LATEX> result in different values for the test statistic. As has

awri | EMPIRICAL EXAMPLES
bl28 | The following examples of the use of <LATEX>G</LATEX> statistics were selected based on size and type of spatial units, size of the <LATEX>x</LATEX> values, and subject matter. The first is a problem concerning the rate of sudden infant death syndrome by county in North Carolina, and the second is a study of the mean price of housing units sold by zip- code district in the San Diego metropolitan region. In both cases the data are explained, hypotheses made clear, and <LATEX>G \left( d \right)</LATEX> and <LATEX>I \left( d \right)</LATEX> values calculated for com- parable circumstances.
d5bz | 1. Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) by County in North Carolina
ap5o | SIDS is the sudden death of an infant one year old or less that is unexpected and inexplicable after a postmortem examination (Cressie and Chan 1989). The data presented by Cressie and Chan were collected from a variety of sources cited in the article. Among other data, the authors give the number of SIDs by county for the period 1979-1984, the number of births for the same period, and the coordinates of the counties. We use as our data the number of SIDs as a proportion of births multiplied by 1000 (see Figure 1). Since no viral or other causes have been given for SIDS, one should not expect any spatial association in the data. To some extent, high or low rates may be dependent on the health care infants receive. The rates may correlate with variables such as income or the availability of physicians' services. In this study we shall not expect any spatial association.
7zvf | Results using the <LATEX>G</LATEX> statistic verify the hypothesis that there is no discernible association among counties with regard to SIDS rates. The values of <LATEX>\mathrm { Z } \left( G \right)</LATEX> are less than one. In addition, there seems to be no smooth pattern of <LATEX>Z</LATEX> values as <LATEX>d</LATEX> increases. The <LATEX>Z \left( I \right)</LATEX> results are somewhat contradictory, however. Although none are statistically significant at the .05 level, <LATEX>Z \left( I \right)</LATEX> values from 30 to 50 miles, about the distance from the center of each county to the center of its contiguous neigh- boring counties, are well over one. This represents a tendency toward positive spatial autocorrelation at those distances. Taking the two results together, one should be cautious before concluding that a spatial association exists for SIDS
mov9 | among counties in North Carolina. Perhaps more light can be shed on the issue by using the <LATEX>G _ { i } \left( d \right)</LATEX> and <LATEX>G _ { i } ^ { * } \left( d \right)</LATEX> statistics.
ks7m | Table 4 and Figure 2 give the results of an analysis based on the <LATEX>G _ { i } \left( d \right)</LATEX> and <LATEX>G _ { i } ^ { * } \left( d \right)</LATEX> statistics for a <LATEX>d</LATEX> of thirty-three miles. This represents the distance to the furthest first-nearest neighbor county of any county.
w1w1 | The <LATEX>G _ { i } ^ { * } \left( d \right)</LATEX> statistic identifies five of the one hundred counties of North Carolina as significantly positively or negatively associated with their neighboring counties (at the .05 level). Four of these, clustered in the central south portion of the state, display values greater than + 1.96, while one county, Washington near Albemarle Sound, has a <LATEX>Z</LATEX> value of less than - 1.96 (see Figure 2). Taking into account values greater than + 1.15 (the 87.5 percentile), it is clear that several small clusters in addition to the main cluster are widely dispersed in the southern part of the state. The main cluster of values less than - 1.15 (the 12.5 percentile) is in the eastern part of the state. It is interesting to note that many of the counties in this cluster are in the sparsely populated swamp lands surrounding the Albemarle and Pam- lico Sounds. If overall error is fixed at 0.05 and a Bonferroni correction is applied, the cutoff value for each county is raised to about 3.50. However, such a figure is unduly conservative given the small numbers of neighbors.

yj0m | In this case it becomes clear that an overall measure of association such as <LATEX>G \left( d \right)</LATEX> or <LATEX>I \left( d \right)</LATEX> can be misleading because it prompts one to dismiss the possibility of significant spatial clustering. The <LATEX>G _ { i } \left( d \right)</LATEX> statistics, however, are able to identify the tendency for positive spatial clustering and the location of pockets of high and low spatial association. It remains for the social scientist or epidemiologist to explain the subtle patterns shown in Figure 2.
ewfp | 2. Dwelling Unit Prices in San Diego County by Zip-Code Area, September 1989
oczy | Data published in the Los Angeles Times on October 29, 1989, give the adjusted average price by zip code for all new and old dwelling units sold by builders, real estate agents, and homeowners during the month of September 1989 in San Diego County (see Appendix). The data are supplied by TRW Real Estate Information Services. One outlier was identified: Rancho Santa Fe, a wealthy suburb of the city of San Diego, had prices of sold dwelling units that were nearly three times higher than the next highest district (La Jolla). Since neither statistic is robust enough to be only marginally affected by such an observation, Rancho Santa Fe was not considered in the analysis.
