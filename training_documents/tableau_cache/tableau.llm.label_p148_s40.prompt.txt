You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

06yq | Microdosing with psychedelics to self-medicate for ADHD symptoms in adults: A naturalistic study
dpv6 | ARTICLE INFO
8r5j | ABSTRACT
2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

994g | Dashboard Design and Styling
p39w | The purpose of a dashboard is to tell a story. In the scheme of human history, hieroglyphs, the Bible, epic poems, theatre, comic books, and even social media are a few of the many different media through which we recount events to each other. All stories have one of the several primary purposes, to teach values or historical lessons, create culture, motivate people to take action, or entertain, to name a few.
g6k3 | Knowing the purpose of the story that you are telling is imperative to making it memorable. Good stories have several important attributes, which should be kept in mind when you are working. Some of these attributes are as follows:
xmvn | · They're simple and focused
v2zu | . They create an emotional response
z2nh | . Listeners can relate to the actors in them
yhx0 | · They have good, real data
mi09 | It's a good idea to take a few minutes to think about the story that you want to tell before you even create a new dashboard. Think about the stories that are the most memorable to you and the data points in them. Then, put yourself in the place of your listener. Design with your listener in mind. If you can develop a list of the top three data questions that you think are most important to your listener and then design a dashboard that focuses on answering them simply and evocatively, then your dashboard will likely be impactful.

usfq | With Tableau Public, you can tell stories in a variety of ways- with individual visualizations, well-formed dashboards, and story points. You can also integrate your work in Tableau Public into other tools by using the JavaScript API (which is beyond the scope of this book). But just because there are many tools and options at your disposal, it does not mean that you should make your dashboards overly complicated. It's actually just the opposite. Good journalism focuses on keeping stories simple, and you should use the same ethos with your stories. Just because you can do something doesn't mean that you should do it.
4jnl | It truly applies well to designing dashboards; less is more. Knowing your user and their questions is fundamental to a good design, and everything else flows from that.
ows8 | In Tableau Public, you can make a dashboard from one or more visualizations, and you can add images, free text, filters, legends, parameters, links, and even embedded web pages. All of these capabilities are designed to enable you to create a data story that has the right context for your dashboard, both for the consumer and for its relativity to other events and data elements. While you can publish individual worksheets to Tableau Public, we encourage you to organize your work into dashboards so that you can guide your user through a complete story.
qkak | In this chapter, we will discuss some best practices for dashboard creation, the elements of a dashboard, and how to navigate the dashboard worksheet. The following topics will be discussed in this chapter:
39ur | · The design process
nlm3 | · Best practices of dashboard design
muf5 | · The elements of a successful dashboard
lqjf | · Creating a dashboard
7z7b | · Adding context with titles, images, links, and tooltips
tv8z | In the next chapter, we will discuss dashboard filters, actions, and parameters, and after that, we will discuss publishing your work to Tableau Public.
wj6v | The dashboard design process
ax4d | The purpose of Tableau Public is to help you tell data stories interactively. Dashboard design, like view design, should tell a concise story that flows from one element to the next. When you are first starting your journey of dashboard design in Tableau Public, you should expect it to be an iterative process in which you design dashboards and revise them over time, often with input from other people. You might also find it helpful to draw out dashboards before building them in Tableau Public. Leave room and time for experimentation when building your dashboard.

0s3f | You may find that more views, or different views, are needed in order to tell your story. Pulling various views together into a dashboard sometimes exposes flaws in the initial design. In that case, go back and change or add to your views, and then come back to the dashboard design process.
1ajd | Best practices for dashboard design
qj5b | Dashboard design should highlight data and decoration should be limited, to add to a reader's understanding. Much has been written about dashboard design for data visualization. The following are some key points that you should consider when designing dashboards:
15wh | . Keep it simple: Your dashboard needs to answer only one question. If you can construct it so elegantly that it answers several questions, that's great, but according to Stephen Few, the maximum number of data points that any of us can remember at once is three.
ad3x | . Keep in mind the audience: Consider what devices will be used to read or consume the data story and content.
6zdx | . The method of consumption: Will users interact with virtualization on their computer, mobile phone, or tablet? Size your dashboard accordingly.
lwg2 | . Performance: Like any other web application, the amount of time it takes for a consumer to get what they need is a major factor of performance. Design your visualizations and data sources so that they perform efficiently.
zsvp | . Start big and end small: Always place the most aggregated (macro) data points or summary metrics on the upper left, and guide users to granular, actionable data points.
ssmj | . Use colors, graphics, and fonts that are appropriate for your subject matter and consumers. Choose a simple, single color or complementary palette colors. Consider red-green color blindness and improve accessibility. Remove all non-data ink except labels, limited titles, and bare-bones instructional text. Additionally, you can create your own custom color palettes in Tableau Public fairly easily. Use labels, titles, and simple instructional text for the dashboard, and format tooltips so that they add context and calls to action for your users.

m3bl | For the dashboard that we are using in this chapter, we created a rough wireframe in Microsoft Visio. We'll refer to it throughout this chapter so that you can see how the functional elements that we are discussing will be included in the final design. It's fairly common for people to draw out the designs that they would like to build in Tableau Public. Also, it's a great way to keep your objectives in perspective when laying out the dashboard in Tableau Public.
7ul5 | Our sample dashboard, which will be included in a blog post at www.dataviz. ninja, follows the Rule of Thirds - after adding the title to the dashboard, the three primary visualizations, namely aggregated data, change over time, and granular details, will consume about one-third of the total space, as shown in the following screenshot. We have also provided space for filters and color legends, and we will continue to use this dashboard design concept in the following two chapters, which cover filtering and publishing:

emp6 | Creating a dashboard
vm2i | Creating a Tableau Public dashboard is a process of adding the various elements (starting with worksheets), onto the dashboard canvas, adding titles, configuring filters, titles, and layout, and then modifying the behavior of the dashboard.
u7au | Now, we will build a dashboard from simple visualizations that were created by using the Climate Change data that was published by the World Bank and which is available at http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/climate-change. It's structured in a way that is similar to that of the other data sources that we are using. You can download the sample dashboards from https: //public. tableau. com/views/Chaper7-Dashboards/CO2EmissionsDashboard. We will use the data sources that we have discussed in the previous chapters to build sample dashboards so that you can download the source files to practice.
1ti5 | Our workbook includes a summary map of carbon dioxide emissions by country in 2008, as well as a line graph that shows change over time as regards the total emissions and emissions per capita by region. Lastly, it contains a heat map that shows the foreign aid distributed for generic programs by the United States by year.
vpp5 | The objective of this section is to build a dashboard that allows users to navigate from high-level areas of interest, that is, outliers, to more detailed data to identify causation.
y9yd | To start the dashboard creation process, click on the dashboard tab at the bottom of the Tableau Public interface. The dashboard tab is the tab with an icon of a rectangle divided into four quadrants, which is outlined in the following screenshot.
rwaf | You can also browse Dashboard | New Dashboard from the Menu bar:
xbze | When you select the dashboard tab, the dashboard view is displayed. This is the interface that allows you to build and configure dashboards from the worksheets that you have already created in this workbook. To the left of the window are the available worksheets. From the left side of the window, you can also add to the dashboard various supporting elements such as text boxes, labels, web page windows, and images. To the right is the canvas area of the dashboard, where sheets and objects are dragged to, arranged, and configured.

8z32 | The dashboard interface is similar to the worksheet workspace in many ways. In the following screenshot, we have identified its several key areas.
0yaq | Like the worksheet view, the dashboard has the following elements:
o21p | . The menus and toolbar, which are placed horizontally across the top of the page
0g5c | . The Dashboard pane on the left, where you can determine the exact composition of your dashboard
ql4n | · The canvas, where you will drag worksheets and other visual elements
eyg6 | We have numbered the elements on the dashboard, as shown in the following screenshot. They are as follows:
00l8 | . A list of worksheets (1) that have not been hidden and which are sorted according to the order in which they are arranged in your workbook
ojx3 | . Containers and objects (2) that can be dragged onto your dashboard to increase the integrity of the design
7o0d | · A controller (3) for new objects
7atk | . A hierarchy of dashboard objects (4) that can be used for navigation
opr3 | · A controller (5) for the dashboard size
rsan | . The canvas (6) where you will compose the dashboard
3l5p | If you are creating a new dashboard, the canvas will be blank. If you open an existing dashboard, the various existing dashboard elements will be displayed on the canvas. The following screenshot shows the dashboard interfaces:
keiw | www.it-ebooks.info
h95r | Chapter 7
8bxq | It's important to keep in mind the purpose of your dashboard. We are building a dashboard that tells the story of carbon dioxide emissions over time. The dashboard should allow users to navigate to the areas of interest and then understand the factors of consumption.
bzwy | The dashboard will have the following key elements, which were previously discussed:
icip | . Title, so that our users know what they are viewing
x0k3 | . At least one visualization with data and proper context is required so that different data points relate to each other and to the user
wh96 | · A call to action (conclusion) is also needed so that users know how to explore the details within the dashboard or go to another web page

ysej | Dashboard Design and Styling
mj7h | In order to build this dashboard, we will start with a single visualization, which is the visualization with summary data in this case. Drag a sheet onto the canvas by hovering over the visualization that you want to add, pressing the left mouse button, and dragging it onto the canvas, as depicted in the following screenshot. You can also double-click on the worksheet name.
3avc | If you wish to remove a worksheet from the dashboard, click on the title of the visualization until a grey container bar appears at the top border of the visualization. Then, right-click on the grey bar. Select Remove from Dashboard from the shortcut menu:
j9bn | The result, as shown in the following screenshot, shows the map that we created. This map shows the CO2 emissions per capita in 2008, which was taken from the World Bank official website. Each country is colored by its relative percentile in the data set, and the label shows the CO2 emissions per capita.

mk0a | However, users don't know all of that yet:
zn35 | Tableau Public automatically added the following two elements:
rrn2 | . The worksheet name as the title
foid | . The color legend in a vertical layout container to the right
152h | In order to compose an empathetically designed user experience with proper context, we need to use layout containers to rearrange the dashboard and create a flow of both navigation and information, that is, a data story. The next section discusses layout objects, and we will show examples of how to use them.

m2uh | Dashboard Design and Styling
erho | Layout objects
bpnq | Tableau Public has several different layout objects that you can add to your dashboard to control the composition.
3xla | Objects are versatile, and you can use them to reflect the overall theme of your graphic composition. From the context menu of an object, you can perform the following tasks:
fs5q | . Format it with borders and background colors
pse2 | · Remove it
rc6c | · Set it as a floating or tiled object
batl | • Remove it from the dashboard
cbqc | You can set the height and width attributes for floating objects, just like you can for worksheets that you have added (and for the dashboard as a whole, which is highly encouraged).
h0lb | The following objects can be added to your dashboard:
87w1 | . Horizontal layout containers: You can drag worksheets that you want next to each other into these containers.
7mw9 | . Vertical layout containers: You can drag other objects and worksheets that you want to stack from top to bottom into these containers.
c5q7 | . Text objects: These can be used to add titles and calls to action. Though you can't add field tokens to text objects, you can add parameter tokens, which will be discussed in depth in the next chapter.
nbs7 | . Images: You can use these to browse logos or branding elements that add richness to your dashboard. You can also use images as links to web pages, since each image can have a URL attribute.
tiyt | . Web page objects: These can be used to add content from the Internet. You can even create dynamic content, which will be covered in the next chapter too.
tiha | · Blank objects: These objects can be used to control space. Blank containers are transparent. So, the background colors that you are using will show through them.
816q | [ 140 ]
ir95 | www.it-ebooks.info
0ypu | Chapter 7
1ic0 | In the section of the dashboard pane that says New objects, the default object is set to Tiled. You should leave it there until you are comfortable with dashboard design. Each new object that you add to your dashboard will have this setting, and though you can easily change the attribute for individual sheets on a dashboard, it's best to keep things simple in the beginning. The Tiled automatically aligns objects to the dashboard grid, and floating adds new objects to the dashboard that are detached from the dashboard grid.
rxkz | notes:
5va3 | When you add objects, like worksheets, into a horizontal or vertical layout container, the widths and heights of the objects will be sized automatically, unless you specify otherwise. In case you're using actions, which will be discussed in the next chapter, it's particularly useful to use containers for sizing automatically.
iqdo | Setting the size of dashboard elements
6rzq | Usually, dashboard elements such as containers can be set by manipulating the border handles of each container and resizing them to a suitable size. Tableau Public also offers a Size feature, as shown in the following screenshot, that allows for more control in the positioning and sizing of these dashboard elements:
rjyh | 1
64js | The dashboard element must be in the floating mode so that it can be sized and positioned. In case the container or element is not already in the floating mode, it can be set to floating by clicking on the dashboard element and checking off the Floating checkbox, as shown in the previous screenshot.
84do | notes
n581 | To change the positioning of the dashboard element, enter the x and y coordinates (this will take some trial and error) in the corresponding Pos: fields, or scroll up and down with the arrows for fine correction. To change Size, enter the width (w) and height (h) values in the corresponding fields using the up and down arrows for fine adjustment.
