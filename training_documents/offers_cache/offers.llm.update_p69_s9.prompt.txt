You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

7cm1 | I'm not here to argue about whether meditation is better than Xanax (obviously it is) but that doesn't mean it's perceived as more valuable.
oyk6 | This is also the reason that the supplement industry ($123B, Grandview Research) is twice the size of the health club industry ($62B, IHRSA). They both accomplish the same perceived objectives - "being healthy," "losing weight," "looking good," "increased energy," etc. - but one is perceived as more valuable because it has lower "costs."
3qp5 | People are more willing to pay $200 for supplements than they are a $29/mo membership. Taking a pill, or drinking a shake, is so much faster and easier than going to the gym everyday. Hence . . . valued.

haqw | P eople who help others (with zero expectation) experience higher levels of fulfillment, live longer, and make more money. I'd like to create the opportunity to deliver this value to you during your reading or listening experience. In order to do so, I have a simple question for you ...
89i1 | Would you help someone you've never met, if it didn't cost you money, but you never got credit for it?
gfu5 | If so, I have an 'ask' to make on behalf of someone you do not know. And likely, never will.
mvzl | They are just like you, or like you were a few years ago: less experienced, full of desire to help the world, seeking information but unsure where to look .... this is where you come in.
buwu | The only way for us at acquisition.com to accomplish our mission of helping entrepreneurs is, first, by reaching them. And most people do, in fact, judge a book by its cover (and it's reviews). If you have found this book valuable thus far, would you please take a brief moment right now and leave an honest review of the book and its contents? It will cost you zero dollars and less than 60 seconds.
zsfu | Your review will help ....
hyvo | .one more entrepreneur support his or her family.
5l9v | .one more employee find work they find meaningful.
6tv1 | one more client experience a transformation they otherwise would never have encountered.
l79g | one more life change for the better.
d8ia | To make that happen ... all you have to do is .... and this takes less than 60 seconds .... leave a review.

p3um | VALUE OFFER: THE THOUGHT PROCESS
fcs1 | I want to do an exercise with you right now. I want to show you the difference between convergent and divergent problem solving. Why? So that you can actually create the Grand Slam Offer that will become the cornerstones of your business.
5rxi | Convergent & Divergent Thinking
cm65 | In simple terms, convergent problem solving is where you take lots of variables, all known, with unchanging conditions and converge on a singular answer. Think math.
ux5y | Example:
c8vn | You have 3 salespeople who can each take 100 calls per month each.
alzc | It takes 4 calls to create one sale (including no shows).
0dos | You need to get to 110 sales . . .
bc48 | How many sales people must you hire? Deduced Information:
f3v7 | 1 salesperson = 100 calls
8s6f | 4 calls = 1 close
x7h9 | 100 calls/4 calls per close = 25 Closes Per 100 Calls
ygmb | 25 closes per rep
0o5y | Goal: 110 sales total / 25 sales per rep = 4.4
dnu3 | Since you can't hire 4.4 reps, you decide you must have five.
dsty | ANSWER: And since you have 3, you hire two more.
ci0z | Math problems are convergent. There are lots of variables and a single answer. We are taught all our lives in school to think this way. That is because it's easy to grade.
