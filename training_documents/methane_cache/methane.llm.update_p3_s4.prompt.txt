You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

7um8 | Particulate MMO. The first crystal structure of pMMO was that of the M. capsulatus (Bath) enzyme, determined in 2005 to 2.8 Å resolution.23 Structures of pMMOs from Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b, Methylocystis species strain M, and Methylocystis species strain Rockwell have also been reported (Table 1).24-26 The pmoB, pmoA, and pmoC subunits are arranged as a 300 kDa @33313 trimer (Figure 2B), which is consistent with electron microscopic data.27 The pmoB subunit (42 kDa) consists of two cupredoxin-like domains linked by two transmembrane helices. The pmoA (24 kDa) and pmoC (22 kDa) subunits are composed primarily of transmembrane helices. In three of the four pMMO crystal structures, an additional helix not connected to any of the pMMO subunits is observed and appears to interact closely with the pmoC + 24-26 In the Methylocystis sp. str. Rockwell pMMO structure, this interaction is mediated by a lipid molecule (Figure 3).20 Since pMMO is crystallized from the native organism, this yet to be identified helix is likely physiologically relevant.
uow2 | METAL CENTERS AND ACTIVE SITE STRUCTURE
iat7 | Soluble MMO. MMOH contains only one type of metal center, the diiron active site located in each a subunit in the a28212 dimer. This diiron center is housed within a four-helix bundle of which surface-exposed helices E and F play key roles in modulating structural changes throughout the catalytic cycle.22 Fe1 is coordinated by His147, Glu114, and a water molecule, and Fe2 is coordinated by His246, Glu243, and Glu209.2º The two iron ions are bridged by residue Glu144 and two hydroxides (Figure 4A). Upon reduction, the Fe-Fe

This shift opens a site for reaction with dioxygen (Figure 4B).21,28 It is well established that the two iron ions are present as an antiferromagnetically coupled diiron(III) site in oxidized MMOH and a weakly ferromagnetically coupled diiron(II) center in reduced MMOH.29-32 A mixed valence form can also be generated, but does not play a role in the catalytic cycle.7
87cq | Particulate MMO. In contrast to MMOH, several metal centers are observed in the structures of pMMO. All structures contain a copper binding site at the N-terminus of the pmoB subunit with ligands His33, which is the amino terminal residue of pmoB, His137, and His139 (M. capsulatus (Bath) numbering) (Figure 5). Guided by extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) data,33 this site was modeled as two copper ions with a Cu-Cu distance of ~2.5 Å in the structures of M. capsulatus (Bath)23 and M. trichosporium OB3b24 pMMO, and in one protomer of Methylocystis sp. str. M pMMO.25 However, the moderate crystallographic resolution (2.6-3.9 Å) precludes definitive assignment of the nuclearity. This site was modeled as monocopper in Methylocystis sp. str. Rockwell pMMO20 and in two protomers of Methylocystis sp. str. M pMMO.25 Both of these pMMOs exhibit low copper binding stoichiometries once the enzyme is purified and concentrated. In the Methylocystis sp. str. Rockwell pMMO structure, a solvent molecule is modeled coordinated to the single copper ion (Figure 5) and is within hydrogen bonding distance of Glu31 (Glu35 using M. capsulatus (Bath) numbering).20 A monocopper site is also present at the equivalent location in the 1.8 Å resolution structure of the soluble domain of the amoB
