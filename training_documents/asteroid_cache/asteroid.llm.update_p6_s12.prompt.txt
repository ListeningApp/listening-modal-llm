You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

75y3 | The mean <LATEX>\begin{array}{} { \text { eset. } } \\ { 2 0 7 p b ^ { * } / 2 0 6 p b } \end{array}</LATEX> age of the Stannern phosphates also recorded young metamorphism at <LATEX>4 1 4 3 . 0 \pm 1 2 . 5 \mathrm { M a }</LATEX> (Fig. 4), sug- gesting that they experienced severe impact reheating at this time. In contrast to Juvinas, both the apatite and merrillite in Stan- nern yielded identical ages. This may be because the host rock of Stannern was reheated more homogeneously to the U-Pb re- set temperature. According to geochemical studies of the trace in- compatible element trends, the geological backgrounds of Stannern and Juvinas should be different, which means that they resided at different locations on Vesta (e.g., Barrat et al., 2007). Their identi- cal reheating ages of ~4150 Ma indicate that there were two (or more) impact events on Vesta during this period, where the re-
s2g2 | heating temperature was high enough to reset the U-Pb system in the phosphates <LATEX>\left( \geq \sim 5 9 0 - 1 0 0 0 ^ { \circ } C \right.</LATEX> discussed later) but inade- quate to reset that of the zircon. Moreover, the 207 Pb-206Pb age of the Stannern pyroxene and plagioclase also recorded this event at <LATEX>4 1 2 8 \pm 1 6 \mathrm { M a }</LATEX> (Tera et al., 1997). The Stannern 40 Ar-39 Ar age was disturbed at ~4200-3800 Ma and did not present a plateau age (Kunz et al., 1995; Kennedy et al., 2019). Conversely, several radiometric chronologies place the early crystallization of Stannern at 4563 Ma (e.g., Lugmair and Shukolyukov, 1998; Touboul et al., 2015). Its zircon 207 Pb-206 Pb age recorded early thermal metamor- phism at <LATEX>4 5 5 0 \pm 1 0 \mathrm { M a }</LATEX> (Ireland and Bukovanská, 1992). Therefore, the metamorphic history of Stannern can be summarized as fol- lows: (i) ancient crystallization at 4563 Ma, (ii) thermal crustal metamorphism at 4550 Ma, (iii) a reset of the U-Pb system in the phosphates and silicates at <LATEX>\sim 4 1 4 0 \mathrm { M a }</LATEX> through intense impact reheating, and (iv) a subsequent weaker impact at sometime be- tween ~4500 Ma and <LATEX>\sim 3 6 0 0 \quad M a ,</LATEX> where the K-Ar chronometer was disturbed. Events (iii) and (iv) may indicate the same event.
q1q2 | 5.3. Unbrecciated achondrites represent the initial cooling of asteroids
cb7r | The U-Pb systems in the unbrecciated samples, Agoult and Ibitira, recorded significantly ancient events prior to 4.5 Ga. The model <LATEX>2 0 7 p b ^ { * } / 2 0 6 p b ^ { * }</LATEX> age of the Agoult apatite, <LATEX>4 5 2 4 . 8 \pm 9 . 6 \mathrm { M a }</LATEX> (Fig. 4), is identical to or slightly younger than the 207 Pb-206Pb age of its oxide fraction <LATEX>\left( 4 5 3 2 . 3 9 \pm 0 . 8 7 M a \right.</LATEX> and is significantly younger than that of the zircon <LATEX>\left( 4 5 5 4 . 5 \pm 2 . 0 M a \right.</LATEX> lizuka et al., 2015, 2019). The age differences between the different minerals may reflect the slow cooling of the Agoult host rock. It is likely that the rock was buried within the crust after its original crystal- lization and was subsequently heated by the hot interior of Vesta (Iizuka et al., 2019). The original internal heat source, a short-lived radionuclide (26Al; t1/2 ~0.7 Myr), had mostly decayed by this time <LATEX>\left( \sim 4 5 5 5 - 4 5 2 5 \mathrm { M a } \right) .</LATEX> However, according to a thermo-chemical evolution calculation (Neumann et al., 2014), the interior of the mantle of Vesta likely maintained a high temperature for <LATEX>> 1 0 0</LATEX> Myr after differentiation. The recrystallized textures of Agoult, with no apparent evidence of impact brecciation, further support this hypothesis of crustal thermal metamorphism. The <LATEX>4 0 \quad A r - 3 9 \quad A r</LATEX> plateau age of the Agoult plagioclase at <LATEX>4 4 9 6 \pm 8 M a</LATEX> (Iizuka et al., 2019) recorded the end of its subsequent slow cooling. To summa- rize, Agoult has the following thermal history: (i) ancient crystal- lization <LATEX>a t > 4 5 6 0 \quad M a ,</LATEX> (ii) high-temperature crustal metamorphism at 4555 Ma, and (iii) subsequent monotonic cooling with a low <LATEX>1 1 \pm 2 ^ { \circ } C / M y</LATEX> (lizuka et al., 2019) in the deep crust
