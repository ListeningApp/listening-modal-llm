You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

ibgs | Although the selectivity of forming allenyl imidamides is good, the formation of alkyne isomer could not be suppressed in many cases. At this juncture, we surmised that trapping the ketenimine intermediate with alcohols may have different product distributions.50,51 Indeed, under identical conditions except for the replacement of i-Pr2NH (1.2 equiv) with MeOH (10 equiv) and Et3N (2 equiv), the reaction of 1,3-diynes selectively provided 2,3-dienyl imidates without a vestige of the alkyne isomer (Table 2). The lower stoichiometry of methanol
colo | led to the lower efficiency of the reaction. Alkyl and alkenyl diynes, which provided a mixture of allenyl and alkynyl imidamides previously, selectively generated allenyl imidates (3ae, 3ce, and 3de) in moderate to good yield (entries 1-3, respectively). Even though 1,3-diyne 1g containing a free secondary alcohol led to decomposition (entry 4), the corresponding <LATEX>\begin{array}{} { \text { ding acyl- } } \\ { 1 , 3 - \text { divec } } \end{array} ,</LATEX> benzyl-, and tert-butyldimethylsilyl- protected provided 2,3-dienyl imidates (3he, 3he', and 3he", respectively) in good yield (entries 5-7, respectively). Similarly, 1,3-diyne with benzyl-protected secondary alcohol 1i delivered 2,3-dienyl imidate 3ie in 72% yield.
d6r4 | Subsequently, we observed that under standard conditions, 1,3-diynes 4 containing an an acetoxy or benzoyloxy substituent at the propargylic position provided mono-, di-, and trisubstituted [3]cumulenes (Table 3).52-56 For example, 1,3-diynes 4a-4c afforded trisubstituted cumulenes 5a-5c, respectively, in 76-80% yields (entries 1-3, respectively). 1,3- Diynes substituted with a cycloalkyl moiety afforded the corresponding cumulenes 5d-5f in good yields (entries 4-6, respectively). Unexpectedly, while the acetate derivative of tertiary alcohol was afforded, the corresponding primary and secondary acetates provide a mixture of the expected [3]cumulenes and the corresponding acetoxy allene deriva- tives. However, upon replacement of the acetate with <LATEX>p -</LATEX> nitrobenzoate (4g-4i), only cumulenes 5g-5i were obtained (entries 7-9, respectively). We believe this is the consequence of the better leaving group capacity of a benzoate compared to that of an acetate. [3]Cumulenes make up a special class of polyene organic compounds whose synthetic utilities have been little explored.7-60 Thus, the current mild protocol to allow the preparation of [3]cumulenes containing various
9mrz | substituent patterns from readily available building blocks is of highly synthetically useful.
pk06 | We envision that with a suitably tethered nucleophile, the conversion of 1,3-diynes to the corresponding conjugated allenyl imidamide and imidates would promote an intra- molecular Michael-type addition (Table 4).61-65 Under
7wn9 | standard conditions, homopropargyl alcohol-containing 1,3- diynes 6a and 6b were smoothly converted to tetrahydrofur- anylidene imidates 7a and 7b in 48% and 87% yields, respectively (entries 1 and 2, respectively). The corresponding homopropargyl sulfonamide 6c led to 1-tosylpyrrolidinylidene imidamide 7c in 72% yield (entry 3); however, the formation of a six-membered ring 7d from 6d failed (entry 4). 1,3-Diynes 6e and 6f substituted with a phenyl group containing an o-OH or NH2 participated in the cascade reaction to generate benzofuranyl imidamide 7e in 70% yield and indolyl imidamide 7f in 64% yield (entries 5 and 6, respectively).
wcd0 | Although expected, migration of the triple bond from 3- alkynyl or 2,3-dienyl isomers to the corresponding 2-alkynyl
caos | isomer 8 was not observed under the conditions regardless of the reaction time. However, because of the thermodynamic preference for 2-alkynyl isomers, we surmised that the isomerization of 2 or 3 to 8 would happen if a base stronger than secondary amines is used (Scheme 4).00 Indeed, treating a
qrvy | mixture of 2 and 3 with DBU (0.1 equiv) rapidly induced isomerization to provide 2-alkynyl imidamides 8a-8d. On the contrary, phenyl- and silyl-substituted 3-alkynyl imidiamides 2 and 3 did not isomerize to the corresponding 2-alkynyl isomers 8e and 8f, respectively.
pn9j | In conclusion, we have developed efficient protocols to generate discrete isomers of 2-alkynyl, 3-alkynyl, 2,3-dienyl, and 2,3,4-trienyl imidamides and imidates from copper- catalyzed reactions of 1,3-diynes and tosylazide. The selectivity between 3-alkynyl and 2,3-dienyl imidamides could be controlled by a heteroatom substituent at the propargylic position of the 1,3-diynes and employing different trapping reagents such as amines and alcohols. [3]Cumulene derivatives were also generated by employing 1,3-diynes that contain an acetoxy or bezoyloxy substituent at the propargylic position. While trapping of the putative azacumulene intermediates with amines provided either 3-alkynyl or 2,3-dienyl imidamides depending on the structure of the trapping amines, trapping with methanol selectively generated 2,3-dienyl imidates. It was found that both 3-alkynyl and 2,3-dienyl imidamides could be isomerized to selectively generate the corresponding 2-alkynyl isomers under equilibrating conditions with a stronger base such as DBU. Intramolecular trapping of the putative azacumulene intermediates provided five-membered hetero- cyclic products if the 1,3-diyne substrates contained a homopropargylic hydroxyl or amino substituent. A unique feature of these unprecedented reactions is that under mild reaction conditions, terminal 1,3-diynes could be selectively converted to different unsaturated carboxylic acid derivatives with good selectivity.
