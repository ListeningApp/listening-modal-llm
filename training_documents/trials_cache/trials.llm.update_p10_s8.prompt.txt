You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

d0ik | 8 Adjustments to sample size calculations
0x0s | In the calculations so far it has been assumed that full information is available on everyone (i.e. no losses to follow-up) and also that every patient receives the treatment they are allocated. In reality this is rarely achieved and some adjustments to the sample size needs to be made to account for this.
4exe | In this section the implications of these two scenarios will briefly be considered including what adjustments can be made. Note that these adjustments make certain assumptions but provide useful guidance to the number required. In addition, the situation where more patients will be randomised to one group than the other will also be discussed.
0myz | 8.1 Losses to follow-up
xh3i | If patients are lost to follow-up for some endpoint then this reduces the effective sample size. For example, if 2% of patients in the UK PACE trial were expected to be lost to follow-up for mortality then the effective sample size of 1926 would be reduced by 2% (although in the UK, the Office of National Statistics can notify the trial when a patient dies).
syiw | Suppose the proportion expected to be lost to follow-up is 'Q' then, in order to adjust for this, the total sample size needs to be multiplied by
kg3t | <LATEX>1 / \left( 1 - Q \right) .</LATEX> For example, the UK PACE trial would need to be increased to
lvae | <LATEX>1 9 2 6 \times \left( 1 / 0 . 9 8 \right) = 1 9 6 6 .</LATEX> 3.10
o9sc | 8.2 Patients who receive the alternative treatment
121u | In many trials some patients will receive the alternative treatment. The impact of this is to make the groups more similar and therefore potentially reduce the observed treatment effect and therefore power is lost. In order to allow for this a correction formula is given below.
zh03 | Let Q1 = proportion in group 1 getting the treatment for group 2 Let Q2 = proportion in group 2 getting the treatment for group 1
1mvw | Correction formula: multiply the required sample size by
6d4s | (1-Q1 -Q2)2
mqah | For example, suppose in the UK PACE trial:
xxr8 | 1% of patients randomised to the single chamber group received the dual chamber treatment 2% of patients randomised to the dual chamber group received the single chamber treatment
rl4j | The required size = (1-0.01-0.02)2 1926 =2048
vz32 | Alternatively the treatment effect to be detected might already account for the impact of patients receiving the alternative treatment.
ncb0 | Clearly, it is desirable to limit the number of patients who switch treatments and if the percentages become too large then interpretation becomes increasingly difficult. This is particularly important in non-inferiority trials (see session 7) where the aim is to show treatments are similar.
8mp0 | 8.3 Patients who stop treatment
xjyk | One simple adaptation to the formula introduced on the previous page relates to placebo controlled trials where a proportion, Q, on the active therapy stop taking their medication. For the purposes of the sample size adjustment, the proportion who stop their placebo medication is less important (as the randomised treatment contains no active ingredient expected to affect outcome).
mt0f | The impact will be to make the active treatment group more similar to the placebo group. The correct formula used is to multiply the sample size by 1/(1-Q)2.
awab | As mentioned, certain assumptions are made (for example, that those stopping active therapy do so early in the trial) but the adjustments do provide useful guidance.
ixcc | 8.4 Other adjustments
8p6h | A trial which randomises patients to two treatment groups of equal size is usually the most efficient design in terms of total numbers required. However, it is sometimes the case that more patients are randomised to one group than the other.
pmgl | Suppose patients are to be randomised to two groups in the ratio r:1. Then the total sample size required for equal numbers needs to be increased as follows:
90no | Multiply the sample size by
jt0y | <LATEX>\left( r + 1 \right) ^ { 2 } / 4 r</LATEX> For example, in the UK PACE trial, suppose the investigators wanted to randomise patients in the ratio 2:1 to the dual chamber treatment. The total sample size would need to be increased as follows:
qb7o | <LATEX>1 9 2 6 \times \left( 2 + 1 \right) ^ { 2 } / 8 = 2 1 6 6 .</LATEX> Since the required ratio is 2:1, the number required in the dual chamber group would be <LATEX>\left( 2 1 6 6 \times 2 / 3 \right)</LATEX> <LATEX>= 1 4 4 4 ,</LATEX> and the number required in the single chamber group 722.
oae5 | 9 Trials which are too small and other issues
s0fl | There are a number of important problems associated with trials which are too small. Such trials will be underpowered to detect realistic treatment differences, i.e. increasing the chance of a false negative result. In addition, the observed treatment effects could be far from the true values (whether the null hypothesis or some alternative hypothesis is true). These observed effects will also be measured imprecisely.
43ia | Unfortunately many trials are too small and as a result will be unable to reliably answer clinically meaningful questions. In addition they use valuable resources and it could be considered unethical to expose patients in a trial which has little chance of being able to address a clinically meaningful question.
3g2y | In addition the results can be misleading and potentially lead to publication bias. Suppose a number of small trials are conducted addressing a similar question. It is likely that some small trials will produce results showing a large, statistically significant effect which might be a chance finding or at best an exaggeration of the truth. The trials showing a significant effect are more likely to be written up and accepted for publication.
gc7v | Trials which are too small are a hindrance to medical progress but finding adequate numbers of patients is not easy. In addition investigators may be over-optimistic in the ability of a trial to recruit eligible patients and recruitment often takes longer than expected. Therefore a realistic appraisal of resources and potential patient accrual is needed.
wqfv | However, there are a number of ways in which numbers can be potentially increased.
j30a | · The trial may need to be conducted as a multi-centre collaboration. Patient accrual will be quicker and more eligible patients available.
7bdk | . Avoid being too restrictive in respect of the patient entry criteria. This will also have the advantage of making the results more broadly applicable.
fim0 | · Trials of more than two treatments require more patients so some thought is necessary as to any benefits of including more than two treatment groups. One possible approach would be through the use of a factorial design (see session 8).
ojro | In this session the main techniques have been covered to calculate sample size when comparing percentages and means for a clinical trial where each individual is randomised. Similar considerations are needed when estimating the required sample size for other measures of effects, e.g. rates which account for varying follow-up times, however a detailed discussion of these formulae is beyond the scope of this module but included in the articles in the references.
l6t9 | In addition, other sample size considerations are required depending on the trial design, e.g. when the aim is to show one treatment is equivalent (or non-inferior) to another treatment or when groups (or clusters) are randomised rather than individuals. These will be discussed in more detail later in the module (sessions 7 and 8).
1ujy | 10 Summary
qzor | In this session the importance of estimating the required number of patients needed to produce a clinically meaningful result has been discussed. Sample size formulae have been introduced for comparing percentages (or proportions) and means together with adjustments which can be made under different conditions. More complex formulae exist but give similar results.
