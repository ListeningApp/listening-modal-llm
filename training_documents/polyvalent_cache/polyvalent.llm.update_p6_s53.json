        "content": "cp13 | For all phages, calculated K-a vary for different assumed complex stoichiometries. For the one-to-one stoichiometry, K-a values are the lowest (highest affinity). Then, they rise for bivalent receptors and slightly decrease for pentavalent. The M-thirteen phages usually have three to five copies of the p-three protein. Therefore, the expected valency is between two to five. For every variant, the difference between K-a calculated under the receptor's mono- and bi-valency assumption is higher than the difference between the one-to-two and one-to-five stoichiometries. It suggests that the accurate stoichiometry is closer to one-to-two or one-to-five than to one-to-one. The determined values are very low compared to typical K-a for immunological complexes. However, the presented method requires working under similar concentrations of M-thirteen and T-n-T. The linear range of concentrations obtained for phages using k-E-L-I-S-A was in the picomolar range; therefore, T-n-T concentration also had to be picomolar. A significant disadvantage of this method is that phage titer biologically measured may differ from the real physical concentration of phage particles in solution measured during E-L-I-S-A. In the biological method, phages are only detected if they can infect bacteria and induce dye (x-gal) metabolism to a blue product. In solution, phages may form aggregates that produce false low phage titers from biological assays. For A-three, B-seven, and D-eleven clones, values of K-a are in a similar range which does not correlate with their distribution in the recovered pool. This fact may be explained by the varied rate of\nbgre | phages' amplification in bacteria culture caused by the different proportions of amino acids in peptides and the possible interaction of peptides with bacterial proteins. The same explanation is suggested by the manufacturer of the Ph.D.- twelve kit as justification for advising against the amplification of phage-displayed peptide libraries. For the wild-type M-thirteen, it was impossible to calculate a K-D that may have a physical sense (calculated K-D values were negative), which shows that the model may be applied only for specific interactions.\n57lp | If a phage is treated as monovalent, the measured K-D does not refer to the thermodynamical strength of single peptide-T-n-T interactions. However, the resultant affinity (strength of single interaction) and valency (number of binding sites per particle) are known in immunology as avidity. Avidities are most significant for I-g-M antibodies that consist of five subunits presenting two antigen-binding domains on each one. As a result, a single I-g-M antibody can theoretically bind ten epitopes, causing one-to-ten antibody-ligand complex stoichiometry. Moreover, bivalent I-g-G antibodies' K-D is affected by non-monovalency in the same manner. Due to avidity's different nature, compared to affinity, a relative dissociation constant may be ten to the power of two to ten to the power of four lower than a single paratope-epitope K-D. However, in several publications, K-D was calculated without correction for non-monovalency of the antigen-binding particle (e.g., phage). One should be aware that the K-D calculated from E-L-I-S-A in these papers is more avidity than affinity.\nukth | Several minor modifications of the presented method may be considered to improve the accuracy of K-D determination via E-L-I-S-A. Limitation of non-specific interaction between phage particles and plate/surface-immobilized proteins and revision of phage concentration measurement would be the most significant improvements. However, the proposed mathematical interpretation of interactions between polyvalent receptors sheds new light on the field of affinity determination in phage-peptide systems, similar to the theory presented by the previous authors. The presented model was compared with empirical results that confirm the hypothesis about the mixed valency of phage particles depending on the number of p-three. Studies on peptide-protein complex formation and dissociation in other experimental systems may be discussed in a separate paper to provide comprehensiveness of the field of K-D determination in biochemical sciences.\nkpvt | The described method consumes low amounts of a target protein. Moreover, the phage material is easily amplified in bacteria culture. Owing to this, the presented assay is very suitable and valuable for research aimed at developing new high-affinity protein-specific receptors. The identified T-n-T-specific peptides might also find applications in research, especially connected with heart and cardiovascular diseases. Moreover, we anticipate that the selected T-n-T binding phages or peptides can be used to optimize a sensing layer toward implementing this concept for detecting the markers of cardiovascular diseases and transferring them into feasible applications in clinical diagnostics. The applied method may also cover other systems where monovalent molecules interact with multiple active sites of the receptor-like natural antibodies.\njie2 | Methods\nd0ik | Proteins (in the form of lyophilized powder): troponin T from the human heart, B-S-A and myoglobin from the equine heart (M-b) were purchased from Sigma, U-S-A, dissolved in one hundred\n0x0s | Article\n4exe | millimolar phosphate-buffered saline P-H equals seven point four (P-B-S) also bought from Sigma, U-S-A and stored at negative twenty degrees Celsius.
