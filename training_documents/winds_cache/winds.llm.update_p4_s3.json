        "content": "xxr8 | To determine the biomass of jellyfish washed up on Cable Beach, we first sampled jellyfish offshore to determine the size and weight distribution of the jellyfish population. We then compared the size distribution of jellyfish on the beach with those offshore using a Mann-Whitney U test, and finding no difference, we applied the average weight of the jellyfish sampled offshore to counts of jellyfish washed ashore. A total of one hundred fifty-nine individuals of Crambionella mastigophora were collected with a dip net offshore of Gantheaume Point on nineteenth September twenty twelve at seventeen point nine seven seven six one four degrees South, one hundred twenty-two point one seven three three zero zero degrees East from a six-meter boat taking care to collect all individuals that could be reached from the boat in the top five hundred centimeters of water to ensure no bias in size selection. These were collected into buckets and then measured on shore for maximum\nrl4j | bell width (diameter) and weighed (whole wet weight) to the nearest one gram on an Accura ACC two zero seven zero RD electronic scale. A further one hundred eighty-six individuals washed up on Cable Beach were measured for maximum bell width on fifth October twenty twelve by collecting all jellyfish from an area four by eight meter quadrat at seventeen point nine three three five five six degrees South, one hundred twenty-two point two zero eight five zero zero degrees East. Biomass in terms of wet weight to size was determined as above, and dry weight and ash-free dry weight were determined by drying samples of jellyfish tissue (principally from the bell) of known wet weight in a Labconco Freezone two point five freeze dryer at negative forty degrees Celsius until constant weight was achieved and then reweighing before ashing at four hundred fifty degrees Celsius for four point five hours and reweighing. Jellyfish tissue was not rinsed in freshwater before drying, so some residual salt may have remained when dried. The mean ratios of wet to dry and wet to ash-free dry weight were then used to calculate biomass for the full-size range of\nvz32 | September twenty twelve. Sites A and B were sampled for prey species, Site C was sampled for medusa size frequency (top right and lower left positions of panel three are seventeen point seven nine degrees South, one hundred twenty-two point three zero degrees East and eighteen point zero three degrees South and one hundred twenty-two point one two degrees East, respectively)\nncb0 | jellyfish sampled. Total organic carbon, total nitrogen content and stable isotopes (carbon thirteen and nitrogen fifteen) were assessed using freeze-dried tissue. Samples were analyzed for nitrogen fifteen and carbon thirteen, using a continuous flow system consisting of a Delta V Plus mass spectrometer connected with a Thermo Flush one one one two via Conflo four following the methods of Paul and Skrzypek.\n8mp0 | To determine the biomass of jellyfish washed up on the Cable Beach, we counted all jellyfish in twelve twenty-by-one meter transects at six sites on eighth October twenty twelve. The transects were set out in pairs along two point five kilometers of beach heading south from a site seaward of the Broome Surf Life Saving Club. The location of the first transect was at seventeen point nine three two six three nine degrees South, one hundred twenty-two point two zero eight eight three three degrees East. The sites were five hundred meters apart along the beach, and at each site, two transects were conducted parallel to the shoreline. One transect was near the water's edge, and one transect was near the high-water mark so as to capture the range of densities at each site across the width of the beach. Figure two shows the apparently even distribution of jellyfish across the beach on the day of sampling. The density of jellyfish from both high and low transects was calculated. To calculate total average biomass on the beach, the mean density was calculated from all twelve transects, and this density was converted to wet weight based on the size distribution measured on the same beach three days earlier and the relationship between size and wet weight. To enable the density of jellyfish on the full width of beach to be estimated, we used a conservative estimate of one hundred meter width based on two measurements made from aerial photographs (averaging one hundred fifteen point five meters) of the width of the beach adjacent to the Broome Surf Life Saving Club (one hundred twenty-seven point five meters) and three kilometers to the south (one hundred three point five meters). These measurements were made between the high (six point eight five meters) and low (three point three two meters) tide points for eighth October twenty twelve. A more extensive visual survey of jellyfish on the beach was made by driving a four-wheel-drive vehicle south from the Broome Surf Life Saving Club for five kilometers to Gantheaume Point (seventeen point nine seven zero zero eight three degrees South, one hundred twenty-two point one nine one zero zero zero degrees East) and north for ten kilometers to Coconut Wells (seventeen point eight three eight six one one degrees South, one hundred twenty-two point two zero nine zero two eight degrees East). This fifteen-kilometer survey recorded the southern extent of the strandings, but they may have extended further north as the beach extends a further seven kilometers to a creek and then a further thirteen kilometers north after that. At one-kilometer intervals along with this fifteen-kilometer section of beach, a visual assessment and photograph along with the GPS position were recorded. This survey confirmed that densities measured over the two point five kilometers\nxjyk | stretch south of the Broome Surf Life Saving Club were representative of the entire beach.\nmt0f | To examine for diet, samples of live Crambionella mastigophora were collected (as per the description above) from two locations on nineteenth September twenty twelve: Offshore of Gantheaume Point at seventeen point nine six six nine four four degrees South, one hundred twenty-two point one seven eight nine eight nine degrees East and near Dampier Creek in Roebuck Bay at seventeen point nine six seven five three six degrees South, one hundred twenty-two point two four three two eight one degrees East. The jellyfish were measured (as per above) and placed in plastic bags and then on ice. The method of determining prey items followed that of Browne and Kingsford except it was necessary to freeze the samples in order to transport them to the laboratory where fourteen individuals were thawed over one to two hours in seawater filtered through Whatman glass microfiber filters (zero point six to zero point eight micrometers) and then washed in the container to dislodge any prey items adhering to oral arms. Much of the jellyfish disintegrated during this process but otherwise large pieces of intact jellyfish were removed and washed with a wash bottle containing filtered seawater before all the remaining liquid was filtered through one millimeter and sixty-three micrometer sieves. The filtrate was fixed in five percent formalin before later being searched under a dissection microscope Leica M two zero five C, magnification six point three, objective ten times. Prey items were identified to the lowest taxonomic unit possible by an experienced zooplankton biologist. The method used does not permit gelatinous prey items to be identified.\nawab | Wind, tide, sea-surface temperature, chlorophyll-a, and modelled surface currents",
