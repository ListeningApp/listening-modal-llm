Provision of one reducing equivalent and O two was sufficient to generate the same ensemble of products as those formed under multiple turnover conditions with surrogate redox partners.\nwtfz | DISCUSSION\nqy1i | Steady-state analysis of product formation by AspB has revealed a significant inverse kinetic solvent isotope effect, implicating the use of an intermediate prior to CYP one for the initiation of substrate dimerization. The competent formation of aspergilazine A under conditions when a second electron is omitted suggests that only a single reducing equivalent from a\n1k9e | Journal of the American Chemical Society\n5bjs | redox partner is needed for catalysis to occur. Further support for the reactive nature of a ferric superoxide complex is provided through examination of the single-turnover KSIE of oxy-AspB decay, which reverts to a normal (i.e., K H over K D greater than one) value due to the suppression of available proton-linked uncoupling pathways.\nuodj | Unlike analogous species in nonheme mono- and di-iron enzymes, the ferric-superoxide intermediate in CYPs has been largely considered catalytically inert and instead serves as the primary branchpoint between uncoupling via autoxidation and further reduction and proton-mediated O-O heterolysis. One notable exception is the CYP TxtE, which catalyzes the nitration of tryptophan. Transient absorption studies have shown that the ferric superoxide complex of TxtE reacts with nitric oxide gas to form a ferric peroxynitrite intermediate that subsequently undergoes a homolytic cleavage to form compound two and release of an NO two radical. Intriguingly, TxtE is also missing the conserved acid residue, which is replaced with a proline, underscoring the importance in the management of proton delivery in this process. Unlike AspB, the TxtE oxy-species is unreactive toward its substrate tryptophan but requires further \"activation\" by NO.\nk16v | The analogous oxy-species is used by the histidine-ligated heme enzyme family (recently designated as heme-dependent aromatic oxygenase) that is historically defined by tryptophan two, three (TDO) and indoleamine two, three-dioxygenases (IDO). TDO and IDO act on a very similar tryptophan substrate, and transient absorption experiments have shown that a ferric superoxide intermediate directly reacts with the substrate through a mechanism involving direct radical addition at the Carbon two position of the indole ring or epoxidation. The heterolytic O-O cleavage then furnishes a transient compound two species and a monooxygenated or epoxide product en route to dioxygenation. Thus, we also considered if AspB may initiate activation of cWP in a similar manner involving a cryptic monooxygenation, but such a mechanism is inconsistent with the normal KSIE for oxy-decay upon substrate N-H deuteration and the inhibitory nature of three.\nb2lm | The apparent reactivity of the AspB-oxy complex contrasts with synthetic heme-superoxo adducts, which are typically considered sluggish oxidants for HAT. The bond dissociation free energy of an indole N-H bond is estimated ninety kilocalories per mole, and the DKP N-H is considerably higher. Numerous reports have demonstrated HAT on relatively weak O-H (BDFE less than or equal to eighty kilocalories per mole) substrates, in accordance with the limited experimental data available of the resultant hydroperoxo species (O-OH BDFE seventy kilocalories per mole). Although the precise electronic origins for enabling HAT by AspB-oxy remain to be elucidated, it is likely that preorganization of the substrate in an optimized geometry is necessary to allow for such a reaction to occur and to thwart unwanted indole oxygenation.\nti7f | Based on the current findings, we propose a mechanism for AspB dimerization that is shown in Figure seven. The use of ferric-superoxide species as a primary oxidant may serve as a general stratagem to circumvent monooxygenation and forgo the nonproductive (and less controlled) oxidation of a redox-active substrate by compound I. Although the deuteration strategy employed here does not allow for precise assignment of the abstraction site (DKP vs indole N-H), the ferric-superoxide species may not have the sufficient oxidizing potential for abstraction of the DKP N-H group based on its higher bond\noksu | Article\nwtow | dissociation energy, consistent with the highly inhibitory nature observed upon substrate indole N-methylation. Indole N-H HAT would then be envisioned to furnish a hydroperoxo species, bypassing the need for the I-helix acid residue for primary protonation. As we have shown that the I-helix alcohol residue (T244) is important for functional product formation in AspB, ensuing O-O heterolysis likely occurs to give rise to compound I and provide an additional oxidizing species for the downstream secondary activation required for subsequent dimerization. HAT by compound I would yield compound II, which would then need to auto-decay to regenerate the ferric water-bound resting state.\no22k | Our findings highlight a unique strategy that CYPs can use for selective diversification of natural products through Carbon-Carbon and Carbon-Nitrogen bond formation. This discovery not only expands the scope of CYP reactivity but may also prove valuable in leveraging these enzymes for chemoenzymatic DKP assembly. As both AspB and NzeB bypass the need for a second electron transfer step provided by a redox donor, more efficient turnover methods (e.g., light- or electrode-driven catalysis) can be envisioned to form high yields of these unique bioactive natural products.\nnwfz | ASSOCIATED CONTENT\nnvfy | Supporting Information\nmror | Detailed experimental procedures and kinetic fitting parameters, Figures S1-S20 and Tables S1-S7.\nzlxc | The manuscript was written through contributions of all authors.
