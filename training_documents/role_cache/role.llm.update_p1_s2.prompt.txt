You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

hjzj | Role of MdERF3 and MdERF118 natural variations in apple flesh firmness/crispness retainability and development of QTL-based genomics-assisted prediction
j79f | Summary
6tbv | Retention of flesh texture attributes during cold storage is critical for the long-term maintenance of fruit quality. The genetic variations determining flesh firmness and crispness retainability are not well understood. The objectives of this study are to identify gene markers based on quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and to develop genomics-assisted prediction (GAP) models for apple flesh firmness and crispness retainability. Phenotype data of 2664 hybrids derived from three Malus domestica cultivars and a M. asiatica cultivar were collected in 2016 and 2017. The phenotype segregated considerably with high broad-sense heritability of 83.85% and 83.64% for flesh firmness and crispness retainability, respectively. Fifty-six candidate genes were predicted from the 62 QTLs identified using bulked segregant analysis and RNA-seq. The genotype effects of the markers designed on each candidate gene were estimated. The genomics-predicted values were obtained using pyramiding marker genotype effects and overall mean phenotype values. Fivefold cross-validation revealed that the prediction accuracy was 0.5541 and 0.6018 for retainability of flesh firmness and crispness, respectively. An 8-bp deletion in the MdERF3 promoter disrupted MdDOF5.3 binding, reduced MdERF3 expression, relieved the inhibition on MdPGLR3, MdPME2, and MdACO4 expression, and ultimately decreased flesh firmness and crispness retainability. A 3-bp deletion in the MdERF118 promoter decreased its expression by disrupting the binding of MdRAVL1, which increased MdPGLR3 and MdACO4 expression and reduced flesh firmness and crispness retainability. These results provide insights regarding the genetic variation network regulating flesh firmness and crispness retainability, and the GAP models can assist in apple breeding.
xb13 | Introduction
cxqi | Fruit softening after ripening is important for plant survival and reproduction. However, optimal flesh firmness and crispness are important fruit quality traits determining consumer choice. The retention of these texture attributes during cold storage is critical for long-term maintenance of fruit quality (Bonany et al., 2014; Grammen et al., 2019; Nybom et al., 2008; Yue et al., 2013). Although many quantitative trait loci (QTL) have been identified and several genes have been reported to be involved in fruit storability, molecular insights regarding fruit firmness and crisp- ness retention are currently limited (Eriksson et al., 2004; Janssen et al., 2008; Marín-Rodríguez et al., 2003; Rose et al., 2002; Segonne et al., 2014; Soglio et al., 2009).
qfmx | Fruit firmness and crispness are quantitatively inherited and are genetically controlled by polygenes with minor effects. In apple (Malus domestica Borkh.), a number of QTLs for fruit firmness and flesh texture were repeatedly mapped on chromosomes 1, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16 and 17, which explained 10-49% phenotypic variance (Bink et al., 2014; García-Gómez et al., 2019; King et al.,
rut3 | 2001; Longhi et al., 2012). A set of diagnostic markers have been converted from QTL-based markers via candidate gene prediction and variation validation (García-Gómez et al., 2019; Leng et al., 2017; Mason et al., 2018; Vanderzande et al., 2018).
m3cp | Post-harvest fruit softening, which counteracts flesh firmness and crispness retention, is a complex physiological process involving the biosynthesis of or response to phytohormones and the degradation of cytoskeletons such as polysaccharide (Marondedze and Thomas, 2012; Xu et al., 2018). Ethylene biosynthesis is generally considered a primary factor leading to fruit softening. 1-Aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) synthase (ACS) and ACC oxidase (ACO) are the two well-studied ethylene production-related genes. QTL-based markers on MdACO1 and MdACS1 have been shown to be responsible for apple fruit firmness and shelf life (Costa et al., 2010; Costa et al., 2005a; Harada et al., 2000; Oraguzie et al., 2007). However, the markers on MdACS1 and MdACO1 explained only 8.3-11.4% of phenotype variance, indicating that other genes may contribute to the overall effect of low ethylene production in certain apple lines (Colgan et al., 2006; Costa et al., 2010).
mq4s | The rapid increase in internal ethylene concentration triggers the transition from the initial slow softening phase to the rapid softening phase in apple (Johnston et al., 2001). A functional single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) marker on polygalactur- onase gene MdPG1 (explains up to 10.7% phenotypic variance) was developed from a QTL for fruit post-harvest firmness (Costa et al., 2010). Flesh firmness loss is usually associated with mealiness. The MdPG1 also contributed most to apple flesh mealiness (Moriya et al., 2017). A significant locus spanning pectin methylesterase (MdPME) was associated with apple fruit crispness and mealiness in a genome-wide association study (GWAS) (Amyotte et al., 2017). Apples of cultivar 'Scifresh' soften slowly because of the relatively low MdPME and MdPG activities throughout fruit development and ripening (Ng et al., 2013, 2014).
95el | In addition to the genes for ethylene biosynthesis and pectin degradation, many transcription factors are involved in fine controlling fruit firmness and crispness. Ethylene response factors, MdERF2 and MdERF3 (XM_008339725, should be MdERF1A in NCBI), bind to the MdACS1 promoter and oppositely regulate its transcription during post-harvest ripening in apple (Li et al., 2016). Nevertheless, the genetic regulatory network mediated by these genes and the relationship between them were not clear.
a0a5 | In the last decade, empirical marker-assisted selection (MAS) for apple crispness has been practically used in breeding programmes, enabling breeders to design the perfect hybrid cross and to select the best seedlings from large populations (Laurens et al., 2018; Lezzoni et al., 2016; Peace et al., 2019). Breeders have noticed that the efficiency of MAS is often not satisfactory for traits involving many loci with minor effects. Genomic selection (GS) emerged as an innovative paradigm twenty years ago in animal breeding and was soon adopted and rapidly studied in fruit plants (Biscarini et al., 2017; Gois et al., 2016; Imai et al., 2018; Iwata et al., 2013, 2016; Kumar et al., 2019). In apple, GS or genomic prediction was pioneered by Kumar et al. (2012a, 2012b) and has been used in simulative selections for fruit quality traits, harvest date, and scab resistance (Kumar et al., 2012a, 2012b; McClure et al., 2018; Muranty et al., 2015; Peace et al., 2019).
