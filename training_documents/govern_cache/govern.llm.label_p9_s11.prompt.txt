You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

wcd0 | Endogenous Variables
caos | There is, to begin with, a debate concerning the extent to which international regimes require the services of organizations (in the sense of material entities possessing offices, personnel, equipment, budgets, and legal personality) to function effectively. Those who approach the issue from the perspective of business administration or

1pmc | public administration, whose primary concern is the performance of organizations, exhibit a tendency to shift the focus of analysis from the effectiveness of international regimes to the effectiveness of inter- national organizations.13 This is, in my view, a mistake. With all due respect for the roles organizations play, there is great variation among international governance systems in the extent to which their opera- tion requires the services of some administrative apparatus, and there is no obvious correlation between the presence of organizations and the effectiveness of regimes. As numerous observers have pointed out, moreover, both material and intangible costs are associated with the operation of organizations, which suggests the value of a close examination of the factors that determine when and what sort of organizations are required to make international regimes effective.
5z6q | Quite apart from the matter of organization, there is much to be said for studies of decision procedures, revenue sources, and compli- ance mechanisms in efforts to pinpoint the determinants of institu- tional effectiveness in international society.14 In the case of decision procedures, the problem is to devise some process that makes it pos- sible to avoid the twin pitfalls of paralysis and defection. Ingenious devices, such as the International Whaling Commission's procedure of combining majority rule with a system of individual objections, are surely worthy of study in this connection. The fundamental question regarding revenue sources, concerns the extent to which a regime is able to obtain revenue directly rather than via some pass-through arrangement under which members make periodic contributions. The controversy surrounding efforts to create independent revenue sources in specific cases, such as the proposed International Seabed Authority, indicates how sensitive this issue is. With regard to compli- ance, the problem centers on the need to secure compliant behavior on the part of a regime's members in a social setting in which enforce- ment capabilities are largely under the control of the members them- selves. Recently, this issue has given rise to interesting work both on the idea of transparency (that is, the formulation of rules in such a way as to facilitate efforts to observe or measure compliance) and on
yeoh | Effectiveness
b8hf | the use of sophisticated technologies to monitor compliance on the part of individual members in a nonintrusive manner.15
hntf | The growing awareness that change is one of the dominant charac- teristics of today's world has led also to an increasing concern for robustness and, more specifically, for adaptability or flexibility among those who think about the effectiveness of international regimes. The idea here is that a regime cannot remain effective for long unless it has some built-in capacity to adjust to changes in the issue area to which it pertains or the behavior it is designed to regulate. Because authority is decentralized in international society, there is no simple way to solve the problem of building flexibility into regimes. Yet inge- nious responses to this problem have been developed in some cases. Allowing for the accession of new members (as in the cases of the whaling regime and the Antarctic Treaty regime), for example, can bring about changes in the functioning of a regime without requiring any formal alterations in its constitutive provisions. Providing for changes in the schedule of the whaling regime and the appendixes of the CITES regime without requiring formal ratification has had the effect of introducing considerable flexibility into these governance systems. Equally interesting is the process now emerging in connec- tion with the ozone regime in which the annual review conferences, held under the auspices of the arrangements set forth in the Montreal Protocol, are empowered to make significant changes in the workings of the regime that do not require ratification.16
99fo | Exogenous Variables
y5r7 | The category of exogenous variables thought to have a bearing on the effectiveness of international regimes covers a wider array of factors than the category of endogenous variables. Whereas endoge- nous factors are limited, by definition, to attributes or properties of
lrry | 155
hvhm | INTERNATIONAL GOVERNANCE
863b | the regimes themselves, exogenous variables may range across the full spectrum of driving forces that analysts expect to influence the course of collective outcomes in international society. Thus, not surprisingly, a broad range of factors must be considered by those endeavoring to account for variations in the effectiveness of regimes. Yet these factors do divide into several major clusters associated with different schools of thought about the forces at work in international relations more generally. Three of these clusters, in particular, seem noteworthy as guides to our thinking about the determinants of institutional effec- tiveness: power factors, interest factors, and knowledge factors.
fj24 | Those who call themselves realists or structuralists approach insti- tutions as reflections of the underlying configuration of power in international society.17 This way of thinking may seem most familiar in connection with discussions of regime formation, but it applies just as well to analyses of the effectiveness of governance systems. A par- ticularly prominent strand of this reasoning involves hegemonic sta- bility theory, which suggests that the presence of a hegemon in the sense of a dominant actor or a party possessing a preponderance of material resources is necessary for a regime to function effectively.18 The decline or fall of the relevant hegemon, on this account, is likely to lead inexorably to a reduction of the regime's effectiveness and, in extreme cases, to its transformation. This is, however, not the only power-based argument that is relevant to a discussion of the determi- nants of regime effectiveness. An alternative view, which is especially interesting because it runs counter to the argument embedded in hegemonic stability theory, suggests that institutions work best or are most effective when they operate in an environment characterized by some rough balance of power among their principal members. A little thought will suggest a number of additional power-based ideas that could prove relevant in analyzing the effectiveness of international governance systems.
uz3c | Arguments centering on interests rest on a view of international society that emphasizes interactive decision making and collective ac- tion among groups of autonomous actors. On this account, regimes

ba4l | Effectiveness
ffx8 | are social institutions that emerge to circumvent or mitigate the collective-action problems that plague all social settings featuring in- teractive decision making in the absence of a central public authority or system of rules to guide the behavior of the participants.19 In thinking about regime effectiveness, those who focus on interests tend to emphasize factors relating to the configuration of interests among the players as well as factors relating to the extent to which institutional arrangements offer appropriate solutions to the relevant collective-action problems. Studies of the configuration of interests highlight not only the locus of a given issue area on the spectrum from pure cooperation (that is, coordination games) to pure conflict (that is, zero-sum games) but also other factors such as the existence of a stable equilibrium.20 With regard to solutions, the issue concerns the extent to which institutional arrangements are well adapted to the problem at hand, a subject to which I shall return shortly in discussing linkage variables.
s6su | Those who look to knowledge in thinking about regime effective- ness rest their case on the proposition that ideas matter indepen- dently of configurations of power and interests.21 Their view, devel- oped in many cases in counterpoint to the arguments of the realists or structuralists, suggests that governance systems-in international so- ciety as elsewhere-are reflections of deeper worldviews or intellec- tual paradigms that structure the way people think about relations among states. On this account, a regime is likely to be effective, in at least some of the senses articulated earlier in this chapter, when it rests on a common conception of the problem to be solved and some degree of consensus regarding what is needed to fashion a solution. A particularly provocative line of thinking in this connection centers on the idea of hegemony in the cognitive or Gramscian sense.22 The idea here is that a system of thought, which may or may not be an out- growth of the views of an actor that is a hegemon in the material sense, can hold sway over the thinking of policymakers in many dif-
y219 | 157
06ht | INTERNATIONAL GOVERNANCE
v3r2 | ferent national settings and that the presence of some such cognitive construct is critical to the success or failure of international regimes created to cope with specific problems. Yet there is no reason to con- fine our thinking about knowledge as a source of effectiveness to such a grand theory. It may well be that more mundane considerations regarding knowledge are relevant as well in efforts to explain varia- tions in observed levels of institutional effectiveness.
nv42 | Linkage Variables
xags | Some students of international regimes have suggested that effec- tiveness depends on the difficulty or the "malignness" of the problem an institutional arrangement is intended to solve.23 This intuitively appealing idea rests on the assumption that we can rank problems from those that are easiest to solve or most benign to those that are most difficult to solve or most malign. So, for example, coordination problems, which require only some adjustment of behavior to avoid common aversions, seem easier to solve than cooperation problems, which require both active collaboration and some mechanism for en- suring compliance to produce some valued products.24 On reflection, however, it is by no means clear how far this line of reasoning can carry us in explaining or predicting levels of effectiveness. The idea of difficulty, in the hands of many, is a measure of the intensity of the conflicts of interest among those engaged in interactive decision mak- ing. To the extent that this is the case, the argument might better be left to interest-based thinking, which offers more sophisticated ana- lytic tools than the simple notion of difficulty. Approached from an- other angle, regimes involve efforts to solve problems that are hard to classify on a scale of difficulty, except in very gross terms. In all but the simplest of situations, in fact, the degree of difficulty of the prob- lem to be solved is likely to become a subject of lively debate rather than something to be treated as an objective condition. The current controversy over the extent to which the problem of climate change is

ko3c | Effectiveness
xek3 | more difficult to solve than the problem of ozone depletion illustrates this point aptly.25
bbpr | Another approach to this general topic, which captures some of what is at stake in the discussion of difficulty, focuses on the fit be- tween the character of an international regime and the problem it is intended to solve. Whereas some problems (for example, the conser- vation of polar bears) can be solved through the elaboration of coor- dination regimes featuring common rules coupled with decentralized administration, other problems (for example, the setting and alloca- tion of catch quotas for krill in the Southern Ocean or the allocation of broadcast frequencies in the electromagnetic spectrum) can be solved only through the establishment of some social choice mecha- nism capable of making collective decisions on a continuing or recur- rent basis. Regimes for high seas fisheries, in which it is relatively hard to monitor compliance with specific regulations, pose different re- quirements than regimes for nuclear safety, in which it is virtually impossible to hide serious accidents. Governance systems that work well when the members are modern states with strong central govern- ments frequently fail when the governments of the participating states have a more limited capacity to control what goes on within their own jurisdictions (for example, the activities of poachers en- gaged in practices banned under the terms of the CITES regime). Similarly, the need for built-in flexibility is greater with regard to problems in which scientific understanding is changing rapidly (for example, ozone depletion or climate change) than for problems whose levels of uncertainty are much lower (for example, regimes to allocate the flow of water in shared river basins).
5zyf | Overall, there is much to be said for the view that the ability to customize the provisions of a regime to fit the circumstances at hand constitutes an important determinant of institutional effectiveness. This is, of course, easier said than done. Not only is it difficult to foresee how complex institutional arrangements will work in practice, but also individual participants are subject to continual pressure both from incentives to capture short-term gains to the detriment of longer-term considerations relating to institutional effectiveness and from the maneuvers of those endeavoring to protect special interests in a way that detracts from regime performance. Then, too, there is the problem of making appropriate adjustments over time. Institu-
9own | INTERNATIONAL GOVERNANCE
bqfb | tions are like relationships among individuals; they require continu- ous monitoring and adjustments to remain viable. It is not sufficient simply to wind them up and set them in motion on the assumption that they will adjust to changing circumstances on their own in the absence of conscious interventions. It follows that any clear-cut con- clusions we are able to reach about linkages between endogenous factors in the sense of attributes or properties of the regimes them- selves and exogenous factors in the sense of features of the physical, biological, and social environment should prove directly relevant to the search for effectiveness in the establishment and management of a wide range of governance systems in international society.
wwdt | CONCLUSION
mn1r | Effectiveness, it is clear, is not a simple matter when we are assess- ing the consequences of international environmental governance sys- tems. Not only is it possible to conceptualize effectiveness in different ways, but it is also common to look to a variety of factors in efforts to explain the levels of effectiveness attained by specific regimes. What is more, much of the variance in our thinking about effectiveness is surely attributable to the disciplinary perspectives and larger world- views that we as analysts bring to the study of this subject. Thus it will come as no surprise that our understanding of the determinants of effectiveness in international governance systems is rudimentary at this stage. Nonetheless, the effort to improve knowledge of this com- plex subject must be placed at the top of the agenda for students of international governance. The study of governance systems in inter- national society cannot prosper in the absence of a better understand- ing of the determinants of effectiveness. Those responsible for de- signing governance systems to cope with growing threats to the earth's habitability demand knowledge that they can use to devise regimes that will prove effective. It is time, therefore, to get on with the task of studying effectiveness in a systematic and empirically grounded fashion.
