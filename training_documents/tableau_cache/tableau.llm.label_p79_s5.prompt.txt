You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

06yq | Microdosing with psychedelics to self-medicate for ADHD symptoms in adults: A naturalistic study

2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

rsvo | When we use a dimension, Tableau Public creates column or row headers for a chart (view). On the contrary, measures typically create an axis in the chart in case the measure is classified as continuous, as described in the next section of this chapter. Measures can be aggregated (mathematical calculations such as summation, averaging, counting, and so on) based on the selected aggregation function (SUM, AVG, COUNT, and so on) for each item in the dimension used in the chart.
z4m8 | Tableau Public automatically determines whether a data field is a dimension or a measure, but sometimes, the software makes mistakes. For instance, if your data source has numeric unique identifiers, such as account numbers, then they will be grouped as measures by default, unless the field name contains the ID string. In this case, you can change a data element to either a dimension or measure by dragging it to the correct pane in the Data window (to the Dimensions pane or the Measures pane). It is more likely that you will have to convert measures into dimensions (because all numeric values are not measures). To convert a measure into a dimension, you can either drag it to the Dimensions pane or right-click on the measure and select Convert to Dimension from the shortcut context menu. If this conversion is needed for only one chart, you can locally convert the measure on a shelf in the same manner (by selecting the Convert to Dimension command from the shortcut context menu).
ukf0 | Continuous and discrete dimensions and measures
k38m | As learned in the previous section, all data elements are classified in Tableau Public as either a dimension or a measure. These dimensions and measures are further classified into continuous or discrete elements.

cuth | The data elements in the Data window and on the shelves in Tableau Public are either light green or light blue in color. The green color indicates that a data element is set to continuous, and the blue data elements are set to discrete elements. A green or blue outline will also appear when selecting the corresponding continuous or discrete data elements. When you are building charts in Tableau Public and adding dimensions and measures to the Columns and Rows shelves, the continuous data items (usually measures) will create axes, and the discrete elements will create row or column headers.
09z2 | Discrete and continuous designations for data elements affect how graph elements are built and marks and axes are rendered. For example, a continuous date dimension used in a line chart will create a traditional, unbroken line chart. Using a discrete date dimension will create a line chart with segmented panes, that is, lines that are broken apart with each change in the date part. For instance, for a graph that shows years and months, the lines will break between each year. Using continuous measures on the Color shelf will result in a color gradient being used in the chart, with the hue or color in proportion corresponding to the value of the measure. If a discrete measurement is used on the Color shelf, the color will not be a gradient but separate colors (this is generally fine for dimensions on the Color shelf, but not for measures). Have a look at the following screenshot to see the difference between using a discrete color and a continuous color.
13fv | In this example, we're using a continuous measure to color each cell. Note that on the Marks card, AVG(Measure) is green. This means that it's continuous. Region, as compared to AVG(Measure), is blue because it's a discrete dimension (check out the next screenshot):

u9dn | We converted AVG(Measure), which is the average CO2 emissions per capita in 2010, into a discrete number by clicking on its context menu on the Marks card and then selecting Discrete, as shown in following screenshot. This version assigns a unique color to every numerical value:
t25w | Similarly, if a continuous measure is used on the Size shelf, the sizes of the graph marks such as circles, squares, or other shapes, will be in proportion to the value of the measure. Discrete measures used in the Size shelf can have a more pronounced size variation, but you can experiment with changing the continuous or discrete settings for measures and dimensions to better understand their effect on the chart. In my opinion, using discrete measures on the Size shelf can sometimes yield good results.
x62u | Measures and dimensions can be converted from continuous elements to discrete and vice versa. This allows you to experiment and customize the chart view. Quite often, you will convert continuous elements to discrete elements, as you will also often convert measures to dimensions. You can convert continuous elements to discrete ones by right-clicking on the date element and selecting the Convert to Discrete menu option. Also, when you move a data element from the Measures pane in the Data window to the Dimensions pane, it will typically convert the date element from continuous to discrete.

3aip | Just like changing data items from measures to dimensions only in one chart, you can also change from continuous to discrete for only the desired chart instead of making the change globally for all the charts and worksheets in the workbook.
q3gu | Selecting aggregation types for measures
txab | Measures can be aggregated. These numeric values can be added, counted, and averaged, and the median can be chosen. In addition, the aggregation types that are available in Tableau Public also include statistical functions such as maximum and minimum selection, variance, standard deviation, and percentile. The most common aggregation types used in journalism and blogging are sum (addition), average, and count. The count aggregation is useful when you have a data source with rows that have an ID field, such as the FIPS ID, which is a numerical identifier for a specific geographic area, such as a county. To get a count of records, use Count (ID), where the ID is the specific ID name in your data source. Extending this example, you can also use Count(Distinct) when you only want a count of every unique ID and don't want to count the repeating IDs.
dov0 | Selecting the aggregation type for measures can be done by right-clicking on a measure from the context menu, choosing the Measure command, and clicking on the desired aggregation type. You can also access aggregations from the drop-down menu by clicking on the tiny arrow on the right-hand side of the data element pill. The following is a screenshot of the full aggregation menu that is available from a measure pill's right-click on the shortcut context menu:

vyos | Swapping and sorting
w4hq | Columns and rows can be swapped (one for another) by using the Swap button in the menu bar. Items on shelves can also be moved manually among shelves and to and from the Data window. Dimensions and measures can be duplicated by pressing Ctrl key and dragging to a new or the same shelf. This is helpful when changing aggregations for a duplicate date element or part of the date (such as changing year to month).
ghbe | Similarly, you can sort fields in the following three ways:
1lkf | . Right-click on the field in the Data window, click on Default Properties, and select Sort, which sets the default sort order but does not allow you to sort by a measure
uobn | . Click on the context menu of a pill on your visualization and select Sort
3194 | . Click on the ascending or descending sort buttons in the toolbar, or hover over a header and click on the appropriate icon
r22o | For instance, in the following screenshot, the countries in each region are sorted in the descending order by the CO2 emissions per capita. If you click on the quick sort icon that we have highlighted, the countries in each region will be sorted again in an alphabetical order. Conversely, when you hover over the x axis and click on the sort button, they will be sorted in the ascending order by the measure being used:
nupw | Types of visualization
37xs | There are many different types of visualization that you can create in Tableau Public, and we will focus on several of the most effective ones in detail. There are some that you should not use without practice, careful construction, and deliberate labels, such as bubble graphs, tree maps, and word clouds. We will not cover those here, since they have very limited uses.

2tj1 | Line graphs
nbhq | Line graphs show data trends over time. Line charts, along with bar charts, are the most popular chart types used in data visualizations. For this type of time series chart, place a time or date dimension on the Columns shelf and a measure on the Rows shelf (the horizontal line chart is the most commonly used/ useful line chart).
w251 | Line charts can then be modified and made more complex by adding a dimension on the Color shelf, which adds one or more additional lines to the chart. You can add different measures to the Color shelf as well and measures or dimensions on the Size shelf. But usually, adding too much complexity to the graph detracts from the understanding of the data. The following steps will help you create a line graph:
1vgx | 1. Create a line graph that shows the average military expenditures as a percentage of the GDP between 2000 and 2010 by loading the World Bank Indicators data.
yjnk | 2. Then, drag Date to the Columns shelf from the Dimensions pane.
9zmh | 3. Drag Region from the Dimensions pane to the Color shelf.
mi3g | 4. Drag Military Expenditures (% GDP) from the Measures pane to the Rows shelf.
ntjg | 5. Click on the context menu on the pill for Military Expenditures (% GDP) and select average the measure, as shown in the following screenshot:

sptg | From this line graph, we learned that the Middle East has had the most fluctuation in its average military spending over the past 15 years.
2k40 | Continuous versus discrete date-time elements
krk7 | This section on line charts is a good place to discuss continuous versus discrete date-time elements. Line charts can be set up either with a continuous time series, or a discrete time series. Most line charts used for visualizations are continuous and unbroken, as the one in this section is. However, time can also be set as discrete, and this will break apart the time series into sections (also called panes or panels), such as by year, quarter, and month. Dashboards are sometimes developed with a discrete time series to allow for a fast comparison of quarters or months. A time-data element can be set as discrete or continuous by right-clicking on the date-time data element and setting it to continuous or discrete. Doing so will radically change the line chart by switching to either a continuous line or a broken line based on the parts of the date selected. Most journalists and bloggers who use Tableau Public will want to use the continuous feature of date-time data to create unbroken line graphs, but experiment with continuous and discrete to check whether it adds value for your readers.
4tyc | Tables
2mjl | Tables are usually created to show a fine level of detail for your data. In most business organizations, people have traditionally consumed analytics created in tabular reports, which can be highly inefficient. Tables display counts or measures relative to categorical variables, such as department spending, the number of college graduates in a city, pollution levels in a stream, and so on. They are useful when you wish to look up individual data point values and compare them across one or more levels of dimensional detail. Tables are the most effective when they are used at a high level and they contain data summaries rather than very long and detailed tables. You should also add filters to table charts to narrow down the data displayed to give readers a focus point. Tables are often called crosstabs. Pivot tables are a specific type of table; they are not discussed here.
6d9q | There are three table views in Tableau -text tables (sometimes called crosstabs), highlight tables, and heat maps. Any of these three chart types can be selected and modified easily from one chart to another, or added to and varied as needed. The text table is a good place to start experimenting when building a table.

kd78 | The tables on the US government's spending were obtained from Tableau Software. Download the Tableau Public workbook from Tableau by visiting http://tinyurl.com/1962-2012spending and download the source data from Tableau Software by visiting http: //tinyurl. com/spending-source-data.
896u | Text tables are common tables, as seen in excel, for instance. This type of chart is available for creation from the top row of the Show Me tool. The following screenshot is an example of a text table. This is a simple table that shows the US government's spending as a percentage of the total spending per Department, for the US President's administration. For the table, we set the SUM(Percent of Total Spending) to the Text shelf, and this exposes the numeric values in the table rows and columns.
o0si | Note that the details of the spending (the numeric values) are easily seen, and there is no highlighting or context around the values (in terms of telling the reader whether the numbers are high or low). No shape or color marks are used. Also note that we set up various filters on the Filter shelf for this table view, including filters for only the top spending departments, and also limited to the last three presidential administrations (Clinton, Bush, and Obama). Because the data is only current through 2012 (and Obama started his first presidential term in 2009), we also set up a filter for Administration Year and filtered to show only years 1 to 4 corresponding to each president's 4-year term of office. This lets us compare equal numbers of years for each president:

8gxa | The heat maps are tables that are used to communicate visual cues such as shape and area by referring to up to two quantity measures. The larger the shape (and usually, the deeper the color), the higher the measure value. This type of chart is available for creation from the top row of the Show Me tool. The following graphic is an example of a heat map, with the SUM(Spending) on the Color shelf (in this case, the darker the red color gradient, the more dollars were spent) and the SUM(% of Total Spending) is tied to the Size shelf (this controls the size of the square). In this case, the larger the square, the more the percentage of the total spending for each government department during successive US presidential administrations. The actual values of spending are obscured here so that the reader is not able to quickly compare the actual values.
fsvi | The colors used can be easily customized for each graph by double-clicking on the gradient color bar titled SUM(Spending). The shape can be customized by selecting another shape in the dropdown list under the Marks title section. Filters that were similar to the Text table were set up. But this time, no filtering for presidents was created. All the presidents listed in the source data set are represented, from Kennedy to Obama, as shown in the following screenshot:

7jzh | Highlight tables are often thought of as heat maps to the industry, as they use color gradient depth, saturation, or hue to highlight a quantity measure (such as highs and lows). The difference between a highlight table and a heat map is the lack of shape and size marks and the ability to see the underlying details in the highlight table. The following screenshot is an example of a highlight table. Note that the darker the color hue, the greater the percentage of spending to the total. The SUM(% of Total Spending) is duplicated in the Marks card for both the Color shelf and the Text shelf. This allows the color hue to be affected in proportion to the numeric value and also lets the value itself be shown in the rows and columns.
vm00 | The colors used, and the other borders and elements, are completely customizable in the tables described in this section. The colors of this chart can be easily customized for each graph by double-clicking on the gradient color bar titled (in this case) SUM(% of Total Spending). The filters that have been created are identical to the first table named the Text table in this chapter section:
