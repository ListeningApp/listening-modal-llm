You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021.

oxou | tably, the curve of rCV2 vs. promoter width for the positive- feedback genes was always above that for the genes with negative feedback or non-feedback (Figure 5B).
495n | Next, we investigated whether different TSS distributions affected burst frequencies and burst sizes differently. Al- though genes with 'sharp' promoters led to a higher ex- pression variability than those with 'broad' promoters for arbitrary feedback forms, burst frequencies and sizes reg- ulated by TSS distributions can exhibit significant discrep- ancy only in the absence of feedback (Figure 5C, Supple- mentary Figure S11e, f). Broad promoters led to higher burst frequencies and smaller burst sizes than sharp pro- moters (Figure 5C, red box), in agreement with the exper- imental observation that broad promoters tended to oc- cur in the case of low RNA polymerase II pause, whereas sharp promoters tended to occur in the case of high RNA polymerase II pause (84-86). These results implied that on the genome-wide scale, feedback regulations significantly weakened the impacts of TSS distributions on transcrip- tional burst kinetics.
awri | E-P interactions mainly modulate burst frequencies only in the presence of positive feedbacks
bl28 | Enhancers, DNA sequences located upstream of the pro- moter, are important regulators of eukaryotic development (87). Several lines of experimental evidence supported that E-P interactions (Figure 6A) may facilitate gene transcrip- tion (88-91) and can regulate transcriptional burst kinet-
d5bz | ics (14,16,92-95). In addition, some studies showed that enhancer and promoter activations might require positive and negative feedback regulations, each contributing the el- ements of the protein complement required for activation of other genes (96). These results raise important questions: does the genome-wide control of burst kinetics by E-P in- teractions involves feedback regulations? If so, how do feed- backs affect burst kinetics?
ap5o | To address these questions, we first recovered the inten- sities of E-P interactions from (16) and performed LOESS regression. With the involvement of feedback regulations, the modulation of variability and transcriptional burst ki- netics by E-P interactions also presents Simpson's para- dox. We then showed that, for all genes, increasing the E- P intensities led to the rise of mean gene-expression levels (Supplementary Figure S12d) but to the decline of vari- ability (rCV2) (Supplementary Figure S12e), indicating that stronger enhancers raised the expressions levels but lowered cell-to-cell variability in contrast to weaker enhancers (97). However, when distinguishing genes by feedback types, this pattern only appears in the case of positive feedback (Fig- ure 6B, Supplementary Figure S12a), implying the impor- tant role of positive feedback in E-P interactions.
7zvf | Next, we focused on burst frequencies and sizes. Previous molecular experiments and genome-wide inferences from scRNA-seq data showed that burst frequencies and sizes in- creased with promoting E-P interactions (93,94), and that enhancers mainly controlled burst frequencies (14,16,92- 95,98-100). The same conclusion was obtained when we
mov9 | performed analysis without distinguishing feedback types (Supplementary Figure S12f, g). Notably, when the feed- back types was considered, we found that as the E-P inten- sity increased, changes in burst frequencies and sizes were most apparent in the case of positive feedback (Supplemen- tary Figure S12b,c). Moreover, the slope of the line for the dependence of burst frequencies on E-P intensity was larger than that for the dependence of burst sizes on E-P inten- sity (Figure 6C). In addition, we observed that this regula- tion effect of enhancers was saturated when the E-P inter- action intensity exceeded a threshold (~40) (Figure 6B and Supplementary Figure S12a-c). This result indicated that the function of the enhancer was not unlimited, in agree- ment with the theoretical prediction in our previous study (https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.01.24.477520).
ks7m | The above genome-wide results provided direct support for the fact that the control of burst kinetics by E-P inter- actions was constrained by positive feedback regulations, in accordance with previous experimental results for a small number of genes (30,101).
w1w1 | DISCUSSION
h8gv | As the core process of life, gene transcription occurs stochastically, leading to variability in the mRNA and further protein abundances. This variability is believed to be mainly attributed to transcriptional bursting, a phe- nomenon that occurs commonly in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. From the viewpoint of biophysics, the sources of transcriptional bursting are multilevel and multiscale (1). In this study, we have developed a statistical framework of the model-driven and data-driven integration to infer dynamic feedback regulations and transcriptional bursting kinetics from static scRNA-seq data, using a mechanistic mathematical model as the connecting thread.
kwkp | The mechanistic model used in our inference framework was interpretable. It captured the scRNA-seq measurement process and the molecular mechanisms of transcriptional bursting processes. We showed that not only burst frequen- cies and sizes as well as expression variability but also feed- back forms can be effectively and robustly inferred to ex- plain biophysical phenomena, which were masked in the
yj0m | scRNA-seq data. Meanwhile, our inference method made the interpretable model tractable. We utilized the Gauss- Laguerre Quadrature Rules instead of the classical MCMC method to compute mRNA distribution with a high-order integral that is difficult to solve, thus making our scalable in- ference applicable on genome-wide scales. Our statistical in- ference framework laid a solid foundation for exploring the molecular mechanisms of stochastic gene expression based on single-cell data.
ewfp | Our inference method provided a powerful tool for ana- lyzing the joint effects of feedback regulation and promoter architecture and for revealing the genome-wide mechanisms of transcriptional burst kinetics. First, we found that at the same gene-expression levels, positive-feedback genes ex- hibited significantly higher gene-expression variability and higher burst frequencies as well as smaller burst sizes than negative-feedback genes on genome-wide scales. This find- ing indicated that different regulatory networks played dis- tinct roles in modulating transcriptional burst kinetics (10). Second, we revealed that the TATA box, apart from be- ing indicatives of enlarging the expression variability and raising burst sizes as suggested in previous studies (13,16), can utilize a positive feedback mechanism to increase burst frequencies. This result may explain the phenomenon that the RNA polymerase II on the TATA box gene had bet- ter localization and fewer transcriptional pauses (75,76). Third, broad promoters with multiple TSSs led to higher burst frequencies and smaller burst sizes, which were con- cealed by the feedback regulations. Finally, we showed that enhancer-promoter interactions modulated burst kinetics and primarily controlled burst frequency in the presence of positive feedback. All these results were obtained un- der the hidden hypothesis that the intrinsic behaviors of the different gene were statistically identical. Overall, these genome-wide evidences indicated that transcriptional burst kinetics was not only encoded by static promoter archi- tectures but also constrained by dynamic gene regulatory networks.
