You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

3pn1 | In the extract below, Don and Hal build two rather robust concessions to manage
wjuz | propositions that display interest or importance in looks. They then partially weaken the force of such concessions through strategically designed reassertions.

yogo | Below is an abridged version of the way their propositions, concessions, and reassertions are sequentially arranged:
2285 | (1) Initial proposition - (Only when you don't know them, looks do everything for you - line 5)
ys0g | (2) Concession 1 - (But as you grow older, you count on looks less and less - lines 8-11)
7zvp | (3) Revised, weaker statement - (Although looks are still necessary - line 12)
ww6u | (4) Concession 2 - (But you can't always have the prettiest girl - line 15)
hpi6 | (5) Revised, weaker statement - (But I once did have the prettiest girl, remember Kayla - line 16)
4uhb | The moderator opens with a three-part list on the topic of looks (line 1) - looks as 'important', 'not that important really', and the 'or' seems to indicate a forthcoming third option or invitation to respond to the first two. Don cuts in and seems to orient to the 'not that important' option (line 2). The moderator quickly cuts back in line 3 and softly amends it to 'although good looking is not bad'. By doing this, he is able to offer a third option that maintains the importance of looks before Don can fully construct a position to the contrary. Don agrees with this more softened option, and goes on to draw up the initial proposition that when you do not know the person, 'looks do everything for you' (line 5). Hal's first concession comes several lines later (lines 8-11), and it positions Hal in at least three ways. It softens the extremity of 'looks do everything' in Don's original proposition, it insulates guys' interests in girls' looks from appearing unaffected by maturation, and it makes Hal appear sexually mature, experienced, and reasonable. Despite his concession, however, Hal shifts back in line 12 to the tenor of the original proposition in saying 'but it still has to be there (.) you

y51p | know (.) you can't be like the ugliest girl'. This weaker statement is designed to counter the concession itself, as if to make sure Hal doesn't now appear too mature, and thus totally uninterested in girls' looks. But then, both he and Don (lines 14-15) soften again this already weaker statement by admitting that having the prettiest girl is not always possible, nor do they necessarily want it. Again, this concession is designed to fend off potential counter-arguments, and offers a more mature position that appears rational, in the sense of 'knowing' that always having the prettiest girl is not realistic. As Couper- Kuhlen and Thompson (in press) argue, concessions often explicitly display the rationality behind repairs and reformulations of prior assertions, thus accomplishing accountability. Thus, 'doing maturity' emerges as the discursive effect of concessive repair practices.
x95m | However, in line 16, Hal's aside to Don ('I did though (.) remember Kayla"') and Andy and Don's celebration of it in lines 17-18 works yet again as a reassertion that undermines the maturity heard in the second concession. But because it is delivered as an afterthought (with Hal turning to Don and Andy and saying it with a downshift in voice), it carries a kind of off-the-record quality, marking its status as a direct or serious reassertion of the original proposition as ambiguous. The ambiguousness is essential for bringing off the hearable immaturity of reassertion without trouble. The laughter constructs the reassertion as both ironic, and thus less serious, but yet still invested to some degree in bragging about it. In other words, while the concession allows Hal and Don to counter the threat of appearing immature and overly preoccupied or naïve about looks, the design of the reassertion allows them to buy back into a kind of sexual interest that celebrates Hal's status as a (hetero)sexual man ('luckiest man in the world') for having had a really pretty girl. By strategically employing concessive repairs, the boys are able to position themselves as mature while simultaneously attending to their interest in heterosexual attraction.
yfum | The next excerpt from a different group discussion involves a precarious negotiation of young males' interest in a particular girl whom they know from school and who they have characterized (earlier in the discussion) as someone who sleeps around a lot. In what follows, the moderator inquires about their potential interest in such a girl. Managing an interest is done in a delicate tongue-in-cheek way that protects them from appearing immature or desperate.
