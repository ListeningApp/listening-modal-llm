In nonmonogamy, this term is more specifically used to refer to the positive feelings experienced when your lover is having a positive experience with one of their other lovers.\nbjmu | CONSENSUAL NONMONOGAMY (CNM)\nw8jo | The practice of having multiple sexual and/or romantic partners at the same time, where all people involved are aware of this relationship arrangement and consent to it. CNM can include, but is not limited to, polyamory, swinging, open marriage, open relationship, solo polyamory, and relationship anarchy.\nn4g6 | METAMOUR\nxrzh | Two people who share a partner, but are not romantically or sexually involved with each other. For example, if you have a partner who also has a spouse, you and their spouse would be metamours, or if you have a boyfriend and a girlfriend who are not involved with each other, the two of them would be metamours to each other.\nb5m5 | MONOGAMY\nwu5k | The practice of having one sexual or romantic partner at a time.\nn462 | MONONORMATIVITY\n7tg4 | This term was coined by Pieper and Bauer to refer to the societal dominant assumptions regarding the naturalness and normalcy of monogamy, where political, popular, and psychological narratives typically present monogamy as the superior, most natural, or morally correct way to do relationships.\n5kya | POLYSATURATED\n7muy | The point at which the thought of another relationship leaves one feeling more exhausted than excited. When a polyamorous person has as many significant and\n3zl7 | insignificant others as they think they can handle at a given time.\ni0sj | INTRODUCTION\nslsh | I'M WRITING THIS BOOK because I believe in love. Again and again, I have experienced the power of love to heal, to bridge, to connect, and to awaken, as well as the trauma that ensues in its absence. In many ways, my life is centered in not just believing in love, but in being love. That is, emanating love as best as I can, moment by moment, interaction by interaction. I am confident that many of you reading this also believe in love and that it is the desire to strengthen and deepen your love relationships that has led you to pick up this book.\nji5o | My journey to writing this book officially began within the last year, but it really began forty years ago, with my first attachment experiences as an infant and the multiple attachment ruptures that followed. A third-generation New Yorker, I grew up in the housing projects of Brooklyn in a neighborhood well-acquainted with violence and a family considerably impacted by multiple divorces, multi-generational traumas, sexual abuse, substance abuse, mental illness, and interpersonal discord. These experiences had an impact that was challenging for many years, affecting all areas of my life, but they also created a powerful determination in me to not only thrive and be resilient in the face of my early childhood hardships but to also contribute to the healing and transformation of others who have been impacted by neglect, abuse, trauma, and poverty. In wanting to understand how to heal the mind, body and heart, I began to study everything I could, from the spiritual to the academic. I devoted my life to the investigation of how we change, evolve, and develop, how we can communicate healthily and effectively, how we can heal and become safely embodied in the wake of trauma, how we can unshackle our hearts from our survival-based reactivity and defenses, and how we can liberate our minds from bigotry, ignorance, and internalized oppression.\n4nlx | As you can probably imagine, this led me to have a diverse professional life that crossed over several seemingly disparate intersections-I was both a socially engaged Buddhist and a somatic bodyworker, a genocide researcher, and a therapist. About a decade into my healing practice with individuals, I began to expand my\no3xz | psychotherapy practice to include couples work. In the earlier stages of building up my client base of couples, there was one particular week in which three different couples' sessions included one of the partners bringing up their desire to explore polyamory for the first time. Needless to say, this caught my attention. I knew about polyamory from a personal perspective, but professionally I was at a loss. Nonmonogamy was barely mentioned in any of my training and when it was mentioned, it was usually dismissed or disparaged. One of the couples I was working with mentioned that they were reading the book Sex at Dawn: The Prehistoric Origins of Modern Sexuality, in which authors Christopher Ryan and Cacilda Jetha discuss the evolution of monogamy as being relatively recent in human history. So, like any decent (and underinformed) therapist I quickly bought the book to better support them in our work together. To my surprise, reading Sex at Dawn turned out to be a personal awakening. Within the pages of the book, I found descriptions of myself I didn't know existed and desires that had lain dormant for years. As a bisexual woman, I was often confused about how to reconcile my sexuality within a monogamous relationship with either a man or a woman. Even though I already knew a decent amount about polyamory, it was mainly from a second- or third-person perspective where polyamory was something you or they did. It wasn't until reading Sex at Dawn that I finally identified with polyamory from a first-person perspective, realizing that not only had I already practiced forms of nonmonogamy for years in my late adolescence and early twenties, but that it was also what I felt to be the fullest expression of my love and sexuality now.\n84mq | This all happened while I was in a monogamous marriage, so immediately throwing off the relational restraints of monogamy to more fully express my capacity and desire to love more than one person was not something that I could just do the very next day. But the personal realizations that came from reading the book impacted not only myself, but also my marriage and my family. Thankfully, after many long walks and talks with my then-husband, he was willing to take on the transition from monogamy to polyamory with me. However, no matter how willing and eager we were to take on the transition, we were both mostly unaware of the\n56tt | irreversible changes that lay ahead. We experienced changes to each of us individually, changes to our marriage, immense growth in each of our capacity to experience more love, honesty, closeness, and pleasure, as well as all the changes that resulted from significant losses, heartbreaks, and attachment alterations within our own relationship and with family, friends, and other partners. At that time there was nothing in the non-monogamy self-help genre that could fully prepare us for everything our attachment systems were going through, and like many polyamorous couples we had to forge our own path forward, repeatedly stumbling along the way and learning retrospectively at the expense of ourselves, each other, and our other partners.\nchel | Nothing about my personal journey, professional experiences or transition from monogamy to polyamory has been linear. Unexpectedly, my therapy clients served as my personal catalyst to claiming my own polyamory, which then led me to specialize in working with people practicing nonmonogamy as my primary professional focus. Today, approximately seventy-five percent of my clients are nonmonogamous, and when I'm not working with clients in person or long distance, I spend my professional time speaking and leading workshops on nonmonogamous relationships, trauma, attachment, and transformation.\nasam | Why a Book on Nonmonogamy and Attachment?\n```",
