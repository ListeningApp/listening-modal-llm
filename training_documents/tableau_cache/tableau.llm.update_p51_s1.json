The tabs with a series of rows and a column on them are sheet tabs, where you can design objects that fit on one sheet. The tabs with a rectangle divided into four quadrants are dashboard tabs, where you can add one or more sheets in order to form a unified dashboard. When you click on one of the new (blank) worksheet or dashboard tabs, that tab opens and names the sheet or dashboard the next sequential name, such as Sheet three or Dashboard two. The sheet or dashboard is blank when you first open a new tab.\ngcbc | Chapter two\nd9tz | A dashboard is really just a group of worksheets on the same page. You can assemble a dashboard after creating the various component worksheets that it will contain. Dashboards are assembled and configured by using the Dashboard tabs in Tableau Public, which are available in the lower row of the tabs in the Tableau Public interface.\ndusw | The lower-right hand side of the Tableau Public interface also contains three workspace control tabs, as shown in the following screenshot:\npk82 | Let's take a look at each of these tabs:\nblll | Show Sheet Sorter: This shows the sheets in your workbook and allows you to reorder them easily\nocgf | Show Filmstrip: This shows the visualization with the thumbnails of other worksheets, which is shown in the previous screenshot\ntybl | Show Tabs: This shows the default view of the visualization and the named tabs of other worksheets, as shown in the previous screenshot\n80zt | The Show Me tool\naxet | A very useful tool in Tableau Public is the Show Me tool, which is available as a floating window when you click on the Show Me button on the upper-right hand side of the Tableau Public interface.\ndrxk | Tableau Public Interface Features\n08na | This tool, as shown in the following screenshot, is a helpful aid when you wish to select various chart types that can be used with your data:\nvijt | The Show Me tool is an optional tool. Charts can be created without any help from this tool.\nj5ke | The Show Me tool also contains a list of tips to add data to shelves and cards, such as the number of dimensions and measures necessary to create the desired chart type.\nxe0y | The Show Me tool also suggests graph types based on the view that the user has created and/ or the fields that the user has selected from the Data window. Based on the selections and the chart type selected in Show Me, the tool also instructs the user what field types are needed to create a certain graph type.\ngjl6 | For example, selecting a continuous date field will make the Show Me tool prompt the suggestion of a line graph. Selecting a geocoded or latitude/longitude field will make it prompt the selection of a geographic map.\n81i9 | Chapter two\nkgrb | In Chapter four, Visualization - Tips and Types, we will discuss the Show Me tool in detail and have an overview of the chart types that are available in Tableau Public. Many of these chart types are covered by the Show Me tool suggestions.\n6g0d | The Show Me tool dialog does not auto-hide once the user makes a selection from it. Click on the Show Me button again to hide the Show Me tool dialog.\nk9u1 | Summary\nldrv | In this chapter, we learned the Tableau Public user interface, from the welcome screen to the worksheet and dashboard tab views. We discussed the concepts of shelves and cards, walked through an example of how the Marks card affects a data visualization, and had a look at how to create a dashboard from the various worksheets created in a Tableau Public workbook. Lastly, we discussed the Show Me tool and how it can aid you in choosing appropriate data visualization types for your data.\nli40 | In the next chapter, we will discuss the various chart types that you can create in Tableau Public and what some of the best practices and uses are for the chart types.\nirr1 | Connecting to Data\nsvwi | Visualizations depend on the data in them, and however aesthetically pleasing your visualization might be, it may be misleading or even wrong, unless the data has been formatted, aggregated, and properly represented.\ncym3 | This chapter discusses the major elements of finding, cleansing, understanding, formatting, and aggregating data that you will need to understand in order to produce accurate visualizations that tell compelling stories, including the following elements:\n7y4b | Where you can get publicly available data and how to use it\n421l | What tables and databases are\nart6 | The data formats that Tableau Public connects to\npsk5 | Databases, tables, dimensions, facts, and field formats and conventions\natv6 | Preparing data to load it into Tableau\n9ja4 | Connecting to the data from Tableau Public\nbl6w | Using the data interpreter\nrxoj | Pivoting fields\nb2rk | Public data\npros | The data sets that are publicly available or the ones that you have compiled on your own, are ideal for Tableau Public. Since all users will be able to download this data and create their own visualizations once you have published your workbook, your data set should not contain information that may be considered sensitive, which can be anything that can be used to identify a private individual or reveal confidential corporate information or intellectual property.\ntlrm | Connecting to Data\n6gxm | Public data is readily available online. Tableau Public maintains a catalog of publicly available data. Much of this data is produced by various governments, economic groups, and sports fans, along with a link to, and a rating for each source. This catalog is updated monthly, and it is a great introduction to using publicly available data. You can find it at public dot tableau dot com slash s slash resources.\n7eaf | The Google Public Data Explorer has a large collection of public data, including economic forecasts and global public health data. This tool is unique because it allows users to make simple visualizations from all the original data sources without having to investigate the source data, though most of it is available by linking available resources.\nt890 | There are several tools available for the scraping of data from public sites too, such as ScraperWiki, import dot i o, and I F T T T, among others. These industries and such tools pertaining to the industry evolve rapidly. Therefore, we will not discuss any specific tool. Social media applications, such as Twitter, have made it possible for individuals and companies to build application programming interfaces, APIs, to connect to their data streams. This is useful for nonprogrammers because it's often free of cost if you wish to scrape data about specific topics, hashtags, or users with a minimal amount of coding.\nnwqa | Not all data is public data, and it's very important to determine whether a data set is public before using it. None of us wants to end up being sued, with a ruined reputation, or as a victim. If your source data set has identifying characteristics, first and last name, address, and financial, geolocation, medical, or federally or state protected data, it should be removed or de-identified and then saved separately before saving the visualization to Tableau Public (or not used at all). Each state has guidelines on what is considered protected information, and it's a good idea to check the restrictions in case there's even the slightest chance that your data set has sensitive information in it.\nsewa | Additionally, data from a corporation should never be used unless the corporation has given the permission to use it. Did we mention lawsuits? Being fired also isn't any fun.\n0tlp | Tables and databases\nbz3j | Once you have found the data set that's ideal for your visualization, it's helpful to know how data stores are structured and what the different terms are.\n14mv | Data is stored in tables. A table is an array of items, and it can be as simple as a single word, letter, or number, or as complicated as millions (or more) of rows of transactions with timestamps, qualitative attributes (such as size or color), and numeric facts, such as the quantity of the purchased goods.\n75iu | Chapter three\n```",
