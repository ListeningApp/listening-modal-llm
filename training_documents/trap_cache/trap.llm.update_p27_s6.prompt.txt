You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).

y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021.

ezla | Some of these special circumstances may also help to explain China's rapid growth into-and possible early shift out of-middle income. True, inequality increased dramatically (.47 Gini coefficient), raising debates about possible "Latin Americanization." Yet on other dimen- sions, China shows that it is already advancing out of MI status with lower informality (a shadow economy of 12 percent), extremely high investment (49 percent), low FDI (10 percent), high R and D spending
rsbu | (2 percent, not far below the OECD average), and educational institu- tions producing large numbers of engineers and technicians, includ- ing 21 percent of secondary students enrolled in technical education.104 This potential for moving quickly through MI status reflects China's resemblance to earlier Asian developmental states by virtue of a clear connection for political elites between development and the capacity to address geopolitical challenges,105 a connection missing in other MI countries, and by virtue of the stability of its authoritarian regime.
magd | In sum, these comparisons across a wide range of periods and con- texts help illuminate cases where politics were more conducive to build- ing and sustaining upgrading coalitions due to factors ranging from elite cohesion around things like EU accession, to more bottom-up pressures (as in Malay party dominance), to state-assisted upgrading in some successful sectors. These positive cases raise hopes that it is not impossible to escape the MI trap, but at the same time they highlight a range of rare facilitating factors that are as yet not common in most MI countries.
tb74 | VI. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS
8l69 | Many contemporary MI countries find themselves on a path-dependent trajectory where the very factors that contributed to and/or accompa- nied their movement into middle-income status (such as informality, high FDI stocks, inequality, and low levels of human capital) both rein- force each other and constitute obstacles to progressing out of MI.106 By fragmenting business and labor, they undercut the potential demand for upgrading institutions. These conditions contrast with earlier HI gradu- ates that, when transitioning to HI, did not face the combined, divisive cleavages of high and persistent inequality, informality, and reliance on FDI.
1jyv | This article focuses on the primary domestic cleavages among social groups that impede the coalition building required for institutional up- grading. A fuller analysis of the MI trap would also need to incorporate further analysis of state capacity (and related pathologies of corruption and clientelism). For example, taxation is one core area of state capacity where MI states lag in terms of their ability to collect revenue, overall and especially in income taxes-a weakness commonly associated with large informal sectors.107 Institution building of the sort analyzed here
olce | is costly and is likely to rely heavily on public funding, so tax capac- ity becomes a critical component. Coalition building is decisive in our view, and bureaucratic resistance and fragmentation can pose additional obstacles to effective policy and institution building. It is important, for example, to understand why education bureaucracies are often large, politicized sources of rents at the primary and secondary levels and fragmented at the tertiary level, while state-sponsored postsecondary vocational and technical education is fragmented and weakly related to business needs.
erx1 | Our analysis of FDI and the shifting development requirements of the twenty-first century indirectly incorporates some international factors. A fuller analysis would also need to examine in greater depth a range of issues, from microlevel dynamics in GPNs to shifting international trade regimes (for example, the limits WTO membership places on industrial policy), to the overall opportunities for expanding high value-added exports. However, the international factors that were crucial in earlier industrializers-especially geostrategic threats and economic integra- tion-are less relevant for large MI countries. The Cold War is over and the countries of Latin America and Southeast Asia, as well as South Africa and Turkey, face no imminent existential threat. Nor are recent trends in economic integration likely to help forge domestic upgrading coalitions. If EU accession returns to the agenda in Turkey, it could have this enabling effect. By contrast, Mexican integration through NAFTA did bring elites together, but it was around a common set of neo- liberal policies rather than around institution building for upgrading.108 In Asia, regional integration through ASEAN was more politically driven, with little engagement by business, especially domestic business. 109
b3bt | Understanding this path-dependent dynamic is all the more impor- tant in light of some important shifts in the global economy that did not confront earlier successful industrializers. Following Alexander Ger- schenkron, the advance of technology and the prior industrialization of other countries change the challenges and opportunities for the next graduates to HI. So, while twentieth-century industrializers could rely on relatively autarchic growth, Fordist mass production, and integrated industrial sectors, today's would-be graduates to HI face a much more open global economy characterized by rapid product cycles, intensely competitive markets, GPNs, and dominant service sectors.110 Therefore, the specific economic trajectories to HI will be different in the twenty-
0w8m | first century, but they will still require strong institutions and enduring support coalitions to create and sustain them.
vcu3 | Our analysis of the MI stall has several practical and theoretical impli- cations. First, on the practical side, it is necessary to recognize that the policy recommendations typically proposed are difficult to implement and require institutions with significant capacity to mobilize resources and coordinate diverse interests. This phase of institutional develop- ment is not just about getting the rules right and providing broad in- centives to attract capital and labor into new sectors; more important, it is also about building effective organizations like schools and research centers, as well as various forums where different economic agents can cultivate long-term collaborations. The neoliberal Washington consen- sus of the 1990s revolved primarily around a set of policies. The new, more pragmatic consensus of the 2000s emphasizes, by contrast, insti- tutions in industrial policy, human capital, and governance generally. This represents progress, but the next step is to reach a better under- standing of what it takes to build institutions.
hjzj | Thus, a further implication of our analysis bears on institutional ori- gins. Economists are correct that building such institutions is best un- derstood as a contractarian process allowing interdependent actors to reap gains from trade. But on its own, this formulation is incomplete, as it fails to acknowledge that strong institutions typically emerge through the incremental interactions of a small number of large, mutually vul- nerable actors.111 These are precisely the conditions undermined by the structural factors or societal disarticulation so common in today's MI countries. Indeed, although accounts of coalitional bases of prior move- ment into high income do acknowledge differences within and among business and labor, the kinds of foreign-local and formal-informal splits within business and labor respectively are striking in their absence from these accounts.
j79f | At a broader theoretical level, our analysis adopts a more structural perspective-one that is focused on the long-term evolution of social and economic groups-than the widespread institutional consensus in development studies. Much recent debate has revolved around which insti- tutions are the most important, often pitting liberal arguments (property rights and the rule of law) against statist alternatives (in- dustrial policy and effective bureaucracies). But much of this debate is premature and misplaced. We must first achieve a better understanding of the coalitional foundations needed to create and sustain these insti-
6tbv | tutions, as well as of the structural factors that shape the potential for coalition building.
