8r5j | ABSTRACT
2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

jie2 | 6.4. Use of EBFs or links in Reinforced Concrete Structures
d0ik | Providing a thorough review of this topic is out of the scope of this study; however, the main applications of EBF configurations in reinforced concrete (RC) structures are mentioned here for the sake of completeness. Steel eccentric braces with or without vertical links can be connected to existing RC frames for seismic rehabilitation. This concept was numerically and experimentally studied by Bouadi and Engelhardt [219], Ghobarah and Abou Elfath [220], Bouwkamp et al. [221], Perera et al. [222], D'Aniello [223], Mazzolani et al. [224], Pina et al. [225], Durucan and Dicleli [226], Özel and Güneyisi [227], Varum et al. [228], and Wang and Yu [229] in the past few decades. Steel links are also utilized as energy dissipating coupling beams between adjacent RC wall piers in hybrid coupled wall (HCW) systems. A comprehensive review of the research on the behavior, analysis, and design of these systems as well as particular topics such as link-to-wall connections can be found in El-Tawil et al. [230].
0x0s | 6.5. Progressive Collapse of EBFs
4exe | In 2009, the gravity-induced progressive collapse of EBFs was studied by Khandelwal et al. [108] utilizing validated numerical analyses. To this end, the alternate path method (APM) was used, i.e. critical columns and adjacent braces were instantaneously removed from a ten-story EBF, properly designed based on the U.S. specifications [69, 231] for high seismic risk. The limited numerical results demonstrated that EBFs are less vulnerable to progressive collapse compared to special CBFs, mainly because of their improved system layout. The beneficial effect of locating EBFs at the perimeter of the structure was also noted.
0myz | 6.6. Fragility Functions for Links
xh3i | The damage states and fragility functions for EBF links were developed recently by Gulec et al. [232]. Based on a precise evaluation of the test data of 82 links (reported previously in the literature) a
syiw | total of 9 damage states, such as web yielding, flange local buckling, flange fracture, damage to concrete slab, etc., were indicated. Furthermore, the methods of repair (MoR) were categorized into 4 groups (i.e. cosmetic repair, concrete replacement, heat straightening, and link replacement) and each damage state was related to a certain MoR. Fragility functions were also developed for short and long links based on statistical analyses to specify the probability that a specific MoR will be required as a function of Yp.
kg3t | 6.7. Other Applications
lvae | In a number of studies by Bruneau and his colleagues [233-237], the concept of EBFs with horizontal or vertical links has been used in steel bridge superstructures in order to introduce energy dissipation in end-diaphragms instead of the common approach which relies on the energy dissipation of the substructure. This can be fruitful for instance in cases where stable and ductile behavior of the substructure is doubtful. Results of the extensive numerical and experimental studies as well as design procedures are presented by these researchers.
o9sc | The applicability of stainless steel in EBFs was studied by DiSarno et al. [238] in 2008. The results of nonlinear pushover and time-history analyses of a sample structure revealed that using members made from stainless steel can enhance the energy dissipation and structural overstrength of the system compared to regular EBFs while reducing the roof drift and the probability of local buckling in members.
121u | In addition to EBFs, HCWs, and bridges, the concept of dissipative link segments has also been utilized in other structural systems. For instance, Moghaddasi B. and Zhang [118] studied the seismic behavior of diagrid structural frames with replaceable shear links, in 2013. In another recent study, the concept of linked column frames (LCF) was proposed and numerically studied by Malakoutian et al. [116]. The use of buckling-restrained braces (BRB) in eccentric configuration was studied by Prinz and Richards [239, 240]. The energy dissipation mechanism in this system is however substantially different from that of EBFs since yielding is concentrated in the braces rather than in the links.
zh03 | 7. Summary and Future Research Needs
1mvw | A comprehensive review of the research conducted on the behavior and design of eccentrically braced frames has been presented in this study which has covered both component level and system level responses. Experimental and numerical studies that address the main characteristics of links as well as link detailing have been presented. Different numerical techniques for link modeling have also been discussed. Furthermore, studies which focused on the seismic behavior and design of EBF systems have been summarized with an emphasis on the capacity design approach. Finally, the special applications of EBF systems or link segments have been discussed. For the improvement of EBF design and applications, the following items have been identified in the course of this review study as important research needs:
6d4s | · Further research on the behavior of very short links (p < 1) is required in order to take advantage of their excessive inelastic rotation capacity in EBF systems. In contrast, considering the doubtful performance of very long links (p > 3~3.5) reported in some numerical studies, additional research for identifying their deficiencies and limitations would appear to be beneficial.
mqah | · The use of a single link overstrength factor (§2) for all link length ratios in the EBF design process can lead to significant underestimations of internal forces developed in other members due to the yielded and strain hardened links, especially when very short links are utilized. Thus, further research is needed to develop simple methods for estimating the actual link overstrength factor for different link length ratios considering the effects of moment-shear interaction, link flange shear resistance, axial restraint provided by the adjacent members, and excessive cyclic hardening. A similar concern is also valid for the case of built-up tubular links. Furthermore, the unusually high overstrengths (of the order of 5.0) which have been reported recently for some unstiffened very short links also need further attention.
xxr8 | . There is a substantial research need for investigating the effect of high axial load on the behavior of intermediate and long links. In addition, the effect of tensile axial force on increasing the link overstrength requires further attention, as mentioned in a number of recent studies.
rl4j | · The increase in the link overstrength due to the presence of a concrete slab has not been adequately investigated. This effect can be hazardous particularly from the capacity design point of view. Methods for estimating this increase are required which can be conveniently applied in practice.
vz32 | · Additional investigation is required to validate whether the recent relaxation in the flange slenderness requirements of shear links by the AISC Seismic Provisions [3] can also be considered for shear links subject to high axial loads.
ncb0 | · Several issues have recently been reported for the spacing requirements of links per AISC 341-10 [3] which need further consideration. Research is required to investigate the possibility of any relaxation in the stiffener spacing requirements of I-shaped shear links. On the contrary, the observed poor performance of some intermediate links, which is attributed mostly to their stiffener spacing requirements, should be studied carefully to come up with appropriate solutions.
8mp0 | · Many novel web stiffening details for reducing the probability of premature fracture and improving the link rotation capacity including, but not restricted to, the sandwich, horizontal stiffener, and diagonal stiffeners details have been proposed which require further research. In addition, the feasibility of other approaches, such as links without intermediate stiffeners, should be studied. Furthermore, if approved, the development of design guidelines for employing these details is essential.
xjyk | . The relation between the reduced material toughness in the k-area of I-shaped links and the recently observed link web fractures is still unclear and necessitates additional experiments.
mt0f | · The deteriorative effect of misalignment between the link end stiffeners and brace flanges in triggering fracture was observed during recent earthquakes, and thus, providing practical methods for reducing the probability of this misalignment in field applications would be fruitful.
awab | · The current intermediate stiffener spacing requirements of built-up box shear links are not dependent upon the required level of yp. Further experimental research is needed to validate such a relation.
ixcc | . Although the crucial importance of link lateral bracing is well understood, there exist only a handful of studies which have explicitly investigated the effect of lateral bracing on link behavior,
8p6h | considering realistic loading and boundary conditions. Additional research on this topic would be beneficial since the current codified lateral bracing requirements for links are in fact based on studies which focused mainly on the plastic hinge locations of MRFs.
pmgl | . There is a significant research need in the field of link-to-column connections considering the fact that most of the connections suitable for MRFs exhibit poor performance when used as link-to- column connections. Promising details such as the all-around fillet weld and the supplemental web doubler connections require further experimental verification, especially for long links, with the aim of developing prequalified link-to-column connections. In addition, other less studied link-to- column connections such as the end-plate connection with and without rib stiffeners as well as the connection reinforced by haunches need additional investigation and development of design procedures. There are also details such as the reduced flange section link connection, which have not been studied experimentally at all.
90no | · There is almost no study which specifically investigates the behavior and design of the column panel zones of EBFs with link-to-column connections. Research on this issue is indispensable. The current AISC Seismic Provisions [3] use the requirements of special MRFs for EBF column panel zone design without the necessary research background.
jt0y | . The amount of reduction in Q2 for the capacity design of columns in EBFs is typically limited since there are no methods for predicting the actual number of simultaneously yielded links above the column under consideration except for complicated nonlinear analysis. Thus, developing simple and reliable methods for estimating the reduced column forces can be advantageous, especially for high-rise EBFs, where a potential cost saving might be achieved.
qb7o | . There is an urgent need for the reevaluation of the response modification factors (R) of EBFs that are in use by most of the design specifications, since they can significantly overestimate the ductility of these structures. In a similar manner, previous studies have proven that the codified displacement amplification factors (Ca) for EBFs are not capable of predicting the actual inter-story drifts and inelastic link rotations based on the results of linear analysis, and thus, reevaluation again appears to be necessary. Although several studies have been undertaken regarding these issues, further research is essential in order to confirm such alterations.
oae5 | · The problem of the concentration of yielding in a limited number of stories is reported even for some properly designed mid- and high-rise EBFs. New methodologies have been proposed recently to overcome this issue, which require further verification (and in some cases simplification) so as to be considered as reliable and practical methods for the design of EBFs.
s0fl | . The codified assessment procedures for EBFs typically do not consider the effect of the loading history on the acceptance criteria and link failure detection. As noted in recent studies, this deficiency can be overcome by introducing measures based on cumulative demands. Further monotonic tests or experiments with other more suitable loading histories might be fruitful for developing these cumulative criteria, which can be used for predicting the actual link rotation capacities during an earthquake.
43ia | · The research on EBFs with vertical links is limited when compared to their horizontal counterparts. There is a significant need for research on the behavior and design of these structures to address issues such as stability and the detailing of vertical links. There is also a notable gap in the design specifications regarding EBFs with vertical links, which can only be closed with additional studies.
3g2y | . The promising performance of tied braced frames (TBFs) as well as EBFs upgraded with zipper struts in terms of the proper distribution of yielding over the structure height necessitates further confirmation through extensive numerical simulations as well as experimental studies. Practical procedures for the design of these systems are also required.
gc7v | · There has been a considerable improvement in the field of replaceable links in the past decade; however, there is still a need for additional research to develop codified design and detailing rules for link-to-beam connections with the final goal of proposing prequalified connection types for replaceable links. Furthermore, studies on intermediate and long replaceable links as well as external replaceable links located between a brace and a column are few in number.
wqfv | · Research on the progressive collapse of EBFs is very limited. Future research on this topic is essential, particularly for improving the behavior of these structures under probable blast loading scenarios.
j30a | · Newly proposed concepts such as composite links, EBFs with shape memory alloy (SMA) devices, EBFs made of high strength or stainless steel, and the use of energy-dissipating steel links in other structural systems such as diagrids and linked column frames (LCF) are also potential areas for future studies.
