Operationalizing the ideological and normative aspects of masculinity in the form of forced-choice questionnaire items is a radically decontextualizing move that is wholly inimical to the discursive dictum that gender is a socially and interactively constructed phenomenon. Within a constructionist view, masculine norms are studied as the active accomplishments of the people who put them to use. Moreover, the heterosexual masculine norm to display desire for females is capable of taking on many forms in different situations. Thus, it is the situation that determines the logic or meaning of the norm being circulated. Seen this way, there is no a priori way to define what heterosexuality means, or of specifying a tout court distinction between what is normatively masculine and what is not. Connell has argued that most men are able to mix varieties of masculinities together so as to move between various normative dimensions of masculine roles. If this is true, then operationalizing normative masculinity may be a dubious enterprise.\niest | In contrast, a discursive focus allows for a more contextually sensitive exploration of the social and interactive processes used by adolescent males to construct and then engage with (and resist) hetero-normative masculinity. A focus on discursive process allows us to see that masculine norms are complex and fluid, and that they are not oriented to in either/or terms. As Graber et al. have argued, there is always a cost or 'cascade of effects' of embracing sexual norms, and that the negotiation of such costs is a dynamic one that methodologically requires contextually nuanced approaches. We believe that a discursive psychological analysis is a fruitful step in that direction.\ncox8 | Second, a discursive approach partially throws into question what is meant when psychologists talk about men 'resolving' stages that feature what could arguably be seen as 'less than mature' aspects of a sexual identity. We resist the urge to think of development in terms of successfully or unsuccessfully resolving tasks, or even of thinking in terms of gradations of resolution. Instead, we argue that young men learn to strategically mitigate appearing obviously or unknowingly complicit with the noxious aspects of hetero-normative masculinity. They do this in talk. And they do it in ways that resist 'fixity'. Seeing the resistance of 'fixity' is something that a discursive analysis is designed to reveal. By examining this in detail, we can more productively argue that their socialization involves what we referred to earlier as the development of 'finely tuned positioning skills', or the gradual refinement of a range of discursive techniques that allow the boys to maintain more than one ideologically dilemmatic position within a variety of situations and in the midst of a variety of potential challenges.\nppqi | Third, connecting the type of ethnomethodologically informed discourse analysis employed in this study closer to the analysis of micro-genetically emergent positions of conversationalists opens up an important realm for developmental theorizing and investigation. A micro-analytic focus on the local 'fine-tuning' of interactive sense-making in the form of 'positioning skills' offers a relatively novel, discursive method for exploring developmental changes. In the group discussions analysed, the back and forth rhetorical orchestration between the participants is the space in which their identities micro-genetically emerge and consolidate. In utilizing this type of micro-analytic gaze for developmental theorizing, we are able to suggest that development (for these boys) involves the discursive rendering of linguistic, interactional and rhetorical skills, all of which reflect the burgeoning ability to be pragmatically and rhetorically 'answerable' in contested social contexts. A micro-developmental analysis of the 'fine-tuning' of such positioning skills reveals the gradual development of an 'interactive self' that is increasingly equipped for the vicissitudes of social life.\noxou | In the present data, the discursive ability to play up motives against empirical particulars, the strategic use of concessions to wash out the seriousness of a denial, and the inventive ability to style the other through caricature are all 'finely tuned positioning skills' that we believe begin to become strategic and common during adolescence. We believe this for two central reasons. First, adolescence has been well documented as a time when males are increasingly socialized to reconstitute their identities in normatively heterosexual ways. Second, it is a time when such socialization is flanked with innovative linguistic developments, which refer to an increase in the variable use of certain linguistic procedures and positioning strategies to do self-presentation and to manage face-work, particularly around gendered and sexual norms. Using language to position oneself as heterosexual is a precarious undertaking that involves a delicate balancing of directness with equivocation, something accomplished by practicing certain kinds of linguistic and rhetorical positioning skills.\n495n | The gradual and refined use of such positioning skills allows the boys to hedge their commitment or non-commitment to what they see to be the precarious aspects of hetero-normative masculinity. These positioning skills are designed as if there are potential counters or criticisms lurking, from either the moderator or the other boys. As such, being able to effectively display such positioning skills entails a constant and vigilant negotiation of an array of discursive possibilities, as well as the use of inventive strategies for positioning self and other. Seen this way, creating a mature self involves reconciling the disparate or potentially incompatible features of social categories, like heterosexuality, in the moment. In the present study, it means finding ways of displaying heterosexual desire that get heard as mature.",
