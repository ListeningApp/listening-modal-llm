You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

q1q2 | A unique, pan-ecosystemic sampling strategy
cb7r | The Pacific Ocean covers approximately one-third of the earth's surface, with nearly 25,000 islands, most of which harbor coral reefs. Tara Pacific equipped the schooner Tara to explore 32 islands across the entire Pacific over a period of 2.5 years (Fig 1). The route of the Tara schooner was chosen to maximize the number of visited remote islands and atolls and to per- form the widest possible comparative survey, from the equator to the temperate and more acidic regions, encompassing most of the environmental range where scleractinian coral spe- cies can live. It also covers a biodiversity gradient, from the low diversity present in the eastern Pacific reefs to the highly diverse western Pacific "warm pool" [14]. This sampling strategy also encompasses a wide variety of environments, from high temperature/low seasonality to low temperature/high seasonality, and also a full range of trophic status and physicochemical envi- ronmental parameters that affect coral reef ecosystems (sea surface temperature [SST], pH, nutrients, lights, pollutants, etc.).
68xu | Across its entire route, the Tara Pacific expedition targeted two species of scleractinian cor- als (Cnidaria, Anthozoa: Pocillopora meandrina and Porites lobata), one species of hydrocoral
hd35 | (Cnidaria, Hydrozoa: Millepora platyphylla), and two species of reef fish (Acanthurus triostegus and Zanclus cornutus) (Fig 3). The chosen taxa are among the few species that occur across most of the Pacific Ocean and are usually abundant on reefs. Around each of the 32 islands, three sites were sampled, collecting 10 colonies of each coral species and 5-10 individuals of each fish species, as well as water samples (see below) (Fig 3). Coral fragments and fish samples were preserved immediately on board, using specific buffers (e.g., DNA/RNA shield for geno- mics, glutaraldehyde for microscopy, etc.), and/or flash frozen for subsequent laboratory anal- yses (e.g., metabolomics, biomarkers, etc.).
2zpk | In addition, seawater biogeochemistry and plankton microbiomes (viruses to zooplankton) were assessed in oceanic waters upstream and downstream of each island, as well as from water above each site (i.e., "surface water") and surrounding two colonies of sampled P. mean- drina corals at each site (i.e., "coral-surrounding water"). Underwater propeller-driven plank- ton nets (for surface water) and water pumping systems (for coral-surrounding water) were developed to collect plankton on reef sites, whereas the preparation of plankton samples into different size classes <LATEX>\left( < 0 . 2 , 0 . 2 - 3 , 3 - 2 0 , 2 0 - 2 0 0 0 \mu m \right)</LATEX> and their preservation followed the Tara Oceans protocols [31] in order to maximize comparability and integration of data. Samples will be analyzed using high-throughput imaging and genomic techniques.
epu7 | Finally, key physical, chemical, and biological parameters were measured continuously from surface water and from aerosols using specific instruments installed on board (e.g., ther- mosalinograph, mass- and spectrophotometers), as well as samples for imaging and genetic analysis of aerosol particles. Environmental context will also be obtained from satellite images and operational oceanographic products from the European Copernicus Marine Service and Mercator Ocean.
7od1 | Tara Pacific samples and data resources for the immediate and long-term future
0bqy | Tara Pacific endorses the findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable (FAIR) principles for sci- entific data management [32] as well as ethical and responsible use of data. With a few excep- tions, all physical samples of coral, plankton, fish, and sediments were preserved on board Tara and sent back to partner laboratories for subsequent analyses. Controlled vocabularies describing sampling devices and sample preparation protocols were used throughout the expe- dition to capture provenance metadata on customized log sheets, and samples were assigned unique identifiers to facilitate their traceability. Legal documents regulating the collection, export, and import of samples, as well as links to the Convention on Biological Diversity's (CBD) access and benefit-sharing clearing house (https://absch.cbd.int/) are in the process of being provided for each sample as a first step toward ethical and responsible use of the Tara Pacific data. The detailed registry of all samples, including their provenance and environmen- tal and legal context, is curated manually using simple semantics that enable machine- and human-readable data discovery services. Sequencing data will be deposited at the free, open- access European Nucleotides Archive (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena); environmental data are deposited at the free, open-access PANGAEA database (https://www.pangaea.de/); and both archives will be interlinked via the sample registry available online at BioSamples (https:// www.ebi.ac.uk/biosamples/). Metabolomic data (mass spectrometry [MS] and nuclear mag- netic resonance [NMR]) and their annotations will also be accessible through the Metabolights portal (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/). The submission of data in a relational, open- access, updated, and cured database is critical and necessary for our aim to establish a refer- ence of the biological state of coral reefs in the Anthropocene for the broader research community.
b780 | Metagenomics and metatranscriptomics to explore the diversity and physiology of coral reef holobionts
ccmb | Building upon expertise gained in the previous Tara Oceans project [33-36], we are applying Illumina HiSeq technology to sequence a series of barcodes designed recently to explore the diversity of bacteria and archaea (V4-V5 region of the nuclear 16S rRNA gene [37]), eukary- otes (V9 region of nuclear 18S rRNA gene [33]), Symbiodiniaceae (ITS2 region of the nuclear ribosomal DNA [38-40]), and metazoan species (mitochondrial COX1 gene [41]), as well as metagenome assembly-defined viral populations [42, 43]. Barcode-specific PCRs are per- formed on DNA from coral tissues, coral-surrounding water, fish tissues, and surface water above the reef in order to assess interkingdom diversity associated with the holobiont at differ- ent degrees of proximity from the coral animal host, from endosymbiotic to drifting in coral- surrounding and surface waters. Biogeographic gradients will also be investigated between the studied island systems. The sequence reads are assembled into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) for bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes and into ITS2-type profiles (using the SymPortal framework at symportal.org [40]) for Symbiodiniaceae and taxonomically annotated by com- parison to reference databases. Classical numerical ecology methods are applied to employ OTU richness and abundance data to (1) assess and compare the total diversity of bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes associated with various compartments of the different coral
