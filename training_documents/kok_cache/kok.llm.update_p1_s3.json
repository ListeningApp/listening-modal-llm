Arguably, this switch arises from light inhibition of respiration, allowing the Kok method to estimate day respiration. Recent analysis suggests that increasing proportions of photorespiration quantified as the ratio of carbon dioxide compensation point to chloroplast carbon dioxide concentration with irradiance explain much of the Kok effect. Also, the Kok method has been modified to account for the decrease in PSII photochemical efficiency with irradiance.\n9g22 | Using a model that illustrates how varying day respiration, the ratio of carbon dioxide compensation point to chloroplast carbon dioxide concentration, photochemical efficiency, and proportions of alternative electron transport could engender the Kok effect, we quantified the contribution of these parameters to the Kok effect measured in sunflower across various oxygen and carbon dioxide concentrations and various temperatures.\n41fx | Overall, the decreasing photochemical efficiency with irradiance explained approximately twelve percent, and the varying ratio of carbon dioxide compensation point to chloroplast carbon dioxide concentration explained approximately twenty-five percent, of the Kok effect. Maximum real light inhibition of day respiration was much lower than the inhibition derived from the Kok method, but still increased with photorespiration.\n7um8 | Photorespiration had a dual contribution to the Kok effect, one via the varying ratio of carbon dioxide compensation point to chloroplast carbon dioxide concentration and the other via its participation in light inhibition of\nuow2 | day respiration.\niat7 | Introduction\nThe Kok effect refers to the abrupt change in the slope of the linear relationship between net photosynthetic rate and irradiance that occurs at very low irradiances, as observed initially in unicellular algae. The switch is reported later in leaves of many higher plant species. The slope decreases from the initial higher value to a lower value, mostly at an irradiance value around the light compensation point. This switch has been interpreted as a consequence of light inhibition of respiration, allowing the so-called Kok method to estimate respiration in the light, or day respiration, and quantum yield of carbon dioxide assimilation, using the part of the relationship with the lower slope. The absolute value of the estimated day respiration is lower than the respiration in the dark. The cost of total respiratory activities accounts for approximately forty percent of gross photosynthetic productivity of whole plants. Light inhibition of respiratory activities also occurs at a stand scale, suggesting that it is a general phenomenon, and thus would have a significant impact on projecting the net ecosystem carbon fluxes in biomes across the globe. For this reason, understanding the Kok effect and its related light inhibition of respiration has continuously received attention.\nywwr | The lower estimates of day respiration by the Kok method, relative to respiration in the dark, have been confirmed by other gas exchange-based methods such as the popular Laisk method. By applying the Laisk\n0i6j | method to different light intensities, it has been shown that day respiration was progressively inhibited by increasing irradiance. However, this light inhibition has been challenged by the direct measurement of day respiration, which exploits the differences in the time course of labeling by carbon isotopes of photosynthetic, photorespiratory and respiratory pathways. For example, using such techniques, Pinelli and Loreto suggested a significant refixation of respired and photorespired carbon dioxide and Loreto et al. calculated that there would be no significant difference between day respiration and respiration in the dark if the refixation of carbon dioxide released from respiration during illumination were taken into account. Similarly, a recent report using a direct method based on isotopic disequilibrium showed that day respiration was underestimated by the Laisk method. Owing to inconsistent reports of this kind, whether the Kok effect was a result of light inhibition of leaf respiration has been under debate over years.\n87cq | In fact, according to an extended form of the widely used model of Farquhar et al. for describing the electron transport-limited photosynthesis, several other mechanisms could also explain the Kok effect. The extended model expresses the net carbon dioxide assimilation rate as a function of the photosynthetically absorbed irradiance as:\n0qs3 | carbon dioxide assimilation rate equals the ratio of one minus carbon dioxide compensation point divided by chloroplast carbon dioxide concentration to four times one plus twice the carbon dioxide compensation point divided by chloroplast carbon dioxide concentration multiplied by the activity function of photochemical efficiency, rho two, and photosynthetically absorbed irradiance minus day respiration.
