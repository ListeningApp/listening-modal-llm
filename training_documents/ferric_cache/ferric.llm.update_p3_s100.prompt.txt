You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

cb7r | 2A) with optical features that closely resemble the substrate- free ferric resting state (Figure S5), before slowly returning to the original mixture of HS and LS species over the following 40 s (Figure 2B, Figure S5). Analysis of the timecourse for cWP- bound oxy-AspB formation and decay at 440 nm required fitting to a three summed exponential (Figure S6). A single rate of formation ~28.1 <LATEX>s ^ { - 1 }</LATEX> and two decay phases (2.2 and 0.04 s-1) (Table S2) represent the primary decomposition of the oxy-ferrous species to the initial LS-species and the subsequent slower generation of the enzyme-substrate complex. Evaluation of the kinetics of oxy formation and decay with varying <LATEX>O _ { 2 }</LATEX> concentrations show that only the first kinetic phase (oxy-formation) is O2-dependent as expected, while the latter phases are independent of <LATEX>O _ { 2 }</LATEX> concentration (Figure 2C). Further comments on the assignment of each of these phases are provided in the Supporting Information Methods, Figure S7, and Tables S2 and S3.
68xu | The direct transition of <LATEX>\mathrm { F e } ^ { 3 + }</LATEX> to a pure LS species is atypical for substrate-bound CYPs34-36 and suggests a process that is more complex than autoxidation. Nonetheless, we have previously observed similar behavior in the H2O2-dependent CYP OleT.37 In that case, autoxidation, which ultimately
hd35 | furnishes <LATEX>H _ { 2 } O _ { 2 } ,</LATEX> can react with the ferric-heme to initiate catalysis. However, AspB is unable to effectively metabolize cWP using a peroxide-shunt pathway (Figure S8), and the inclusion of catalase did not alter the kinetic behavior for oxy- decomposition, unlike what was found for OleT (Figure S9). Another notable deviation from typical CYP behavior is seen when comparing the decay rates of the oxy-complex for the substrate-bound and free enzyme. In the absence of the substrate, AspB-oxy decays directly back to the ferric resting state (Figure S10). For many CYPs, a bound substrate typically extends the lifetime of the first dioxygen intermediate, occasionally upward of 100-fold, thus allowing second electron transfer event to occur and minimizing the generation of reactive oxygen species. However, there is no significant difference in the decay rate constants for AspB decomposition in the presence or absence of the substrate <LATEX>\left( 2 . 2 \pm 0 . 3 s ^ { - 1 } \right.</LATEX> for substrate-free oxy).
2zpk | N-Methylated Substrate Derivative Stabilizes the Oxy Complex. We synthesized a substrate derivative where the indole nitrogen was methylated, termed N1-methyl cWP (3) (Figure 3A), as computational studies by Sherman and colleagues have suggested that DKP-dimerization by AspB may be afforded by primary indole N-H abstraction.19,23 AspB displayed very similar binding characteristics <LATEX>\left( K _ { D } \right.</LATEX> and maximal spin-state conversion) with (3) (Figure S11). The crystal structure of N1-methyl cWP-bound AspB (PDB: 8TWU) was solved to 1.86 Å resolution (Figure S12A, Table S4). As in the crystal structure of AspB bound to cWP (PDB 7S3J), two molecules of (3) are found bound in the active site in close vicinity to the heme cofactor (Figure 3B). The first substrate molecule, shown in blue, displays some minor structural differences from that of the native substrate (Figure S12B). This substrate molecule loses some of the concavity seen with the native substrate, and the DKP nitrogen is no longer within hydrogen bonding distance of the heme propionate group as is seen in the crystal structure with (1). Nonetheless, the introduced methyl-group is oriented ~4 Å from the heme-iron in a position that would appear primed for oxidation (e.g., hydroxylation followed by spontaneous demethylation)8 by an activated oxygen species if it was generated. The second substrate molecule, shown in light green, binds very similarly to what was observed in the crystal structure of the native substrate. HPLC characterization of AspB turnover with (3) revealed that the substrate analog was highly inhibitory (Figure 3C) and only produced a very minor amount <LATEX>\left( \sim 2 \right)</LATEX> of a demethylated dimerized product with an <LATEX>m / z = 5 7 9</LATEX> (Figure S13).
epu7 | As AspB appears unable to effectively metabolize the N- methylated substrate despite a similar binding mode, we compared the spectral and kinetic characteristics for oxy-AspB decay in the presence of 3. Dramatically different kinetic behavior was observed, as the oxy-complex decayed directly to a mixture of ferric HS/LS states with a composition that was identical to the resting substrate-bound state (Figure 3D) with clearly defined isosbestic points for the transition. While the formation of AspB-oxy was significantly faster in the presence of 3 (238 s 1) with an on rate for <LATEX>O _ { 2 }</LATEX> binding ~3-fold higher than with 1 (Figure S14), the decay kinetics were much slower than cWP and dominated by the amplitude of the slow phase. The rates of both decay phases closely resembled formation of the E-S complex monitored at 390 nm (Figure S15, Table S5), unlike what was observed with 1. Thus, alteration of the indole
7od1 | moiety of the substrate reverts AspB to the typical autoxidation behavior characteristic of most CYPs.
0bqy | Provision of a Second electron Is Not Required for Catalysis. Taken together, the unusual behavior for the decay of the AspB-oxy complex in the presence of 1 as well as the inverse KSIE on product formation prompted us to examine the possibility that the generation of CYP-I may not be required for catalysis. The dithionite-reduced E-S complex was exposed to <LATEX>O _ { 2 } ,</LATEX> and samples were then analyzed for product formation. It is unlikely that excess dithionite would be able to effectively reduce the oxy complex, as CYPs prototypically require an allosteric effector role provided by a biological redox partner for efficient second electron transfer.39,40 Nevertheless, we further excluded this possibility through the removal of excess dithionite by anaerobically desalting the E-S complex following reduction such that only one electron equivalent was provided. Irrespective of this chromatographic step, we observed the efficient formation of a product with identical retention time (Figure 4A), UV-absorption profile and <LATEX>m / z</LATEX> as
