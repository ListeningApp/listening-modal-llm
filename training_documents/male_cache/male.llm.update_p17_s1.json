From pregnenolone, the Leydig cell produces testosterone via metabolism through the forty-four steroidogenic pathway shown in\nh83u | In addition to androgens, the testis also synthesizes estradiol (via conversion of testosterone by the enzyme aromatase) and secretes significant amounts of estrogens. Estrogens may act intratesticularly to regulate testosterone production. This action may be mediated through estrogen receptors, which have been localized in Leydig cells.\nkjoa | a) Characteristics and Location: The Leydig cells are located between the tubules in the interstitial space close to the blood vessels and lymphatics. The cells are characterized by:\nwb1c | (one) lipid droplets\nak13 | (two) mitochondria with tubular cristae\ns7el | (three) a smooth endoplasmic reticulum.\n0lfu | (four) These cells express the receptors for LH, which stimulates steroidogenesis through a cAMP-mediated signal transduction pathway.\ncnjl | b) Hormone Production Androgens are secreted from the testes beginning during prenatal development. The Leydig cells are steroidogenically active between eight-eighteen weeks of gestation and later at puberty and subsequently. Androgens act at receptor sites in target tissues such as testes and penis, as well as male accessory organs, such as seminal vesicles and the prostate, to effectuate sexual reproduction. Testosterone maintains spermatogenesis and the function of the male accessory glands. Androgens regulate central nervous system functions to\nrtdl | influence libido and sexual behavior. Androgens also stimulate metabolism and protein synthesis and influence muscle growth, as well as the additional secondary sex characteristics (male pattern body hair and balding, deepening of the voice, increased bone density, calcium retention, increased red blood cells, and increased body water due to increased renal absorption of water). The functions of the Leydig cells are regulated by:\nnorp | (one) LH that stimulates testosterone biosynthesis\nchx3 | (two) Prolactin that induces the expression of the LH receptor\nsfcf | Two) The Germ Cells: The germinal elements comprise a population of cells, which include a slowly dividing primitive stem cell population, the rapidly proliferating spermatogonia, spermatocytes undergoing meiosis and the metamorphosing spermatids.\nnuxs | a) Mitosis in the Testis: The spermatogonia in the testis have the highest rate of proliferation in the body. They proliferate to ensure the relatively constant production of sperm by the testis.\numx0 | i) Spermatogonial stem cells were first postulated to exist based upon subtle morphological characteristics and the realization that in some instances after prolonged periods of secondary infertility, after exposure to gonadotoxins, rejuvenation of spermatogenesis might occur years later. The spermatogonial stem cells are largely quiescent but have the capacity to regenerate spermatogenesis after a toxic insult. The cells are characterized by their ability to undergo self-renewal throughout the life of males. The cells reside in a niche or specialized microenvironment on the basal side of the blood-testis barrier. Regulation of self-renewal is under investigation, but growth factors such as GDNF and FGF are critical regulators of spermatogonial stem cell renewal. Spermatogonial stem cell transplantation techniques developed in the mid-nineteen-nineties definitively showed the regenerative potential of these cells to restore spermatogenesis to an otherwise Sertoli cell-only testis. Interestingly, more recent studies in mouse models and in human spermatogenesis show that these cells are also pluripotent with the ability to form multi-potent embryonic stem cell-like lines that can differentiate into somatic cells.\no306 | ii) Type A spermatogonia: These are the least mature germ cells and are located directly along the basal lamina. The primitive spermatogonium is about twelve micrometers in diameter, and on a hematoxylin and eosin stained slide, they appear to have a lighter halo around the nucleus. The cells are connected by small cytoplasmic bridges. There are two type A spermatogonia, type A pale and A dark. The A dark spermatogonia are the putative stem cells. Type B spermatogonia are more differentiated. Retinoic acid is usually metabolized by the testis from retinol in circulation. Retinoic acid acts directly on the spermatogonia to stimulate their entry into the meiotic pathway and differentiate into type B spermatogonia. Retinoic acid also acts on the Sertoli cells to regulate the cyclic functions of this cell in spermatogenesis. The clock appears to be set by retinoic acid but the germ cells can influence this cyclic activity of the Sertoli cell as well.\nqm1b | b) In a routine pathological examination, the types of spermatogonia are not routinely assessed. Spermatogonia are the diploid spermatogenic cells located along the basal lamina of the\nn9ms | basal compartment of the seminiferous epithelium. They are outside of the blood-testis barrier (below the tight junctions between adjacent Sertoli cells). A spermatogonial stem cell undergoes successive rounds of mitosis at puberty. This mitosis is very inefficient, and many cells undergo apoptosis. This stage is known as the proliferative stage of spermatogenesis. After exposure to toxic agents or radiation, the stem cells have the potential to repopulate the testis with spermatogenic cells and re-establish the spermatogenic process.\nicdp | Three) Meiosis: involves the steps that follow the entry of the type B spermatogonia into the meiotic pathway. This is a process where the germ cells undergo a series of DNA replication resulting in a tetraploid gamete, followed by meiotic recombination with double-strand breaks, crossing over and DNA repair followed by two successive reductive divisions to yield the haploid spermatid.\nwtse | a) Primary Spermatocytes: The type B spermatogonia are the progenitor cells that differentiate into the primary spermatocytes. The spermatocytes are large cells with twice the normal amount of DNA per cell and a four C chromosome value. The spermatocytes are located in the adluminal compartment of the seminiferous epithelium (inside of the blood-testis barrier). The primary spermatocyte undergoes the first or reductional meiotic division to produce two secondary spermatocytes (two C DNA content). Prophase is divided into four stages-leptotene zygotene, pachytene, and diplotene. This is the longest stage, taking about twenty-two days in humans, so most spermatocytes seen in a section will be in this phase. The cells reach diakinesis. The cells then progress to metaphase, the chromosomes move to the poles at anaphase. The cells are the largest spermatogenic cells and are characterized by chromosomes in various stages of coiling.\nbm7g | i) First Meiotic Division one. Leptotene: Each homologous chromosome is two sister chromatids (maternal and paternal) that attach to the inner membrane of the nuclear envelope.\njr68 | two. Zygotene: Synapsis of the homologous chromosomes begins. A synaptonemal complex develops between homologous chromosomes.\naxix | three. Pachytene: Synapsis is complete when homologous chromosomes become entirely linked. Stretches of paternal and maternal DNA are coordinated in space and crossing over between non-sister chromatids starts (homologous recombination).\n05y4 | four. Diplotene: The chromosomes appear double. Disjunction takes place when crossing over ends. Chromosomes remain attached at specific points (chiasmata).\n2fb0 | five. Diakinesis: Chromosomes detach from the nuclear membrane, shorten and become thicker. Synaptonemal complex disassembles, but a short piece remains in the chiasma region. A microtubule spindle begins to form.\n```",
