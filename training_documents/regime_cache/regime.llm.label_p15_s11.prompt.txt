You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

7bdk | One source of error is the systematic error due to three different biases. As discussed in Proposition 2.4, the finiteness of the integration time leads to some bias of order 1/(nt), which is typically smaller than the statistical error. Additionally, the fact that we consider n / 0 leads to some bias of order n, as a consequence of Lemma 2.2. Lastly, the time discretization of the continuous dynamics also leads to some time step bias; see [28].
fim0 | As discussed in Proposition 2.4 below, the statistical error is dictated by a central limit theorem, so the variance of the estimator On,t scales as 1/(n2t). The simulation time required to estimate P1 with a sufficient statistical ac- curacy therefore scales as t ~ n-2, leading to very long integration times t. Such long simulation times are often prohibitive in practical cases of interest. These results, and the tradeoffs to be considered, are discussed in more detail in Section 2.3.
ojro | 2.2.3. Application to mobility. The aim of this section is to illustrate the various previous results in the paradigmatic case of mobility. We consider the case where F E Rª is a constant force, and the state-space is X = Td. We define the mobility for both overdamped Langevin and Langevin dynamics, and discuss how it is related to the self-diffusion by Einstein's relation.
l6t9 | 16
1ujy | R. SPACEK AND G. STOLTZ
qzor | From a physical point of view, it is expected that a nonzero constant force in some given direction induces a response from the system. At steady-state, this response is represented by some nonzero flux, due to the fact that the forcing F is not the gradient of a periodic function. This nonzero flux depends both on the perturbation and on the observable R in question.
a0by | For the Langevin dynamics (2.18), the perturbation nF is expected to induce a nonzero velocity in the direction F. The mobility is the proportionality constant between the externally applied force F and the observed average velocity in the di- rection F. Therefore, it is natural to consider the observable
u1ky | R(p) =FT M-1p.
htm9 | This gives us the following expression for the mobility, in view of (2.26):
8hul | PI =/ TdxRª (FT M-1p)f1 40.
87vz | It can be rewritten using the Green-Kubo formula (2.36) and the expression (2.37) of the conjugate response as
ym66 | P1 = B | E0 [(FT M-1Pt) (FT M-po)] dt. 1+00
l0a3 | From this expression, it is easy to see that the mobility is related to the self-diffusion coefficient DF as (see for instance [28])
u8nw | (2.39) P1= BDF,
l2v9 | where
afbe | DF = lim t->+00 E [(FT (Qt - Qo))2] 2t ,
78r8 | with
320g | Qt = Qo + | M-1ps ds t
tp8g | the unperiodized displacement. The formula (2.39) for DF is known as Einstein's relation [14].
gxfd | For overdamped Langevin dynamics (2.11), there is no notion of velocities. The system is however expected to drift in the direction F. This can be quantified by how much the gradient part of the force changes in the direction F. Thus, it is natural to consider the following observable
s2v1 | R(q) = FTVV (q).
jkp9 | The mobility is then defined as the average projected force in the direction of the perturbation
z8tt | P1 = = (FT V) f1 40.
9g22 | EXTENDING LINEAR RESPONSE WITH SYNTHETIC FORCINGS
41fx | 17
7um8 | For overdamped Langevin, the mobility is related to the self-diffusion DF through the following equality (see for instance [12]):
uow2 | BDF = |F|2 - P1 = |F|2 - B IF|2 - B | E| [(FTV (qt)(FTV(0)] dt, 0
iat7 | where the second expression involves the Green-Kubo formula for the linear response of FTVV.
ywwr | 2.3. Numerical Analysis for NEMD. In this section, we perform error analy- sis on the estimator (2.38). We obtain bounds on the variance, then on the finite-time integration bias. Without loss of generality, we consider response functions of the form R = IIOR, i.e. functions with zero average with respect to the invariant mea- sure yo of the reference dynamics. The estimator @n,t defined in (2.38) converges almost surely, as t > co to
0i6j | P.n = = IN Ryn = P1 + O(n),
87cq | (2.40)
0qs3 | where the last equality comes from Lemma 2.2. However, On,t suffers both from a large asymptotic variance, of order ok.o/n2 (with oko the asymptotic variance for time averages of R computed with the reference dynamics), and a large finite-time sampling bias, of order 1/(nt). The aim of this section is to make precise the latter two statements.
z8f7 | Bounds on the statistical error. The scaling of the statistical error is quantified in the following result.
7w7j | PROPOSITION 2.4. Suppose that Assumptions 1 through 4 hold true. Fix RE So and n E R. Assume that XO ~ Hinit for some initial probability measure Hinit (dx) such that Minit (Kn) < +00 for any n > 1. Then the estimator Qnt converges almost surely to P1,n as t -> +00, and the following central limit theorem holds:

5bq3 | V/n| < n * , 102,11-02,0-702, 이 ≤Cn2.
ezla | (2.42)
rsbu | This result shows that simulation times of order t ~ ~~ 2 should be considered in order for the variance of the naive estimator (2.38) to be of order 1 , and also for its bias to be of order n, i.e. of the same order of magnitude as the bias p1 - P1,n arising from choosing n / 0. For completeness, the proof of (2.42) is done at second-order, in order to determine the expression of the term oRo characterizing the first-order variation of o R,n with respect to n.
magd | Proof. The central limit theorem (2.41) holds by the results of [4], since the Poisson equation -Ln Rn = IIn R has a unique solution in IIn BAº C L2 (y) for some integer n > 1 in view of (2.5) and (2.6). Note that IIn Rn = Rn. To prove (2.42), we first write the asymptotic variance as (see for instance [29, Section 3])
