You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

06yq | Microdosing with psychedelics to self-medicate for ADHD symptoms in adults: A naturalistic study
dpv6 | ARTICLE INFO
8r5j | ABSTRACT
2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

u1ky | Metabolomics and proteomics have been integrated using RF for analysis of prostate cancer (Fan et al., 2011) and thyroid functioning (Pietzner et al., 2017). Similarly, metabolomics is integrated with mRNA for studying ulcerative colitis (Bjerrum et al., 2014) and cancer survival (Kim et al., 2014). On the other hand, glycomics and epigenomics have only appeared once in the multi-omics context (along with mRNA and metabolomics) and used by Zierer (Zierer et al., 2016) for the study of age-related comorbidities using a graphical variant of RF.
htm9 | Recently, metabolomics and proteomics have also been integrated with lipidomics to evaluate COVID-19 patients using PLS-DA (Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis) and Extra Trees (Overmyer et al., 2020; Thomas et al., 2020).
8hul | Multi-omics studies have also been successfully conducted in plants (potato (Acharjee et al., 2016, Acharjee et al., 2011)) and animals (such as canine heart disease (Li et al., 2015)).
87vz | Overall, the different recent multi-omics studies highlight the supe- riority of integration methods in understanding the complexity of different diseases and uncovering the underlying abnormalities from the vastly generated multi-omics data, which is not always possible with individual omics analysis.
ym66 | 6. Recommendations
l0a3 | Today a plethora of multi-omic integration methods are available for both supervised and unsupervised learning as evident in the current review. This information can overwhelm interdisciplinary scientists and would require a time-consuming effort to understand the challenging mathematical and computational concepts behind them. Hence, we suggest that interdisciplinary teams working on multi-omics always include ML practitioners to assist with the choice of methods, the development of solutions, the interpretation of results and their signif- icance and limits. Such truly interdisciplinary teams offer real oppor- tunities for better mutual understanding of the different fields, practice and expertise necessary, leading ultimately to more robust conclusions. Also, to facilitate the method selection process, a recommendation flowchart is proposed in Fig. 3. It shows the various decision steps required for choosing an appropriate method (or family of methods) for a given scenario. For example, to choose a method for integrating two omics for unsupervised learning one can choose a model-based method such as 'PSDF or Lemon-Tree' if the two omics are gene expression and CNV, otherwise 'MDI or SNF' can be used. Similarly, 'NEMO' can be used in scenarios where the datasets are partially overlapping, and a trans- formation approach is required. Hence, it can be used for biomedical analysis, including diagnosis, prognosis and biomarker identification, by posing them as supervised or unsupervised learning problems.
u8nw | Clearly, a 'one-size-fits-all' approach is not feasible. Also,
l2v9 | Biotechnology Advances 49 (2021) 107739
afbe | unfortunately, the existing literature does not provide many direct comparisons between methods using the same publicly available data- sets. Hence, to choose the best method which suits a given dataset and question, an empirical approach that investigates the use of different methods, guided by ML practitioners is recommended.
78r8 | 7. Conclusions
320g | This paper reviewed various ML approaches used for the integration of multi-omics data for analysis. A concise background of multi-omics and ML was presented. It examined the concatenation-, model- and transformation-based integration methods, employed for multi-omics data along with their advantages and disadvantages. Also, various existing multi-omics studies have been summarised. Finally, a recom- mendation flowchart is presented for interdisciplinary professionals to choose an appropriate method for a multi-omics dataset. Overall, this work showcases the recent findings in the multi-omics domain and signifies the key role of ML in the future of personalised healthcare.
