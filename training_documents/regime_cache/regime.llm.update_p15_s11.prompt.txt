You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.

53fa | One source of error is the systematic error due to three different biases. As discussed in Proposition 2.4, the finiteness of the integration time leads to some bias of order 1/(nt), which is typically smaller than the statistical error. Additionally, the fact that we consider n / 0 leads to some bias of order n, as a consequence of Lemma 2.2. Lastly, the time discretization of the continuous dynamics also leads to some time step bias; see [28].
nnb3 | As discussed in Proposition 2.4 below, the statistical error is dictated by a central limit theorem, so the variance of the estimator On,t scales as 1/(n2t). The simulation time required to estimate P1 with a sufficient statistical ac- curacy therefore scales as t ~ n-2, leading to very long integration times t. Such long simulation times are often prohibitive in practical cases of interest. These results, and the tradeoffs to be considered, are discussed in more detail in Section 2.3.
s943 | 2.2.3. Application to mobility. The aim of this section is to illustrate the various previous results in the paradigmatic case of mobility. We consider the case where F E Rª is a constant force, and the state-space is X = Td. We define the mobility for both overdamped Langevin and Langevin dynamics, and discuss how it is related to the self-diffusion by Einstein's relation.
o7zd | From a physical point of view, it is expected that a nonzero constant force in some given direction induces a response from the system. At steady-state, this response is represented by some nonzero flux, due to the fact that the forcing F is not the gradient of a periodic function. This nonzero flux depends both on the perturbation and on the observable R in question.
thxo | For the Langevin dynamics (2.18), the perturbation nF is expected to induce a nonzero velocity in the direction F. The mobility is the proportionality constant between the externally applied force F and the observed average velocity in the di- rection F. Therefore, it is natural to consider the observable
b67w | R(p) =FT M-1p.
hoze | This gives us the following expression for the mobility, in view of (2.26):
hd71 | PI =/ TdxRª (FT M-1p)f1 40.
eix9 | It can be rewritten using the Green-Kubo formula (2.36) and the expression (2.37) of the conjugate response as
h4p4 | P1 = B | E0 [(FT M-1Pt) (FT M-po)] dt. 1+00
asp2 | From this expression, it is easy to see that the mobility is related to the self-diffusion coefficient DF as (see for instance [28])
8d1n | (2.39) P1= BDF,
559s | where
rhb6 | DF = lim t->+00 E [(FT (Qt - Qo))2] 2t ,
dpdb | with
lek9 | Qt = Qo + | M-1ps ds t
i22c | the unperiodized displacement. The formula (2.39) for DF is known as Einstein's relation [14].
ofle | For overdamped Langevin dynamics (2.11), there is no notion of velocities. The system is however expected to drift in the direction F. This can be quantified by how much the gradient part of the force changes in the direction F. Thus, it is natural to consider the following observable
ezbr | R(q) = FTVV (q).
tpiw | The mobility is then defined as the average projected force in the direction of the perturbation
dgkq | P1 = = (FT V) f1 40.
hxjr | EXTENDING LINEAR RESPONSE WITH SYNTHETIC FORCINGS
2yv3 | For overdamped Langevin, the mobility is related to the self-diffusion DF through the following equality (see for instance [12]):
opoe | BDF = |F|2 - P1 = |F|2 - B IF|2 - B | E| [(FTV (qt)(FTV(0)] dt, 0
vr2v | where the second expression involves the Green-Kubo formula for the linear response of FTVV.
m4jl | 2.3. Numerical Analysis for NEMD. In this section, we perform error analy- sis on the estimator (2.38). We obtain bounds on the variance, then on the finite-time integration bias. Without loss of generality, we consider response functions of the form R = IIOR, i.e. functions with zero average with respect to the invariant mea- sure yo of the reference dynamics. The estimator @n,t defined in (2.38) converges almost surely, as t > co to
59hi | P.n = = IN Ryn = P1 + O(n),
ua3p | (2.40)
0a2t | where the last equality comes from Lemma 2.2. However, On,t suffers both from a large asymptotic variance, of order ok.o/n2 (with oko the asymptotic variance for time averages of R computed with the reference dynamics), and a large finite-time sampling bias, of order 1/(nt). The aim of this section is to make precise the latter two statements.
abow | Bounds on the statistical error. The scaling of the statistical error is quantified in the following result.
qx6n | PROPOSITION 2.4. Suppose that Assumptions 1 through 4 hold true. Fix RE So and n E R. Assume that XO ~ Hinit for some initial probability measure Hinit (dx) such that Minit (Kn) < +00 for any n > 1. Then the estimator Qnt converges almost surely to P1,n as t -> +00, and the following central limit theorem holds:
p2bm | Vt (&n,t - P1,n) t+00 law , N (0, 0 Km) .

w41b | V/n| < n * , 102,11-02,0-702, 이 ≤Cn2.
vokd | (2.42)
efir | This result shows that simulation times of order t ~ ~~ 2 should be considered in order for the variance of the naive estimator (2.38) to be of order 1 , and also for its bias to be of order n, i.e. of the same order of magnitude as the bias p1 - P1,n arising from choosing n / 0. For completeness, the proof of (2.42) is done at second-order, in order to determine the expression of the term oRo characterizing the first-order variation of o R,n with respect to n.
vjhs | Proof. The central limit theorem (2.41) holds by the results of [4], since the Poisson equation -Ln Rn = IIn R has a unique solution in IIn BAº C L2 (y) for some integer n > 1 in view of (2.5) and (2.6). Note that IIn Rn = Rn. To prove (2.42), we first write the asymptotic variance as (see for instance [29, Section 3])
