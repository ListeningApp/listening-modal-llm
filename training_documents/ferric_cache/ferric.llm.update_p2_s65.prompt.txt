You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

y2qo | The C-N linkage of two molecules of cWP involves a two- electron oxidation of the substrates, and mechanisms that are initiated by indole or DKP N-H abstraction by CYP-I have been advanced. 18,19,23 A structural alignment of AspB with other well-characterized CYP monooxygenases shows a distinct alteration of residues at the I-helix that are known to be critical for O-O heterolysis in O2-activating CYPs (Figures S1A,B). Notably, AspB lacks the highly conserved acid (Asp or Glu) on the I-helix distal pocket that forms half of the "acid- alcohol pair" that is crucial for mediating proton delivery to the ferric peroxo-anion intermediate (Figure S1C).24-28 Due to this deviation (a proline is found at the corresponding position in AspB), we performed steady-state kinetic solvent isotope effect (KSIE) experiments to determine if an alternative mode of proton-delivery was operant. A comparison of the rates of product formation by AspB in H2O and D2O buffers revealed an inverse KSIE of 0.66 ± 0.1 (Figure 1C,D). This phenomenon is highly unusual for a P450 that employs CYP-I as an oxidant, as rate-limiting proton-transfer steps are involved in its generation.29 Furthermore, increasing the concentration of protons in AspB reactions by lowering the pH resulted in a slower rate of product formation (Figure S2). This is the opposite trend from what was previously observed for the analogous I-helix acid mutant (D251N) in the camphor monooxygenase CYP101.28 In that case, an increase in the turnover rate and corresponding ~5-fold increase in the KSIE at lower pH was attributed to an extended proton-delivery chain involved in the generation of CYP-I. In contrast, the availability of protons appears to impede product formation in AspB despite the absence of an I-helix acid.
1piq | Inverse KSIEs have been reported for some atypical P450 reactions and used as a rationale to invoke intermediates that precede compound I.30 These include substrate transforma- tions that are either postulated or demonstrated to be mediated by a ferric-peroxoanion species, such as the 17,20 lyase chemistry catalyzed by CYP17Al in the conversion of 17- hydroxypregnenolone to dehydroepiandrosterone, and more recently, an epoxide ring-opening cascade of tirandamycin L by mutants of the CYP TamI. However, the nucleophilicity of a ferric peroxoanion complex would make it unlikely to serve as an effective reagent for cWP dimerization.
7fqw | Transient Kinetic Studies. To gain insight into the potential involvement of an alternative oxidant in AspB, we
rhaz | performed stopped-flow absorption experiments at 4 ℃ where the reduced enzyme-substrate (E-S) complex was rapidly mixed with excess <LATEX>O _ { 2 } .</LATEX> The resulting ferric-superoxide (or "oxy") complex represents the last semistable intermediate in CYP catalysis and the first branchpoint between productive catalysis and uncoupling. The intermediate can either decay via the release of superoxide via autoxidation, or if a second reducing equivalent is suitably provided, be further activated to form a (hydro)peroxo or CYP-I following the O-O bond cleavage. In the first 100 ms after mixing of the reduced substrate-saturated AspB with excess <LATEX>O _ { 2 } ,</LATEX> the ferrous enzyme rapidly decays to form a new species (Figure S3) with absorption characteristics (Soret <LATEX>2 _ { \max } \sim 4 2 4</LATEX> nm and merged Q- bands ~556 nm and a shoulder <LATEX>\begin{array}{} \text { ler } \sim 5 8 5 \\ \text { CYP-cxv } \end{array}</LATEX> nm) (Figure 2A) that are similar to other reported <LATEX>\left( \mathrm { F e } ^ { 3 + } - O _ { 2 } \right) ^ { - - }</LATEX> complexes (Table S1). As a second electron is not provided for catalysis to occur, one would anticipate that autoxidation should result in reformation of the ferric enzyme-substrate bound resting state. Substrate-saturated AspB is composed of a mixture of high- and low-spin (HS and LS) species (~15% HS at <LATEX>4 ^ { \circ } C</LATEX> (Figure S4). However, the AspB oxy-complex appears to directly decay to a purely LS-form from 0.1 to 2.5 s (Figure
