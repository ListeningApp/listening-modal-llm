But this raises other questions. When does such a probability distribution exist? If it exists, is it unique? And what if not all the P sub I are positive?\ncnqv | In what follows we'll dive down this rabbit hole and get to the bottom of it. I'll just state some facts-you may enjoy trying to see if you can prove them. First, there exists a probability distribution from P sub one to P sub N with expectation of A equals C if and only if\n848r | A sub min is less than or equal to C is less than or equal to A sub max where A sub min is the minimum value and A sub max is the maximum value of the numbers from A sub one to A sub N. Second, whenever\no1ho | A sub min is less than C is less than A sub max, there exists a unique probability distribution from P sub one to P sub N maximizing Shannon entropy subject to the constraint expectation of A equals C. Third, this unique maximizer P has P sub I greater than zero for all I, and is thus a Boltzmann distribution, whenever\ngd2a | A sub min is less than C is less than A sub max. When C equals A sub min, the unique maximizer assigns the same probability P sub I to each outcome I with A sub I equals A sub min, while P sub I equals zero for all other outcomes. Similarly, when C equals A sub max, the unique maximizer assigns the same probability P sub I to each outcome I with A sub I equals A sub max, while P sub I equals zero for all other outcomes.\nz373 | It's good to look at an example:\n38ni | Puzzle twenty-four. Suppose there are only two outcomes, with A sub one equals negative one and A sub two equals one. Work out the Boltzmann distribution P maximizing Shannon entropy subject to the constraint expectation of A equals C for negative one is less than less than one. Show that as lambda approaches positive infinity this Boltzmann distribution has\neffn | P sub one approaches one, P sub two approaches zero while as lambda approaches negative infinity it has\nud13 | P sub one approaches zero, P sub two approaches one. Show the probability distribution P sub one equals one, P sub two equals zero maximizes Shannon entropy subject to the constraint expectation of A equals negative one, while P sub one equals zero, P sub two equals one maximizes it subject to the constraint expectation of A equals one. Show these two probability distributions are not Boltzmann distributions.\naoj8 | THERMAL EQUILIBRIUM\n1std | Suppose a system has finitely many states I equals one, two, up to N with energies E sub j. If the probability P sub I that it's in the ith state maximizes entropy subject to a constraint on its expected energy:\nm2cm | expectation of E equals sum from I equals one to N of P sub I times E sub I\n2syo | we say it is in thermal equilibrium. In this case P sub I is given by a Boltzmann distribution\ndxsw | P sub I equals\nba75 | greater than\nsod4 | exp of negative E sub I\n2x2r | at least if all the probabilities P sub I are positive.\n4gct | Don't worry: the substance of what I'm saying here is almost the same as in the last box. I'm merely attaching new words to the concepts, to make them sound more like physics:\nuuio | Before I said we had a set of N 'outcomes' numbered one, two, up to N. Now I'm talking about 'states'. If we have a system with N states, it means there are N outcomes when we do a measurement to completely determine which state it's in. A 'state' is some way for a physical system to be that's vague but it's all we can say until we consider some specific kind of system. In classical physics the states form a set, usually infinite but sometimes finite.\ne34x | Before I said we had a 'quantity' A that depends on the outcome, taking the value A sub I in the ith outcome. Now I'm calling this quantity the 'energy' E. Energy is a particularly interesting quantity in physics, so we'll focus on that, without demanding that you know anything about it: for our present purposes, we can take any quantity and dub it 'energy'.\n8w73 | Before I called the Lagrange multiplier. Now I'm calling it Beta, because that's what physicists do in this particular context.\n6ndf | When a system maximizes entropy subject to a constraint on the expected value of its energy, and perhaps also some other quantities, we say the system is in thermal equilibrium. This is meant to suggest that an object just sitting there, not heating up or cooling down, is often best modeled this way.\nx2p2 | You may have noticed the annoying clause \"at least if all the probabilities P sub I are positive\". I only said that because I cannot tell a lie. In Puzzle twenty-four we saw that as Beta goes to infinity, the Boltzmann distribution can converge to a non-Boltzmann probability distribution where some of the probabilities P sub I vanish. This still counts as thermal equilibrium, because it's still maximizing entropy subject to a constraint on expected energy. We'll learn more about this when we study the concept of 'absolute zero'.\nyhgh | COOLNESS\njjti | If a probability distribution P sub I maximizes entropy subject to a constraint on the expected value of the energy E sub j, then\nuw2x | P sub I is proportional to exp of Beta times E sub I\n1rbl | where Beta is the coolness, inversely proportional to temperature. So:\nwr7g | The cooler a system is, the less likely it is to be in a high-energy state!\n```",
