You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

52b2 | A: The answer, simply, is that I am not really 'critical' of it in the way that I think you mean. You must bear three things in mind when you ask this kind of question, or risk nobody ever bothering to answer it at all: -
rvlv | 1. You have to have some facts to back it up, either specifics or general facts, either to support your question or to get a productive reply.
vfsg | 2. You have to realise that the modern world in which we at the moment Uve, is very widely suffused with 'Western culture', and that therefore it is almost impossible to miss it if one is critical about almost anything. It is like say- ing: 'Why do you kill millions of innocent beings - bacteria -everytime you breathe in?' The one may be incidental to the other.
xbmv | 3. This question is being asked, and answered, in a Western country, a part of Western culture, where, because of that culture, agonising self-appraisals, criticism and reproach almost ad in- finitum have been standard behaviour for a considerable period and without which-if you only listen and read what surrounds you - life would perhaps come to a halt.
8dfo | If there is any really good reason for criticising 'Western culture' as such, it is that one should deplore its failure to nurture and maintain not the criticism on which it constantly prides itself, but the clear-thinking which, say, the Greeks - supposedly Westerners -had, and which should have been passed to you, to enable you to answer this question for yourself, thus saving time and effort, and using mental capacity for something a little more ad- vanced.
lz3e | Western people, whatever their ideology, spend much time in the engineering of belief, conviction, commitment - they keep changing the name, but the process is the same. I call it not criti-
y26m | cal, but descriptive, to mention this, and to offer the remedy: in the saying: 'When you are most convinced: that is the rime to use caution about your certainty.'
j0ou | Western culture, like any other culture, could well take to heart this ancient Eastern saying: 'However useful a garment, it is not for eating.'
zk07 | The Western Tradition
0lr7 | Q: Can we have tales and illustrations from the Western tradi- tion which illustrate or make available the kind of knowledge which is so often quoted from the East?
udsn | A: You can certainly have such examples, but the problem is that the understanding of the example has, in the West, generally been trivialised - 'give a dog a bad name and hang it'. There are many jokes and stories in Western literature and folklore which may be employed in the development of wisdom. But the conven- tion has been to write them up as short stories, or to laugh at their funny side'. As a result, people are inoculated against the effect which they could have in provoking insights.
6tgb | Q: Why has this not happened to Eastern literature?
7fxo | A: Because the concept of the 'pearl within the (banal) shell' has been constantly repeated and kept alive. Interestingly enough, the concept has been stressed sufficiently often in the Western trans- lations and repetitions of these stories to insist on this element being maintained as a hypothetical possibility. This insistence that the oyster may contain a pearl, in place of merely selling oysters, as it were, makes it possible for the Western man to look for this content in stories which have an Eastern flavour, when he would not tolerate it in a Western story.
nzpg | Q: Is there a ready example?
kou3 | THE HERO HUSBAND
q8mn | A: Take the tale of the woman who would not marry a man because 'he was not successful'. She said she wanted a hero for a husband. He went to Africa and became a world-famous explorer. When he came back to claim her, she said that she had married in

xtmy | the meantime. He demanded to know who the paragon was who had won her, so that he himself might pay homage to such a man. She confessed: 'He is only the professional at the golf club up the road'. This was made into a wry short story by a Western writer. Its depth, wisdom and sheer power is obscured by the local Western habit of looking only for 'pay-off lines', humour as humour, characterisation, plot, climax, and anti-climax, and so on.
mdfm | In this process, other values of the story have been lost. But if it were put in an Eastern setting, even Western audiences might see something of great instructional value in it. And there are dozens more of this kind.
xjme | Most, but not all, of the word-artefacts formerly current in the West have thus been appropriated by shallow word-smiths or occultists. But some remain, and much more can be retrieved.
zb9k | TALE OF AN EAR
5yws | The materials are often to be found in the West, in encounters, in jokes and tales, in events. But the skill in using them is not there, though it can be developed.
t3fi | One of the basic Sufi needs is to enable people to see themselves as they really are, and to clear away imaginings about what they are or what they think they are doing. Here is a Western anecdote, good enough for a Sufi demonstration-tale:
dyg0 | A man went to the Van Gogh exhibition in New York. The place was so jammed with people that he could not get near the pictures. He went away and carved an ear from corned beef, then framed it and returned to hang it on the exhibition wall marked: 'Ear of Van Gogh'.
3n0b | The crowds surrounded this object, thus allowing the true art- lover to see the paintings, and showing that they were themselves there only for sensation.
46bq | In a Sufi context, this tale would have been used both to point out the difference between aesthetics and emotion and also for the participants to see themselves as they really were.
tocx | In the West, however, such tales are usually employed only as jokes: enabling the hearer to feel amused, and perhaps relieved,
07f7 | that he was not there; or superior because others had been 'de- ceived' successfully.
3cv9 | It is interesting to reflect that, while the Westerner wants to know if there are traditions in his own history which will help him, the Easterner will tend to want to know whether the material will help him, wherever it comes from.
xa2i | I am reminded of the old saying: The child remarks, 'That hawk is white', while the adult asks 'How sharp are its talons?'
xj8o | And I hope that we do not forget, while we are on this subject, that most of the most prized traditions in the West are derived, and not without pride, from the Middle East, and especially the Eastern Mediterranean ...
gk3j | How does the Sufi Teach?
8vzd | Q: Sufis do not teach by 'stereotypes', as you often say. How does the Sufi teach?
6588 | A: The Sufi teacher has the task of communicating his message and reality. He has to reduce, not increase, the effect of his own personality, in favour of content.
1ms8 | A test of the suitability of a student is to find out whether he can set aside the fixation upon a technique, person or school - and make himself open to receive a comprehensive teaching.
b1vx | The Sufi teacher's mission is to be in the service of those who can learn. He does not exist to please or to displease anyone. To accord with the preconceptions of others as to appearances is irrelevant to his functions: though not necessarily, as Ibn Arabi reminds us, to his social viability.
4i6r | He works in accordance with the prospects of his students and the possibility of maintaining the continuation of the community of Sufis.
a3i4 | He does not hand out formulas nor does he insist upon the performance of mechanical procedures. His knowledge, on the contrary, makes it possible for him to prescribe apposite studies for suitable people, at an indicated time, in the proper place.
