        "content": "1mvw | Particulate MMO. Mechanistic studies of pMMO are far behind those of sMMO, due to ongoing difficulties isolating highly active purified enzyme and uncertainty as to the atomic details of the active site. Density functional theory and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics studies suggest that a monocopper copper two oxo species or a di mu-oxo copper two copper two species could oxidize methane and that formation of the dicopper species is more favorable. Calculations using a dicopper active site model suggest that either a mu-n-one colon n-two-peroxo copper two copper two or mu-n-two colon n-two-peroxo copper two copper two species is formed first and then is transformed into the more reactive di-mu-oxo copper two copper two species after O-O bond cleavage.\n6d4s | In later studies, a mu-oxo mu-hydroxo copper two copper three center was proposed to be the active species and was calculated to be more reactive toward methane than a di mu-oxo copper two copper three species. Formation of this mu-oxo mu-hydroxo copper two copper three species is proposed to be facilitated by proton transfer involving residues Tyr three seventy-four and Glu thirty-five in the second coordination sphere of the dicopper center. It is important to note that these intermediates have been calculated based on the moderate resolution crystal structures of pMMO and have not been detected experimentally. Related to these ideas are recent studies of the zeolite Cu-ZSM-five, which can oxidize methane to methanol. Spectroscopic studies and DFT calculations show that the zeolite active species is a mono mu- oxo copper two copper two core formed from a mu-n-two colon n-two-peroxo copper two copper two intermediate. Although pMMO and the zeolite are fundamentally different, this work does suggest that it may be feasible to oxidize methane in an enzyme with a dicopper site.\nmqah | One putative oxygen intermediate has been detected experimentally for pMMO. When reduced pMMO is reacted with hydrogen peroxide or reduced spmoB is reacted with oxygen or hydrogen peroxide, a new species with an absorbance feature at three forty-five nanometers is formed. The energy and intensity of this feature are consistent with a mu-n-two colon n-two-peroxo copper two copper two species like those formed in oxy-\nxxr8 | Current Topic\nrl4j | hemocyanin and oxytyrosinase, a met copper two copper two species like that in methemocyanin, or a hydroxo-bridged copper two copper two center like that in the type three copper centers of multicopper oxidases. Because of the instability of spmoB and heme contaminants present in pMMO, further studies of this species by resonance Raman spectroscopy have not been conducted. Importantly, this intermediate does not form in variants of spmoB in which the ligands to the dicopper center have been mutated, consistent with oxygen binding at the proposed active site. In addition, this species disappears in the presence of methane, and some methanol product is detected, indicating that it may be a relevant intermediate during methane oxidation. The identity of the actual species that reacts with methane, the pMMO equivalent to Q, remains unclear. Several studies using chiral alkanes suggest that carbon-hydrogen bond activation by this unknown species proceeds via a concerted, nonradical mechanism.\nvz32 | CONCLUSIONS\nncb0 | The two methane-oxidizing enzymes in nature, sMMO and pMMO, are completely different. The sMMO hydroxylase component, MMOH, is a soluble alpha two beta two gamma two dimer, whereas pMMO is an alpha three beta three gamma three trimer with both membrane-bound and periplasmic regions. The active site of sMMO is a well- characterized diiron center, but the atomic structure of the pMMO copper active site remains unclear. Similarly, the structural basis for substrate and product access to the sMMO active site has been partially elucidated but is not well-defined for pMMO. Both MMOs oxidize a range of hydrocarbon substrates, but pMMO has a narrower substrate specificity. sMMO exhibits higher turnover numbers than pMMO both in cells and in isolated enzyme preparations, but neither enzyme achieves levels desirable for biological gas-to-liquid conversion processes. The delivery of electrons to the sMMO active site in MMOH and the roles of MMOB and MMOR are reasonably well understood on the molecular level, although some aspects remain controversial. By contrast, the source of electrons for pMMO is still under debate, and possible protein interaction partners such as MDH require further investigation. The catalytic cycle of sMMO has been mapped out, and the intermediate that breaks the methane carbon-hydrogen bond, Q, has been characterized. Although mechanistic possibilities for pMMO have been considered, its mechanism cannot be further elucidated until lingering questions about the active site are resolved. Despite all these differences, the two systems share the unique ability to oxidize methane, and it is remarkable that nature has evolved two distinct large enzyme complexes for oxidation of a small gaseous substrate. Further study of how each MMO orchestrates the delivery of methane, oxygen, protons, and electrons to the active site, and how the oxygen-oxygen and carbon-hydrogen bonds are broken is essential to understanding these enzymes, their roles in the environment, and their potential biotechnological applications.\n8mp0 | Funding\nxjyk | Biochemistry\nmt0f | ABBREVIATIONS\nawab | Current Topic\nixcc | Biochemistry\n8p6h | Current Topic\npmgl | Biochemistry\n90no | Current Topic\njt0y | domains of the reductase component of soluble methane mono-oxygenase from Methylococcus capsulatus.
