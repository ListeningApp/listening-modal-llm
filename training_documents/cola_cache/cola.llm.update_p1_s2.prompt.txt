You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021.

yeoh | CARBONATED BEVERAGES AFFECT LEVELS OF ANDROGEN RECEPTOR AND TESTOSTERONE SECRETION IN MICE
b8hf | Objectives. This work aimed to study the influences of carbonated beverages (CBs) on the testis growth and the expression levels of androgen receptor (AR) of mice.
hntf | Methods. Two experimental groups of 30 mice each PEP-1 and PEP-2 drank 50% and 100% Pepsi-Cola, respectively for 15 days. Other 2 experimental groups of 30 mice each COC-1 and COC-2 drank 50% and 100% Coca- Cola, respectively for 15 days. The control group (CG) of 30 mice drank water. Bilateral testes were harvested aseptically on days 0, 5, 7, 10, 13 and 15. Real-time PCR and Western blot were implemented to detect levels of androgen receptor (AR) mRNA and protein in testis tissues.
99fo | Results. Testes masses of PEP-2, COC-1 and COC-2 were greater than those of PEP-1 and CG (P < 0.05). On day 15, testis longitudinal diameter (TLD) of CBs-treated mice was increased as compared to CG. TLD, testes transverse diameters (TTD) and AR proteins levels of PEP-2 and COC-2 were increased in comparison with CG (P<0.05). Serum testosterone concentrations of PEP-2 were higher than that of COC-1 and CG (P < 0.05). Levels of AR mRNAs of four CBs-treated mice were increased by 60.18%, 67.26%, 65.93% and 78.76%.
y5r7 | Conclusions. A high concentration of Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola could raise TLD and TDD, enhance testosterone secretion, and increase serum EGF concentrations.

hvhm | INTRODUCTION
863b | Coca-Cola (Coke) and Pepsi-Cola are two main carbonated beverages (CBs) drunk by numerous consumers over the world. CBs consumption may lead to obesity, cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes mellitus (1). CBs increased weight body of rats after consuming over one year (2). Epidemiologic studies evaluated the association between caffeine and fertility (3), which indicated that health damage effects of CBs on adolescents and children

uz3c | were serious. Previous studies also suggested that CBs affected fertility (4). Massive consumption of coffee or caffeine increased testosterone production (5). Coca-Cola could induce incidence of malignant mammary tumors in Sprague-Dawley rat (6). However, many reports were questionnaire and prospective investigations based on the local populations in a region. Some reports even showed the opposite (7). So far there has been little documentation regarding correlation between CBs consumption and reproduction function and fertility in humans and animals (8). CBs have been associated with alterations in estradiol and other hormones which may affect ovulation, the length of the follicular or luteal phase (9). The exact mechanisms that carbonated beverages affected the fertility are undetermined. Comparative experimental studies are scanty (6, 10).
d5bi | Our preliminary study showed that administration of Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola for 25 days could decrease ovaries mass, reduce the ovarian cortex thickness, as well as affect follicles development (11). Besides, cola and Pepsi-Cola could inhibit burn repair and physics strength of the healed tissues of the burned rabbits (12). Therefore, drinking carbonated beverages may threaten reproductive success (13).
ba4l | Androgens play an important role in sexual differentiation and secondary characteristics formation of the male mammals. Androgen exerts its physiological functions by combining its specific androgen receptor (AR) in target tissues (14). Testosterone, a crucial androgen, has an important role on forming puberty and maintain normal male libido. Currently, it remains undetermined whether long-term intake of CBs influences the synthesis and secretion of testosterone (15).
ffx8 | The present study aimed to investigate the effects of carbonated beverages (CBs, including Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola) on the testis development and expression levels of androgen receptor (AR) of mice, and also to

06ht | MATERIALS AND METHODS
v3r2 | Animals
nv42 | 150 non-copulating male mice (Mus musculus), body weight of 20.84 ± 2.45g, were bought from Lanzhou University [License No. SCXK (Gansu) 2005- 0007]. They were allocated into 5 groups: Pepsi-Cola 1 (PEP-1), Pepsi-Cola 2 (PEP-2), Coca-Cola 1 (COC-1), Coca-Cola 2 (COC-2) and the control group (CG, n=30). Mice were raised in mice cages that were equipped with automatic water dispensers under the same conditions kept at 30% to 50% humidity and 22℃-24℃. Water was provided ad libitum. Mice were freely fed with daily ration feeds (Lanzhou Taihua Feed Co., China). Each mouse was weighed every day. The experiment was begun after an adaptation period of 7 days.
xags | Animal treatments and sample collection
jc47 | Pure Pepsi-Cola and Coca-Cola were purchased from the monopolized store; 50% Pepsi-Cola (Coca-Cola) was prepared by releasing one liter (1 L) of pure Coca- Cola (Pepsi-Cola) with 1 liter of tap water (1:1 v/v). Mice in PEP-1 and PEP-2 drank freely 50% and pure (100%) Pepsi-Cola, respectively for consecutive 15 days. Animals in COC-1 and COC-2 drank freely 50% and pure (100%) Coca-Cola, respectively for consecutive 15 days. Mice in the control group (CG) drank freely tap water. Bilateral testes were aseptically collected from each mouse on days 0, 5, 7, 10 and 15, respectively. Blood was harvested from the jugular vein of each mouse killed by neck dislocation. Serum was isolated from blood by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 10 min, and then stored at -20℃ until analysis. Animal treatment was permitted by the Experiment Animal Care and Use Committee of Gansu province, China.
ko3c | Measurements of testis mass, testis longitudinal and transverse diameter
xek3 | The mass of each testis was measured using an electronic balance. The average was determined on the basis of both left and right values. The extraneous tissues and fats on the testis surface were removed using sterile scissors. The testis longitudinal diameter (TLD) and testis transverse diameter (TTD) of each testis were accurately measured with a vernier caliper.
bbpr | Measurements of serum testosterone and epidermal growth factor (EGF)
5zyf | The contents of serum testosterone and EGF
9own | were measured using the mice ELISA kit (Shanghai Qiaodu Biological Technology Co., Ltd, Shanghai, China), as per instruction manual (Qiaodu biotechnology corporation, Shanghai, China). The detection level was 0.40pg/mL. Each assay was done in triplicate.
bqfb | Determination of expression levels of AR mRNA
wwdt | Total RNAs were extracted from the testis samples (16), then reversely transcribed into cDNA with the superscriptTM first strand synthesis system for RT- PCR (Invitrogen, Beijing, China).
mn1r | Appropriate primers of the androgen receptor (AR, GenBank No: X59592.1) were designed and synthesized by Sangon Biotech Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Only those primers showing dimmer-free reactions were used for further analysis.
