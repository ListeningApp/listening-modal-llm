Engel's thesis is that the loss of a loved one is psychologically traumatic to the same extent that being severely wounded or burned is physiologically traumatic. He argues that grief represents a departure from the state of health and well-being, and just as healing is necessary in the physiological realm in order to bring the body back into homeostatic balance, a period of time is likewise needed to return the mourner to a similar state of psychological equilibrium. Therefore, Engel sees the process of mourning as similar to the process of healing. As with healing, full function, or nearly full function, can be restored, but there are also incidents of impaired function and inadequate healing. Just as the terms healthy and pathological apply to the various courses in the physiological healing process, Engel argues that these same terms may be applied to the courses taken by the mourning process. He sees mourning as a course that takes time until restoration of function can take place. How much functional impairment occurs is a matter of degree. Rather than using terms like restoration and recovery, I prefer to use the term adaptation: some people make a better adaptation to the loss while others make a less good adaptation. In Chapter five, we look at complicated mourning, where individuals are making a less than adequate adaptation to the loss.\nnsm3 | Before we look at the characteristics of normal grief, it would be useful to look at three terms that are often used interchangeably: grief, mourning, and bereavement. For purposes of common understanding, in this book I am using the term grief to indicate the experience of one who has lost a loved one to death. It is comprised of thoughts, feelings, behaviors, and physiological changes that vary in pattern and intensity over time. The term grief can be applied to other losses, but in this book, it primarily addresses losses due to death. Mourning is the term applied to the process that one goes through in adapting to the death of the person. The finality and consequences of the loss are understood and assimilated into the life of the mourner. Bereavement defines the loss to which the person is trying to adapt and the experience of having lost someone close.\njdfw | NORMAL GRIEF\nuc9r | Normal grief, also referred to as uncomplicated grief, encompasses a broad range of feelings, cognitions, physical sensations, and behavioral\nl0ap | One Attachment, Loss, and the Experience of Grief\nx815 | changes that are common after a loss. One of the earliest attempts to look at normal grief reactions in any systematic way was done by Erich Lindemann when he was chief of psychiatry at the Massachusetts General Hospital.\nepbj | In the Boston area, there are two Catholic colleges well known for their football rivalry. Back in the fall of nineteen forty-two, they met for one of their traditional Saturday encounters. Holy Cross beat Boston College, and after the game many people went to Cocoanut Grove, a local nightclub, to celebrate. During the revelries, a busboy lit a match while trying to change a lightbulb and accidentally set a decorative palm tree on fire. Almost immediately, the whole nightclub, which was packed beyond its legal capacity, was engulfed in flames. Nearly five hundred people lost their lives in that tragedy.\nnmn2 | Afterward, Lindemann and his colleagues worked with the family members who had lost loved ones in that tragedy, and from these data and others he wrote his classic paper \"Symptomatology and Management of Acute Grief\". From his observations of one hundred one recently bereaved patients he discovered similar patterns, which he described as the pathognomonic characteristics of normal or acute grief:\ng3tm | One. Somatic or bodily distress of some type\ntfra | Two. Preoccupation with the image of the deceased\n5lm9 | Three. Guilt relating to the deceased or circumstances of the death\nwp2c | Four. Hostile reactions\nus5v | Five. The inability to function as one had before the loss\nrs2m | In addition to these five, he described a sixth characteristic exhibited by many patients: they appeared to develop traits of the deceased in their own behavior.\nuz9y | There are many limitations to Lindemann's study. Some of these have been outlined by Parkes, who points out that Lindemann does not present figures to show the relative frequency of the syndromes described. Lindemann also neglects to mention how many interviews he had with the patients, and how much time had passed between the interviews and the date of the loss. Nevertheless, this remains an important and much cited study.\n8ov0 | I am using the word normal in both a clinical and a statistical sense. Clinical defines what the clinician calls normal mourning behavior, while statistical refers to the frequency with which such behavior is found among a randomized bereaved population. The more frequent the behavior, the more it is defined as normal.\nmj9m | What is of particular interest to me is that the bereaved we see today at the Massachusetts General Hospital exhibit behaviors very similar to those described by Lindemann more than seventy years ago. In a large number of people undergoing an acute grief reaction, we find some or most of the following phenomena. Because the list of normal grief behaviors is so extensive and varied, I have placed them under four general categories: feelings, physical sensations, cognitions, and behaviors. Anyone counseling the bereaved needs to be familiar with the broad range of behaviors that falls under the description of normal grief.\n94h3 | Feelings\n9jx1 | Sadness\nc3lz | Sadness is the most common feeling found in the bereaved and really needs little comment. This feeling is not necessarily manifested by crying behavior, but often it is. Parkes and Weiss conjecture that crying is a signal that evokes a sympathetic and protective reaction from others and establishes a social situation in which the normal laws of competitive behavior are suspended. Some mourners have a fear of sadness, especially the fear of its intensity. It is not uncommon to hear a person say, \"I lost it at the funeral.\" Still others try to block sadness through excessive activity only to discover that the sadness comes out at night. Not allowing the sadness to be experienced, with or without tears, can frequently lead to complicated mourning.\n8bwk | Anger\nez9s | Anger is frequently experienced after a loss. It can be one of the most confusing feelings for the survivor and as such is at the root of many problems in the grieving process. A woman whose husband died of cancer said to me, \"How can I be angry? He didn't want to die.\" The truth is that she was angry at him for dying and leaving her. If the anger is not adequately acknowledged, it can lead to complicated mourning.\nmqot | This anger comes from two sources: from a sense of frustration that there was nothing one could do to prevent the death, and from a kind of regressive experience that occurs after the loss of someone close. You may have had this type of regressive experience when you were a very young child on a shopping trip with your mother. You were in a department store and suddenly you looked up to find that she had disappeared. You\noc99 | One Attachment, Loss, and the Experience of Grief\n```",
