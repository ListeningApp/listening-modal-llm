        "content": "7um8 | Effect of Noble Gas Properties. Since the time when it was first discovered by Prudhomme and Guilmart, a number of papers were devoted to the studies of the noble gas properties on the yield of hydrogen peroxide and sonoluminescence. A principal conclusion has been made by Hickling and was confirmed by others researchers, that the major reason of the increase of SL and the yield of hydrogen peroxide is the decrease of thermal conductivity of a gas in the order of noble gases helium, neon, argon, krypton, xenon. As a result of this, the temperature inside almost adiabatically collapsing cavitation bubble increases in the same order.\nuow2 | The solubility of a gas can also have an influence on SL and on the yield of hydrogen peroxide. Actually, the increase of a gas solubility in the order from helium to xenon is accompanied by the growth of the number of emitting light bubbles and, thus, by the increase of SL and the yield of hydrogen peroxide.\niat7 | However, this cannot explain the changes in SL spectra and in the OH star over OH ratio in the order of noble gases. Following the scheme of equation fifteen, these changes can be the result of SL quenching as a consequence of different vapor/gas ratio inside the cavitation bubble filled by different noble gas. Actually, the increase of gas solubility from helium to xenon promotes the process of a gas diffusion into the bubble as it expands, but the diffusivity of noble gases decreases in the same direction and seems to offset the growth of the bubble. Studying SL from a single nonlinearly pulsating cavitation bubble, the authors found the variation of the SL intensity with time. This can be due to the processes of the gas diffusion inside and outside the bubble. In a cavitation field the processes of rectified diffusion are complicated by the translational motion and coagulation of bubbles. Thus, the effects of a gas solubility on the vapor/gas ratio inside the cavitation bubble need more detailed experimental and theoretical examinations.\nywwr | The changes of thermal conductivity of gas can also change the vapor/gas ratio inside the bubble. In the stage of a bubble expansion the temperature of liquid-gas interface decreases because of the evaporation of water into the bubble. Thermal diffusivity of the gas contained inside the bubble corrects this deviation from the bulk solution temperature. So, the temperature on the bubble wall adjacent to the gas phase and the vapor pressure inside the bubble will be higher in the case of the gas with higher thermal diffusivity; that is, it will grow in the order from xenon to helium. However, the temperature drop on the bubble-liquid interface is small and becomes significant only at high enough temperatures of a bulk solution. Actually, thermal processes occur at the bubble growth in dynamics, when crispation appears on a bubble surface and the diffusion of a gas inside the bubble can influence the rate of evaporation. Thus,\n0i6j | Didenko and Pugach\n87cq | from this point of view we cannot make any definite conclusion about the vapor-gas ratio inside the bubble at the stage of its expansion.\n0qs3 | Thermal conductivity of a gas plays a significant role in the vapor/gas ratio also at the time of the bubble collapse: the higher the thermal conductivity, the smaller the radius and the higher the pressure inside the bubble. Assume that the vapor pressure inside the bubble at the stage of its maximal size is equal for all noble gases, filling the bubble, then at the stage of the minimal bubble size the vapor pressure will increase in the order xenon, krypton, argon, helium-filled vapor-gas cavitation bubble.\nz8f7 | Thus, the solubility and the thermal conductivity of noble gas can, in principle, influence the gas/vapor ratio inside the cavitation bubble. However, it is difficult to estimate the significance of these effects at this time.\n7w7j | The results obtained in this work can be simply explained by assuming that the temperature inside cavitation bubbles increases in the order helium, argon, krypton, xenon following the decrease in thermal conductivity. Thus, the yields of SL and hydrogen peroxide also increase in the same order.\n51vd | The temperature inside the helium-containing bubble is not high enough to produce the large quantity of water molecules in the wacht state, and the A and B states are generally formed. The dissociation of these states is accompanied basically by OH radical formation in a quiescent electronic state (reactions two, three a, and three c). The number of water molecules in the B state is lower than in the A state so the ratio of OH star, OH is small, zero point twenty six.\nbaj1 | The growth of temperature inside the bubble promotes the number of water molecules in B and wacht states. As a result, the ratio of OH star, OH and the short-wave part of the spectra of A less than two hundred seventy nanometers increase in the order helium, argon, krypton, xenon.\nn1wo | Conclusions\n5bq3 | Sonoluminescence originates from the thermal heating of the cavitation bubble content at the final stage of its compression. The unexpectedly high velocity of the SL decay cannot be explained by thermal losses. Besides that SL is over before the minimum size of a bubble is achieved, but following to thermal theory the temperature inside the bubble must be maximal at that moment. Thus, SL is not a blackbody radiation and is a form of luminescence. The concentration of excited particles inside the bubble is small, but the density of its content is high, so the processes of luminescence quenching can be very effective and they determine the SL time dependence.\nezla | The obtained experimental results can be easily explained by the decrease of thermal conductivity and, consequently, by the increase of temperature inside collapsing cavitation bubble in the order of noble gases from helium to xenon. Correspondingly, the number of water molecules excited on higher electronic states also increases. Thus, the SL intensity, the yield of hydrogen peroxide, and the OH star OH ratio increase in the same order.\nrsbu | It is difficult to estimate quantitatively the processes inside the bubble as the temperature calculations at high amplitude of the bubble pulsations are complicated. In addition, the conditions inside the collapsing cavitation bubble are very peculiar to use directly the results from other fields of physics and chemistry. In this paper an attempt to describe the mechanism of SL was made, which could explain qualitatively the main points of the observed phenomena.\nmagd | Spectra of Water Sonoluminescence",
