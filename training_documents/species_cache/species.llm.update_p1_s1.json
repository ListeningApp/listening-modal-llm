We argue that it is important to distinguish the range dynamics of such species from those that occur without, or with less clear, involvement of human-induced environmental changes. We elucidate the salient features of the rapid increase in the number of species whose range dynamics are human induced, and review the relationships and differences to both natural range expansion and biological invasions. We discuss the consequences for science, policy and management in an era of rapid global change and highlight four key challenges relating to basic gaps in knowledge, and the transfer of scientific understanding to biodiversity management and policy. We conclude that range-expanding species responding to human-induced environmental change will become an essential feature for biodiversity management and science in the Anthropocene. Finally, we propose the term neonative for these taxa.\nvbni | Widely accepted definitions of the nativeness of species-or, more generally, of taxa-are based on a dichotomous classification (i.e., native, meaning indigenous, and alien, meaning nonnative, exotic, nonindigenous). Native taxa are those that have arisen through evolution in a region or have colonized a region by their own means of dispersal. Alien taxa are those that have been transported by specific human agency-that is, the anthropogenic movement of propagules or parent organisms, respectively, or the dispersal through human-constructed corridors, such as canals-into regions that could not be reached (or could only be reached in very rare cases) by natural dispersal. \ndgcw | Despite considerable debate, the basic principles on how native and alien species should be classified have become widely accepted in science and environmental policy. However, there is ongoing debate on how this dichotomy should be applied in practice, because of the multitude of situations in\ngvwz | which human agency may be involved in range expansion and because of the paucity or uncertainties of available taxonomic and biogeographic data. Less attention has been paid to situations in which range expansion is the result of human modifications of the environment that have led to changes in the distribution of suitable environmental space, allowing a species to disperse naturally to and establish in new areas previously not colonized. The only example we are aware of that systematically distinguished between natural and anthropogenic occurrences-in this case, of vascular plant species-is the New Atlas of British and Irish Flora.\nsk5m | Human activities increasingly cause environmental perturbations, such as climate change, land-use change, over-harvesting, eutrophication, and pollution. The resulting changes in biophysical attributes of the environment affect the distribution of species in different ways. Many species experience population declines or local extinction that result in shrinking ranges or even global extinction. Other species track the shifting environmental conditions by colonizing new\nqws8 | geographical space, at widely varying rates, and there are many species that react differently to human-induced environmental change in different parts of their ranges. The phenomenon of geographic range expansion is becoming increasingly frequent, the velocity of range expansion is often increasing, and ongoing rapid environmental change will doubtlessly amplify these processes in the future. For instance, recent range expansion into higher latitudes and altitudes have frequently been documented as a consequence of anthropogenic climate change, in particular for mobile species.\n877u | This situation is blurring the distinction between native and alien species and has fuelled debate on how to classify taxa that respond to human-induced environmental changes by expanding their ranges without any specific human assistance into new regions that are often adjacent to their native range. Some authors have suggested that such taxa should be considered as native. Others, while agreeing partly with this view, have proposed that alien status may be applied if there is a strong indirect human contribution that is a prerequisite for such autonomous range expansion. Finally, some authors have suggested that all such species should be considered as aliens, because of the underlying indirect human agency and because their range expansion is clearly attributable to human-caused environmental changes or, at least, cannot be considered native using the current definitions. The classification of such range-expanding species as native or alien has important ramifications for environmental legislation and biodiversity management. This is because, although both groups can cause major effects on communities and ecosystems, they often carry different obligations for responsible authorities.\nrzhj | We argue that there can be substantial differences regarding the spread dynamics and characteristics, as well as the impacts caused, between taxa that are naturally expanding their range solely because of anthropogenic environmental change, native species that have been present in a region since historic times, and alien species that have been directly introduced by humans from another region. The increasing frequency of naturally range-expanding taxa, and the unclear situation in management and regulations warrants recognizing these species as a special category. In the present article, we elucidate the salient features of the rapid increase in the number of range-expanding species, review the relationships and differences between resident native and alien\nbfax | Forum\nf2y8 | species, and discuss the consequences for science, policy, and management of expanding taxa in an era of rapid global change. Finally, we consider the pros and cons of introducing a new term (neonative) for range-expanding species that track human-induced environmental change.\no7qm | The temporal dimension of human-induced environmental changes\n```",
