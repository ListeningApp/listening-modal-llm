For a surface-attached molecule, it is reasonable to assume that the electronic coupling is approximately the same if the ligands are the same for the reactant species. Therefore, we will assume that k sub max, ET two equals k sub max, EPT one equals k sub max, EPT two because the ligand is OH for the reactant in each of the three channels (Figure three).\nbgre | For electrochemical systems, the apparent P K a of a surface-attached molecule has been reported to depend on an applied potential. When the potential becomes more negative, the negative charge accumulating on the electrode surface will disfavor deprotonation of the attached catalyst. This potential-\n57lp | Article\nukth | dependent behavior has been observed in experiments on metal surfaces and described in terms of an increase of approximately zero point ten P K a unit per fifty-nine millivolts of potential decrease. I T O, a degenerate semiconductor, is expected to exhibit similar behavior due to its metal-like conductivity and carrier density (approximately ten to the twenty centimeters to the negative third power). For the I T O-Ru system, the P K a, O x is measured to be one point two at one point one volts versus N H E, and the apparent rate constant reaches its maximum value in the range of negative zero point one to positive zero point one volts versus N H E for P H of one, three, or five (symbols in Figure five a). To reproduce the experimental data with our model, we used a slope of a equals zero point twelve P K a unit per fifty-nine millivolts of potential decrease, similar to previous findings. Thus, the potential dependence of P K a, O x was modeled as\nkpvt | P K a , O x left E right equals negative zero point twelve times the fraction of E minus one point one volts over zero point zero five nine volts plus one point two.\njie2 | Note that this potential dependence on I T O has not been experimentally verified. Anchoring a Ru second power water oxidation catalyst with a P H-sensitive visible absorption spectrum to the surface and monitoring its spectral behavior with an applied potential could provide useful insights. We also investigated models where P K a, O x is independent of the potential E and found that such models could only reproduce the experimental data at higher P E to the H power, such as P H equals five, but not for the entire P H range (Figure S five). For the I T O-Ru system, P K a, Red cannot be measured for the attached complex due to the instability of the phosphonate anchoring group at P H greater than five. We also used equation thirteen to describe the potential dependence of P K a, Red with a value of eight point two at one point one volts, which will give a value of approximately nine point two at E sub ET two superscript o to be consistent with the Pourbaix diagram of the free complex in solution. We found that the results using a higher value could not reproduce the results at P H equals five.\nd0ik | This potential-dependent apparent P K a of the surface-attached species can also be viewed in terms of a potential-dependent work term due to bringing a proton to the interfacial region. A similar work term is necessary for the ET steps for the same physical reason and to ensure that the overall free energy of the PCET process is independent of path. Therefore, this work term was added to all of the ET and PT steps. Including these work terms for the diagonal steps does not alter the results because they effectively cancel. These work terms are effectively accounting for nonideal behavior at the interface. The impact of the potential dependence of",
