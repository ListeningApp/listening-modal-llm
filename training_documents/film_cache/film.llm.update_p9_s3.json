        "content": "ap6l | You might begin discussing feminism by asking your students how many of them are comfortable being identified with the 'feminist' label. The opposite of feminism is male sexism. Sexism is discrimination on the basis of sex, especially the oppression of women by men. Sexism may also mean the oppression of men by women, though this use of the word is relatively uncommon. Being a feminist simply means being against male sexism. It seems rather odd, then, that the word has come to carry negative associations.\niest | As feminist Tom Digby has noted, while there are important differences between sexism and racism, I could not help wondering why, if antiracists aren't presumed to hate whites as a group, why should antisexists be presumed to hate men as a group? One has to wonder whether the demonising of 'feminism' is symptomatic of male sexism within academic and media institutions. If not, then how did feminism come to be so misrepresented? In assessing the claim that feminists hate men, Digby says:\ncox8 | Considering the absence of supporting evidence or argument, it is hard to take the substance of the assertion that feminists hate men seriously; nonetheless, because it has been such a weapon of choice among anti-feminist polemicists, its rhetorical context is worth examining.\nppqi | Firstly, the idea that feminism is an exclusively female movement is a gross misrepresentation. Not all females are feminists and not all feminists are female. Some of the key feminists have been men. Nor is it true that all male sexism is perpetrated by men. Scores of women collude in the oppression of women by men. Many women have contributed to public perceptions that feminism is a marginal and unnecessary 'man-hating' doctrine. It is crucial to be clear from the start that, just as not all females are feminists, not all feminists are female. And just as not all males are sexist, not all sexists are male.\noxou | Feminist film studies, or 'gendered film studies', is intended to explore the ways in which women (and men) are represented by visual media, and film in particular. When we speak of film as a medium of representation we mean that it does not merely record reality, but constructs an image of reality through the use of codes, myths, conventions and signs. Media re-presents information to its audience, who are encouraged to see its output as a 'window on the world'. This is misleading, as\n495n | STUDYING FEMINIST FILM THEORY\nawri | the process of representing information is highly selective.\nbl28 | Feminists argue that media representations of gender perpetuate and reinforce the values of patriarchal society. Men tend to be cast in strong, active roles while women are shown as passive and merely 'pretty'. Film, like any discursive medium, generates meaning on two levels. The explicit message or interpretation is that which is consciously intended. For example, John Singleton, in describing his film Boyz n the Hood nineteen ninety-one said, 'My main message is that African American men need to take more responsibility for raising their children, especially boys.'\nd5bz | A film's implicit meanings are less stable, and may involve contested interpretations that go beyond the intention of the film-maker. For example, many critics and commentators see the film noir movies of the nineteen forties as evidence of a movement within American social history and culture. More specifically, they see film noir as a reflection of post-war feelings of disillusionment and despair. They describe the 'femme fatale' as a masculine construction of femininity at a time when the social place of women was being challenged by the women who had gone to work outside the home during the war. Similarly, the social ideology of the typical Western constructs a positive image of the white population as the custodians of 'progress' and 'civility' while representing the indigenous Native American culture as 'savage' or 'primitive'. These meanings are not literally written into the script, but they can be read out of its subtext. The subtext refers to the unstated message conveyed through the form of a book, film or picture.\nap5o | Sexuality has to do with anatomical differences between women and men. Most of us are born with a determined set of reproductive organs (penis and testes, or ovaries and vagina), although a fraction of the population are born with both male and female genitalia. In any case, whether male, female or intersex, an individual's sex is a given. It is something with which we are born. Sexuality may, however, be changed through surgical procedures. Gender, by contrast, refers to those socially constructed ideas about 'boys' and 'girls', and the ways in which society perceives the differences between the sexes. We could almost say that 'sex' refers to what's between our legs while 'gender' refers to what is between our ears. Gender refers to the set of beliefs about characteristically 'masculine' and 'feminine' behaviours, traits, mannerisms and attitudes.\n7zvf | Gendered film studies looks at the social purpose(s) of our stories and myths. Ideas and images of 'the masculine' or 'the feminine' are social constructions, and so we must attend to them as such, and ask who is creating these images. Whom do they benefit? Language is not a neutral medium of communication. Discourse and language is the medium through which social power relations between different groups are reinforced or re-negotiated. We need to ask what kind of world the film constructs and whose values and ideas are being expressed through it. Do the film's representations challenge or affirm our own experiences of the world? Do\nmov9 | STUDYING FILMS\nks7m | they construct a world of appearances that does not reflect our experiences? What purpose do the film's representations serve? Whose interests are best served by it? The key here is to remember that films (and other media) do not merely record the world as it is. They construct an image of the world, a mediated version of the world.\nw1w1 | Following theorists such as Sarah Gilligan, it should be fairly clear that women have historically functioned within mainstream cinema as the following:\nh8gv | Girlfriend.\nkwkp | Damsel in distress.\nyj0m | Angelic mother.\newfp | Whore.\noczy | Sexual object.\n2ttg | Erotic distraction.\nhis3 | Femme fatale or monster.\nm50z | Castrating mother.",
