You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

0i1k | each worker, which has two basic scheduling units (i.e., <LATEX>\left. K = 2 \right) .</LATEX> We propose three methods to concatenate multiple basic units. (1) Direct concatenation, as shown in Figure 7(b). The bubbles at the end of the first basic unit can be occupied by the forward passes at the beginning of the second basic unit. If the backward pass has the same workload as the forward pass, basic units can be concatenated seamlessly. However, backward pass has about two times workload of the forward pass, which results in intermediate bubbles.
dqlg | To remove the intermediate bubbles of direct concatenation, we propose (2) forward doubling (shown in Figure 7(d)) and (3) back- ward halving, in which the key idea is to equalize the workloads of forward and backward passes. In forward doubling, we increase the number of micro-batches for each forward pass to two, and then

zse6 | of the pipeline, as shown in Figure 7(d). Forward doubling removes the intermediate bubbles, but it leads to two times activation mem- ory consumption and therefore may exceed the device memory capacity. We resort to activation recomputation to reduce memory overhead. Note that recomputation increases the workload of the backward pass, but the p2p communication overhead in the forward passes is also doubled because of the outputs for two micro-batches; therefore, we still treat the forward pass (with two micro-batches) and the backward pass (with one micro-batch and recompute) have approximately equal workload. Forward doubling prefers large mod- els in which even <LATEX>B = 1</LATEX> exceeds the device memory capacity, since in such case activation recomputation must be used. For smaller models which has a larger <LATEX>B ,</LATEX> we propose to use backward halving, which uses the same schedule as forward doubling, except that rather than executing two micro-batches in the forward pass but to halve the micro-batch size of the backward pass. Backward halving does not increase the activation memory (thus no activation recom- putation), but it may lower the computational using a sub-max B. To select the best of the <LATEX>\begin{array}{} \text { d efficiency because of } \\ \text { inree methods is not a } \end{array}</LATEX> priori, which we rely on empirical results. Note that both forward doubling and backward halving have total <LATEX>D - 2</LATEX> bubbles (D/2-1 in the forward passes and D/2-1 in the backward passes), as shown in Figure 7(d), which is about a 50% reduction compared with DAPPLE and GPipe. For <LATEX>K > 2 ,</LATEX> we use the schedule of 2D micro-batches as a basic scheduling unit (as shown in Figure 7(c)) for forward doubling
p2n3 | and backward halving, and concatenate <LATEX>\left\lfloor k / 2 \right\rfloor</LATEX> basic units and the residual D micro-batches if <LATEX>K</LATEX> is odd.
ohh7 | One more benefit for both forward doubling and backward halv- ing is that they have more space to overlap <LATEX>p 2 p</LATEX> communication (in the forward passes) than the classic 1F1B schedule [38, 39]. In Figure 7(d), taking the forward pass on micro-batch 1 as an example, the <LATEX>p 2 p</LATEX> communication from P1 to P2 can be overlapped by the intermediate forward pass computation, while for 1F1B there may be not enough computation to overlap <LATEX>p 2 p</LATEX> communication.
vbni | 3.6 Generalize to More than Two Pipelines
dgcw | So far we have only discussed the case that two pipelines (one down and one <LATEX>\left. u p \right)</LATEX> are combined together in Chimera. Yet, Chimera can be generalized to combine more than two pipelines for an even number of pipeline stages (i.e., <LATEX>D</LATEX> is even). For <LATEX>Q = D / 2 ,</LATEX> let <LATEX>F</LATEX> denote the set of <LATEX>\mathrm { a l l }</LATEX> the divisors of <LATEX>Q ,</LATEX> including 1 and <LATEX>\mathcal{Q}</LATEX> itself. For any <LATEX>f \in F ,</LATEX> we can generate a scheme for Chimera, which combines <LATEX>f</LATEX> down pipelines and <LATEX>f</LATEX> up pipelines together and each pipeline has <LATEX>D / 2 f</LATEX> micro-batches scheduled by the 1F1B strategy. Figure 8 gives an example in which Chimera combines four pipelines with eight stages (i.e., <LATEX>D = 8</LATEX> and <LATEX>\left. f = 2 \right) .</LATEX> For the down pipeline <LATEX>i \left( i \in \left[ 0 , f - 1 \right] \right) ,</LATEX> the <LATEX>D</LATEX> stages are mapped to the <LATEX>D</LATEX> workers in turn with the first stage (i.e., stage0) being mapped to the worker <LATEX>i * \left( D / f \right) .</LATEX> For example, for the down pipeline1 in Figure 8, stages [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7] are mapped to workers [4,5,6,7,0,1,2,3], respectively. For the <LATEX>f</LATEX> up pipelines, the <LATEX>D</LATEX> stages are mapped to the <LATEX>D</LATEX> workers in a completely reverse order of the corresponding down pipeline. It can be easily demonstrated that the schedules of the <LATEX>2 f</LATEX> pipelines can be overlaid without conflict.

For a given <LATEX>f ,</LATEX> Chimera incurs <LATEX>2 \left( D / f / 2 - 1 \right)</LATEX> bubbles, but has to maintain <LATEX>2 f</LATEX> model replicas and synchronize the gradients of 2f stages on each worker.
