You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

ylhz | 2.3 The hindgut
a3td | Digestion is completed in several hours and indigestible matter passes into the peritrophic membrane of the midgut. The faecal pellet is contained in this tube, which is grasped by the rectal pads and extruded at intervals in lengths equal to that of the midgut. Infolding of the basal membrane in the hindgut epithelial cells as well as folding of the entire epithelium allow for stretching of the hindgut lining under faecal loading.
ex5k | The cells lining the short hindgut appear to be specialized for cation transport (Mykles, 1980), but their specific functional role in nutrition has yet to be defined. Since the hindgut is lined with cuticle, it is unlikely to absorb digestive materials (van Weel, 1955). It may be involved in water transport (see the section on osmoregulation), but again its role must be limited due to the cuticular lining. The rectum is probably also the means by which the external medium is pumped into the midgut but, again, the function of this rectal pumping has not been firmly established.
9d4o | 3. Digestive enzymes
cjq2 | The pH of digestive fluids is acidic (about pH 5) (Hoyle, 1973) which favours the activities of the various enzymes involved in digestion. The shrimp stomach, which is covered in a chitin layer, does not secrete acid or enzymes, although its contents often show digestive enzyme activities, some of which may derive from the hepatopancreas and some from food animals.
5esx | The midgut contains several enzymes including protease, amylase and lipase which are secreted by the hepatopancreas (Ceccaldi, 1989). The proportions of these enzymes can vary with development (Biesiot & Capuzzo, 1990). Digestive enzymes are synthesised in the F-cells (fibrillar cells) and accumulate in the B-cells (Sousa et al., 2005; Vogt et al., 1989).
m5ka | Normally, secretion is thought to be by merocrine (by exocytosis) or apocrine (by enclosing in plasma membrane to form vesicles) discharge; however, the stimulation of food intake following a period of starvation may induce holocrine secretion (by rupture of the cell membrane) (Gibson and Barker, 1979).
byu8 | The hepatopancreas secretes a wide range of digestive enzymes: proteases, including specific collagenases, lipolytic enzymes, chitinase, cellulase (e.g. endo-ß-1,4-glucanase and ß-1,4-glucosidase) to be able to utilise the cellulose from plant cell walls, laminarinase which hydrolyses laminarin (a polysaccharide of glucose found in brown algae) and amylase which hydrolyses starch (Allardyce & Linton, 2008; Figueiredo & Anderson, 2009; Johnston & Freeman, 2005; Xue et al., 1999). Species with a high dietary intake of protein show high proteinase activities. Species that feed on crustaceans synthesise chitinase. Herbivorous species tend to produce high levels of the various carbohydrases to be able to disrupt cell walls and make use of the cellulose from plant cell walls, laminarin and other non-starch polysaccharides (Johnston & Freeman, 2005; Xue et al., 1999). Omnivorous species have high activities of several of the above enzymes.

vafm | 3.1 Proteases
2zmw | Protein is a major component in the feed of crustaceans and consequently proteolytic enzymes play a significant role in food hydrolysis and assimilation (Dall, 1991; Gibson & Barker, 1979a).
bf9k | Proteases are involved in digesting long protein chains into short fragments, splitting the peptide bonds that link amino acid residues by catalysing the reaction of hydrolysis. Hydrolysis is a chemical process in which a molecule of a target substance is split into two parts by the addition of a molecule of water. Some proteases can detach the terminal amino acids from the protein chain (exopeptidases, such as aminopeptidases, carboxypeptidase A); the others attack internal peptide bonds of a protein (endopeptidases, such as trypsin, chymotrypsin, pepsin, papain and elastase). Thus, when trypsin hydrolyses a protein, it splits peptides into amino acids which can then be absorbed across the cell membrane (Fig. 6).
otkr | Fig. 6. Cleavage points for various protease enzymes - exopeptidases (aminopeptidase and carboxypeptidase) and endopeptidases (pepsin, chymotrypsin).
ibgs | For many years it was thought that the vast majority of ingested proteins in all animals were completely hydrolysed to free amino acids before absorption. However, in mammals and teleost fish this view has been revised, and it is now believed that a significant proportion of amino acids are absorbed in the form of di- and tripeptides via a cotransport system driven by a hydrogen ion gradient (D'Mello, 2003). There is some evidence that the hepatopancreas of decapod crustaceans possess similar mechanisms (Thamotharan & Ahearn, 1996).
colo | The vertebrate proteases (pepsin, chymotrypsin and carboxypeptidase) are secreted as inactive zymogens (pepsinogen, trypsinogen, chymotrypsinogen and procarboxypeptidase). This is in order to prevent digestion of intracellular proteins. These inactive precursors are activated by either inorganic ions (e.g., H+ activates pepsinogen), specific enzymes (e.g., enterokinase activates trypsinogen) other enzymes (e.g. trypsin activates chymotrypsinogen) or by the active enzyme itself (e.g. pepsin activates pepsinogen; trypsin activates trypsinogen).
d6r4 | Invertebrate endopeptidases generally are secreted in an activated form, although their activity is augmented by the presence of sulfhydryl (S-H) bonds in the gut. Various intracellular endopeptidases of both vertebrates and invertebrates, called cathepsins, are produced in the active form. It is likely that extracellular digestive endopeptidases are derived from intracellular cathepsins.
9mrz | Proteases found in crustacean include trypsin, chymotrypsin, elastase, semi-collagenase, aminopeptidases and carboxypeptidases (Table I).
pk06 | The chemistry of crustacean proteases has been the subject of a considerable research effort (e.g.Celis-Guerrero et al., 2004; Dall et al., 1990; DeVillez & Buschlen, 1967; Fernández Gimenez et al., 2001; Muhlia-Almazán &

qrvy | García- Carreño, 2003; Zwilling et al., 1969). Several studies have shown that in crustaceans, especially penaeids, the synthesis of digestive proteases is sensitive to the level of protein in the food (Muhlia-Almazán & García- Carreño, 2003).
pn9j | The main endopeptidases for most crustaceans are trypsin and chymotrypsin. Trypsin is considered one of the most important enzymes in decapod crustaceans. In Marsupenaeus japonicus and Melicertus kerathurus, this enzyme accounts for 40-50% of the total proteolysis (Galgani et al., 1984), whereas it is reported to be about 50- 60% in giant tiger prawn (Penaeus monodon), kuruma shrimp (Marsupenaeus japonicus), redtail prawn (Fenneropenaeus penicillatus formerly Penaeus penicillatus) speckled shrimp (Metapenaeus monoceros) and Euphausia superba (Tsai et al., 1986) and 33% in the fiddler crab Uca pugilator (Eizen & Jeffrey, 1969) (Fig. 7).
1pmc | Fig. 7. Euphausia superba
5z6q | Fiddler crab Uca pugilator
yeoh | In giant freshwater prawn (Macrobrachium rosenbergii) trypsin and chymotrypsin account for between 55 and 82% of proteolytic activity (Chisty et al., 2009). Some species produce cathepsin L as the main proteolytic enzyme e.g. the North Sea shrimp Crangon crangon and Crangon allmani most individuals of which lack trypsin and chymotrypsin (Teschke & Saborowski, 2005).

y5r7 | Trypsins have been described in decapod crustaceans that are capable of hydrolysing the triple helix of native collagen under physiological conditions. These enzymes, discovered in in the fiddler crab Uca pugilator, have been named "collagenolytic proteases" (Eizen & Jeffrey, 1969; Grant et al., 1983). True collagenases are metalloproteases that degrade native collagen under physiological conditions, but are unable to hydrolyse denatured collagen or other native proteins (Woolley et al., 1978). The main difference with the collagenolytic proteinases resides in the structure of the active sites (Sakharov et al., 1994). Proteases able to degrade native collagen have also been found in P. monodon (Lu et al., 1990; Tsai et al., 1991).
lrry | In crustaceans, amino acids are absorbed by the R-cells and F-cells of the hepatopancreas and, to a lesser extent, by the midgut intestine. Amino acids are transported to the various tissues and are utilised as required, either being incorporated into proteins or used in a range of biochemical processes. Between 25% and 50% of dietary amino acids are incorporated into the body protein. The deposition of protein is consequently a major determinant of amino acid utilization and requirements.
hvhm | 3.2 Carbohydrases
863b | The term carbohydrases applies to enzymes that digest carbohydrates. Carbohydrate digestion, like protein digestion, involves hydrolysis of polymeric bonds (the bonds between polymers - chemical compound or mixture of compounds consisting of repeating structural units) and proceeds in stages until the basic units (monosaccharides) are produced. There are two classes of enzymes that hydrolyze polysaccharides (polymers of saccharides): the polysaccharidases and the oligosaccharidases. Polysaccharides are long carbohydrate molecules of up to 3,000 monosaccharide units joined together. An oligosaccharide contains a relatively small number (typically 2-10) of monosaccharides.
fj24 | The most common polysaccharidase enzymes are amylases, which hydrolyze plant starches (amylose and amylopectin) (Fig. 8) and animal glycogen; these all are polysaccharides with a-bonds between the subunits.
uz3c | Fig. 8. Amylose is a linear polymer of glucose mainly linked with a(1->4) bonds. It can be made of several thousands of glucose units. It is one of the two components of starch, the other being amylopectin.
d5bi | The oligosaccharidases hydrolyze trisaccharides such as raffinose, and disaccharides, such as maltose, sucrose, lactose (milk sugar) and trehalose (a common insect sugar). Maltose, sucrose and trehalose all contain a glucose bound by an a-bond to a second monosaccharide and are hydrolyzed by a-glucosidases (e.g., maltase and sucrase - also called invertase in invertebrates - and trehalase). Glucose linked to other monosaccharides by a ß-bond (e.g. lactose, cellobiose) is hydrolyzed by ß-glycosidases (e.g. lactase or ß-galactosidase).
ba4l | Decapod crustaceans are able to hydrolyze a great variety of polysaccharides and oligosaccharides, greatly surpassing the range of herbivorous fish. A wide range of enzymes have been identified in shrimp hepatopancreas and other sections of the digestive tract: a- and ß-galactosidases, a-fucosidase, laminarinase, a-mannosidase, ß- glucuronidase, ß-glucosaminidase, xylanase, a-xylosidase, raffinase, ß-fructofuranosidase, chitobiase and cellulase (Chuang et al., 1992; Chuang et al., 1991a; Chuang et al., 1991b; Gibson & Barker, 1979a; Omondi & Stark, 1996; Trellu & Ceccaldi, 1977; Vega-Villasante et al., 1995).

06ht | The activity of amylases is of great importance for herbivorous crustaceans and in the (omnivorous) common prawn (Palaemon serratus), its activity is more important than proteolytic activity (van Wormhoudt, 1980). Sequencing of three a-amylases extracted from Litopenaeus vannamei has revealed close evolutionary relationships with mammals (59-63% identity) and with insects (52-62% identity) (van Wormhoudt & Sellos, 1996; Van Wormhoudt & Sellos, 2003).
v3r2 | The digestibility of starch is an important factor in determining the availability of glucose in feed formulations. The enzyme a-amylase hydrolyses starch into maltose. Additional enzymes, maltase and isomaltase, then hydrolyse maltose further into glucose. These enzymes are present in the gastrointestinal tract of fish and shrimp but their activity and effectiveness vary between species. Data are limited for crustacean species (Table II) but in fish, a reduction in digestibility is observed when the dietary level of starch increases, irrespective of the starch origin.
nv42 | Data sources: Cousin et al. (1996) and Rivas-Vega et al. (2006).
xags | According to Stone (2003) the reduction in the digestibility of carbohydrates when dietary levels increase may be the result of an overload on the digestive enzymes that become saturated with substrate. The threshold for enzyme saturation by substrate is unknown in crustaceans and it is not apparent in the data shown in Table II.
jc47 | Herbivorous species of fish have high activity and efficacy of starch degrading enzymes. Omnivorous species have moderate activity whilst carnivores have only a limited ability to digest starch.
