        "content": "cxqi | Studies one through three provide evidence against the vacillation hypothesis, which holds that previous studies have yielded evidence for mixed emotions only because subjects vacillated between happiness and sadness more quickly than those studies' static measures could detect. They also provide evidence against the notion that people report mixed emotions only because they think the researchers want them to (Study two) or because they hold the lay belief that people can experience mixed emotions (Study three). Taken together, the results of Studies one through three provide evidence for the E S M's contention that happiness and sadness can co-occur and against the valence-arousal model's contention that happiness and sadness are mutually exclusive. More broadly, in contrast to Bain's assertion that valence is irreducible to the experience of emotion and that pleasantness and unpleasantness \"destroy\" each other, our results indicate that positivity and negativity are separable in experience.\nqfmx | Part two: Reactive Measurement\nrut3 | In Studies one through three, we explicitly asked people whether they felt happy and whether they felt sad. Such closed-ended questions are commonly used to measure emotions, but they may have unwelcome consequences. People generally test hypotheses by seeking confirmatory evidence, so asking people whether they are experiencing a particular emotion may prompt them to seek evidence that they are feeling that emotion. Sandberg and Conner found that women asked to indicate how much they would regret not getting a cervical smear were more likely to get a cervical smear within four months than those in a control group. This finding suggests that simply asking about anticipatory regret can elicit anticipatory regret.\nm3cp | Sandberg and Conner's findings give rise to a potential alternative interpretation for prior evidence for mixed emotions. For example, by asking them whether they felt happy after Life Is Beautiful, J. T. Larsen et al. may have inadvertently elicited happiness by prompting subjects to think about the pleasant events that occurred near the end of the film (e.g., the boy's reunion with his mother). Similarly, by asking them whether they felt sad, J. T. Larsen et al. may have elicited sadness by prompting subjects to think about the unpleasant events that occurred near the end (e.g., the father's death). According to this reactive measurement hypothesis, J. T. Larsen et al.'s subjects experienced mixed emotions only because J. T. Larsen et al. asked them whether they felt happy and sad. We tested this alternative interpretation in Studies four through six by asking subjects open-ended questions about their emotions (e.g., \"How do you feel?\") rather than closed-ended questions (e.g., \"Do you feel happy?\").\nmq4s | Study four: Emotion Listings\n95el | In Study four, we asked subjects to list the emotions they were experiencing immediately after watching one of the two clips from\na0a5 | Life Is Beautiful. We reasoned that if people can feel happy and sad at the same time, they would be more likely to spontaneously report experiencing mixed emotions after watching the bittersweet clip than after watching the control clip. The control clip ends on an especially sad note, so its ending might be especially unlikely to elicit mixed emotions. Thus, we included a group of subjects who watched no clip at all. Because the emotion listings were insensitive to the time course of emotions, we supplemented the emotion listings with a retrospective measure of the time course of subjects' positive and negative emotions.\ngocl | Method. Subjects were one hundred sixteen University of Colorado, Boulder, undergraduates (fifty-four women; forty-seven percent).\nob1z | Subjects were seated in separate cubicles and randomly assigned to watch the bittersweet clip, the control clip, or neither clip. Computerized instructions provided the cover story but made no mention of emotions. For subjects who watched either the control or bittersweet clip, the computer provided the following prompt immediately after the clip ended: \"Emotions can affect language comprehension, so before we go on we need to know what-if any-emotions you are feeling right now, at this very moment. Are you feeling any emotions right now?\" Those who selected \"yes\" were instructed to \"list ONE emotion that you are feeling right now, then press 'Enter.'\" After entering an emotion, they were asked, \"Are you feeling any other emotions right now?\" Those who selected \"yes\" were instructed to list another emotion. These steps were repeated until subjects indicated that they did not feel any other emotions.\nm4cb | To collect a retrospective measure of the time course of subjects' positive and negative emotions, the computer next told subjects that\nm61y | Some people mention feeling both happy and sad after the movie. If you mentioned feeling both happy and sad (or some other pair of positive and negative emotions), we're interested in how your feelings played out over time during the last few moments of the movie and up until now if the movie is still affecting your emotions.\nu2ob | The computer then displayed a figure with four panels, each plotting different patterns of happiness and sadness across time. Figures six A, six B, six C, and six D depicted happiness and sadness as nonadjacent, adjacent, partially overlapping, and completely overlapping, respectively. Subjects were then asked which figure best captured the time course of their emotions at the end of the clip. Subjects were also given the option to indicate that they had not \"mentioned feeling positive and negative emotions.\"\n2gnm | Subjects who were assigned to watch neither of the clips received the cover story and completed the emotion listing task immediately thereafter. For these subjects, the instructions for the retrospective time course measure made no mention of the clip.\nemgw | Results and discussion. Subjects generated a variety of words to describe their emotions. The percentage of subjects in each condition who reported happiness or its synonyms (i.e., glad, happy, joy, overjoyed, \"feel rejoiced\") and sadness or its synonyms (i.e., depressed, despair, sad, saddened, sadness, sorrow) is shown in Table two.
