        "content": "7zvf | Previous and recent experimental studies have demonstrated that, unlike end stiffeners, intermediate stiffeners can also be one-sided in links with various lengths. The numerical study of Daneshmand and Hashemi revealed that using one-sided stiffeners can reduce the rotation capacity of intermediate and long links, however, this reduction rarely decreases Y-max below the code-specified rotation capacity. Furthermore, the reduction was reported to be more pronounced for links in the range of one point eight to two point two. Nevertheless, A-I-S-C three forty-one permits the use of one-sided intermediate stiffeners for links with a depth of less than six hundred thirty-five millimeters. Malley and Popov demonstrated that partial depth intermediate stiffeners can also be used in shear links, provided that a concrete slab properly restrains the top flange. However, as required by A-I-S-C three forty-one, it is more advisable to use full-depth intermediate stiffeners welded to the web and both flanges since these stiffeners can enhance the stability of the link against flange local buckling as well as against lateral torsional buckling.\nmov9 | Recent tests and the probabilistic analysis of Bulic et al. suggested the use of at least two couples of properly designed web stiffeners in short I-shaped links to achieve enough reliability according to Eurocode Zero for the mean recurrence interval of fifty years.\nks7m | Richards and Uang noticed during their numerical study that some of the intermediate links failed to achieve the rotation capacity predicted by the provisions, with a maximum difference of eleven percent. Similar observations were also reported by Arce. Richards and Uang attributed the issue to the intermediate stiffener spacing requirements of the A-I-S-C Seismic Provisions. As stated earlier, Kasai and Popov proposed their stiffener spacing formula for short links; however, the provisions extended its use to intermediate links, without accounting for the significant moment-shear interaction that is present in the web panels of these links. Thus, it was concluded by Richards and Uang that the direct use of stiffener spacing requirements of short links may be unconservative for intermediate links.\nw1w1 | During a series of tests from two thousand two to two thousand five on A-nine ninety-two links, conducted at the University of Texas at Austin, another important issue was observed. Most of the specimens with less than one point seven exhibited web fractures at the ends of the stiffener-to-web welds prior to any notable web buckling. This was not consistent with the failure modes observed in the early studies of Popov and his colleagues where web fracture occurred only after severe web buckling at locations of large deformations. The pre-buckling web fracture had also been reported previously by McDaniel et al. during tests on large built-up links where it was attributed to the insufficient offset between the stiffener-to-web and the web-to-flange welds. It is also worth noting that in a number of more recent tests this type of failure mode has also been reported. Based on the test results, Okazaki and his colleagues have concluded that altering the applied loading history or the utilized stiffener detailing cannot change the link failure type from the web fracture mode. The test results however revealed that it is fruitful to terminate the stiffener-to-web weld at a distance not less than five t-w from the k-line of the link section. A clear correlation between the reduced material toughness in the k-area and the occurrence of link web fracture was not established. In addition to the above findings, a new stiffener detailing was also reported by Okazaki and Engelhardt which can delay web fracture and provide enhanced cyclic performance. This detail consists of two-sided intermediate\nh8gv | stiffeners which are welded only to the flanges that restrain the web by sandwiching it. Additional research regarding this detail was deemed necessary by Okazaki and Engelhardt.\nkwkp | In order to further investigate the cause of the recently observed pre-buckling web fracture failures, Chao et al. conducted a detailed numerical study. Numerical results suggested that the web fractures are due to the high triaxial constraints that develop at the ends of the stiffener-to-web weld and the localized high plastic strains at these locations. Beneficial effects of welding stiffeners to both flanges, using two-sided intermediate stiffeners and avoiding large stiffener spacing were also mentioned. Similar observations were also reported in previous experimental studies. Chao et al. also proposed a possible reason for the observed web fractures in the recent tests as opposed to the nineteen eighties experiments. The new straightening process for structural shapes causes higher strength and reduced toughness in the k-area, along the full length of the rolled sections, unlike the old method which induced localized changes in the material properties due to work hardening. As explained by Chao et al., the higher k-area strength in the new shapes prevents yielding in this region, and consequently, high plastic strains are developed in the adjacent web steel. These localized strains coupled with high stress triaxiality at the stiffener-to-web weld ends increase the possibility of ductile fracture initiation at the weld ends. Based on the numerical results, Chao et al. proposed a single horizontal stiffener instead of multiple vertical stiffeners for short links and demonstrated its promising performance numerically. The sandwich stiffener detail proposed by Okazaki and Engelhardt also performed well during the simulations.\nyj0m | Dusicka et al. conducted experiments on isolated very short built-up I-shaped links with a different stiffener detailing in which the link web was constructed from low-yield-strength steel without any stiffeners. The test results revealed that, unstiffened links with stocky webs constructed from low-yield-strength steel can sustain extremely high cyclic rotation angles, of the order of zero point two radians. As a result of such detailing, the failure mode was altered from that controlled by fracture at the ends of the stiffener-to-web weld to web tearing at the link end corners accompanied by web out-of-plane deformations in some cases. Bahrampoor and Sabouri-Ghomi also studied the effect of using very low-yield-strength steel with F-y equal to ninety megaPascals in E-B-F links. Comparison between the results of one-story one-bay F-E models with links constructed from regular\newfp | and low strength steels revealed that the energy dissipation characteristics of links can be enhanced using unstiffened stocky webs constructed from very low-yield-strength steel.\noczy | The use of diagonal web stiffeners for shear links was studied both experimentally and numerically by Yurisman et al. Based on the results reported by these researchers it appears that the diagonal web stiffeners may provide an alternative to the commonly used vertical stiffener arrangement for short links; however, further research is essential. Chegeni and Mohebkhah proposed new stiffener details for improvement of the rotation capacity of long links. Two details were suggested: placing an additional one-sided stiffener at a distance of zero point seven five bf from the link ends; and using small one-sided diagonal stiffeners between the end stiffener and the intermediate stiffener in long links. Results of the parametric study indicated that the latter detail is more effective in improving the rotation capacity and energy dissipation of long links. However, further experiments for validating the suggested details were deemed necessary.",
