        "content": "oksu | Forty argon minus thirty-nine argon age of its plagioclase, four thousand four hundred ninety-six million years. This is consistent with a previous interpretation that Agoult recorded ubiquitous high-temperature metamorphism of the initial crust of Vesta. The two hundred seven P B star over two hundred six P B star age of the Ibitira merrillite is four thousand five hundred fifty-two point zero plus or minus eight point seven million years, consistent with the other chronometers in this meteorite. Conversely, the model two hundred seven P B star over two hundred six P B star ages of the Juvinas phosphates recorded two distinct events at four thousand five hundred sixteen point nine plus or minus ten point four million years, the weighted mean value for apatite, and four thousand one hundred fifty point three plus or minus eleven point six million years, merrillite. The earlier age reflects either crustal metamorphism or an independent impact at approximately four thousand five hundred twenty million years. The later age reveals the presence of a moderate collisional reheating event at four thousand one hundred fifty million years. This timing is identical to the two hundred seven P B star over two hundred six P B star of the Stannern apatite and merrillite at four thousand one hundred forty-three point zero plus or minus twelve point five million years. For the Camel Donga apatite, the model two hundred seven P B star over two hundred six P B star ages present a mean value of four thousand four hundred ninety-one point four plus or minus thirteen point five million years with one exceptionally disturbed value of approximately four thousand three hundred seventy million years. Apparently, these brecciated eucrites indicate the presence of multiple collisional events during the period of approximately four thousand four hundred to four thousand one hundred fifty million years ago. By combining our chronological dataset with data from the literature, the thermal and metamorphic history of Vesta's crust can be described as follows: One. Initial magmatic processes occurred during the period of approximately four thousand five hundred sixty to four thousand five hundred million years ago. Cataclysmic collision(s) also occurred during this stage. Two. The asteroid subsequently experienced multiple collisions during the period of approximately four thousand four hundred to four thousand one hundred fifty million years ago, which were recorded by the uranium-lead systems in apatite, merrillite and some silicates, but not by the uranium-lead system in zircons. The reheating temperature exceeded the apatite uranium-lead closure temperature, approximately five hundred ninety to one thousand degrees Celsius, and likely reached locally the basalt melting point. Three. Later collisions at approximately three thousand nine hundred to three thousand five hundred million years ago were recorded only by the potassium-argon system. The reheating temperature was likely less than or equal to five hundred degrees Celsius, which can be achieved through weak impacts. The records on Vesta are well explained by a scenario with early asteroidal bombardments and a monotonic decrease of the bombardment rate from greater than or equal to four thousand five hundred million years ago to approximately four thousand one hundred million years ago, rather than by the conventional late heavy bombardment.\nwtow | CRediT authorship contribution statement\no22k | Declaration of competing interest\nnwfz | The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.\nnvfy | Appendix A.
