You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

z2dl | If you find a crazy good market, ride it, and ride it hard. And if you pair a Grand Slam Offer with a crazy market, you'll likely never need to work again (seriously). So have this skill set - the ability to accurately assess markets by taking into account pain, money, targeting, and growth - in your back pocket so that when lightning strikes, you can make sure it strikes twice.
vtxq | Having established how to nail a market, let's get back to pricing. The first step to making crazy money is charging premium prices.

vgpr | ll I could see was black. My eyes felt glued shut. I was awake, but the fatigue in my temples felt like a five-pound weight was duct-taped to my skull, dragging my eyelids back down. I had to concentrate forcibly to open them.
xrda | The details of the dimly lit room beamed in. I rolled over to the edge of the hotel room bed, feeling each and every muscle in my body as my weight shifted. Hunched on my side, I could see my clothes scattered on the floor. I was so beat the night before that I didn't even remember taking them off.
u0fl | I had just finished a five-day gauntlet of keynote after keynote presentation. Two days of presentations for our highest-level clients immediately followed by spending two days planning with our entire company (135+ employees).
1qe2 | I had missed a FaceTime call from my father the day before. I didn't have anything on my agenda for the morning. So I creakily got up, slid into a hoodie and some sweats, and walked into the hotel hallway to call him back. After the initial pleasantries, he immediately dove into why he was calling - parental concern.
of19 | "I saw the picture you posted of all your clients . .. " he said, but in an unusually concerned tone. "I thought the event was for all your highest-paying clients? I didn't know it was a big event. It looked like you had a thousand people there!"
l0xs | Alone in the hallway and struggling to shake the heavy weight of exhaustion still, I tried to gauge where his concern was coming from and what he was getting at. I had explained this all to him already. "It was only for our highest-level clients, that wasn't all our clients," I said. "Just the ones who pay $42,000 a year ... our Gym Lords, like I told you."
yrtf | "Every single person in that picture paid you $42,000?" He sounded almost frightened at the idea.
9foe | "Yeah, wild right?" My voice was hoarse from days of speaking and thousands of twenty-second conversations.
mind | "Is it legal what you're doing?" he asked. Wow. That escalated quickly, I thought to myself. "Do they know they're paying you that much?"
zn89 | "Yes, it's legal. And of course they know. It's not like magically siphoning money." "That's a lot of money. I hope what you're giving them is worth it."
b264 | I contemplated whether it was worth the effort to dive into this or just ignore it. But knowing this was going to be "a thing," I took a deep breath and began to explain. "If I made you $239,000 extra this year, would you pay me $42,000?" I asked, using "$239,000" because it was the average increase in topline revenue of a gym using our systems for 11 months.
jv66 | "For sure," he said, "I mean if I knew I was going to make that back. But what would I have to do?"
5507 | "About 15 hours a week of work"
74me | "And how long would it take me to make the $239,000?"
exc2 | "Eleven months"
8y62 | "And how much of the $42,000 would I have to pay you up front?"
4fig | "Nothing. Just pay me as you start making the money using the system"
sksb | I watched it click. My dad got it. "Oh," he said, "well then, yeah, I would do it."
op72 | "And that's why they do it, too."
im7i | Making shit loads of money breaks people's minds. It literally stretches their minds so far past what they believe is possible they assume you are doing something wrong or illegal. They literally "can't even."
rmuk | Why? Because they think to themselves . . . they can't be that much smarter than me or work that much harder than me, so how is it possible for them to make 1,000 times more than me? Enough money that it would take me literally ten lifetimes to make what they make in a year.
kadj | In the three years leading up to me writing this book, I took home over $1,200,000/mo in profit. Every. Single. Month. That's more than the compensation for the CEOs of Ford, McDonalds, Motorola, & Yahoo . . . combined . . . every year . . . as a kid in his twenties.
5kvy | It angers those who believe life isn't fair. It confuses others who cannot comprehend and believe there must have been a mistake. And it inspires a select few, who are bound for greatness.

vcpg | You can do this.
ij2y | You just need to learn how.
w7j4 | And I'm gonna show you.
q8xw | Price to Value Discrepancy
1m55 | "I hope what you're giving them is worth it."
2zaa | Those words would probably sting for most, but when my dad said them to me, I just knew he didn't understand the value we were providing. What I want to show you is how to create and communicate value, aka the "worth-it-ness" of an offer.
4iwf | In order to understand how to make a compelling offer, you must understand value. The reason people buy anything is to get a deal. They believe what they are getting (VALUE) is worth more than what they are giving in exchange for it (PRICE). The moment the value they receive dips below what they are paying, they stop buying from you. This price to value discrepancy is what you need to avoid at all costs.
grmv | After all, as Warren Buffet said, "Price is what you pay. Value is what you get."
mrk0 | PRICE TO VALUE DISCREPANCY
bash | The simplest way to increase the gap between price to value is by lowering the price. It's also, most of the time, the wrong decision for the business.
xseo | Getting people to buy is NOT the objective of a business. Making money is. And lowering price is a one-way road to destruction for most - you can only go down to $0, but you can go infinitely high in the other direction. So, unless you have a revolutionary way of decreasing your costs to 1/10th compared to your competition, don't compete on price.
3oxf | As Dan Kennedy said, "There is no strategic benefit to being the second cheapest in the marketplace, but there is for being the most expensive."
gvhw | So the goal of our Grand Slam Offer will be to get more people to say yes at a higher price by increasing our value to price discrepancy. In other words, we will raise our price only after we have sufficiently increased our value. This way, they still get a great deal (think buying $100,000 of value for $10,000). It's 'money at a discount.'
