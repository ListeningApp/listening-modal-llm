        "content": "d2fj | We need to make precise some estimates on the evolution semigroup associated with equation two point four for the analysis presented in Section two point three. We consider to this end weighted spaces of bounded functions. To define them, we first introduce a family of Lyapunov functions denoted by <LATEX>(K_{n})_{n∈N}</LATEX>, with <LATEX>K_{n} : X ⟶ [1,+∞)</LATEX> such that\ngeyi | for all n greater than or equal to zero, <LATEX>K_{n} < K_{n+1}</LATEX>.\n2181 | The associated weighted B infinity spaces are\n9ubl | B equals the set of measurable functions phi such that <LATEX>\\| \\phi \\|_{B_{0}} = \\sup_{x∈X} K_{n}(x) < +∞</LATEX> .\no8pj | In particular, for any phi in B infinity, it holds that <LATEX>\\| \\phi \\| < \\| \\phi \\|_{B_{0}} K_{m}</LATEX> . We can then introduce the space, which consists of all functions phi in <LATEX>C^{∞}(X)</LATEX> which grow at most like <LATEX>K_{n}</LATEX> for some n, and whose derivatives also grow at most like <LATEX>K_{m}</LATEX>, possibly with m greater than n\n27b9 | and m depending on the order of derivation. Denoting by <LATEX>\\partial^{k} = \\partial_{x_{1}}^{k_{1}} \\ldots \\partial_{x_{d}}^{k_{d}}</LATEX> for\n09xa | <LATEX>k = (k_{1}, \\ldots, k_{d}) in N^{d}</LATEX>, <LATEX>\\mathscr{S} = \\{ \\varphi \\in C^{∞}(\\mathcal{X}) | for all k in N^{d}, \\exists n in N, \\partial^{k} \\varphi \\in B_{n}^{∞} \\}</LATEX>. When <LATEX>\\mathcal{X}</LATEX> is bounded, it is possible to choose <LATEX>\\mathcal{K}_{n} = 1</LATEX> for all <LATEX>n \\geqslant 0</LATEX>, in which case <LATEX>\\mathscr{S} = C^{∞}(\\mathcal{X})</LATEX>. For unbounded spaces, a typical choice is <LATEX>\\mathcal{K}_{n} = 1 + |x|^{n}</LATEX>, in which case the functions <LATEX>\\varphi \\in \\mathscr{S}</LATEX> and their derivatives grow at most polynomially. We also consider the subspace <LATEX>\\mathscr{S}_{0} = \\Pi_{0} \\mathscr{S}</LATEX> of functions with average zero with respect to <LATEX>\\psi_{0}</LATEX>, where <LATEX>\\Pi_{n}</LATEX> for <LATEX>\\eta \\in \\mathbb{R}</LATEX> denotes the projection operator\nyi97 | <LATEX>\\Pi_{\\eta} \\varphi = \\varphi - \\int_{\\mathcal{X}} \\varphi \\psi_{\\eta}</LATEX>. We denote by <LATEX>\\|\\cdot\\|_{\\mathcal{B}(E)}</LATEX> the operator norm on the Banach space <LATEX>\\mathcal{B}(E)</LATEX> of bounded linear operators on a Banach space <LATEX>E</LATEX>, defined by\n4zj7 | <LATEX>\\| \\mathcal{A} \\|_{\\mathcal{B}(E)} = \\sup_{g \\in E \\setminus \\{ 0 \\}} \\frac{\\| \\mathcal{A} g \\|_{E}}{\\| g \\|_{E}}</LATEX>. Before we state the next assumption, we let <LATEX>\\mathcal{A}^{*}</LATEX> denote the adjoint of <LATEX>\\mathcal{A}</LATEX> on the space <LATEX>L^{2}(\\psi_{0})</LATEX>. More explicitly, for any test functions <LATEX>\\varphi</LATEX>, phi in <LATEX>C^{∞}</LATEX> with compact support,\n3wgh | <LATEX>\\int_{\\mathcal{X}} (\\mathcal{A} \\varphi) \\phi \\psi_{0} = \\int_{\\mathcal{X}} \\varphi (\\mathcal{A}^{*} \\phi) \\psi_{0}</LATEX>. The action of these operators can be found via integration by parts. In particular, for <LATEX>\\psi_{0}(x)</LATEX> a probability density proportional to <LATEX>\\mathrm{e}^{- \\beta U(x)}</LATEX>, an integration by parts shows that <LATEX>\\partial_{x_{i}}^{*} = - \\partial_{x_{i}} + \\beta \\partial_{x_{i}} U</LATEX>. In addition, note that <LATEX>\\nabla_{x}^{*} \\nabla_{x} = \\sum_{i=1}^{d} \\partial_{x_{i}}^{*} \\partial_{x_{i}}</LATEX> .\nuvo3 | Note that the Fokker-Planck equation two point three, written in terms of the <LATEX>L^{2}</LATEX> adjoint, can also be written with the <LATEX>L^{2}(\\psi_{0})</LATEX> as <LATEX>\\mathcal{L}_{0}^{*} 1 = 0</LATEX>. We make the following assumption on the Lyapunov functions.\nyjbv | Assumption two (Lyapunov estimates). The space <LATEX>\\mathscr{S}</LATEX> is dense in <LATEX>L^{2}(\\psi_{\\eta})</LATEX> for any <LATEX>\\eta \\in \\mathbb{R}</LATEX>. For any <LATEX>n \\in \\mathbb{N}</LATEX>, the <LATEX>L^{2}(\\psi_{\\eta})</LATEX> norms of the Lyapunov functions are uniformly bounded on compact sets <LATEX>\\eta</LATEX>: for any <LATEX>\\eta_{*} > 0</LATEX>, there exists a constant <LATEX>C_{n,n_{*}} < +∞</LATEX> such that\nl6it | equation two point five",
