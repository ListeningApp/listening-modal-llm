You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

06yq | Microdosing with psychedelics to self-medicate for ADHD symptoms in adults: A naturalistic study
dpv6 | ARTICLE INFO
8r5j | ABSTRACT
2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

ci51 | VALUE OFFER: CREATING YOUR GRAND SLAM OFFER PART II: TRIM & STACK
jaj7 | "Cut! Cut! Cut!"
uc0w | FRIENDS TO RACHEL GREEN IN FRIENDS
494y | I divided this chapter into two parts because it's the meatiest section in the book. It's also the most important. Without a valuable product or service, the rest of the book won't be as actionable. We just covered all the problems we are going to solve. The second half of making your offer is breaking down tactically what we are going to do/provide for our client. In theory, we'd all love to fly out and live with our customers to fix their problems. In reality, that wouldn't make a very scalable business. We need our offer to be incredibly attractive and profitable.
5whs | That being said, if this is your first Grand Slam Offer, it's important to over-deliver like crazy. Maybe flying out isn't such a bad idea in the beginning. Make some sales, then think about how to make it easier for your clients. You want them to think to themselves, "I get all this, for only that?" In essence, you want them to perceive tremendous value.
kigc | Everyone buys bargains. Some people just buy $100,000 things for only $10,000. That's where we want to live: high prices, but a steal for the value (like hopefully this book so far).

c1pj | FULFILL
6v9y | FULFILL
deen | In order to best absorb the notions of trimming and stacking, we need a mental reframe.
27bo | Enter the sales to fulfillment continuum.
72k6 | Whenever you are building a business, you have a continuum between ease of fulfillment and ease of sales. If you lower what you have to do, it increases how hard your product or service is to sell. If you do as much as possible, it makes your product or service easy to sell but hard to fulfill because there's more demand on your time investment. The trick, and the ultimate goal, is to find a sweet spot where you sell something very well that's also easy to fulfill.
emhp | I have always lived by the mantra, "Create flow. Monetize flow. Then add friction." This means I generate demand first. Then, with my offer, I get them to say yes. Once I have people saying yes, then, and only then, will I add friction in my marketing, or decide to offer less for the same price.
tcgw | Practicality drives this practice. If you can't get demand flowing in, then you have no idea whether what you have is good. I'd rather do more for every customer and have cash flow coming in, then optimize my business but have zero cash flow coming in after (and zero idea about what I need to adjust to better serve my customers).
4d8s | Here's a perfect example to drive this home. When I started Gym Launch, gym owners reached out asking me to help. They needed so much help, I didn't know where to start. But I wanted to make sure they got way more than they paid me. So here's what I ended up doing to fill their gyms: I would fly out to their gym for 21 days, spend my own money on hotels, car rentals, eating out, advertising, generate the leads, work the leads, then sell for them. I would even do the first onboarding meeting with clients to get them started. In short, I did everything. I took on all the risk.
1cmq | They only had to put down $500 to "reserve" their date, which I made refundable at the end of their launch. So they had 0 financial risk, 0 time risk, 0 effort, and the deal was, I got to keep all the up front cash collected from selling their services, and they got clients for free. You can imagine how this was a pretty compelling offer.
u8s6 | On my own, I was able to sell about $100,000/mo in up front cash for myself. So these deals were very lucrative for me. Over time, I scaled that to a team of 8 guys selling every month. But this began to wear on me and the team. It was at that point that I realized that if I were to simply teach them how to do what I did, I could charge maybe a third of what I would normally make, but I would be able to help hundreds of gyms a month instead of eight. And, I could do it all sleeping in my own bed every night.
86m5 | My promise was fundamentally the same: I will fill your gym in 30 days. It was simply the how and what I did that changed. The how and what is what we are breaking apart.
lzzv | When talking to business owners about their model, I tell them to create cash flow by over-delivering like crazy at first. Then use the cash flow to fix your operations and make your business more efficient. This revision process can be pretty seamless. You may not even have to change what you offer. You may just end up creating systems that create the same value for the customer but cost you significantly less resources.
623p | Ultimately this is how businesses beat one another. Understanding this will be important as you scale your business.
50lp | Now that we've established the importance of the fulcrum and how to approach the sales-fulfillment balance at the outset, let's cover the last two steps of creating our Grand Slam offer. To recap quickly, remember that we covered identifying dream outcomes (step one), listing problems (step two), and determining solutions (step three).
i4nn | Step #4 Create Your Solutions Delivery Vehicles ("The How")
nuk3 | The next step is thinking about all the things you could do to solve each of these problems you've identified. This is the most important step in this process. This is what you are going to deliver. This is what you are going to do or provide in exchange for money.
y2cn | For the purposes of keeping creativity high (divergent thinking), think about anything you could possibly do. Think of all the things that might enhance the value of your offer. So much so that they would be stupid to say no.
hgm4 | What could you do that someone would immediately say, "All that? Seriously? Yes, I'm in."
nc42 | Doing this exercise will make your job of selling So. Much. Easier.
tbfm | Even if you come up with something you're not actually willing to do, it's okay. The goal here is to push your limits and jog your brain into thinking of a different version of the solution you'd normally default to. This is where you get to flex your entrepreneurial creativity.
ok18 | Reminder: You only need to do this once. Literally one time for a product that may last years. This is high-value, high- leverage work. You ultimately get paid for thinking. You got this. This should be fun. Go ahead and list out all your possibilities now. Then I'll take you through my example. I'll just use the buying food problem from earlier as an example. I like to group things by how many people I'm going to deliver this thing to at once.
pgqe | My list is below. And at the bottom, I've given you my "cheat codes" for how I think through this to get even more creative.
qo9m | Problem: Buying Healthy Food Is Hard, Confusing, and I Won't Like It
e7zz | If I wanted to provide a one-on-one solution I might offer . . .
lhzk | 1. In-person grocery shopping, where I take clients to the store and teach them how to shop
wdpw | 2. Personalized grocery list, where I teach them how to make their list
twiq | 3. Full-service shopping, where I buy their food for them. We're talking 100 percent done for them.
cchx | 4. In-person orientation (not at store), where I teach them what to get
2vma | 5. Text support while shopping, where I help them if they get stuck
z4aw | 6. Phone call while grocery shopping, where I plan to call when they go shopping to provide direction and support
mo0p | If I wanted to provide a small group solution I might offer . . .
tyxr | 1. In-person grocery shopping, where I meet a bunch of people and take them all shopping for themselves
txaa | 2. Personalized grocery list, where I teach a bunch of people how to make their weekly lists. I could do this one time or every week if I wanted to.
qz8s | 3. Buy their food for them, where I purchase their groceries and deliver them as well
y7de | 4. In-person orientation, where I teach a small group offsite what to do (not at store)
rukn | If I wanted to provide a one to many solution I might offer . . .
5tu7 | 1. Live grocery tour virtual, where I might live stream me going through the grocery store for all my new customers and let them ask questions live
vqgg | 2. Recorded grocery tour, where I might shop once, record it, then give it as a reference point from that point onwards for my clients to watch on their own
sbs5 | 3. DIY grocery calculator, where I create a shareable tool or show them how to use a tool to calculate their grocery list
n413 | 4. Predetermined lists, where each customer plan comes with its own grocery list for each week. I could make this ahead of time so they have it. Then they could use it on their own time
mvxd | 5. Grocery buddy system, where I could pair customers all up, which takes no time really, and let them go shopping together
gyzb | 6. Pre-made, insta-cart grocery carts for delivery, where I could pre-make insta-cart lists so clients could have their groceries delivered to their doorstep with one click
rrp1 | As you see, the list can really go on and on here. This is just to illustrate the many ways to solve a single problem. Now do this for all of the perceived problems that your clients encounter before, after, and during their experience with your service/products. You should have a monster list by the end of this.
8b70 | Product Delivery Cheat Codes
nivt | What's that? You're having trouble being creative? I'm going to give you the cheat codes right now, kind of like I did with the brick example: "the brick could be gold, or plastic, or have holes in it, or be a lego, etc." Here are my "cheat codes" for product variation/enhancement and a visual to break down the process for you from my consulting deck:

40h8 | 1. What level of personal attention do I want to provide? one-on-one, small group, one to many
9w49 | 2. What level of effort is expected from them? Do it themselves (DIY) - figure out how to do it on their own; do it with them (DWY) - you teach them how to do it; done for them (DFY) - you do it for them
kgl8 | 3. If doing something live, what environment or medium do I want to deliver it in? In-person, phone support, email support, text support, Zoom support, chat support
kq4g | 4. If doing a recording, how do I want them to consume it? Audio, video, or written.
qjp8 | 5. How quickly do we want to reply? On what days? during what hours? 24/7. 9-5, within 5 minutes, within an hour, within 24 hrs?
pc64 | 6. 10x to 1/10th test. If my customers paid me 10x my price (or $100,000) what would I provide? If they paid me <LATEX>1 / 1 0 ^ { \text { th } }</LATEX> the price and I had to make my product more valuable than it already is, how would I do that? How could I still make them successful for <LATEX>1 / 1 0 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }</LATEX> price? Stretch your mind in either direction and you'll come up with widely different solutions.
mbrx | In other words, how could I actually deliver on these solutions I am claiming I will provide. Do this for each problem because solutions from one problem will give you ideas for others you wouldn't normally have considered.
pcd0 | Remember, it's important that you solve every problem. I can't tell you the amount of times one single item becomes the reason someone doesn't buy.
txkp | Anecdote: Why We Must Solve Every Perceived Problem
mxqe | One month I really needed to make some sales to pay rent. My next sale walked in the door - it was a business exec looking to lose weight. As we got into the sales presentation, she told me the program wouldn't work for her because she went out to eat for lunch everyday. Normally, I would have lost this sale. I was a stickler for making people not eat out. But I really needed the money. Refusing to lose the sale because of this one thing, I conceded "I'll make you an eating out guide for when you go to restaurants so you can eat our 100 percent of the time and still hit your goal. How does that sound?" She agreed, and I closed the sale.
y9ob | I took the time to make an eating out guide for her. But from that point going forward, whenever someone said "but what about eating out ?? " I had the solution. Over time, I continued solving obstacles with templates and trainings until there were no more "one things" to prevent my sales. This lesson has stuck with me to this day. Don't get romantic about how you want to solve the problem. Find a way to solve every problem a prospect presents with. When you do that, you make an offer that's so good, people just can't say no. And that's what we're building here.
twm6 | Note: You must resolve every obstacle a buyer believes they will have to convert the highest amount of people. That's not to say that if you don't, you won't sell people. Not at all. But you won't sell as many people as you otherwise could have. And that's the goal, to sell the most people, for the highest possible price, with the highest possible margin.
8qsp | Step #5: Trim & Stack
yck2 | Now that we have enumerated our potential solutions, we will have a gigantic list. Next, I look at the cost of providing these solutions to me (the business). I remove the ones that are high cost and low value first. Then I remove low cost, low value items.
