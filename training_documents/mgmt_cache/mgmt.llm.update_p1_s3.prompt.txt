You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

ukth | SUMMARY
kpvt | Emerging market companies create new management practices for an environment characterized by increased volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity (VUCA). This article shows how Haier developed a platform of management practices called Rendanheyi to transform itself from a conventional hierarchical manufacturing firm to a highly responsive online-based entrepreneurial company. It demonstrates how the organizational, competitive, institutional, and technological contexts mattered for the development of Rendanheyi, showing how context-dependent management innovations are created to allow emerging market firms such as Haier to deal with a high VUCA world and creating an extended process model of management innovation that managers can readily apply.
jie2 | E merging market companies face a challenging environment charac- terized by increased volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity (VUCA).1 Volatility comes from, among other things, varying growth rates and currency fluctuations, making the business environment unstable and unpredictable. Fluid market conditions, the impact of new tech- nologies on organizational structures, and the unresolved future of international trade rules, create uncertainty. Foreign investments, including in developed countries, imply more complex environments. And there is significant ambiguity,
d0ik | for instance, around the effects of maintaining existing homegrown management practices, such as relationship-based management in Asia, versus adopting west- ern theories and management practices.2 But some companies such as China's Haier Group, the world's largest white goods company, have taken on this chal- lenging environment by reinventing themselves and developing a management model that thrives in such a high-velocity environment.
0x0s | In this article, we show how companies such as Haier create management innovations in a high VUCA context. Management innovation involves the cre- ation of new management practices.3 Under the leadership of Zhang Ruimin, the Haier Group developed "Rendanheyi" (in Chinese: (A-), which can be loosely translated as "integration of people and goals" or "the win-win model of individual-goal combination." Rendanheyi is a platform made up of a bundle of management practices, rather than a single new practice. Other such platforms have, of course, evolved historically. For example, Toyota's lean manufacturing has an overall goal-to produce on a large scale with minimum effort and waste- and encompasses several specific practices including just-in-time, Kanban, and target costing.4 Similarly, Rendanheyi is intended to be an integrated and all- encompassing management model with the overall goal to create "zero distance to the user" and unleash entrepreneurial autonomy within the organization. Specific elements of the Rendanheyi platform include autonomous micro-enter- prises, performance-based compensation, and open online user platforms.
4exe | From the introduction of Rendanheyi in 2005, Haier was transformed from a conventional hierarchical appliance manufacturer into a highly responsive, diversified online-based entrepreneurial conglomerate organized as entirely autonomous micro-enterprises. During 2005-2009, Haier operated newly estab- lished strategic business units and implemented new information technology (IT) solutions and performance-based measures to better connect the company to cus- tomers. In 2010, micro-divisions called ZZJYT (an abbreviation for "zi zhu jing ying ti," translated as "independent operating unit") were established. ZZJYTs operated like a virtual team, and each ZZJYT leader had considerable decision- making autonomy-and new performance-based measures were introduced.5 In 2014, Haier was eventually transformed into a conglomerate of independent micro-enterprises called "xiaowei qiye" (abbreviated as "xiaowei"), operating as independent companies with ownership stakes from outsiders and responsible for all contracting, budgeting, and recruitment decisions. This latest phase has been labelled "Rendanheyi 2.0."
0myz | The case of Rendanheyi is important for management innovators, as it demonstrates how a high VUCA context in an emerging market can shape novel management practices. In the literature, there has been renewed interest in man- agement innovations in recent years,6 but few studies have explored their initial creation process.7 In this article, we tackle a major shortcoming of the existing literature, which revolves around the Birkinshaw et al. model of "management innovating" that largely neglects the role of context.8 The organizational, com- petitive, institutional, and technological contexts mattered a lot in the Haier case.

syiw | The State of Knowledge on Management Innovation
kg3t | Firms have long recognized the importance of technological innovations in products and processes, but increasingly they also value the competitive edge from innovation in how the firm is managed. Historical examples of such "man- agement innovations" include advances in structure such as the (divisional) M-form at GM, but also tools and techniques such as the balanced scorecard (Analog Devices) and scenario planning (Shell). Most academic writing is focused on the ways in which existing management practices spread across a population of organizations and from one industry or country to the next.9 While these are interesting questions, they do not help to understand the process of developing a novel management innovation such as Rendanheyi.
lvae | Still, some work looks at what drives organizations first to invent and then to implement new management practices, that is, management innovating. A major advance in understanding management innovating came from the Birkinshaw et al. process model, which offers a template to understand how man- agement practices are created and implemented.10 This model focuses on under- standing the active role of individuals, who are called internal and external change agents, in different phases of management innovating.
o9sc | Internal change agents are, of course, crucial in understanding why and how a specific management innovation comes about. Indeed, all management innovations can be linked to a powerful protagonist. For example, the founder of Toyota Motor Corporation Kiichiro Toyoda and production engineer Taiichi Ohno played key roles in the development of lean manufacturing at Toyota.11 Much more recently, the chairman of the Samsung Group Kun-Hee Lee was crucially involved in developing the co-opetition model within Samsung.12 In addition, external change agents such as gurus and management consultants can be involved in management innovating.
121u | The Birkinshaw et al. process model proposes that there are four distinct phases in management innovating. The first of these comes about when change agents are motivated to consider creating a management innovation because of some dissatisfaction with the status quo. The second stage, invention, occurs when a thought or real experiment is started to create a new hypothetical management practice. In the third stage, implementation, this hypothetical practice is put into practice to establish its value. Finally, in the fourth stage, theorization and labeling, there is retrospective sensemaking whereby an innovation can receive legitimacy. Thus, we understand relatively well what actions agents undertake to create man- agement innovations.
zh03 | A shortcoming of this model and the bulk of management innovation litera- ture is that it mostly black boxes the role of context, even though context clearly matters for the development of management innovations. For example, the devel- opment of lean manufacturing at Toyota benefited from the context of Japan with its different cultural understanding of time as a simultaneous rather than sequen- tial process, as well as its traditionally close collaborative arrangements between
1mvw | manufacturing firms and suppliers within zaibatsu/keiretsu, along with postwar material shortages.13 And the development of the co-opetition model was sup- ported by Samsung's common language, organizational culture, and management systems, which fostered close collaboration across the Samsung Group and, thus, helped toward seizing new business opportunities and reducing transaction costs. 14
