You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

5vqw | In a meta-analysis performed by Lee et al. [41], 22 articles were included (mean or median age at diagnosis or age at presentation range: 6.7-11.5 weeks); the pooled accuracy of preoperative liver biopsy was 91.7%, with a sensitivity of 91.2% (95% CI 75.0-100%), specificity of 93.0% (95% CI 66.7-100%), positive predictive value of 91.2% (95% CI 75.0-100%), negative predictive value of 92.5% (95% CI 47.6-100%) and accuracy of 91.6% (95% CI 65.6-100%).
meyw | A large multicentre study performed by Russo et al. [42] addressed histopathological features of liver biopsies that dis- tinguish biliary atresia from other causes of infantile cholestasis. They found a diagnostic accuracy of the needle biopsy of 90.1% (95% CI: 85.2-94.9%), whereas sensitivity and
2e62 | specificity for biliary atresia were 88.4% (95% CI: 81.4- 93.5%) and 92.7% (95% CI: 84.8-97.3%), respectively (medi- an age at the time of the needle biopsy: 58 days). This study revealed large variability in the severity of histological changes in biliary atresia; for example, bile duct proliferation was absent in as many as 22.8% of biliary atresia cases and bile duct/ductular plugs were absent in 25% of biliary atresia cases. Histological features of biliary atresia also overlapped with non-biliary atresia cases; more than 40% of the latter had some degree of bile ductular reaction and bile plugs were present in 15%. According to these data, percutaneous liver biopsy cannot exclude biliary atresia. The general reported complication rate of US-guided percutaneous liver biopsy ranges from 1.7% [43] and 4.6% [44] but has not been reported in this specific population.
75y3 | Risk scores
s2g2 | Differentiation of biliary atresia from other nonsurgical causes of neonatal cholestasis is challenging so a diagnostic risk score is desirable. We searched for biliary atresia risk score papers in the literature including all imaging techniques.
q1q2 | Kim et al. [45] used both clinical (gestational age at birth) and imaging criteria (triangular cord thickness at US, gallblad- der structure at US, hepatobiliary scan findings) to develop a risk score for biliary atresia that stratifies patients in a low-risk group in which liver biopsy may be postponed, an intermediate-risk group in which liver biopsy can be consid- ered and a high-risk group in which prompt liver biopsy with or without intraoperative cholangiography should be consid- ered. There are concerns about Kim et al.'s [45] risk score. First, hepatobiliary scintigraphy causes a diagnostic delay of 1 week (5 days for preparation with phenobarbital and 2 days for the examination - we need 24-h delayed imaging) and it
cb7r | is not recommended because of its limited specificity. According to Kim et al.'s [45] risk score, a full-term birth infant with triangular cord sign and gallbladder abnormalities has only a 15.88% probability of biliary atresia. This is not in agreement with the very high sensitivity and specificity of the combination of triangular cord sign and gallbladder abnormal- ities reported in the first part of our meta-analysis (87%, 90% and 99%, respectively) [13]. According to those results, this infant has a very high probability of having biliary atresia. Kim et al.'s [45] risk score underweights the role of an optimised US scan. In that paper, US was performed after a 2-h fast, which in our opinion is too short. The US criteria did not include signs such as micro- or macrocyst or syndromic presentation. In Kim et al.'s [45] strategy, biopsy is indicated in the high-risk group, but we consider it more important to do a cholangiography than a biopsy, according to the results of our review. We agree that the high-risk group should get a cholangiography and a biopsy and that the low-risk group can be monitored by close follow-up according to the age. However, our major concern with these results is that they give no answer to how to handle the patients with intermediate (15.88-59.99%) risk of biliary atresia.
68xu | El-Guindi et al. [46] used stool colour (clay), US signs (tri- angular cord sign, contractile gallbladder, gallbladder length ≥20.5 mm, hepatic artery diameter <LATEX>\geq 2 . 0 5 m m ,</LATEX> hepatic artery diameter/portal vein diameter ≥0.445 mm, hepatic subcapsular flow), laboratory tests and histopathology to develop a 12- parameter diagnostic score to discriminate biliary atresia from other causes of neonatal cholestasis, reporting a sensitivity and specificity of 100% each. The main concern is the reproducibil- ity of these measurements and of this diagnostic score; Macaluso et al. [47], applying the same diagnostic score to their population, obtained less encouraging results: global sensitivity was 31% (5/16) with a specificity of 90.9% (10/11).
