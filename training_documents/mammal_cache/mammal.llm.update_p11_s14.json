        "content": "9g22 | Meta-module two can be considered as a partially methylated module (mean methylation zero point six six) and is enriched with several enhancer states, late replicating domains, partially methylated domains, commonPMD, and solo CpGs, WCGW. Meta-module two also contains the module most related with life span, midnight blue, and the human mortality risk module, magenta. These two modules overlap with the CpGs that are positively related to life span. Three out of four average weight-related modules are also located in meta-module two.\n41fx | Discussion\n7um8 | In this study, we present an analysis of a cross-species DNAm dataset obtained from a mammalian array platform. This platform specifically focuses on highly conserved regions of DNA, making it a valuable resource for studying methylation patterns across mammalian species. Successful construction of mammalian phyloepigenetic trees suggests that the divergence of DNAm profiles is closely aligned with genetic changes throughout evolution. Sensitivity assessments reveal that the observed phyloepigenetic associations are not caused by technical issues associated with our measurement platform. Instead, the phyloepigenetic signal may stem from sources such as upstream regulators, transcription factors, or DNA sequence variations in distant regions.\nuow2 | The conserved CpGs exhibiting the strongest phylogenetic signals are situated in intergenic regions, whereas promoter regions do not display such signals. Previous studies reported a rapid evolutionary rate of enhancers as a shared feature among mammalian genomes,\niat7 | adjustment for phylogenetic relationships can be found in figs.
