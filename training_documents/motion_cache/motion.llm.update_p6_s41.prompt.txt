You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.

These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

0b8v | V. Equation Sets Comparison
fucs | A. Reference Mission Scenario
yply | To assess and compare the accuracy of the derived equation sets, we considered a reference target orbit inspired by the HLEPP study [10,11]. The study considers a human-assisted robotic mission on the lunar surface, where rovers are tele-operated by astronauts on board a station in lunar orbit, the DSG. Access to the station by vehicles incoming from both the Earth and the lunar surface is one of the most critical aspects of the mission. The study of the relative dynamics for this scenario, and the design of maneuvers for rendezvous and docking with the DSG will provide a step forward in the overall mission design.
75n5 | The candidate family of orbits for the DSG is the Earth-Moon L1 NRHO [10,22,23]. An example of NRHO belonging to the south subfamily is shown in Fig. 3. The orbit was provided by ESA.
ec91 | In Fig. 3 the region of the orbit suitable for rendezvous, as suggested by [10,11], is highlighted. To identify the rendezvous region, the mean anomaly of the NRHO must be introduced:
wul6 | M(1)=2m-
4rhy | where, in analogy to the Keplerian orbits, t is the time from the periselene passage, and T is the orbit period. For the orbit in Fig. 3, the average period is T = 6.9867d. The periselene is defined as the point where the orbit crosses the x-z plane of the Moon frame .M closest to the Moon, whereas the aposelene is defined as the point crossing the same plane farthest from the Moon. The analysis of the stable and central manifolds of the orbit as a function of the mean anomaly was used in [10,11] to identify the recommended rendezvous region M € [80°, 280°]. In this region the existence of the central manifolds enables the design of hovering or station keeping trajectories that can be exploited in the waiting for the clearance for the final approach.
092d | B. Simulations Setup
94ul | The equation sets defined in Sec. IV.C were tested and compared, in order to assess their accuracy for different initial spacecraft separations.
0vdu | Spacecraft motion was simulated according to the ER3BP. The reference scenario discussed in Sec. V.A was used as a benchmark, and the presented NRHO orbit was chosen for selecting target initial states with respect to the Moon.
a230 | The three simplified equation sets previously defined, namely, the ELERM, the CNERM, and the CLERM, were implemented in MATLAB/Simulink 2014b. The ENERM set was not included in the comparison because for the ER3BP it corresponds to the exact description of the relative motion. Two relative motion equation sets based on the two-body problem were also considered, in order to understand their applicability to restricted three-body scenarios:
dvoe | 1) the linear equations of relative motion (LERM) [24]:
677t | x=p(1-2) x-21(2-2)
5hk6 | 8
viei | ÿ = - jy p
rk0j | 2 = 2] [x-x) + j2 (1+2]
c6x9 | e) Hill's equations
g5at | e) Hill's equations
re3j | wherep = xî + yj + zk, p is the target orbit semilatus rectum, and f denotes the true anomaly rate. Both p and f were computed from the target initial position and velocity vectors as follows:
6z45 | p- h(p), j = h(to) h(to)2
20af | where h(to) = ||r(to) x[r(to)]Mll
huae | 2) the Hill's or Clohessy-Wiltshire equations [1,3]:
rblh | x=2nż j =- n2y
gl5i | ¿ = - 2nx + 3n2 z
x0yg | where n is the orbit mean anomaly, given by n = 2x /T, with T period of the NRHO orbit.
mjt8 | Two different Monte Carlo simulations were performed to assess the accuracy of the equation sets. The distance test analyzes the accuracy as the initial relative separation increases. In particular, for each target initial condition, a given number of relative distances were chosen. For each one, a random initial relative position vector with norm equal to the chosen distance was computed, and the equation sets were propagated. Relative velocity was kept fixed to zero for all the simulations. Conversely, in the speed test a set of initial relative speed was chosen, and associated relative velocity vectors were generated randomly. In both tests, target initial conditions were chosen in terms of mean anomaly M along the NRHO orbit. The equation sets were tested over an interval of 12 h. MATLAB solver settings are listed in Table 1. Monte Carlo test parameters are given in Table 2.
htcn | e) Hill's equations
86d4 | The following performance indexes were defined to compare the equation sets:
z7qp | 1) the maximum distance and speed errors over the simulation interval:
6t1g | ev = max ||p(t) - ®(t)||
cpls | ep = max ||p(t) - p(t) |, te[to,tf]
m50n | te[to,t}]
eztf | where the hat denotes the relative position and velocities computed by the tested equation set, whereas the quantities without hat denote the true values.
bwsu | 2) the aggregative performance index:
oqod | #
tey0 | V = max |§(t) - §(t)|, tE[to,tf]
ghiv | ξ np
o5ts | where n is the NRHO mean motion. This index, used in [5,26], allows to characterize the overall accuracy of the set. The index v has
hd7d | dimension of length by adimensionalizing time in the relative velocity using the orbit mean motion.
