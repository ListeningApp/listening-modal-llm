You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).

y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

p1kn | person has with their self. This severed internal relationship with the self needs to be restored so that the person can go on to trust and value themselves, as well as begin to trust others again. When this type of healing has yet to occur, people func- tioning from the fearful-avoidant attachment style will tend to see themselves as broken and unworthy and will expect that others are untrustworthy or will only hurt them in the end. In more extreme cases, this attachment style is associated with high relationship turmoil, dissatisfaction and toxicity, self-destructive behaviors, relationship abuse, mental illness and addictions.
49ym | Diane Poole Heller makes two important distinctions in regard to this attach- ment style. The first is that the expression of this style can either look more dismis- sive and withdrawing or more anxious, clingy and pursuing. Heller refers to these two variations as either being more disorganized avoidant or disorganized anxious. In my own practice, I make a distinction between the internal fearful-avoidant and the external fearful-avoidant. In the category of internal fearful-avoidant, we find people who, when under stress or threat, are triggered into higher anxiety and have the internal disorganized experience of wanting connection and wanting to move clos- er to someone, yet simultaneously feeling an inner pull back, believing the connec- tion to be unsafe. However, such people do not act this dynamic out in ways that are destructive to themselves or others. The experience is more internally disrup- tive than externally damaging.
abvj | Other people express the experience of having one foot on the gas and the other on the brake in a relationship in a much more external and reactive way. These people react externally in ways that are confusing, contradictory or harmful. The distinction between internal and external fearful-avoidant might be a difference in degree or severity within this attachment style, or it might also be two different stages in healing. A person with a fearful-avoidant attachment style who has been engaging in healing work that is moving them towards more secure functioning may initially develop less external reactivity while still experiencing an inner "push/ pull" dynamic. The process of resolving their trauma may have enabled them to now choose differently with how they externally respond.
k4xq | The second important distinction that Heller makes is that we can have a chron- ically disorganized style that functions as a primary attachment style, or more of a situational disorganized style. In the situational kind, someone might be more con- sistently secure, dismissive or preoccupied in their attachment style, but in certain situations or under the influence of certain triggers, they get activated into a tempo- rary disorganized state. Once the stressor or situation resolves, they then return to their other, more dominant style.
ok5a | Since people with the fearful-avoidant style experience both attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance, see which of the above statements for the dismissive and preoccupied styles also describe your experience. Some statements that some- one with a fearful-avoidant style might make are:
2ngm | . I often don't feel safe or fully trusting in relationships, even if my partner acts in safe and trustworthy ways.
mtp1 | . I frequently get triggered by things that may seem to come out of nowhere.
171k | . I genuinely want intimacy and closeness but I can experience episodes of fearful overwhelm when intimacy with a partner increases.
gugp | . When in conflict, I can vacillate from being overwhelmed or aggressive to being dismissive and numb.
axri | . I can vacillate between different types of chaos or rigidity.
iqve | . When in distress I have acted in ways that have been harmful to myself or my partners.
o7st | . I often expect that the worst will happen in a relationship, even when things are going well.
jsfl | . I have elaborate negative fantasies about what will go wrong or how my part- ner will inevitably hurt me beyond repair, even if things are mostly going well.
0px6 | . Being in a relationship can cause me to become dysregulated, dissociative or confused.
9n3l | . There are times when I look fine on the outside, but I am actually a complete tsunami on the inside.
09gz | . I frequently experience the conflicting internal drives of wanting to be close
pppg | and share myself but fearing that closeness or vulnerability will be dangerous or cause the relationship to end.

o873 | An important takeaway from this overview of attachment theory is the importance of securely attaching to others who will care for us. This is our first survival strat- egy because without the loving and attentive presence from others we would die. Accordingly, emotional attunement and connection are wired into us as basic human needs that persist through life. Depending on the environment and circum- stance that we were born into and how well our parents were able to meet our at- tachment needs (some conditions our parents had control of and others they did not) we will either develop a secure attachment style, where we feel safe to be with our caretakers and explore the world beyond them, or we will develop an insecure attachment style. Insecure attachment can take the form of overly pulling into our- selves to avoid and withdraw, overly turning outward to others to grasp and pro- cure, or vacillating between the two. These insecure attachment styles are sec- ondary survival strategies that make sense based on what we went through as a child and will continue to impact how we attach and bond in our adult romantic relationships. Here I invite you to reflect on your own personal attachment history, what style or styles you experienced with your different attachment figures and how this relates to the attachment behaviors you have exhibited in your adult romantic relationships.

yusn | CHAPTER TWO THE DIFFERENT DIMENSIONS OF ATTACHMENT
5cww | MOST ATTACHMENT RESEARCHERS base their work on the idea of categorizing peo- ple under one of four specific types: secure, preoccupied, dismissive or fearful- avoidant. More recently, however, some researchers have proposed that attach- ment is better described using the two dimensions of attachment anxiety and at- tachment avoidance, and looking at the different ways these dimensions can interact.29 They place each of these dimensions along an axis from high to low, and then cross the axes to form a diagram with four quadrants. While this model still produces the same four basic types (one per quadrant), it lets us see a few things in more nuanced ways based on how far along each axis we find ourselves. Not every person with a preoccupied attachment style is exactly the same, for instance. It also helps show the common ground between the different types; for example, both the fearful and the dismissive attachment styles share a higher level of emo- tional avoidance. This model can help us better understand how we might be able to move the needle on our own emotional tendencies when they're not serving us well.
vgpr | Being high in the attachment anxiety dimension relates to increased fears of being rejected, neglected, abandoned or separated from an attachment figure. Being low in attachment anxiety relates to being less fearful or preoccupied that such things will occur. Attachment avoidance is the dimension that relates to how comfortable or uncomfortable a person feels when it comes to being close, inti- mate or reliant on a partner. Stated more positively, low attachment avoidance refers to being more comfortable with intimacy, closeness and reliance on a part- ner and being more likely to approach and engage with a partner.
