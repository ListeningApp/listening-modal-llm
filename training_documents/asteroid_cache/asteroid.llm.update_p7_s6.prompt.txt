You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

68xu | The merrillite in Ibitira recorded an earlier event, with the model <LATEX>2 0 7 p b * / 2 0 6 p b ^ { * }</LATEX> age of <LATEX>4 5 5 2 . 0 \pm 8 . 8 M a</LATEX> (Fig. 4). This value is indistinguishable from its pyroxene 207Pb-206Pb isochron age of <LATEX>4 5 5 6 . 7 5 \pm 0 . 5 7</LATEX> Ma (lizuka et al., 2014). The whole-rock Mn- Cr systems also recorded this age <LATEX>\left( 4 5 5 7 + 2 / - 4 \quad M a ; \right.</LATEX> Lugmair and Shukolyukov, 1998). Thermal metamorphism at ~4555 Ma is con- sistent with the records in the eucrites, even though Ibitira came from a different parent body. The <LATEX>4 0 A r - 3 9 A r</LATEX> age of <LATEX>4 4 8 7 \pm 1 5</LATEX> Ma for Ibitira is distinctly younger than those from the other chronometers (Bogard and Garrison, 1995). It is inferred that Ibitira experienced (i) ancient crystallization likely prior to 4560 Ma, (ii) high-temperature thermal metamorphism in the crust at 4555 Ma, and (iii) subsequent monotonic cooling until

2zpk | Our study reveals that the U-Pb system in the phosphates in the three brecciated eucrites recorded multiple impact events prior to 4.15 Ga. The phosphates U-Pb ages of two other brecciated eu- crites, NWA 8009 and Bereba, also recorded the thermal events at
epu7 | ~4.25-4.1 Ga (Liao and Hsu, 2017; Zhou et al., 2011). Moreover, the silicate U-Pb systems in some eucrites recorded coincident timings (Galer and Lugmair, 1996; Tera et al., 1997). It is obvi- ous that the parent body, Vesta, suffered intense impacts at <LATEX>\geq 4 . 1 5</LATEX> Ga, during which the U-Pb systems in its phosphates and silicates were partially reset. Conversely, only the K-Ar system recorded the later bombardment on Vesta (or the V-type asteroids) at 3.85-3.47 Ga (Kennedy et al., 2019). The absence of ~3.85-Ga records in the phosphates U-Pb systems suggests that these later impacts were weaker than the earlier impacts (>4.15 Ga), resulting in lower re- heating temperatures.
7od1 | The closure temperatures <LATEX>T _ { c }</LATEX> of the U-Pb system in zircon and apatite, and of the K-Ar system in plagioclase are calculated using Dodson's law (Dodson, 1973): <LATEX>T _ { c } = E / R \ln \left( A R D _ { 0 } T _ { C } ^ { 2 } / a ^ { 2 } E T ^ { \prime } \right) ,</LATEX> where <LATEX>E = a c t i v a t i o n</LATEX> energy, <LATEX>R = g a s</LATEX> constant, <LATEX>D _ { 0 } =</LATEX> coef- ficient, and A is a dimensionless constant, with known diffusion properties of Pb and/or Ar (Cherniak and Watson, 2000; Cherniak et al., 1991; Cassata et al., 2009). For diffusion scale (a), we use typical grain sizes of the minerals in the basaltic eucrites. Cool- ing rate <LATEX>T ^ { \prime }</LATEX> is an unknown parameter. In high-temperature range <LATEX>\left( 1 2 0 0 ^ { \circ } C - 8 5 0 ^ { \circ } C \right. ,</LATEX> <LATEX>T ^ { \prime }</LATEX> for the basaltic eucrites is known to be as rapid as 4000°C/Myr (Miyamoto and Takeda, 1977). By extrapo- lating this to the lower temperature range, <LATEX>T _ { c }</LATEX> becomes <LATEX>\sim 5 9 0 ^ { \circ } C</LATEX> for the U-Pb in apatite and <LATEX>\sim 3 0 0 ^ { \circ } C</LATEX> for the K-Ar in plagioclase. The detailed conditions for the <LATEX>T _ { \mathrm { c } }</LATEX> calculations and their results are provided in supplementary Table S3. In case of impact-induced reheating and subsequent rapid quenching at the near-surface of the asteroid the closure temperatures are much higher. Assuming a rapid quenching <LATEX>1 ^ { \circ } C / d</LATEX> (or, <LATEX>\left. 4 \times 1 0 ^ { 8 } { } ^ { \circ } C / \mathrm { M y r } \right)</LATEX> after impact reheat- ing, <LATEX>T _ { c }</LATEX> becomes <LATEX>\sim 1 0 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }</LATEX> for the U-Pb in apatite, <LATEX>\sim 5 0 0 ^ { \circ } C</LATEX> for the K-Ar in plagioclase, and exceed the melting point of basaltic rock for the U-Pb in zircon (Supplementary Table S3). This means the U-Pb ages in the eucrite zircon may not be disturbed by impacts without extensive remelting and/or recrystallization, unless our as- sumption of the rapid quenching is incorrect.
0bqy | In Fig. 5, we compiled the literature data for the U-Pb and Hf-W chronologies of zircon, the U-Pb system of silicates and phosphates, and the K-Ar system of whole-rock or silicates (dated by the <LATEX>4 0 A r ^ { 3 9 } A r</LATEX> method) for various basaltic eucrites and mesosiderites. There seem to be three key age groups: (1) prior to 4.5 Ga, (2) prior to 4.15 Ga, and (3) near ~3.9-3.5 Ga.
