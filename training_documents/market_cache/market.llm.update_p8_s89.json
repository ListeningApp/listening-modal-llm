This generated an overall database of some one thousand seven hundred ninety records, with data stretching over some seventeen years from nineteen seventy-two to nineteen ninety-nine. However, although the information dates as far back as the earliest purchases in the nineteen seventies and includes records up to the late nineteen nineties, in fact most people bought lots during the nineteen eighties. The database includes information for all fifteen of the sub-divisions included in the CRG programme, from which data for the following variables were extracted: the sub-division name; the purchase date (year); the price paid; from whom it was bought; and, whether or not the lot was sold with or\n6d4s | without a Deed (a Contract for Deed usually). As well as analysing the general trend for all records, we were also able to disaggregate data for a number of specific colonias- four of which had a good sample size. These four colonias represent sixty-four percent of all records in our usable CRG database.\nmqah | Our first task in the analysis was to convert all data from nominal prices (i.e. unadjusted for inflation) into constant land prices using standard deflators. Due to occasional flaws detected in the CRG records, after cross-checking we omitted any case where there was uncertainty, or where there was missing information. This reduced the total number of cases from the original one thousand seven hundred ninety to a 'working database' comprising one thousand four hundred six records that are shown in Table one. These data are used to undertake the first phase of our land price analysis and, compared with other simi-\nxxr8 | lar surveys, they represent a relatively large data-set. Not only is it relatively large, but we are confident that the information had been consistently and accurately collected and recorded.\nrl4j | Real land prices were computed for each lot but, because lot size sometimes varied, it was important to calculate in unit-price terms, as the real cost per square foot. Although most people recalled how much they had paid, or the deal that was struck at the outset, there was less certainty about the exact size of their lots, so in each case this was cross-checked with the data at the CRG office which were based upon plat information and were known to be accurate. Also, in Starr County, we were greatly helped by the fact that most of the lots sold were of a uniform size-fifty by one hundred square feet-which is small by colonia standards in Texas. This largely obviated any possible inaccuracies by having to rely solely upon the size as reported by respondent. Thus, from both the questionnaire survey and the CRG database, we had the nominal and real price paid for the lot, and the same for unit prices per square foot, all matched to the year of purchase. These form the basis for the following graphs. Moreover, in aggregate data presentations, wherever possible the 'trimmed' mean value was adopted since this automatically excludes the outliers that would distort the average and mislead the analysis. Thus, the median and trimmed mean values offer the most accurate picture of lot prices in any single year.\nvz32 | Occasionally, nominal price data on lot prices were taken directly from the CRG\nncb0 | database (as were lot-size data since these were always more accurate than the self-estimates offered by respondents). The CRG data were checked against that provided by survey respondents in order to gauge accuracy and consistency of the survey data and they proved a reasonably close match-especially the medians-although the average lot price in the survey was almost three hundred dollars higher. Upon further investigation, it transpired that this was because some respondents had, in fact, purchased two adjacent lots, but considered the purchase as a single (larger) lot. Where this was known to be the case, the survey data were recalculated in order to reflect a single lot price, but just in case we have not caught all of those cases we occasionally prefer to use the median value. Generally, though, we are comfortable using the survey data and we are confident that they are sufficiently accurate to warrant further analysis.\n8mp0 | One assumption that we do make here is that, at the time of purchase, these were unimproved parcels of land-i.e. they did not have any dwelling on them. This was almost always the case, even though some lots have been resold (traspasos) and, in these cases, it was possible that they may have included a dwelling structure of some sort (although these would probably be excluded by using the trimmed mean). In addition, we were able to control for two variables in order to exclude lot sales that might have contained a dwelling structure: first to focus only upon those cases where the vendor was either Blas Chapa or Elías López since they never sold lots with structures; and, secondly, in the more recent cases that were likely to be\nxjyk | traspasos, to exclude regular-sized lot sales costing more than fifteen thousand dollars in real terms since this price was considerably over the odds and would indicate the presence of a dwelling. (Similarly, we excluded the extremely low reported prices, since these were probably misinformed prices placed on the record by CRG officials in those cases where the person had paid very little, or was receiving the lot through the CRG.)\nmt0f | Most residents (seventy-two percent overall) declared that they had bought their lot from Blas Chapa and/or from Elías López. This has two important implications for our analysis: first, these would have been 'first-hand' buyers, as both men were the original developers of these colonias and did not deal in anything other than unimproved lots; and, secondly, it meant that it was they who had set the asking price-according to their own criteria-rather than these being prices set in the (open) market-place (although one could assume that the two would be closely interrelated), or by another private third-party individual. But other studies have shown that it is not uncommon for 'non-market' criteria to enter the equation particularly where the sale is made by a friend or relation of the developer.\nawab | Land Price Trends over Time\nixcc | In our first model of land-price changes over time, we calculated yearly real average land prices per square foot for the whole period covered in the CRG database. The mean and median real square foot land prices range from zero point four hundred seventy-five cents in nineteen eighty-three to a high point of one dollar and two hundred ninety-six cents in nineteen ninety-five. Examining the curves in Figure one, first for vacant lots and secondly for all lots combined, one can see that there is little difference between the two indicators: the same general trend is replicated in each curve. At first sight, 'real' prices appear to have been around the zero point seventy cents per square foot mark in the late nineteen seventies through to nineteen eighty-two, dropping to zero point fifty cents and then remaining flat for the remainder of the decade, before rising steadily from nineteen ninety-one, rising sharply in nineteen ninety-three through to nineteen ninety-five, and declining thereafter.\n```",
