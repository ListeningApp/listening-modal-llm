Moreover, some politicians use forbearance (nonenforcement against informal practices such as squatting and street vending) as an electoral appeal, and those in the informal sector come to view these forbearance benefits as a significant part of their perceived \"welfare\" system. Forbearance is viewed by poor voters as a better indicator of the class sympathies of candidates than are promises of traditional welfare benefits (like education), and hence it further undermines the possibilities for constructing a programmatic upgrading coalition. The general point is that several different strategies can incorporate informal workers into electoral politics with promises of benefits not connected to upgrading and in ways that divide formal and informal workers. Dani Rodrik paints a vivid picture of the political consequences of a large, enduring informal sector:\newfp | Politics looks very different when urban production is organized largely around informality, a diffuse set of small enterprises and petty services. Common interests among the non-elite are harder to define, political organization faces greater obstacles, and personalistic or ethnic identities dominate over class solidarity. Elites do not face political actors that can claim to represent the non-elites and make binding commitments on their behalf. Moreover, elites may prefer-and have the ability-to divide and rule, pursuing populism and patronage politics, and playing one set of non-elites against another.\noczy | FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT\n2ttg | Sustained, cohesive support from a broad segment of big business is likely a necessary condition for high-cost, long-term investment in upgrading institutions. However, business in most MI countries is structurally fractured along a dimension that fragments interests on key issues related to upgrading policies, such as education (Section Four). The cleavage-absent in all large earlier industrializers-is between foreign and domestic firms. The stock of FDI in large MI countries is not high when compared to the stocks in OECD countries today, but the more relevant comparison is between MI countries in the twenty-first century (thirty-four percent of GDP) and HI countries in the twentieth century (four percent of GDP for East Asia and nine percent GDP for OECD). The average percentages would have been even lower for HI countries\nhis3 | in the twentieth century, when they were making the transition to HI. Moreover, MNCs are among the largest of big businesses in today's MI countries. In Latin America they usually account for a third to a half of the hundred largest firms. MNCs are especially dominant in the manufacturing sectors of many MI countries, including in our two Southeast Asian cases, Malaysia and Thailand, where they account for thirty-four and thirty-one of the top fifty manufacturing firms, respectively. This typically translates into MNC dominance of manufactured exports and contrasts with the cases of the East Asian HI \"graduates,\" where domestic firms account for the majority of manufacturing exports. At a minimum, this MNC dominance shuts the largest domestic firms out of manufacturing.\nm50z | Of course, market-seeking MNCs might be amenable to joining upgrading coalitions, but these firms have technology and marketing advantages derived from home markets that protect them from domestic competitors. Because of their market advantages, they can also afford to pay workers more and poach skilled workers elsewhere, thereby also creating a private solution to the skills problem (discussed in more detail in the next section). Efficiency-seeking MNCs operating in global production networks might have stronger interests in joining an upgrading coalition, but they also have other options: solving skills needs internally, relying on affiliated foreign suppliers, or simply moving higher value-added production to a country that already has the desired skills and infrastructure.\nme84 | On technology policy in particular, it is hard for foreign and do-\no56m | WORLD POLITICS\nslz6 | mestic firms to find common ground, especially for long-term, costly investments in building up the institutional infrastructure needed for innovation. Although some domestic firms might favor such a push, foreign firms typically do not, as they do most of their R and D in their home countries. When MNCs do invest in R and D in developing countries, as they do increasingly in India and China, it is often in the lower technology, more routinized elements of R and D. But MNCs invest very little in R and D of any kind in large MI countries and have little interest in paying for costly long-term upgrading for domestic innovation.\n90k5 | In terms of collective action and political engagement, MNCs are pretty deficient, as Albert Hirschman first noted decades ago. For one, MNCs regularly operate through more direct ties to relevant agencies, such as boards of investment. MNCs also sometimes create separate associations, such as the ubiquitous Amchams (American Chambers of Commerce), or split off separate associations in particular sectors (for example, mining in Chile or banking in Argentina). Moreover, some prominent associations exclude foreign firms. For example, in Mexico the exclusive CMHN (Mexican Council of Business Men, a council of the top forty or so business groups) had no MNC members, and in TUSIAD (Turkish Industry and Business Association), the main association for big business in Turkey, less than ten percent of close to six hundred members were from MNCs. In turn, governments, when establishing councils to meet with business, often exclude foreign firms (for example, CDES Economic and Social Development Council in Brazil). Or MNCs opt not to participate in tripartite meetings, something that often occurs in Association of Southeast Asian Nations countries. In addition, MNCs usually have further incentives to disengage from politics because they want to maintain a low profile (and stay out of government crosshairs) and or because expat managers may know little about how best to engage. In sum, even were they more interested, MNCs would make poor coalition partners.",
