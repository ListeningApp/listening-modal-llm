So here, ten tumoroid lines were subjected to a variety of radiotherapy treatments in the presence or absence of a toxic dose of cisplatin to determine whether the effects of these treatments were additive or synergistic. When compared with single-agent treatment, the combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy resulted in increased cell death, with six lines showing increased sensitivity to radiotherapy in the presence of cisplatin. Overall, the radiotherapy response improved in the presence of cisplatin, indicating a synergistic effect. All in all, Driehuis et al. were able to demonstrate that, in vitro, a variable response to cisplatin, carboplatin, and radiotherapy was present, suggesting that these tumoroids have the potential to be used in personalized therapy.\nqecd | Five point two point five. Microfocus X-ray Fluorescence Mapping of the Penetration of an Osmium Complex in Ovarian Spheroids\n1o7p | The organo-osmium complex has shown an anti-tumoral activity both in vitro and in vivo. This complex is an inert prodrug that, under intracellular reductive conditions, can be activated by hydrolysis, producing a reactive compound responsible for oxidative stress and apoptosis. Sanchez-Cano et al. studied the tumoral cell growth inhibition and drug penetration of the compound on A two thousand seven hundred eighty ovarian carcinoma spheroids. Spheroids were grown in U-bottom cell-repellent ninety-six-well plates at cell densities of one thousand to five thousand cells per well.\ncp13 | Regarding the growth inhibition, it was shown that the organo-osmium complex is more effective than cisplatin, in both two D and three D models. Moreover, when the time of exposure increased from sixteen hours to forty-eight hours, the differences between the antiproliferative activity of the compound on the two D and three D models were minimal, contrary to what happened with cisplatin, in which the biological activity was higher in the monolayer cultures. Such results suggest that the complex was able to penetrate the spheroids in a time-dependent manner. To confirm this hypothesis, a microfocus X-ray fluorescence imaging technique, SXRF, was used to map the distribution of osmium in the spheroids, which is depicted in Figure four.\nbgre | It was possible to observe that the organo-osmium complex reached the tumor core, remaining there for a longer period of up to forty-eight hours. The authors suggested a correlation between treatment time and the number of osmium atoms at the spheroid cores, possibly due to transport mechanisms. Overall, Sanchez-Cano et al. were able to demonstrate the anti-tumoral potential of the organo-osmium complex against platinum-resistant tumors.\n57lp | Five point two point six.
