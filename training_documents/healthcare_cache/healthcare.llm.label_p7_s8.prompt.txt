You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

06yq | Microdosing with psychedelics to self-medicate for ADHD symptoms in adults: A naturalistic study

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

hvhm | A green health care insurance company would be accountable for environmentally sound practices. From fair-exchange coffee, to "cruelty free" cosmetics, to locally grown food, more customers are willing to support companies that unite ethics with the product they supply. Each year, a handful of articles call on health care to divest from fossil fuel sources.105 Sustain- able energy and investment in renewable sources are two ways an insurance company can be green. Alter- natively, a green insurance company might choose to partner only with health care facilities that are mem- bers of organizations which actively participate in sus- tainability initiatives, such as Practice GreenHealth,106 Health Care Without Harm,107 the Healthier Hospitals Initiative,108 and the Catholic Health Association.109
863b | To be sure, insurance companies are dependent on many different supply chains. For instance, phar- maceuticals are known environmental menaces110 and consistently one of the largest carbon emitters in health care.111 Requiring environmental accountability from drug companies would be a significant first step for greening insurance companies, with ample data to support the move.112 Once sustainability measures are in place, insurance companies can brand themselves as green, thus rising as visible leaders in green health care reform.
fj24 | V. Conclusion
uz3c | While there is justified suspicion about American health care - which is capitalistic and atomized113 - the potential for individuals to change the system is also the greatest strength. Historically, health care policymakers have been amenable to stakeholder requests and willing to comply with patient and doc- tor demands. Such was the case with lowering the cost of HIV-medications.114 Many patients and physicians recognize that a healthy body and mind depend on a healthy planet. Their collective actions can stimulate green health care reform.
d5bi | Cheryl Macpherson, Elise Smith, and Travis Rieder maintain, "given the goals of health care, claims of
ba4l | and calls for health promotion are hypocritical unless they involve strategies and policies that explicitly pro- tect environments and natural resources."115 Patient and doctor participation in green initiatives, in tan- dem with advocacy, makes green health care reform not only possible, but truly a requirement of climate change.
