You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

06yq | Microdosing with psychedelics to self-medicate for ADHD symptoms in adults: A naturalistic study

2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

cuin | think about certain matters. In order to connect with these people you may have to use their language at the outset. This does not make it your language. You remember the saying: 'To a hungry man, "two and two" means "four loaves of bread'"? If you are speaking to a hungry man, your first words might well be about bread.
n1i7 | If you want a shorter answer to the inference that Sufis simply want to titillate, here is an old proverb:
0r5m | 'If you believe it, and think that you are sure of it, know that you are in fact in need of improvement. Being sure and believing are stages to be superseded on the Path to Certainty.'
ne2o | Words like 'secret', too, are technical terms among the Sufis. A better rendition of 'secret' is often 'innermost consciousness'.
sqxn | When to have Meetings
6pmo | Q: People hear about something and immediately crave it, as you have pointed out. Why does just any meeting with a teacher or a source of knowledge not produce results for the student?
195r | THE SPRING OF SWEET WATER
kqmi | A: There is a Persian saying, from the classical Gulistan of Saadi, to this effect:
g8rd | Wherever a spring of sweet water may be -
nns9 | Men, birds and ants will circle around it.
9uwy | Wherever there is a source of attraction, people will surround it, in accordance with their nature. I say, 'in accordance with their nature' because human beings resemble animals in being attracted to the aspect of things which immediately attracts them. As with animals, sometimes these things are suitable for them, sometimes not.
srly | Let me be more specific. You hear about a teaching and what you hear attracts you. Or perhaps you want to find out more about it. This means, to you, that you should with the least delay make a contact with this teaching. The assumption here is that you can benefit from a contact made at your convenience or under circumstances dictated by you. This attitude is un- promising, because it does not correspond with what could happen.
dl6i | The only value of a teaching to you, and to the teaching itself, is when you become attuned to it in the way, at the time and under the circumstances which are best suited to a fruitful relationship with that teaching. 'Even a fish can only drink so much of the sea.'
89ub | In this respect the teaching is more subtle than, say, learning a language. You can get a book, or recordings, or a tutor, and study a language anywhere, at any time, whenever you can conveniently do so. And yet, even with learning a language, conditions must be
dhle | right. You must be in a certain mental and physical state: not too tired or too hungry, for instance. You must be in a comparatively comfortable place, not standing in the open in a downpour of rain, for example. You must have certain essentials: an electronic machine, electricity, or to be able to read, preferably not be deaf and so on. The ordinary man can grasp these needs in a learning situation which he organises for himself. He does not so readily bother to think about them in respect to higher knowledge. Why not?
2nib | Learning how to learn involves examining assumptions. Mulla Nasrudin tales very often fulfil this function.
naev | SHABISTARI ON ATTUNEMENT
7h0h | Shabistari, in his Secret Garden, alludes to the problem of attune- ment between teacher and learner, and between people and their ex- periences, emphasising that the harmony must be right: TUumina- tion is sometimes of grandeur and sometimes of beauty [its] perfection is between the two.'
a64c | People crave things, you say, and you are right. But if the thing which they crave, in this case Sufi knowledge, is qualitative and not quantitative, an adjustment to quality must take place before learning can take place.
gi7n | Consider the fact that Sufi teachers give subjects and other materials to students to study so that a result may be seen when it can take place, and not just by an arbitrary 2.30 pm the follow- ing afternoon. People who are victims of the belief that learning takes place mechanically or by instant illumination cannot profit from this, because they reject a whole range of the interaction between the teacher and themselves.
3pn1 | Any meeting with a teacher can produce results, but it is the student who will inhibit these results, because of the shallowness of his expectations. We have published numerous tales which illus- trate this point on learning how to learn.
wjuz | Is this why you seem to discourage people from coming long Q: distances to see you, while they continue to arrive from the ends of the earth from Japan, Argentina, India, Canada, Samoa ... ?
3yxv | A: I do not discourage all such people. But there is a pattern, and I am glad to be able to share it with you, since it is one which lies at the very root of our studies. When I was a young disciple, I bad exactly the same question, and was in just the same sort of position as you. My teacher used to get letters and visits from people from all over the world. I asked him why he discouraged people who made (or were prepared to make) long and sometimes difficult journeys. What he told me I have found to be true, and even, if that is possible, doubly true. It was this:
d8zj | ATTITUDES OF DISCIPLES
ywxn | People tend to think first and mostly of themselves. This can mean that when they hear of our work, they passionately desire to take part in it, to leam more, to benefit themselves personally. When they do this it always means that they are feeding their own selfishness, and have become fixated on personal advantage.
uxhs | On the other hand, when people come into contact with our ideas and spread them to others in the right kind of way (that is, not cultishly or by setting themselves up as teachers) they are sharing as well as taking something in.
ed6e | Such people never clamour first of all to be received, seen, taught, and so on. They cultivate a group of people, spread this knowledge as best they can, and then they ask whether they should come or whether someone might visit them. They are, in fact, in a condition to learn and to serve as well as to be served. This estab- lishes the continuum of serving and being served.
6qqm | Others, on the other hand, spend large amounts of money to travel, collecting it sometimes from others, and think only of themselves, even if they do not realise it. If they do not see this behaviour in themselves it is for us to point it out to them, so that they can profit from so doing, and learn to readjust their greed by establishing the serve and be served continuum. This is what my teacher taught me. He used to say: 'Many people think I am only testing them when I send them messages to this effect or if I do not answer them, giving them an opportunity to change their approach from "Give me" to "What can I do?" but you will see, in this very place, how the people who come here under such
onum | 39
3iir | conditions turn out to be unreachable, mere metaphysical tourists.' He was completely right. So, by refusing to teach, he gave them an opportunity of learning this behaviour of their own through self- observation. Some of them, although only a minority, actually learned this. Of course, we have been able to cut down very much on this difficulty by publishing anecdotes where it has been shown by classical and other teachers how anxiety to learn is sometimes a mask for self-interest. This has enabled quite large numbers of people to adopt a correa posture towards the Teaching.
7a0a | Learning how to learn is well illustrated by this kind of ap- proach, and this does show how one and the same person can be unable to profit from the Teaching while he or she insists on ex- tending this greed side of the personality towards it, and how the same person may be able to leam when applying the better and more promising side towards it.
o1qp | But do not forget that there are just as many who do not know how to teach as there are who cannot, in their present state, learn. There is even the circumstance that people who think that they can teach, are unconcerned about the learning side.
jrik | HOW A LANGUAGE WAS TAUGHT
xv78 | Only the other day I found a delightful example of this mentality when talking to a language teacher. He said: 'I have a marvellous system, all my own. I taught it to a man who enrolled as a private pupil. I taught him absolutely perfectly.'
sdks | I said, in the usual rhetorical way people use in general con- versations: 'So he knows the language very well now, does he?'
y8fb | 'Not a word,' said the teacher. 'I taught him perfectly, but he just would not learn,'
521q | The Ceiling
yogo | Q: Can you give me an example, in parallel or parable terms, of the area in which Sufi teaching operates, and how it is done?
2285 | A: Our teaching speaks of, and exists partly in, 'another world', a 'higher realm', a 'different dimension'.
ys0g | Here is a parallel of what this means, in one significant way, and what the object of the Teaching is.
7zvp | THE UNKNOWN CEILING
ww6u | Suppose we have a house with walls, ceilings, floors, and we are inside that house. Let us say that through long-established custom, people can touch and deal with only the floors and walls. If someone were to walk in and say: 'Look at the ceiling,' the people would be incapable of doing so-rather like a child which often cannot see something, certainly cannot observe it, unless it has been demonstrated to it.
hpi6 | Suppose, further, that the custom of generations was to hang things on walls and not to have anything on the ceilings. Objects on the ceilings might then be 'invisible' to the people at large.
4uhb | So it is with our teaching. We frequently and abundandy assert that people do not think things through, that they make assump- tions (such as 'there is no ceiling') which they do not attempt to verify. But, like the intelligent man who would be trying to point out the existence of the ceilings, we do more than constandy draw attention back to the theoretical postulate ('there may be ceilings').
epyi | We provide, in instructional courses, meetings, contact with teachers, observation materials, exercises, call them what you like, the practical means to establish and maintain for the community which is being addressed the experience of the existence of 'ceilings'.
y51p | WHERE TO FIND TRUTH
x95m | Careful preparation is necessary before people can perceive some- thing which is there all the time. Saadi of Shiraz rightly referred to this in poetic terms when he said: 'The Adept sees that same thing in a camel/as in the beautiful ones of China or Chagil.'
yfum | Again, by the application of a certain concentration capacity, some people induce others to externalise their inner thoughts, as a teaching method. These thoughts betray the character and opera- tion of the secondary self, the false personality which, although enabling people to handle many of the circumstances of life, has as its objective the maintenance of itself: and not the progress of the individual beyond quite narrow and shallow limits.
ppx4 | WORKING ON THE 'COMMANDING SELF'
qf11 | This Commanding Self (in Sufi classical literature styled the Nafs-i-Ammard), is manifested by reactions, hopes and fears and various opinions and preoccupations.
8oqt | By bringing its operation into view, its limitations, distortions and peculiarities can be observed, both by the individual himself and by observers. This 'self is actually largely what most people imagine to be their own personalities, their own and only selves; and it is interposed between objective reality and the real self, the essence, of the individual, whose realisation is the purpose of Sufi study.
6zah | Sometimes the manifestation of this self is characterised by ideas or behaviour attributed to other people, as can happen in a dream. One modern technician with knowledge of such things has remarked: 'It is as if the mental computer has been induced electronically to repeat a part of its programming ..
4v5o | The reverse effect is also possible, when the Teacher [Murshid] imparts to the mind of the disciple [Murid] concepts which can reach the essence and which therefore cannot be conveyed by the ordinary methods employed in communicating with the conven- tional self.
ha9e | THE PRECIOUS PEARL
xrnt | People have tried to cultivate this capacity for purposes of per- sonal ambition and, since this is indeed partially possible, its methodology is carefully protected.
c8ra | Such works as Ibn Arabi's Durrat al-Fakhha, 'Precious Pearl' give numerous instances both of this mechanism and of how it tends to be independent of what people customarily regard as systematic operation. It can, for example, arise unbidden. It works in people whom one would not immediately suspect of possessing it-because of our usual assumptions about any such capacity. It may not operate at all. Sometimes it is willed, sometimes not. On occasions it functions whether the faculty is being used for 'good' (socially acceptable) purposes or not. Traditionally, it can also work for what seem to be trivial purposes, as has been noted with similar extrasensory activity in more recent Western studies. These facts can make it all the more interesting, since such characteristics are not in accord with the usual folkloric beliefs about such matters and tend to lack inherent relationships with occultism, more directly resembling more modern communications phenomena, though in a very refined form.
p1l0 | UNDERSTANDING WITH THE HEART
1i8b | 'The Sufis,' runs the saying, 'understand with their hearts what the most learned scholars cannot understand with their minds.'
5sfj | The results of the encounter with the Sufi may or may not be at the time or place desired by the learner. They may or may not follow immediately. Other things may have to happen before the full benefit of the meeting can be perceived.
vk4h | One of the more obvious factors at work in such relationships is pointed out in the tale in my book The Dermis Probe, entitled 'Pomegranates'.
nsm3 | WORK AND WORK
jdfw | Q: Why do Sufis expect people to do physical and mental work; why do they so often have establishments which have to be kept going by labour?
uc9r | 43
l0ap | A: I first came across this question in myself, when I was living in a Sufi settlement where everyone had to work. There were so many important and influential - and moneyed - people who visited the place that I used to wonder why our Teacher did not 'professionalise' things, and employ gardeners and so on, rather than having so many people doing things that some of them were manifestly not accustomed to doing.
x815 | I asked him one evening when he called for questions: There are people constandy offering large sums of money to us. Would it not give more opportunities for study if we used this money to run the establishment?'
epbj | DEVELOPING ONE'S OWN UNDERSTANDING
nmn2 | As is the custom among Sufis, he told me to go away and find the answers myself, and then to come back when I had them, to see whether I was only asking frivolous questions. So I spent three or four weeks on the subject.
g3tm | First I wrote down all the possible reasons I could think of, then I wandered about looking at the way in which things were being done, studying life through life, until I came up with the answers. They were these, and by giving them to you I am doing you no favour, since if you had worked them out yourself you would have gained more. As it is, I will have to give you the opportunity of learning something equivalent by some other pro- cedure :
