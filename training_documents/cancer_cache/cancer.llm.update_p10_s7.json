        "content": "87cq | To the best of our knowledge, most of the metallodrug evaluation studies that incorporate three-D models use spheroid-based models, as summarized in Table one, which depicts the advantages, disadvantages, and complexity of each cancer three-D model, as well as published literature on the application of three-D models for metallodrug preclinical testing. This could be related to the fact that protocols for the spheroid production of several cancer cell lines have already been well established. In comparison with other three-D models, spheroids are relatively easy and inexpensive to obtain, while still providing a three-D structure that can replicate the aspects of in vivo tumors. More recently, some studies have already started incorporating organoid and tumoroid models in their research. The complexity of these models not only allows for better mimicking the in vivo tumor, increasing the relevancy of the study, but also introduces aspects of precision medicine, which are essential for future clinical applications. Additionally, microengineering approaches, especially three-D bioprinting, have gained interest lately, due to their ability to precisely control key aspects of experimental conditions. In the following sections, a brief description of the types of assays performed in these models will be presented, as well as the most illustrative examples of preclinical biological evaluation of metallodrugs in three-D models.\n0qs3 | Five point one. Assays Performed on Three-D Models\nz8f7 | The application of three-D models to test the anti-tumoral activity of metallodrugs has mainly focused on the assessment of cytotoxicity, penetration, and evaluation of metabolic effects.\n7w7j | Five point one point one. Cytotoxicity Assays\n51vd | Cytotoxicity can be defined as the toxicity induced by chemotherapeutic drugs in live cells. The viability of three-D models can be assessed after incubation with the metallodrugs through several methods, such as the alamar blue assay, MTT assay, CellTiter-Glo three-D Viability Assay, or acid phosphatase assay. These methods use different metabolic reactions to evaluate the number of viable cells in the three-D models after exposure to the metallodrug. The alamar blue and MTT assays are based on the reduction of resazurin or tetrazolium salts, measuring the mitochondrial activity, while the CellTiter-Glo three-D Viability Assay indicates cell viability through ATP measurement and the acid phosphatase assay quantifies the cytosolic acid phosphatase activity.\nbaj1 | Five point one point two. Penetration Assays\nn1wo | One of the factors responsible for drug resistance may be the inability of anti-cancer drugs to penetrate solid tumors. The tumor penetration of the compound is thus an essential aspect that needs to be studied to obtain optimal drug efficiency. As discussed previously, fluorescence imaging is a complex technique to image spheroids and tumoroids, which has some disadvantages. Additionally, in most circumstances, metal complexes have to be tagged with fluorophores to be detected through this technique, which may affect the distribution of the compound. The capacity of the metallodrugs to penetrate tumor models can also be assessed using a combination of analytic and imaging tools, such as laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, synchrotron X-ray fluorescence, or matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometric imaging.\n5bq3 | Five point one point three. Metabolomics Assays\nezla | Omics approaches have been proven to be strong methods for studying drug susceptibility, drug resistance, and mechanisms of action. Metabolic patterns are widely considered accurate predictors of phenotypes and such patterns could be used to predict or better understand the anti-tumoral activity of metallodrugs. One approach to studying the metabolites of spheroids after exposure to metallodrugs is using LC-MS-based metabolomics, in which liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry are combined. Although not described so far for the study of metallodrugs, other omics studies with different approaches for liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry, seahorse assay, and metabolic imaging have already been used in cancer three-D models.\nrsbu | Five point two. Selected Examples of the Evaluation of Metallodrugs in Three-D Models\nmagd | In order to highlight the relevance of the use of three-D models in cancer research, the most relevant applications of these models for metallodrug evaluation will be presented, focusing on discrete metal complexes rather than nanomaterials. From a limited number of reports in the literature, the examples presented next were selected based on the diversity of metals (and metalloids) explored, on the different three-D models and types of assays performed, and on the tumor types.\ntb74 | Five point two point one. A Ruthenium-Based Five-Fluorouracil Complex with Enhanced Cytotoxicity in Colon Carcinoma\n8l69 | Silva et al. synthesized a novel ruthenium-based compound, Ru five-FU PPh three two bipy, and tested its effect on cell-based models. Complexes containing five-fluorouracil five-FU are commonly used to treat colon and rectal carcinoma, so the cytotoxicity of this compound was studied in human colon carcinoma HCT one one six cells.\n1jyv | The cytotoxicity of the complex was first tested in several tumoral and healthy cell lines using the alamar blue assay. The cytotoxicity was presented in terms of IC fifty, which corresponds to the amount of a drug required to inhibit a biological process or response by fifty percent. The HCT one one six cells were determined as the most sensitive to the compound\nolce | Ru five-FU PPh three two bipy, with an IC fifty of one point five micromolars. The cytotoxicity was also evaluated in HCT one one six spheroids grown at a density of five thousand cells per well in U-bottom low adhesion plates, presenting an IC fifty of one point seven micromolars, as depicted in Figure two. As two-D models are reported to be less resistant to drugs than three-D models, it is expected that the IC fifty is lower. However, comparing the IC fifty obtained for the two-D and three-D models it is possible to see that the difference between the two types of models is very small. So, this complex also presents high cytotoxicity at lower concentrations in three-D models, which suggests that it has great potential for treating solid tumors. This should be further studied in more complex models, such as tumoroids, in order to verify the therapeutic potential of the compound. Overall, Ru five-FU PPh three two bipy presented higher cytotoxicity in tumoral cells than five-FU in both two-D and three-D cell models.\nerx1 | Five point two point two. Boron Clusters as a Novel Therapy against Glioblastoma\nb3bt | Metallacarboranes are three-D aromatic complexes composed of a central metal ion, usually cobalt or iron, that is the common vertex of two joined icosahedrons, with interesting advantages in terms of their high stability, water solubility, and redox potential. Similar to carboranes, these compounds are tunable, but the metal core adds additional features regarding the redox potential and the charge of the molecule.",
