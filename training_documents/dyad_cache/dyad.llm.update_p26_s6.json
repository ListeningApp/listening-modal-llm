        "content": "seik | The most critical mistakes (\"scandalous\" and \"foolish\") involved MacArthur's mistaken estimate of the magnitude of the Chinese threat in November. In part, it was the outcome of the Bataan Gang mentality that provided him with information and estimation please. But it was MacArthur, primarily his paranoia and narcissistic personality, who created this atmosphere, and we will elaborate on this subject. We will also present two additional patterns of behavior which he exhibited prior to the November fiasco: an overly optimistic estimate of the balance of forces before the outbreak of four war; and a drive, motivated by political and operational considerations, to end every confrontation as soon as possible.\noq7c | Although many biographies discuss the relationship between MacArthur's strategy and personality, only a few attempted to analyze his strategy as a function of his personality and none did it within the Korean War context. Manchester provides a good short description of this personality:\nz4mi | He was a great thundering paradox of man, noble and ignoble, inspiring and outrageous, arrogant and shy, the best of men and the worst of men, the most protean, most ridiculous, and most sublime. No more baffling, exasperating soldier ever wore a uniform. Flamboyant, imperious, and apocalyptic, he carried the plumage of a flamingo, could not acknowledge errors, and tried to cover up his mistakes with sly, childish tricks.\nhkft | Manchester specifically relates MacArthur's paranoia as a salient component of his psyche:\njai3 | The General's paranoia never lay more than a fraction of a millimeter below the surface of his thoughts. \"They\" had conspired against his father, \"they\" had refused to decorate him after his Vera Cruz adventure, \"they\" had undercut him in France in nineteen eighteen, \"they\" had forced him into retirement in nineteen thirty-seven, \"they\" had refused to reinforce his defense of Corregidor and Bataan, \"they\" had sent an inferior B-seventeen to Cagayan, and \"they\" were waiting even now to thwart him again.\np57i | The prime suspect of MacArthur's envy and paranoia was George Marshall, who was the same age and had performed brilliantly as a staff officer under Pershing in World War One. Marshall was probably one of the \"deskbound men who envied and resented\" MacArthur as \"a fighting officer.\" When MacArthur became chief of staff, he exiled Marshall to run the Illinois National Guard. No wonder then that during the war MacArthur, now serving under Marshall, who had become chief of staff in nineteen thirty-nine, believed that Marshall and others plotted\nu5ug | against him. Sheer classic projection may have added to his belief, whereby he assumed that others would behave toward him as he would toward them if their situations were reversed. He even expressed the belief that the \"Germany First\" policy formulated by Roosevelt and Churchill was a conspiracy to deny him the resources he needed to win the war in the Pacific. In addition to Marshall, who was \"working against him at all times,\" he also blamed the Supreme Allied Commander in Europe, Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower. The two had had a stormy relationship since Eisenhower ended his job as MacArthur's assistant in the Philippines in the late nineteen thirties, and MacArthur blamed him for undermining his work and \"stealing publicity.\" Gen. Robert Eichelberger, a corps commander under MacArthur, noted when describing this paranoid way of thinking that stealing \"any publicity from MacArthur was like driving a dagger into his heart.\"\ni9k5 | MacArthur's paranoia did not fade away after nineteen forty-five. During the Korean War he was certain that the chief of staff, Omar Bradley, hated him since he had rejected Bradley as a senior commander when planning the invasion of Japan in nineteen forty-five. And even his nineteen sixty-four memoirs were colored by his paranoia. Twenty-two years after the decision to prevent the release of a statement he prepared on Japanese atrocities in the \"Bataan Death March,\" he wrote, \"Perhaps the Administration, which was committed to a Europe-first effort, feared American public opinions would demand a greater reaction against Japan.\"\n20z2 | MacArthur's paranoia can be linked to his deep sense of family heritage, particularly his father's career. He was born into an aristocratic family. His father was the youngest colonel in the Union Army during the Civil War and occupied the Philippines in nineteen hundred. Afterward, however, despite being the highest-ranking officer in the Army, his military career came to a dead end (for which his son blamed others). MacArthur's mother lived through his success—she spent four years in West Point watching over him during his studies in the military academy—and she \"sent him out not merely to avenge the wrongs done to his father but to compete against him.\"\n4cgs | Douglas MacArthur's need to be worthy of the heritage of his family and redeem his father's end of career constitutes a partial explanation for his narcissist personality: his grandiose sense of self-importance, conviction of his rightness, sensitivity to criticism and demand for admiration, tendency to get into power struggles, and his desire to take credit for himself and place blame on others. Narcissism in general, and paranoia in particular, explain his need to form a group of loyal and admiring officers—some of whom were highly talented—who would provide the recognition he so desperately craved, particularly during the difficult years in the Philippines and Australia. In November nineteen fifty, this mentality provided support that was needed to bridge the gap between his goal of ending the war by Christmas and the reality of the battlefield.\nhtre | In addition to narcissism and paranoia, other patterns help to understand MacArthur's conduct on the eve of the fiasco. One was his constant unrealistic optimism concerning the balance of forces prior to the breakout of war, and disregard of his Asian enemies. In nineteen thirty-nine, he doubted if \"an enemy could concentrate superior forces at any vital Philippine area\" and estimated that a Japanese blockade would be \"practically unfeasible without the tacit agreement of the other nations surrounding the Pacific.\" On the eve of the attack on Pearl Harbor, he was certain that war would not start before spring. When it started, he defined the Japanese blockade on the Philippines as a \"paper blockade.\" When the Korean War started, he was contemptuous of the fighting capabilities of the K.P.A., and despite their initial military achievements did not change his mind, believing that if he could put the First Cavalry Division into Korea, \"those fellows scuddle up to the Manchurian border so quick, you would see no more of them.\"",
