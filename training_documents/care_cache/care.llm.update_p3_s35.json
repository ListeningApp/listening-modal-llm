        "content": "0fpw | Consideration of the context for the research also differs substantively across the efficacy-effectiveness-implementation spectrum. Efficacy trials value conducting a trial that is invariant from beginning to end. This entails sometimes extraordinary efforts at training clinicians and tracking subjects, so that the research team's efforts amount at times to \"crypto-case management\" (i.e., aggressive subject engagement and follow-up outreach) to ensure close follow-up and minimal data loss-which is not a problem since the focus of the trial is solely on testing the intervention under optimal conditions. However, since effectiveness studies are more concerned with the performance of an efficacious intervention in real-world settings, careful attention is paid to limiting the amount of research-funded effort that is incorporated into the protocol, often \"firewalling\" research effort with carefully and explicitly defined parameters. Further, for implementation trials, trying to optimize the natural context in which uptake is being measured is a threat to the validity of the trial. Thus, researcher involvement at the sites is drastically circumscribed, with\ndqn8 | some implementation trials even limiting research support to training endogenous clinicians and utilizing remote, \"light-touch\" outcome assessments for patient and provider subjects.\ncop0 | These differences across the efficacy-effectiveness-implementation spectrum are reflected in radically different priorities regarding trial validity. As noted above, in efficacy studies internal validity prioritizes establishing a causal connection between the intervention and the outcome; in the service of this aim, the sample, outcome measurements, and intervention are all highly controlled without consideration of applicability beyond the specific trial itself. In effectiveness studies, external validity prioritizes the generalizability of trial results to other relevant populations and situations; accordingly, although the effectiveness trial must have sufficient internal validity to carry out the study successfully, explicit design decisions are made that value generalizability beyond the trial itself. Finally, implementation trials, in contrast to both types of clinical trials, aim at arriving at the optimal implementation strategy, and maximal innovation impact, by the end of the study. Note, however, that in subtle ways such \"mid-course corrections\" are the case for all types of trials, including especially efficacy trials, in which intervention fidelity data are assiduously collected throughout the study and adjustments in training and even personnel are made to ensure internal validity. The difference between clinical trials and implementation trials is that in the latter such modifications are planned for a priori and are often the focus of specific study hypotheses, under the rubric of \"formative evaluation.\"\nlhkq | Thus, in overly simplistic terms, the clinical researcher establishes the efficacy and then effectiveness of an innovation, and then hands it off to the implementation scientist to test ways of getting people to use it. This process as stated is overly simplistic because it suggests a unidimensional flow of tasks (like our pipeline in Fig. one). In reality, the process is much more iterative as implementation experience may suggest changes in the clinical innovation to increase its external\n82ju | validity (while also taking steps to ensure fidelity to its core components, supporting internal validity).\ny2qo | Four point two. Implementation science versus quality improvement and dissemination research\n1piq | Implementation science also differs from quality improvement, which usually begins with a specific problem rather than a practice to promulgate. It typically focuses on an individual clinic, hospital, or system, and tends not to seek to contribute generalizable knowledge. It also differs from traditional dissemination research, which usually focuses on the spread of information using communication and education strategies. However, the purpose and methods of these three fields often overlap, as you will see in the articles that follow in this issue.\n7fqw | Four point three. The scope of implementation science\nrhaz | Thus, not surprisingly, implementation science involves investigation at more levels than just the individual patient or subject. Targets of investigation may also include the provider, clinic, facility, organization, community, and even the policy environment.\nwak1 | Thus, also not surprisingly given the central role of context in implementation science, implementation researchers include not just clinicians and clinical scientists but also social scientists, economists, systems engineers and health services researchers. Additionally, special mention should be made of the relationship between implementation researchers and their \"operational partners\" with whom a clinical innovation is to be deployed: healthcare system leaders, administrators, and staff who run and staff the clinics, facilities, and organizations (and sometimes also including policymakers). Unlike clinical research, in which such individuals and structures play a primarily permissive or\nwtfz | passively supportive role, in implementation research operational colleagues need to be full partners in the research from study design through analysis, since implementation research aims to assess and actively intervene in their structures, where they are the experts. While there are cultural gaps between researchers and healthcare system leaders and staff that must be overcome, their participation is essential since an innovation will be implemented because of them, not in spite of them.\nqy1i | Four point four. Summary\n1k9e | In summary, implementation science seeks to \"continue the job\" of biomedical research, taking evidence-based clinical innovations and testing strategies to move them into wider practice. Given this goal, the principles and methods of implementation science differ somewhat from clinical research. Most centrally, implementation science protocols do not ignore or control for context but rather actively seek to intervene to change the context in which clinical innovations are used in order to enhance their uptake. Importantly, implementation scientists interface closely with healthcare leaders and staff as partners, breaking down the research-practice divide in order to achieve the ultimate goal of increasing the public health impact of evidence-based innovations.\n5bjs | A number of exciting challenges face the rapidly developing field of implementation science. First and foremost, further integration of implementation science methodologies into clinical trial designs will speed the development of evidence-based interventions that have demonstrable public health impact.\nuodj | In addition, development of efficient methodologies for data collection with minimal disruption to the processes under study will be important in order to minimize the Hawthorne effect in both descriptive studies and controlled trials. Testing and validating the theories that underlie implementation efforts is needed to enhance the development of next-generation analytic methods and interventions. Finally, the development of an investigator workforce with diverse and complementary skills, and provision of sustainable academic careers for them, remains a central challenge to the field.\nk16v | Five. Conclusion: overview of this special issue\nb2lm | This Special Issue is designed to serve as an introduction to the principles, concepts, and methods of implementation science. The articles have been written particularly for clinical scientists interested in how to increase the public health impact of their work.\nti7f | The Special issue provides articles on topics in two general areas, the first is those that are foundational to implementation science such as the conceptual background and specific methodologies that are core to this field of study. The second area are a set of articles that address special and emerging topics within implementation science including an expansion of case study analysis through a matrix process, the application of implementation science in global settings and capacity-building and training opportunities. Each of the manuscripts includes a review of underlying principles, introduction to relevant methods, and an example from a real-world, funded study that illustrates and amplifies the principles and methods discussed.\noksu | Foundational topics:\nwtow | Ms. Damschroder discusses the role of theories, frameworks, and models in implementation science, which are critical in identifying which, among all the \"moving parts\" of healthcare, are relevant to specific implementation efforts.",
