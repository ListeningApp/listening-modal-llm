        "content": "qzor | Modulus of M superscript zeta as a function of t and x squared equals one almost everywhere, Norm of gradient M superscript zeta subscript L superscript infinity of the positive real numbers to L superscript two of Omega is less than or equal to constant, Norm of gradient partial t M superscript zeta in L squared of the positive real numbers to L squared of Omega is less than or equal to C zeta superscript negative one, Norm of partial t M superscript zeta in L squared of the positive real numbers to L squared of Omega is less than or equal to constant.\na0by | We also have the following.\nu1ky | Lemma eight. The sequence M superscript zeta is compact in\nhtm9 | L subscript loc superscript two of the positive real numbers to L squared of Omega. Lemmas seven and eight imply the following convergence results.\n8hul | Lemma nine. There exists a subsequence still denoted by m superscript zeta such that\n87vz | Twenty-four\nym66 | M superscript zeta weakly star converges to M in L superscript infinity of the positive real numbers to H superscript one of Omega, Partial t M superscript zeta weakly converges to partial t M in L squared of the positive real numbers to H superscript negative one of Omega, Gradient M superscript zeta weakly converges to gradient M in L squared of the positive real numbers to L squared of Omega, Gradient partial t M superscript zeta strongly converges to zero in L subscript loc superscript squared of the positive real numbers to L squared of Omega, Partial t M superscript zeta strongly converges to zero in L subscript loc superscript squared of the positive real numbers to L squared of Omega, M superscript zeta strongly converges to M in L subscript loc superscript squared of the positive real numbers to lowercase l squared of Omega. Moreover, M satisfies the saturation condition modulus of M equals one.\nl0a3 | The above convergences allow one to conclude.\nu8nw | Theorem ten. Let M be the limit of a subsequence of M superscript zeta as zeta goes to positive infinity. Then, the domain Omega is uniformly magnetized.\nl2v9 | Remark eleven. The result of Theorem ten is of interest. In fact, the added term in the effective field can act as a control for magnetization switching.\nafbe | Our aim now is to pass to the limit as zeta goes to zero in one. We denote by M superscript zeta a global weak solution of LLG equation one associated with zeta and the initial data M subscript zero and satisfying the energy inequality seven. The bound on square root of zeta times gradient partial t M superscript zeta in L squared of zero to tilde T semicolon L squared of Omega allows one to get the following.\n78r8 | Theorem twelve. Let M be the limit of a subsequence of M superscript zeta. Then, M satisfies\n320g | Partial t M minus alpha M times partial t M equals negative one plus alpha squared M times D Laplace M in positive real numbers times Omega, M of zero equals M subscript zero in Omega, M times D partial n M equals zero on the boundary of Omega.\ntp8g | Twenty-five\ngxfd | Moreover, M satisfies the saturation condition modulus of M of t and x equals one almost everywhere.\ns2v1 | Remark thirteen. From twenty-five, we can say that, for lower values of zeta, the magnetic nonlocal damping vanishes and the classical switching continues forever. In other words, the magnetization precesses several times around the effective field direction before it reaches equilibrium.\njkp9 | Four. Concluding Remarks\nz8tt | In this paper, we have considered nonlocal damping in magnetization dynamics. The model consists of a generalized LLG equation that contains a term characterizing nonlocal damping expressed in terms of Laplace partial t M in the effective field. The long time behaviour of the solutions is characterized and the sensitivity of the model to nonlocal damping parameter",
