I sat scrunched up in a children's miniature play chair. My knees almost touched my chest, even with my feet firmly planted on the old beige carpeted floor. My laptop felt hot sitting atop my steeply angled knees. Dolls and toys were scattered around me. They stared at me with wide eyes and toothy grins, motionless. I had been their entertainment the past few weeks.\nztv3 | I was in Leila's parents' house. They had recently become grandparents and used this spare bedroom as a playroom when the grandchildren visited. I didn't have a place to live. So they were letting Leila and I stay there \"as long as we needed.\" They had let me use the children's playroom as my office for my \"business,\" which at this point felt almost as make-believe as the stories they had told their grandchildren in this room.\nd6tt | I literally felt like I was playing dress-up. Except the stakes were real. And this was my life.\now58 | My ears were hot and red from the phone being pressed against them for what felt like hours. I kept switching hands because my arms would tire from holding the phone up for so long.\nrhnw | \"I'm sorry Mr. Hormozi,\" the voice on the other end of the line said, \"we have to hold onto these funds for the next six months. We've seen some irregular activity, so this is precautionary.\"\n78ub | \"Are you fucking kidding me, one hundred twenty grand,\" I said. \"A 'precaution'!?\"\n49qz | \"I'm sorry sir, our underwriting team—\"\nvw2p | \"Yeah, I heard you,\" I said, cutting him off. \"I don't accept that.\"\njkfz | \"Sir, it's not up to me it's just our pol—\"\n1jrv | \"What am I gonna tell my salesman, who has a baby and another on the way? Are you going to tell him he's not going to be able to buy his pregnant wife and newborn food? Are you going to pay his mortgage for him?\" I was seething.\nurci | \"Sir—\" he began again, with unphased apathy, just trying to deliver the news.\nzrmd | \"It's not yours to take.\" My aggression was quickly turning into desperation. \"Shit, just send me half so I can pay my employees,\" I pleaded. \"It's Christmas Eve for fuck's sake.\"\nvret | \"Sir, we're going to be holding onto the entirety of your funds for the next six months per your agreement...\" The voice faded into the distance.\nurmw | Fuck.\nhqf9 | I hung up and checked my accounts. Twenty-three thousand thirty-six dollars.\n7ahf | I owed my salesman a twenty-two thousand dollar commission check for one hundred twenty thousand dollars in sales I never got. Without wanting to give myself the opportunity to think about it, I wired it to him.\n1lig | Negative twenty-two thousand dollars. Payment Successful.\npr1i | Balance one thousand thirty-six dollars. Fuck.\n7k5c | I screenshotted this image of my bank account because I knew I would tell this story someday.",
