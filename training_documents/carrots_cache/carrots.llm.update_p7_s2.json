        "content": "cq4s | We find in our sample a heavy reliance on carrots. To induce executives to cooperate in selling their firms, VCs frequently offer sale bonuses. In sixteen of the fifty firms, VCs pay an average sale bonus of one point six three million dollars. In eleven of fifty firms, VCs give common shareholders as a class an average of three point seven million dollars extra. In forty-five percent of the firms, VCs give at least one type of carrot, with these carrots on average amounting to nine percent of the deal's value. Across all fifty firms in our sample, an average of four point three percent of deal value-two point four percent on a dollar-weighted basis-is used to fund these two types of carrots: sale bonuses and carve-outs to common.\nwot7 | We also find some use of sticks, such as threats to blacklist founders who refuse to cooperate and attempts to undermine common shareholders' voting rights. But the overt use of these sticks is relatively infrequent. And although sixty percent of the founders in our firms are replaced before the sale, we find no evidence that VCs fired or threatened to fire founders to ease the sales of firms.\niora | Our study makes three important contributions to the literature. First, it sheds light on an important but underexplored aspect of corporate governance in private, VC-backed firms. In particular, it highlights the potentially divergent interests of different players in VC-backed firms around trade-sale exits and shows that VCs frequently must overcome potential opposition to these sales.\nh9b8 | Second, our study provides additional evidence that managers of a target firm can extract value by holding up a sale of the firm. Researchers have reported on the use of side payments to executives in the sale of publicly traded firms. We show that such \"bribes\" are used not only in public firms with dispersed ownership but also in closely held private firms.\nbmnm | Third, our study provides some evidence on whether VCs are constrained from abusing their power in startups. The relatively infrequent use of sticks in our sample supports the view that reputational or other nonlegal considerations substantially constrain (but do not completely prevent) sharp-elbowed behavior by VCs in Silicon Valley.\nqesj | The remainder of the Article is structured as follows: Part One describes the typical structure of VC cash-flow and exit-facilitating control rights in startup firms. Part Two explains why founders, other executives, and common shareholders may wish to impede a trade sale as well as the means they have\nddaf | Carrots and Sticks\n1eh9 | to do so. Part Three describes the carrots and sticks that VCs may use to overcome such resistance. Part Four presents our dataset. Part Five describes the carrots and sticks actually used by VCs in our sample.\nlpsu | One\nyrsq | VCS' Cash-Flow and Control Rights\ngtej | A. VCs' Cash-Flow Rights\ncs35 | In the United States, VC-backed startups almost always issue two classes of stock: common and convertible preferred. The founders and employees of the startup hold the common stock. The convertible preferred stock is held by the VCs, who invest in startups almost exclusively through this type of security. Most venture-backed startups issue a new series of preferred stock for each round of financing.\nqm1o | Like most preferred stock, VCs' preferred shares carry a liquidation preference and are convertible into common stock. If VCs retain their preferred stock and preserve their liquidation preferences, those preferences must be satisfied before common shareholders receive any payment. In this scenario, the VCs' cash-flow rights resemble debt. If the VCs convert their preferred shares to common, giving up their liquidation preferences, the VCs have the same cash-flow rights as common shareholders. Thus, convertible\nq5t8 | Carrots and Sticks\n1iir | preferred stock combines downside protection with upside potential.\nfpmr | In a trade sale, the VCs will choose whether to exit as preferred shareholders and reap the benefits of their liquidation preferences or to exit as common shareholders. If the VCs exit via an IPO, underwriters will typically insist that the VCs convert their preferred shares to common shares and give up their liquidation preferences along with other rights attached to the preferred stock. To prevent holdouts, a startup's charter will, with respect to the holders of each series of preferred stock, generally either (a) require all of the holders of that series to convert to common stock or (b) allow a majority of the holders of that series to forcibly convert all holders of that series to common stock. Thus, one way or the other, VCs in IPO firms will typically exit as common shareholders.\n7f3y | B. VCs' Exit-Facilitating Control Rights\ng7we | To exit their investment, VCs must arrange an IPO, trade sale, or dissolution of the firm. Below, we describe the two types of control rights most relevant to facilitating an exit: one, the right to fill seats on the board of directors and two, shareholder-voting rights.\ncmmw | One. Board Seats\nf6og | The board of directors is responsible for managing the day-to-day business and affairs of the company. Critically, the board is also the only corporate body that can initiate fundamental transactions, such as mergers, IPOs, and dissolutions. These transactions, in turn, are almost always\nrgb8 | Carrots and Sticks\n1m13 | necessary for the VCs to exit; hence, we will call them \"VC exit transactions.\" Thus, VC exit transactions-including trade sales-cannot go forward without board approval. But, as we will see, board approval alone is not sufficient. Shareholder approval is also necessary.\nglst | The board, in turn, is elected-and can be replaced-by the shareholders. In the typical public company, default statutory-voting rules give the holder of each share one vote for each open board seat. By contrast, in a VC-backed firm, the parties typically negotiate a voting agreement that overrides default statutory voting rules. The agreement specifies the allocation of board seats among: one, representatives of the common shareholders; two, representatives of the VC investors; and three, so-called \"independent\" directors, who are mutually appointed by the common shareholders and the VCs and typically are industry experts or other outsiders with valuable experience and connections.\n4ufy | Because board approval is necessary for VC exits, VCs negotiate aggressively for board seats when investing in startups. While data on board composition in private, VC-backed firms are scarce, two persistent patterns emerge from various small-scale studies of VC contracting documents and VC-backed firms. First, VC board representation tends to increase with new financing rounds, especially outside rounds that bring in new VCs. Second, in a plurality of firms, neither common shareholders nor VC-appointed directors ever achieve outright control; the swing vote remains in the hands of an independent director. Keeping the swing vote in the hands of an independent director makes it more difficult for either the common shareholders or the preferred shareholders to act opportunistically with respect to the other class of shareholders. But as one of us has argued in\nrx7v | Carrots and Sticks\nbrvl | other work, these studies (and the outwardly neutral appearance of independent directors) may understate the extent of de facto VC control over startup boards.\n0aci | Two. Shareholder Rights\n5vxd | As noted above, for VCs seeking an exit transaction, board approval is not sufficient. Shareholder approval is also necessary.",
