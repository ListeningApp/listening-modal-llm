You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

pujl | Prevalence of stable and successfully treated periodontitis subjects and incidence of subsequent tooth loss within supportive periodontal care: A systematic review with meta-analyses
3rqe | Abstract
nsi3 | Aim: To identify (i) the prevalence of meeting the endpoints of 'stable periodontitis' (probing pocket depth <LATEX>\left[ P P D \right] \leq 4 m m ,</LATEX> bleeding on probing <LATEX>\left[ B o P \right] < 1 0 ,</LATEX> no BoP at 4 mm sites), 'endpoints of therapy' (no <LATEX>P P D > 4</LATEX> mm with BoP, no <LATEX>P P D \geq 6 m m ,</LATEX> 'con- trolled periodontitis' (≤4 sites with <LATEX>P P D \geq 5 m m ,</LATEX> 'PPD < 5 mm' and <LATEX>P P D < 6 \quad m m</LATEX> at the start of supportive periodontal care [SPC]) and (ii) the incidence of tooth loss in relation to not meeting these endpoints within a minimum of 5 years of SPC.
nil3 | Materials and Methods: Systematic electronic and manual searches were conducted to identify studies where subjects, upon completion of active periodontal therapy, entered into SPC. Duplicate screening was performed to find relevant articles. Corre- sponding authors were contacted to confirm inclusion and retrieve required clinical data for further analyses to assess the prevalence of reaching endpoints and inci- dence of subsequent tooth loss, if available, within at least 5 years of SPC. Meta- analyses were carried out to evaluate risk ratios for tooth loss in relation to not reaching the various endpoints.
68a1 | Results: Fifteen studies including 12,884 patients and 323,111 teeth were retrieved. Achievement of endpoints at baseline SPC was rare (1.35%, 11.00% and 34.62%, respectively, for 'stable periodontitis', 'endpoints of therapy' and 'controlled periodon- titis'). Less than a third of the 1190 subjects with 5 years of SPC data lost teeth-a total of 3.14% of all teeth were lost. Statistically significant associations with tooth loss, at the subject-level, were found for not achieving 'controlled periodontitis' (relative <LATEX>\left. r i s k \left[ R R \right] = 2 . 5 7 \right) ,</LATEX> PPD < 5 mm <LATEX>\left( R R = 1 . 5 9 \right)</LATEX> and
seik | <LATEX>P P D < 6 \quad m m \left( R R = 1 . 9 8 \right) .</LATEX> Conclusions: An overwhelming majority of subjects and teeth do not achieve the proposed endpoints for periodontal stability, yet most periodontal patients preserve most of their teeth during an average of 10-13 years in SPC.
oq7c | Clinical Relevance
z4mi | Scientific rationale for study: The risk of tooth loss is determined by clinical periodontal parameters as established in the literature. Composite measures have been established to determine when it is appropriate to end active periodontal therapy.
hkft | Principal findings: Only a small proportion of subjects reach currently defined endpoints of periodontal therapy, although tooth loss presents as a rare event in treated periodontitis. Practical implications: The findings are novel and can have a significant impact on clinical prac- tice, policy and research. It may be necessary to revisit the clinical endpoints of periodontal ther- apy to better reflect the risk of tooth loss during supportive periodontal care.
jai3 | 1 INTRODUCTION |
p57i | Defining periodontal health at the subject- and tooth-level is pivotal in establishing acceptable therapeutic endpoints and to evaluate indi- vidualized risk for periodontal disease progression. A successfully treated 'stable periodontitis' subject, as per the World Workshop Classification (WWC) 2017, is defined as one with probing pocket depth (PPD) ≤ 4 mm, no bleeding on probing (BoP) at 4 mm sites and BoP in <10% sites (Chapple et al., 2018). The European Federation of Periodontology (EFP) composed S3 treatment guideline-a four-step approach-to treat stages I-III periodontitis. Clinical guidelines for periodontal treatment should consider tangible outcomes-tooth sur- vival and re-treatment (Loos & Needleman, 2020). Based on evidence for disease progression (Claffey & Egelberg, 1995; Matuliene et al., 2008), EFP's S3 treatment guideline proposed 'endpoints of therapy' for a patient to enter supportive periodontal care (SPC)-no PPD > 4 mm with BoP and no PPD ≥ 6 mm (Sanz et al., 2020). A 'treat-to-target' approach has also been proposed. 'Controlled peri- odontitis', defined as having ≤4 sites with <LATEX>P P D \geq 5 m m ,</LATEX> incorporates the effects of different periodontal treatments (Feres et al., 2020).
u5ug | Guidance may present us with an ideal scenario where unless the endpoints are met, a subject should not enter into SPC. Yet, the evi- dence is unclear whether this is the reality within clinical practice. The aim of this systematic review is to assess the prevalence of treated periodontitis subjects who have met the following definitions:
i9k5 | · 'Stable periodontitis' (Chapple et al., 2018)
20z2 | · 'Endpoints of therapy' (Sanz et al., 2020)
4cgs | · 'Controlled periodontitis' (Feres et al., 2020)
htre | .
da3c | <LATEX>P P D < 5 \quad m m</LATEX> .
890q | <LATEX>P P D < 6 \quad m m</LATEX> With tooth loss being the final sequela of periodontitis, the proposed endpoints should be based on whether their unachievement results in increased tooth loss. Therefore, the relationships between the aforemen- tioned endpoints and subsequent tooth loss during a minimum of 5 years of SPC were also assessed, leading to the following focused questions:
jomo | . Focused question 1 (FQ-1): What is the prevalence of periodontitis in subjects who, at the start of SPC, meet the aforementioned endpoints?
06fi | · Focused question 2 (FQ-2): What is the incidence of periodontitis- related (when reported) or non-specific tooth loss among treated adult periodontitis subjects, using each of the above definitions, who have been in SPC for a minimum of 5 years?

cqq2 | 2.1 Protocol development and registration |
1ews | A systematic review protocol was prepared according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidance (Moher et al., 2009). Details of the protocol were registered on PROSPERO on 16 February 2022 (ID: CRD42022310238). Amendments were made to the original protocol to expand the num- ber of endpoints assessed.
afyn | 2.2 Eligibility criteria |
8sye | 2.2.1 PICOS components |
r04h | Population: Adult human subjects with periodontitis (excluding as a manifestation of systemic or necrotizing disease), who have completed active periodontal therapy (APT). Studies with inclu- sion/exclusion criteria that would affect the outcome of this sys- tematic review (i.e., prevalence of reaching endpoints) were excluded.
orpr | Intervention: APT encompasses many interventions ranging from behavioural changes to surgical interventions (Sanz et al., 2020). Stud- ies including a minimum of subgingival non-surgical periodontal ther- apy (NSPT) as part of their APT were selected (FQ-1).
