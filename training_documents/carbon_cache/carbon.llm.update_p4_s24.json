When discussing carbon dioxide emissions, the reviewed authors provide different results. Some authors found that foreign direct investments and trade contribute to economic growth and to the degradation of environment at the same time. Other authors showed that foreign direct investments and trade contribute to economic development due to technology development, productivity and efficiency gains, and promotion of new and more innovative processes and managerial skills resulting in the reduction of environmental impact in host countries. As far as income inequality is concerned, the mechanisms of foreign direct investments and trade openness differ, and the results of the estimations are different as well.\n2e62 | Therefore, the reviewed results display that, in the case of economic development, income inequality level and carbon dioxide emissions could change differently and separate channels affect these variables differently.\n75y3 | The approaches to the influence of income inequality on production- and consumption-based emissions.\ns2g2 | Almost all authors have analysed the relationship between income inequality and territorial or production-based carbon dioxide emissions. However, only few of the studies have estimated the consumption-based emissions or analysed the consumption-based emission inequality. Baker and Jorgenson emphasize that research should focus on international inequality impact on both consumption- and production-based carbon dioxide emissions. With respect to the production-based emissions, the leakage phenomenon should also be considered, which is defined as a process where the transfer of dirty industries to the emerging economies with weak regulatory systems rather than the increase in production efficiency and productivity accounts for the decrease of carbon dioxide emissions in the developed countries.\nq1q2 | Three theories have been proposed by the authors that theoretically analyse the approaches of relationship between income inequality and environmental impact: political economy explanation (in this paper, it is renamed as determination of environmental policies), which was suggested by Boyce; economic behaviours of households (the latter theory overlaps with the MPE theory), suggested by Ravallion et al., and \"Veblen effect\"; inequality determined changes in working time, which could also be attributed to \"Veblen effect\", discussed by Bowles and Park. These theories were widely discussed by other authors. However, the authors who presented these theories usually referred to the production-based emissions. Meanwhile, in this paper, it is assumed that all the abovementioned approaches do not\ncb7r | Political economy explanation.\n68xu | Economic behaviours of households.\nhd35 | Inequality determined changes in working time.\n2zpk | adequately explain the relationship between inequality and territorial (or production-based) carbon dioxide emissions. Thus, it is emphasized that the approaches should be separated when analysing the production and consumption-based carbon dioxide emissions. The following sections propose the separate approaches to the influence of income inequality on the production-based and consumption-based emissions.\nepu7 | The approaches to income inequality impact on production-based carbon dioxide emissions.\n7od1 | Regarding the production-based carbon dioxide emissions, only two of the abovementioned approaches are appropriate: determination of environmental policies and inequality determined changes in working time. Determination of environmental policies operates mainly via political influence due to the changes in income inequality. Boyce hypothesized that the increasing demand for \"the environment\" is related to the increase in income. Therefore, in the countries where the inequality level is usually low, the prevailing higher environmental standards condition lower levels of emissions. Other authors state that the reduction of environmental impact might request a higher political and economic equality at first. Meanwhile, according to Franzen and Vogl and Berthe and Elie, a higher level of income inequality causes the material and social problems to take priority over the environmental aspects. Thus, inequality renders the agreement on environmental policies and implementation of these policies more difficult. In developing countries, where the level of income inequality is usually high, the environmental standards are low. Grunewald et al. suggested that the growth of income inequality impedes environmental policy solutions to emerging issues, which subsequently conditions that the growth of inequality can contribute to the increase of air pollutions.\n0bqy | Besides, expensive environmental protection in wealthy countries generates the transfer of dirty production to poor countries, where the environmental standards are low. Consequently, due to the leakage phenomenon, the carbon dioxide emissions increase in developing or of higher inequality countries, while in developed or of lesser inequality countries, the pollution level decreases. Furthermore, within countries, rich communities reap disproportionate benefits from dirty activities and avoid the negative consequences of their production by moving polluting industrial activities into less rich areas. This reveals that income inequality promotes and enhances the implementation of environment-polluting projects, which strengthens the power of the rich society to impose environmental fine on the poor. Hence, for the less developed countries, inequality is as an obstacle for the mobilization of the collective effort essential for confronting environmental pollution and carbon dioxide emissions. Moreover, Gassebner et al. and Grunewald et al. stated that rising income inequality in less rich countries is related to industrial reduction and a decrease of producers' political power, thereby reducing their ability to decrease environmental impact.",
