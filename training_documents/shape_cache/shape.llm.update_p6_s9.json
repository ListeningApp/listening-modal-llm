        "content": "gxfd | Two practitioners will likely use such alternative measurements - such as SizeUK - while attempting to replicate FFIT. Sokolowski and Bettencourt even modifies FFIT to address the underlying assumptions about measurement placement that cannot work on women over size fourteen. However, these placement assumptions are invisible to third-party practitioners who do not run studies 'hacking' the algorithm. If using alternative measurements reclassifies bodies into different shapes, then FFIT is unauthoritative outside of its original application because of unreplicable measurement definitions. In such a situation, ergonomists who attempt to use the FFIT system in their work may not, therefore, be able to compare their work to others - but they are unaware of these underlying issues.\ns2v1 | We aim to assess the FFIT's suitability as a body classification system for scientific research and garment construction purposes, considering how slight changes in measurement definitions may affect shape classifications. We use FFIT as the case by which to explore how body shape systems may provide unreliable when used more broadly than specified systems and measurements extractions. In pursuing this aim, we consider the following hypotheses:\njkp9 | One. Calculating the FFIT using alternative measurement definitions causes the same human shape to be categorised as alternative body shapes, with a low - below fifty percent - agreement between measurement definition groups.\nz8tt | Two. Waist measurements decrease by a statistically significant amount - X equals zero point zero five - when taken at SizeUK's region of SoB plus four point zero centimeters compared to the FFIT's region of SoB plus six point three five centimeters: with a large effect size.\n9g22 | Three. Waist heights increase by a statistically significant amount - X X equals zero point zero five - when taken at SizeUK's region of SoB plus six point three five centimeters compared to the FFIT's region of SoB plus four point zero centimeters: with a large effect size.\n41fx | Four. A person's FFIT Body Shape classification can be predicted from shoulder measurements that the FFIT excludes - Shoulder-to-Shoulder (Horizontal), Shoulder-to-Shoulder (Calliper), and Shoulder Girth (Full) - through a statistically significant regression model; X equals point zero five.\n7um8 | In investigating our hypotheses, we analyse one thousand six hundred seventy-nine UK females' FFIT shape classification - and necessary measurements - through Kappa Measure of Agreement, T-test, Multinomial Logistic Regression, and ANOVA statistical tests.\nuow2 | Materials and methods\niat7 | Study population\nywwr | One thousand six hundred seventy-nine females participated in this study, obtained through convenience sampling. We achieved this by posting flyers and adverts on social media, inviting members of the public to attend open scanning sessions between twenty eleven to twenty sixteen in Manchester, Nottingham, and London.\n0i6j | Our sampling frame required participants to be female, over eighteen years old, have no physical or cognitive disabilities, and not be pregnant during data capture. These measures ensure ethical compliance and reduce the sample's independent variables. We only sampled females because the FFIT body shape classification system relates explicitly to the female body. We gained participant consent before data collection, with full prior approval of the study by Manchester Metropolitan University's ethics committee. Personal identifiable data was collected, kept separately, and de-identified within the working data set.\n87cq | Sample size\n0qs3 | To achieve a power of pi is greater than or equal to zero point eight, we calculated the minimum sample size as one thousand four hundred forty-eight participants using G Power. We calculated our sample size for a one-way between-groups ANOVA with a small sample size. We used these parameters because an ANOVA has the greatest sample requirements of all our study's tests; Effect Size\nz8f7 | F equals zero point one, alpha equals zero point zero five, one minus beta equals zero point eight, eight groups. We sampled one thousand six hundred seventy-nine participants, exceeding our minimum sample size by two hundred thirty-one participants.\n7w7j | Sample demographics\n51vd | The study's sample were females aged eighteen to eighty-four years, mean equals thirty-one point five, standard deviation equals fourteen point five, of body mass thirty-four point zero to one hundred sixty point three kilograms, mean equals sixty-five point three, standard deviation equals fifteen point zero, and height one hundred thirty-three point five to one hundred eighty-eight point nine centimeters mean equals one hundred fifty-four point six, standard deviation equals six point six. Participant ethnicity was mainly White, but also included Black one hundred fifty-four, Asian sixty, Chinese forty-four, Mixed White and Black thirty, Other Mixed Background twenty-eight, Mixed White and Asian twelve, and other or not stated twenty-one. All participants were UK females.\nbaj1 | Data collection procedure\nn1wo | Before participants attended scan sessions, they were provided with guidelines regarding the body scanning requirements concerning underwear, jewellery, and hair. All participants were asked to use non-padded\n5bq3 | and non-compression underwear to avoid any distortion of their natural body shape. The research ethics prohibits scanning anybody without underwear and excludes any inspection because of privacy issues. To ensure underwear, jewellery, or hair did not distort body shapes, the research team visually inspected each subjects' collected (processed) scan data. Visual inspection ensured all landmark points and measurements were in locations according to the anatomy and surface, considering measurement standards for clothing. Scan data that provided inaccurate measurements of the participant was removed.\nezla | We used TC Twoâ€™s KX-sixteen body-scanner to collect participant's body scan data, with all participants adopting the standard scanning posture as different standing postures significantly alters waist and hip placement. The standard scanning posture is 'standing position A prime' according to International Standards Organization twenty sixty eighty-five; see Figure three that aligns with Gill, Hayes, and Parker's scanning protocol. We used the anonymised body scan data for measurement extraction and analysis.",
