        "content": "2e62 | I have black eyes and hair. As you can tell from my last name you should know that I am Chinese. ... I was born in Taiwan and moved to Costa Rica when I was in grade two. Later when I was in grade four I moved to Canada.\n75y3 | You probably wouldn't know that I am Chinese. I have one of the strangest names in the world, but at least if someone asked, \"Where's Sterling?\" nobody would say, \"Sterling who?\"\ns2g2 | What lessons should the school be teaching, I wondered, about the historical depth and intricacy of the great divide that these students continue to live out? How might it help them understand the histories carried in these innocent acts of self-identification? It was not that the question of identity\nq1q2 | was missing from the school curriculum. Students have long had lessons on who is and who is not a member of this imagined community known as Canada. These lessons do their share to make each student, in effect, \"a précis of all the past,\" as Antonio Gramsci framed it: \"For each individual is the synthesis not only of existing relations, but the history of these relations.\" A strong source of light that the schools can throw on \"the history of these relations,\" I argue, is found in reviewing imperialism's educational project.\ncb7r | One student in Kathy's class framed her identity in terms of ethnicity: \"My ethnic background is Chinese but I was born in Vancouver and have lived here all my life\"—yet there is still the strength of the contrast, established by her use of \"but,\" of her Chinese background and her life in Vancouver. The Kiplingesque division between East and West remains firmly a part of this city's vision of itself as the gateway to the Asian Pacific, a city in which half of the students speak English as their second language. Although the city is often given to celebrating its multiculturalism, the newspaper boxes a few blocks from Kathy Chin's school are occasionally defaced with \"Chinks go home,\" and stickers placed on telephone poles in a local suburb at one point read, \"Save a Young Mind, Stop Multiculturalism.\" The city's leading newspaper has run headlines on the order of \"Immigrants Form Pool for Disease, Doctors Say\" and \"Cost of Providing ESL Classes Is Eating Up the Education Dollar.\" Clearly, the graffiti would be a lot easier to deal with-as messages of misguided hate and ignorance-if they did not appear to be underwritten at times by the city's newspapers and doctors.\n68xu | Of course, there were also students in Kathy's class who did not appear to have to face such issues:\nhd35 | I am fifteen (turning sixteen on April seven) with blonde hair and blue eyes. I'm pretty short. I was captain of the cheerleading squad for a football team.\n2zpk | Hello, my name is James Statley. I live in Vancouver, British Columbia. I like sports a lot. I hate school.\nepu7 | My name is Robert Campbell, and I am a Libra.\n7od1 | It would seem that the play of race and ethnicity in identity is not necessarily everyone's affair, and this, too, signifies a gap in the students' education. All students need to understand the historical legacy of these self-identifications. They need to see how it is that white is a color that need not name itself. No one makes this more apparent than the antiracist educator Peggy MacIntosh when she speaks of the \"invisible weightless knapsack\" of white privilege, out of which she pulls some twenty-six instances, including, \"I can be sure that my children will be given curricular materials that testify to the existence of their race,\" and, \"I am never asked to speak for all the people of my racial group.\" MacIntosh's last point strikes home all the more as this speaking-for-my-race is what I've done on behalf of Kathy Chin and her classmates, just as they have used this racial and ethnic identification out of a sense of history for which I am holding education accountable in this book.\n0bqy | The real issue is obviously not how Kathy and her classmates chose to identify themselves. My concern is with whether the schools can do more to help the young understand the educational formation of worldly divisions that carry with them a profound sense of who belongs where. The postimperial migration of people around the world today poses profound challenges to what we once knew and assumed of the world. Just as the changes involve Kathy Chin, I would argue, so also they include, and must become a part of the education of, her classmate Robert Campbell. He also needs to understand how the community he lives in is changing as part of a history that has long involved the sort of dislocations that first brought the Scots to Canada even as they displaced the people who had lived here for thousands of years before that. Imperialism does not tell the whole of students' stories, but it does figure in what they will learn of the world.\nb780 | The Canadian literary critic Northrop Frye, whose work I focus on in chapter nine, wisely commented that that great identity question \"Where is\nccmb | here?\" was less perplexing than \"Who am I?\" The geoidentity question \"Where is here?\"—which in Matthew Arnold's \"Stanzas from the Grande Chartreuse\" takes the form \"And what am I, that I am here?\"—does have a way of linking our various histories as indigenes, colonials, immigrants, expatriates, tourists, citizens, refugees, and displaced persons. It is easy to see that many of the disputes that threaten the future of Canada, as well as those that concern broader questions of national identity, are about the nature of \"here.\"\nma93 | What Imperialism?\nc6hh | The Columbus quincentenary, celebrated a few years ago, was staged as a great marketing opportunity for blockbuster art shows and epic movies, yet for many the event amounted to what performance artist Guillermo Gómez-Peña called \"a dance on the wound of history.\" It was also a grim reminder of how students in the West have long been asked to honor the inflicting of that wound. We might take the familiar classroom mnemonic \"In fourteen hundred and ninety-two / Columbus sailed the ocean blue\" as proof of how Columbus has long been at the heart of what it means to be schooled. A new account, if not a new rhyme, of imperialism's misadventures, which has been long overdue in the schools, has begun to be written for the classroom, as I will point out presently. What also needs to be reviewed is imperialism's record of learned achievements, which was to shape our modern sensibility.\ny7ea | Such accounts need to begin with the often-taught pursuits of the Portuguese along the coast of Africa, Columbus in the Caribbean, the Spanish in America, Cabot and Raleigh across the Atlantic and their countrymen in India, the Dutch in Southeast Asia, and later the Germans in Africa and the Americans in the Pacific. They need to include imperialism's influence through Europe's age of exploration and the Renaissance, the founding of colonies and the Enlightenment, the opening of the Pacific and the rise of Romanticism, the Victorian age and the scramble for Africa. They need to confront a trade in human beings that forced twelve million people from sub-Saharan Africa on a deadly journey into slavery in the Western Hemisphere. They need to address the devastation of indigenous populations through military campaigns, economic exploitation, and the spread of epidemics. They also need to consider the encyclopedic project of mapping and naming all",
