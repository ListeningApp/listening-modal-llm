You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

c1e3 | Coarse-graining in time with the Functional Renormalisation Group: Relaxation in Brownian Motion
7pez | We apply the functional Renormalisation Group (fRG) to study relaxation in a stochastic process governed by an overdamped Langevin equation with one degree of freedom, exploiting the connec- tion with supersymmetric quantum mechanics in imaginary time. After reviewing the functional integral formulation of the system and its underlying symmetries, including the resulting Ward- Takahashi identities for arbitrary initial conditions, we compute the effective action I from the fRG, approximated in terms of the leading and subleading terms in the gradient expansion: the Local Potential Approximation and Wavefunction Renormalisation respectively. This is achieved by coarse-graining the thermal fluctuations in time resulting in e.g. an effective potential incorporating fluctuations at all timescales. We then use the resulting effective equations of motion to describe the decay of the covariance, and the relaxation of the average position and variance towards their equilibrium values at different temperatures. We use as examples a simple polynomial potential, an unequal Lennard-Jones type potential and a more complex potential with multiple trapping wells and barriers. We find that these are all handled well, with the accuracy of the approximations improving as the relaxation's spectral representation shifts to lower eigenvalues, in line with ex- pectations about the validity of the gradient expansion. The spectral representation's range also correlates with temperature, leading to the conclusion that the gradient expansion works better for higher temperatures than lower ones. This work demonstrates the ability of the fRG to expedite the computation of statistical objects in otherwise long-timescale simulations, acting as a first step to more complicated systems.
qs5t | I. INTRODUCTION
en4s | Stochastic processes appear in all kinds of contexts in physics: from the Brownian motion of small particles in a thermal bath [1, 2] to exotic scalar fields experiencing quantum fluctuations in the early inflationary universe [3], many problems of interest can be described by the overdamped Langevin equation (4). In this work we em- ploy an effective description of the stochastic dynamics that captures the aggregate effect of fluctuations embod- ied in an effective action I[x(t)], a functional of the av- erage position x(t) = (x(t)) which can be thought of as an analogue to the statistical free energy and can be de- rived from the partition function or generating functional via a Legendre transform. Once obtained, the effective action can be used to compute n-point correlation func- tions of the particle's position (x(t1)x(t2) ... x(tn)), char- acterizing the system's statistical properties. To obtain this effective action we will be coarse-graining the system in time such that we obtain e.g. an effective potential that incorporates thermal fluctuations on all timescales. To achieve this we will use a technique known as the
csb5 | functional, or exact, or non-perturbative Renormalisa- tion Group [4, 5] - see [6] for a review and an entry point to the literature on the subject, [7] for a comprehensive overview of applications as well as e.g. [8, 9] for more elementary introductions.
i096 | The renormalisation group (RG) was brought to full force through the work of K. Wilson [10] who used it to understand phase transitions and since then the RG has become a widely used technique in modern physics with many applications in both particle physics [11] and con- densed matter physics [12, 13]. The RG is relevant when- ever fluctuations significantly influence the state (static or dynamical) of a physical system. A recent popular in- carnation of this programme is the functional RG (fRG) formulation. Wetterich showed [4] - see also [5] - how one can define I' at some particular energy or momentum scale A in the UV (for us this will correspond to small timestep/high frequency) where the theory is known and then create an RG flow that interpolates through all en- ergy (frequency/momentum) scales down to the IR (i.e. decreasing fluctuation frequency/increasing characteris- tic timestep of fluctuation here). This change of the effec- tive theory at different scales, the fundamental idea be- hind the RG, can be formulated in an integro-differential equation known as the Wetterich equation:
tlzt | (1)
6iyf | where Ik is the effective action at scale k, Tr denotes a trace over spatio-temporal points (an integral over space- time) and a trace over all other relevant indices, Rk is an IR regulator that acts as a cut-off for fluctuations below (momentum/frequency) scale k, and I.2) is the second functional derivative of Ik. A simple zero-dimensional manifestation of this flow equation in the context of the Boltzmann equilibrium distribution is illuminating and is reviewed in Appendix A. At the end of the flow, as k -> 0, all fluctuations are included and the full effective action T is obtained.
o1nk | In this work we solve equation (1) in the context of the dynamics of particles under the influence of a deter- ministic force, stemming from an arbitrary potential, and thermal fluctuations. We will study a simple polynomial potential, a double Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential, as well as one containing multiple barriers/trapping wells, serv- ing as a toy model of an energy landscape on which par- ticles can diffuse. To solve (1) we employ a widely used approximation scheme, the gradient expansion, to second order. We find good agreement with simulations (and the Fokker-Planck equation where it proved amenable to a numerical solution) at moderate to high temperatures and that this correlates with the spectral representation of the relaxation process, i.e. the overlap between the ini- tial condition (a delta function initial probability distri- bution) and the spectrum of the Fokker Planck operator. In particular, the more the resulting spectrum is shifted towards lower-lying eigenvalues, the better the gradient expansion agrees with the exact evolution. This is in line with expectations about the validity of the gradient expansion, namely that it better captures slower evolu- tion which should be associated with the lower eigen- values. Furthermore, we expect that for a fixed initial condition lower temperatures correspond to a spectrum shifted towards higher eigenvalues and, correspondingly, worst performance of the gradient expansion.
mnaf | We start in Sec. II by reviewing the connection be- tween Langevin dynamics and Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics in imaginary time, first shown in [14] - see e.g. [15] for a review of this connection. The path integral formulation then allows us to apply the fRG program di- rectly. We include a brief summary of how the Langevin equation can be reformulated in terms of a probability distribution function whose evolution is described by the Fokker-Planck equation (32) and how the latter relates to a Euclidean Schrödinger equation. We close the sec- tion by discussing the symmetries of the resulting theory and their implications through Ward-Takahashi type re- lations, paying attention to the fact that the initial state may not be that of equilibrium.
0yxe | In Sec. III we present the flow equations for the ef- fective action utilising a slight modification of the re- sults of [16] for supersymmetric RG flows. As we ex- plain, the flow equation derived from the supersymmetric formulation ensures compatibility with the equilibrium Boltzmann distribution, a feature not directly obvious from the application of the renormalisation group to the
