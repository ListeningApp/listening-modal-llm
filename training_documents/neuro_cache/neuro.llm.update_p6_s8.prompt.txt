You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

p6pq | The study by Fox et al. (1986) suggested to me to ask the corresponding question about visual mental imagery. There has been a long debate about whether a picture- like representation underlies the experience of visual mental imagery (see, for example, Kosslyn 1980, 1994; Pylyshyn 1981; Tye 1991). Neuroimaging can be used to ask whether such a structure is evoked during visual imagery, as suggested in figure 1. For example, Kosslyn et al. (1995a) asked subjects to visualize line drawings of common objects under three different conditions. The conditions were the same, except that a different-sized box was shown to the subjects before each, and the subjects were asked to visualize each named drawing during that condition as if it were within the box. Thus, they visualized objects at a very small size (0.25° of visual angle, from their perspective), at a medium size (4º) or at a very large size (16°). After visualizing a drawing, subjects were asked to evaluate a subtle shape property (such as whether in that drawing the left side of the object had been higher than the right), which required them to use imagery (they did not know about the particular judgements to be asked at the time at which they studied the drawings). During scanning, the subjects had their eyes closed and all cues (names of objects to be visualized and shape probes) were delivered auditorily. In the 'listening baseline,' they heard the same kinds of stimuli used in the imagery conditions, but now simply responded when they heard a shape probe; this control was always conducted before the imagery conditions, so the subjects did not know the significance of the terms. In fact, there were four sets of recorded object-probe stimuli, which were rotated so that each occurred equally often in each of the three imagery conditions and in the listening baseline. The data from the imagery conditions were also compared with those from a 'resting' baseline condition, but this is not relevant for present purposes.
zse6 | The results were straightforward. When the imagery data were compared with those from the listening base- line, we found activation in Area 17. Moreover, the locus of maximal activation depended on the size at which the drawings were visualized. We found very posterior activa- tion with the small images, more anterior activation for the medium-sized images, and still more anterior activa- tion for the large images. These results parallel those found in studies of visual perception, and are as expected if this topographically organized structure (part of the visual buffer illustrated in figure 1) is in fact used in visual imagery.
p2n3 | It is important to note that the simple finding that an area is activated, even an area with well-characterized properties, is not sufficient to infer that the properties of that area contribute to performance. As noted earlier, the
ohh7 | choice of a baseline is crucial, and it is possible that a test condition can seem to produce activation because the baseline condition actually reduces activation (as might happen in visual cortex when one is concentrating on listening to cues). Thus, in the study just described it is important that the imagery results cannot be ascribed to hypometabolism during the baseline condition: this would not explain the selective effects of size in itself on the locus of activation. By varying the sizes of objects in images, we could show directly that the spatial properties of this structure are drawn upon during performance of the task. In addition, we have found that if repetitive trans- cranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is applied over Area 17, which has the effect of temporarily impairing the underlying tissue, subsequent imagery performance is impaired (Kosslyn et al. 1999); thus, in this kind of task, the activation in early visual cortex has a functional role. In short, this research reveals that a spatially organized buffer can in fact be used during visual mental imagery.
vbni | In addition, this use of neuroimaging can reveal distinctions where none were previously apparent. In this example, other research results have failed to reveal the activation of Area 17 during visual imagery (for recent reviews, see Mellet et al. (1998) and Thompson & Kosslyn (1999)). Many laboratories have now found one or the other result, and thus neither the presence nor absence of the effect can be explained away. Rather, it seems clear that there is more than one type of imagery, and not all types rely on the kind of depictive representation that is associated with our introspections of imagery. This finding does not detract from the fact that a topographi- cally organized structure is used in some types of imagery.
dgcw | (e) Is there more than one way in which a function can be performed?
gvwz | In the previous sections we considered how one can discover the processes and structures that give rise to a specific ability. We initially considered studies that provide a 'big picture' overview of the system that underlies a particular ability, and then narrowed our focus to increas- ingly small portions of such a system. One virtue of starting in this way is that it puts the more precise ques- tions in context; it leads one to ask questions about how processing occurs in a system. Each process depends on others for its inputs, and in turn sends its outputs to yet other processes (and structures). Thus, to begin to think about what an individual process or structure does, it is useful to think of it in context.
sk5m | Armed with such information, it is straightforward to use neuroimaging to consider another type of question, that of whether there is more than one way to perform a particular function. That is, can different combinations of structures and processes underlie a particular type of performance? Each such combination of structures and processes corresponds to a different strategy. The key is to show that different strategies produce different patterns of activation. For example, Kosslyn et al. (1998) asked whether there is more than one way in which to rotate objects mentally in mental images, one that draws on motor processes (as would occur if one visualized what one would see if one twisted an object in a certain way) and one that does not (as would occur if one visualized what one would see if an external force twisted an object).
qws8 | In this study, subjects performed two types of mental rotation tasks. In one, the subjects performed the classic Shepard & Metzler (1971) task. They saw pairs of three- armed angular shapes, half of which were identical and half of which were mirror images. We administered two conditions. In the test condition, the shapes appeared at different relative orientations, and subjects decided whether the members of each pair were identical or mirror images. We compared brain activation in this condition to that in a baseline condition, which was identical to the test condition except that the shapes in each pair were always presented at the same orientation. In the second mental rotation task, the subjects saw pictures of pairs of hands, and had to decide whether both were the same hand (right or left) or one was right and one was left. In the test condition the hands appeared at different relative orientations, whereas in the baseline condition both members of the pair appeared at the same orientation. Each subject received the baseline and test conditions for one type of stimulus before the two condi- tions for the other type, and the order of presentation was counterbalanced.
