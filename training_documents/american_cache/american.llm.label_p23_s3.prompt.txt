You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

5zyf | Like the Federalist language reformer Noah Webster, Morse sought to achieve a degree of national identity by aligning the overall practices of alphabetic training with geographical knowledge. Given the program- matic rethinking of elementary literacy instruction, the map became a product of alphabetic learning. Indeed, as the basic principles of literacy (the alphabet, representational sign systems, phonetics) became imbri- cated with basic principles of geography (notions of place, systems of measurement, taxonomic organization), the conventional words and ver- bal text were perceived through a geographic consciousness. By prefacing

bqfb | his textbook with a map of the new nation-state, Morse invariably coupled the map reader's desire for visual self-location to the textbook's otherwise verbal representation of political identities. Students following the read- ing protocol of the textbook map, then, learned not only to privilege the geographic dimension of the nation-state over representations of local places but also to superimpose the cartographic signs representing the union over the textbook's alphabetic notations describing the states. Thus, while Webster relied on the national map to Americanize the spell- ing and pronunciation of English words, Morse's map-reading lesson transformed the study of geography into a nationalistic spelling bee.28
wwdt | Federalists like Webster and Morse who used the rhetoric of the na- tional map operated inside an established cartographic tradition in which maps had historically accompanied the creation of national ideologies. Ever since Abraham Ortelius and Gerard Mercator published their world maps and atlases in the sixteenth century, single-sheet maps had pre- sented the sovereign states as visually and territorially unified constructs. During the eighteenth century, the wealthier European nation-states had sponsored or were about to initiate the production of national maps. Developing out of the discourses of property surveys and regional map- ping projects, the national map served a dual function. First, in the map- making process, surveyors left visible markers on the land (such as bound- ary markers and border crossings). Second, the map image as a material artifact provided a visual proxy and reproducible evidence of the nation's territorial, optically organic, and demonstrably material existence.29
mn1r | 28. Morse's choice of map here reflects the way in which child psychologists describe the cultural construction of national identity. In their study "The Transition from Ego- centricity to Reciprocity," Jean Piaget and Anne Marie Weil seek to establish "the develop- ment in children of the idea of the Homeland and the Relations with other Countries." While they approach their test subjects from the positions of the cognitive (when does the notion of country become reality?) and the affective (when do evaluative attributes such as loyalty and patriotism emerge?), both authors presuppose the knowledge of geographic images like school maps. See Sarah F. Campbell, ed., Piaget Sampler: An Introduction to Jean Piaget through His Own Words (New York, 1976), 37-58.

2e62 | In the first decades of the United States' existence, the image of the national map was one of the few visual artifacts demonstrating what many perceived to be either an abstract or even untenable fiction, namely that there could be a national union between disjointed regions and politically disparate people. Unlike in Europe, where governments controlled the output of national maps, in the United States the national map quickly became the dual product of the federal government and the private eco- nomic sector. On the one hand, the federal government sponsored the production of national maps on two occasions. The passage of the Land Ordinance Acts of 1785 and 1787 anticipated a burst of mapmaking ac- tivities as it launched a national survey. The copyright law of 1790, which was advertised on the inside of every book printed in the United States as "an Act . . . securing the copies of Maps, Charts, and Books," protected maps by giving them the status of a preferred commodity.
75y3 | On the other hand, the appearance of a state-regulated distribution of national maps would be misleading because the majority of maps and other geographical writings were produced by private individuals and small commercial publishers. The new citizens were most likely to en- counter the image of the nation by reading inexpensive, small-scale maps, like the one inserted in Morse's school geography. The map image of the United States proliferated significantly when publishers like Mathew Carey of Philadelphia included national maps in various book genres and through multiple packaging reduced significantly the average price per map. According to Carey's sales catalog of 1795, single-sheet maps sold for as little as twelve and a half cents (by comparison, the folio edition of the American Atlas, containing twenty-one maps, was priced at five dollars-six if "coloured"). These numbers show that single-sheet maps rather than map collections were affordable texts and as such quickly absorbed into the nation's cultural landscape.30

Considering the domestic habit of putting maps on display inside private settings, the national map in all likelihood decorated the walls of American homes (Figure 34). The nation's map image certainly became a pedagogic piece of furniture in schools. It was a fundamental part of textbooks, globes, and wall decora- tions. Teachers and parents even experimented with the cognitive func- tion of the national map by integrating it into didactic puzzles (Figure 35). Once we leave the domestic and institutional spaces of the home and the school, we discover that the nation's cartographic shape hung on rollers or under glass in public places. Wall maps were displayed in public offices and coffeehouses; as the genre painting Barroom Dancing by John Lewis Krimmel shows, the national map was displayed in taverns, where it func- tioned as decoration, conversation piece, and metaphoric touchstone of communal identity (Figure 36).31

0bqy | A spate of American-made atlases greatly popularized the image of the nation-state. Beginning with the publication of Mathew Carey's American Atlas (1795), four more national atlases almost simultaneously captured the public eye: Carey's General Atlas (1796), Carey's American Pocket Atlas (1796), Joseph T. Scott's Atlas of the United States (1796), and John Reid's American Atlas (1796). Each of these atlases privileged the national map. While the atlas as a printed form imitated the generic design of a book, the map showing the territory of the United States often functioned like a table of contents or prefatory chapter. Placed in this position, the national map more than introduced the states; in most cases it emphasized na- tional unity over state autonomy.
b780 | The map of the "United States" by Samuel Lewis from Carey's General Atlas illustrates the way in which the image of the nation graphically sub- sumed images of the states. Lewis's national map was the twenty-fourth of forty-eight maps and served as the preface to the subsequent set of seventeen maps of the states and Maine (Figure 37). Located as the atlas's middle and turning point, this map separated international maps from those delineating the new nation-state. Designed for pedagogic uses (it was intended to supplement William Guthrie's schoolbook, A New System of Modern Geography [1794]), the Lewis map creates the nation as a self- contained entity. Lewis limits his workmanship to meticulously inscrib- ing the graphic space of the United States; he leaves virtually uninscribed the surrounding spaces (thus making it difficult for the inexperienced map reader to tell land from water). With the name of the United States being visibly absent from the actual map image (it appears in the map margin inside an unembellished cartouche), Lewis downplays the alpha- betic element used for hailing national identities in cartographic writing. Instead, he emphasizes the map's geographical aspect. Using the border line and topographic symbols, Lewis limns the nation in almost corporeal

y7ea | terms. Similar to images describing the human anatomy in contemporary magazines and handbooks, the thickly shaded lines tracing the coastal and national boundaries in the east, north, and south resemble the epider- mal layer visually protecting the land against the encroachment of oceans and neighboring territories. At the same time, the double-lined course of the Mississippi River invokes not only the nation's western border but also the anatomical imagery of a skeleton's spine or a body's vascular system. The constitutive parts of the national body, the states, recede inside the image of the nation-state. Their thinly drafted boundary lines collapse inside the map's corporealized gestalt of the nation's territory.
nav4 | When considering the political conflict between the Federalist ideology and sectionalist interest groups that raged during the first two decades of independent nationhood, the rhetorical effect of the atlases' national maps by and large supported the Federalist cause. Each atlas promoted a cartographic system of checks and balances. While the national map was often afforded additional space in the form of foldouts, none of the state maps published in the early atlases were allowed to dominate optically. Each state map was cut to a uniform size, projecting the idea of equal

g9du | representation under one nation. When viewed in the context of the atlas maps' overt emphasis on boundary lines and visual unity, the national map functioned as the archival container and frame of reference for the smaller state maps. By virtue of its cartographic design the national map adumbrated the Federalist notion that there is "unity in diversity," a unity that is predicated on a national cartographic network that assumes au- thority over its local constitutive parts.32
f682 | What is significant, however, is that, at the same time as the first United States atlas maps seemed to provide a material palimpsest upon which readers could trace out nationalistic fantasies of interstate unity, it was precisely the unique material context of the atlas that deanatomized the nation's cartographic image. Early American atlas maps conceptual- ized the individual states not as dismembered parts of a larger corporate body but as miniature copies imitating the symbolic form of a larger nation-state. For example, in Carey's American Pocket Atlas the map of South Carolina (1796), also drawn by Samuel Lewis, appeared not only as a self-contained unit but was drawn to look like a geographically separate nation-state unrelated to either the United States or the North American continent (Figure 38). Its graphic presentation creates the geographical illusion that the state hinged between two oceans rather than between the states of North Carolina and Georgia. The impression that each state could be a separate nation was further enhanced by the use of map scale. States were depicted, not in relative proportion to their geographical size, but in maximal proportion to the textual space they were to fill on the
li1k | page. The maps of Delaware and Rhode Island covered as much paper space as did the maps of Maine and Pennsylvania. Optically, then, the state maps repeated the same cartographic designs that initially had been reserved for the national map. Like the national map, the state map turned on a binary structure of territorial representation, privileging the state's visual outline over its verbal identification, its geographical over its political anatomy, its interior over its exterior relations.
pbea | United States atlas maps here seem to confirm the Federalist and Anti- federalist fear that even those writing systems that ceased to subordinate the reading experience to an exclusively alphabetical order were still inca- pable of representing the idea of a new nation-state in immediate and unambiguous terms. While the image of the national map seemed to uphold the constitutional principle of checks and balances (maps repre- sented states optically in equal terms), the state map appeared to under- cut the Federalist ideal of national unity by projecting the thirteen (or more) states as separate nations and unrelated to the larger union. The pictorial rhetoric of the national map failed to offer a design that estab- lished a hierarchical relationship between the union and state. Unable to give precedence to either unit, the medium of the map potentially under- cuts its symbolic power by signifying opposite values: even as its visual rhetoric could serve as a tool of national integration, it also could promote the union's disintegration.
