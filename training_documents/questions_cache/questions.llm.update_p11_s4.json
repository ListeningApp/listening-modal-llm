        "content": "uz9y | \"As we learned more, the meaning of the question continued to evolve. We asked ourselves, \"How can we go out and plant this seed? How do we frame it as we bring other people into the conversation?\" The question always worked in stimulating the dialogue. Sometimes as leaders it's important not to collectively work on what the answer is but to work on what the question is. That was a big insight for me as we did this work. The question never failed us.\"\n8ov0 | Improving Questions at Pfizer. In another recent case, professionals at Pfizer, the world-renowned pharmaceutical firm, are experimenting with a systematic method of improving the quality of their questions. Through a custom-designed workshop, marketing and finance professionals in Pfizer's European business unit have been learning to articulate powerful questions. These executives have discovered that meetings have more energy and creative ideas flow more quickly when they place attention on formulating catalytic questions. With this discipline in place, new ideas are more easily finding their way into key products and services.\nmj9m | From these examples, it's clear that improving the quality of the questions you ask and creating a framework of engagement that encourages their exploration can create business value. Because learning to engage thoughtful questions can lead to insight, innovation, and action, doing so will become an essential strategic capability for leaders of organizations who want to create sustainable results in the face of both short- and longer-term challenges and opportunities.\n94h3 | Fostering Strategic Inquiry\n9jx1 | Beyond building the capacity of individual employees to ask powerful questions, an organization can design processes that use such queries to enhance the emergence of knowledge creation and strategic thinking. As the chairman and CEO of a major multinational corporation says, \"Discovering strategic questions is like panning for gold. You have to care about finding it, you have to be curious, and you have to create an anticipation of discovering gold, even though none of us may know ahead of time where we'll find it. You head toward the general territory where you think the gold may be located, with your best tools, your experience, and your instincts. And then you begin a disciplined search for the gold.\" We've partnered with this leader to create a set of tools for fostering strategic inquiry and working with powerful questions in the service of positive futures called the \"Game Plan\" process. The following steps may not apply to all situations and they may not always play out in the same sequence. However, the Game Plan suggests ways that organizations can create both formal and informal processes to support individuals as well as teams in discovering the \"gold\" for themselves.\nc3lz | The Game Plan Process\n8bwk | The steps in the Game Plan can be used both as a process discipline by individuals looking at a particular situation, as well as by functional and cross-functional groups and leadership teams charged with the responsibility for key decisions regarding future courses of action. The Game Plan can also involve diverse stakeholders to provide important perspectives both on the current situation and on possible future actions.\nez9s | The Art of Powerful Questions\nmqot | Assess Your Current Situation. Get a feel for the larger context in which you are operating. Scan the internal and external business and organizational environments that may affect the future of the system or project you are working with. This situation analysis might include the assessment of critical results data, meetings with key stakeholders, and the mapping of your strengths, opportunities, and threats. It might also involve looking for \"signals\" — internal and external events, developments, and trends that can affect the future of your situation. Like trackers in the mountains, look for both obvious and subtle indicators that point to storms as well as sunny skies. Allow your curiosity and imagination to take the lead as you begin to identify the many questions that the broader landscape within which you're operating reveals.\noc99 | It will be challenging, but important, to frame your findings as questions rather than as problems or concerns — questions that end with a question mark, not with a period or an exclamation point. To help in designing these queries, ask yourself, \"How does A affect C and what questions does that suggest? If X were at play here, what question would we be asking? What's the real question underneath all this data?\"\ngipz | Discover the \"Big Questions.\" Once you think you've posed most of the relevant questions (and there may be many of them), look for patterns and themes. This is not a mechanical process, even though it should be disciplined and systematic. You are on a treasure hunt, seeking the core questions — usually three to five — that, if answered, would make the most difference to the future of the project or situation you are exploring. Cluster related questions, and consider\nb4wj | The Art of Powerful Questions\n5xlt | the relationships among them. Begin to clarify the \"big questions\" that the initial clusters reveal. Frame these as clear and concise queries, not as problems. Something fundamental changes when people begin to ask questions together — they go beyond the normal stale debate about problems that passes for strategy in many organizations.\n9bz4 | Create Images of Possibility. Ask yourself, \"What would our situation look like or be like if the 'big questions' were answered?\" Creating vivid images of possibility differs from pie-in-the-sky visioning, especially if people with a variety of perspectives have participated in the earlier stages of your analysis. This part of the conversation can also provide clues for refining or reframing your big questions as well as inventing creative strategies. Developing scenarios — stories of the future based on different ways your big questions might be answered — can also be useful. These often reveal new territory and opportunities for action that are grounded in real life.\nyfv2 | Evolve Workable Strategies. Workable strategies begin to emerge in response to compelling questions and to the images of possibility that these questions evoke. In a sense, such strategies are the \"big answers\" — the key initiatives you invent to address your \"big questions.\" Once you clarify key initiatives, you can formulate and implement specific action plans.\npujl | Of course, the cycle is never complete. You need continuous \"sensing\" based on relevant business and organizational data, ongoing conversations with internal and external stakeholders, informal conversations among employees, and feedback from the organizational environment. This input enables you to continually reassess the landscape you're operating in — revealing new questions for exploration.\n3rqe | The innovative leader with whom we developed the Game Plan process has shared this tool with the entire organization. People from throughout the company have found that it provides a way to discover questions that matter to the future of individual units and to the firm as a whole. The company has also used the Game Plan as part of refining the corporation's\nnsi3 | Is Your Organization an Inquiring System? Assessing Your Organization's Capabilities\nnil3 | To what degree do leaders in your organization foster an environment in which discovering the \"big questions\" is encouraged as much as coming up with workable solutions?\n68a1 | Does your organization have rewards or incentives for members to work across functional boundaries to find challenging questions that create common focus and forward movement for knowledge creation?\nseik | Do your leadership development programs contain as much of a focus on the art and architecture of framing powerful questions as they do on techniques for solving problems?\noq7c | Do your organization's strategic planning processes include structured ways to discover the \"big questions\" that, if answered, would have real strategic leverage?\nz4mi | What enabling tools or technologies does your organization employ to \"seed\" itself with strategic questions that \"travel well\" and catalyze learning conversations both within and across functions?\nhkft | Does your organization use collaborative technology tools to enable people on the frontlines to ask each other questions related to their daily work (i.e. customer service, equipment maintenance) and receive help with these questions from colleagues in other locations?\njai3 | Do senior leaders in your organization see the process of strategy evolution as one that engages multiple voices and perspectives in networks of conversation?",
