We also discussed how to download and install Tableau Public, explore Tableau Public's features and learn about Tableau Public, and find other authors' data visualizations using the Tableau Galleries and Recommended Authors/Profile Finder function on the Tableau website. In the next chapter, we will explore data connections and manipulations in Tableau Public.\ni888 | Tableau Public Interface Features\nzcil | The user interface for Tableau Public was created to be simple and intuitive. It comes with three primary features (as discussed in Chapter One, Getting Started with Tableau Public), namely connecting to data, opening your work, and discovering Tableau Public. Since Tableau Public is a tool for data discovery as well as data visualization, the interface is designed to encourage discovery through the drag-and-drop features for data. The user interface for Tableau Public is segmented into separate areas, namely data elements, cards, shelves, and the canvas. The data is also divided into two general categories- dimensions and measures. By understanding how data interacts with the user interface, you can design, configure, and polish chart objects that will be built into worksheets. These worksheets can then be assembled into one or more dashboards.\ndzwl | In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:\nsjbu | The Tableau Public user interface\nukqq | The side bar, including the Data window and the Analytics pane\n6l57 | The toolbars and menus\ne7vr | The Columns, Rows, and Filters shelves\numbl | The Marks card\nvc35 | The Filters and Pages shelves\npjz3 | The ShowMe card\nxl2e | Tableau Public Interface Features\nmobw | In the previous chapter, we discussed how to download and install Tableau Public. We also saw what the start screen looks like and how you can use it to connect to data, explore your own work or that of others, or discover how to use the tool. On opening either a data file or an existing workbook with Tableau Public, you will see the worksheet view.\n2ow1 | There can be one or more worksheets in a workbook. Tableau Public extends this further by allowing you to place one or more worksheets in a dashboard, with all of this contained within the workbook.\n18j7 | The starting point that appears when opening a new Tableau workbook is the worksheet view. This is the working area where you can build your dashboard. Let's take a quick look at it.\nt1m7 | The visualization shown in the following screenshot uses data from the Federal Aviation Administration on every commercial flight at the domestic airports of the United States in March twenty fifteen to average the departure delay (in minutes) for every weekday. You can download this data from the Federal Aviation Administration website. Also, you can download the companion Tableau Public workbook from the profile of this book at the Tableau Public website. We will use this workbook to explore parts of the Tableau Public interface, as shown in the following screenshot:\nn3b7 | Chapter Two\nm3or | The following are the parts of the user interface that are shown in the preceding screenshot:\nha75 | Workbook (One): This is the workbook title, which is the name given to the workbook when you save it.\njv7m | Toolbar (Two): This is where you can save your work, among other functions.\nvusw | Cards and shelves (Three): These are the areas where you can add fields or filters to the visualization.\neekz | The View, or the Visualization (Four): This is the graph itself.\noa2r | The ShowMe card (Five): This prompts you to create different visualization types based on the data selected.\nny2b | Sheet tabs (Six): This allows you to create, rename, or duplicate sheets and dashboards.\nhf0t | The Status bar (Seven): This shows the aggregated totals of the marks on your visualization.\nguma | Tableau Public Interface Features\n777z | Data Source (Eight): Links back to data sources.\n2fyc | The Sidebar (Nine): This contains both the Data window and the Analytics pane.\nm0s8 | The Start button (Ten): This takes you back to the home screen.\nkyn7 | The side bar\nslnt | Our discussion about the parts of the user interface starts with the side bar because it contains both the Data window and the Analytics pane. First, we will talk about the Data pane. After that, we will discuss the Analytics pane.\n8oup | The Data pane\nu7p0 | The Data pane is where your data sources load. In addition to listing the fields in your data source either alphabetically or by folder, the Data pane includes visual cues that tell you the type of each field. The following screenshot shows the visual cues of the Data pane:\nygsa | Chapter Two\nuwue | Tableau Public scans the contents of your data source, groups fields into Dimensions, and Measures according to their field type. Before you start working with your data, you should look through the fields in the Dimensions and Measures panes to make sure that each field is in the proper place.\nu9bd | L\notfg | The Data pane has the following five different sections:\naxch | One. The data source name (One): When you load data, you should provide the data source with a name that identifies the contents, because that is what you and your consumers will see when they download your workbook from Tableau Public. Once you have added several data sources, you can condense their window in order to save space and then select different sources from the drop-down menu.\nn45v | Two. The Dimensions pane (Two): This includes categorical fields with qualitative data. The Dimensions pane typically consists of a string field, a date field, and a field that has geographical attributes, as well as unique identifiers, such as ID fields.\nnjyh | Three. The Measures pane (Three): This usually includes quantitative fields with numerical data that can be aggregated. Tableau Public will automatically group numerical fields, except the ones with the ID string in the name as measures.\nr1t8 | Four. The Sets pane (Four): This includes user-defined, custom fields that interact just like dimensions and measures do. Sets pane can also create subsets of data that you can use just like dimensions.\n0ut9 | Five. The Parameters pane (Five): This includes dynamic placeholders that can replace constant values in calculated fields and filters. Parameters are unique to a workbook and not a data source. You'll see the parameters available in your workbook no matter which data source you are viewing.\ntqo3 | From the Data pane, you can can create fields for the Data window, as follows:\nw1kw | One. Right-click on the data source to edit it.\n2z6m | Two. Click on the View Data icon to see a sample of your data set.\n5obr | Three. Click on the search icon (the little magnifying glass) to search for fields.\ndr7x | Four. Click on the arrow that points downwards, which is the Context menu, to create calculated fields, parameters, and change the sort/view options for the Data window.\nvkws | Tableau Public Interface Features\nu4ip | Visual cues\nq7mz | Within the Data pane, each field name is displayed, but there is also a visual cue that tells you what type of field it is. Field types determine the function and capability of joining data sources. In addition to showing the field type, Tableau Public allows you to change a field's type by right-clicking on it and selecting the Change Data Type option. The following list shows the fields and their descriptions:\ng124 | The Abc field: This indicates that the field is a string field, which means that the contents of the field may include letters, special characters, or numbers.\nfrec | The calendar icon: This indicates a date, datetime, or time field.\n0mr5 | The number sign: This indicates a numeric field that can have any type of native numeric format, from BigInt to decimal.\nam0p | The globe icon: This icon indicates that the field has geographic attributes.\n```",
