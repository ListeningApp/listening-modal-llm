        "content": "qlbb | the logo map, with its simultaneous integration into alphabetic and geographic training, is vividly exemplified in the needlework samplers created by American schoolgirls. Throughout the eighteenth century, formal alphabet lessons had been accompanied by needlework samplers reproducing the letters of the alphabet and didactic quotations. By the seventeen nineties, however, as American literacy lessons were increasingly taking a geo-\nnhsg | graphic turn, the samplers' thematic range was expanded to include the reproduction of maps. While pupils continued to embroider the alphabet, they also took up pen, brush, and needles to draw, paint, and stitch the United States map outline and place-names on paper and on silk.\nhy0l | Hannah Cockburn's sampler, for example, displays both her needlework and her geographic knowledge as she faithfully imitates Morse's map-reading lesson by showing the border lines and names of the union and its states, including the \"Twenty League Line\" separating national from international waters. Mary Franklin's sampler, while depicting both the North and South American continents, nonetheless advertises the national form as the heavily traced border line of the nation-state distinguishes the political territory from its larger geographic context.\n4jmz | Both samplers demonstrate that, because the national map shaped the methodologies of formal literacy instruction, the nation's outline had become internalized and was now shaping practices of self-representation and political identification. The samplers' representation of the national territory-using blazes of color, thicker thread, or wider brush strokes-privileged the outline map as the recognizable sign through which young Americans were taught to express their national identity. The samplers' materiality even suggested that the text of the national map was beginning to be understood quite literally as the nation's material texture.\nb7cq | Indeed, the logo functioned like a universal signifier when it was mass-produced and valorized as a sentimental object. As early as seventeen ninety-two, Ameri-\n0b39 | cans imported milk jugs on which enterprising Englishmen had printed the map-as-logo, surrounding it with the likenesses of two founders, George Washington and Benjamin Franklin. Americans thus appear to have viewed the cartographic image of the nation as more than a desirable consumer object. Considering the widespread circulation of national maps, citizens endowed the logo image with the kind of political-aesthetic value of \"Americanness,\" which significantly would retain\nqecd | and generate its sacred aura despite the fact that the logo was mass-produced.\n1o7p | Central to this aura is that, emerging from within the postcolonial culture, the map logo assumed the very communicative properties so eagerly sought after by the proponents of a new American language scheme. But while language reformers concentrated on the alphabetic construction of a newly nationalized English, it was through the everyday popular use of the national map that its territorial outline became an emblem rivaling the letters displayed in the ABC books. Instead of redefining the alphabet so that \"A stands for America,\" mapmakers and pupils discovered in the map logo the ideal sign representing the nation unambiguously and in diverse textual contexts: the national outline literally became a legible sign, a ready-made icon that was easily transported into the process of mediation and national identification.\ncp13 | Reduced to the shape of a logo, the map became the communicative agent through which a multitude of individuals were taught not only to imagine but to \"read\" themselves as parts of a national whole. Every time citizens recited \"American\" letters in spellers or drew or stitched the map image of the nation, they contemplated themselves as a local representation contingent upon a national geography. If the outline map established the nation as a material artifact, then during the seventeen eighties and seventeen nineties it functioned as a sign that American citizens were trained to recognize as we today are trained to recognize the logo of McDonald's golden arches. The most compelling description of a realized and representative model of an American linguistic community derives from the fact that people as different as John Jay and Hannah Cockburn simultaneously \"read\" the vernacular of the map logo. If nationalism invented the American people, it was common readers who inaugurated the nation by poring over geographic texts that produced and reproduced their cultural community as a geographic reality, as a recognizable American sign.",
