Nine hundred thirty-eight thousand five hundred forty-two samples of Ht and T four zero one six cannot reach optimal solutions if we use the optimization parameters shown in Tables S-Two, S-Three, and S-Four.\nu8nw | Generally, not all the cations have the maximum number of chemical bonds. The global geometrical optimization is aimed at transforming the structure largely enough to create a different network of chemical bonds so that every cation satisfies its bonding needs. To analyze the optimization history, we monitor the rate of chemical bonds Pc given by\nl2v9 | Eisin CB) EÎ¯ plus N(CB)\nafbe | Pc equals\n78r8 | (S-Eight)\n320g | where the numerator is the number of chemical bonds,\ntp8g | and the denominator is the total number of bonding needs. If every cation satisfies its bonding needs, the structure is locally optimized to identify whether the structure can be the optimal solution of the geometrical optimization problem. If so, all the interatomic distances satisfy the condition of Equation (S-Six), and we regard the chemical bonds satisfying Equation (S-Six) as the relaxed chemical bonds. We monitor the rate of relaxed chemical bonds Prc, where the numerator and the denominator are the total number of the relaxed chemical bonds and the total number of the chemical bonds of the constraint, respectively. We also monitor the packing fraction defined to be\ngxfd | (S-Nine)\ns2v1 | Figure S-Two shows the changes of Pc, Pre and during the optimization process. The fluctuation of Pc indicates that a structure is transformed largely enough to change the network of chemical bonds. The small rate of Prc comes from the large displacement through the global optimization. If Pc reaches one point zero, the structure is locally optimized to identify whether the structure can be the optimal solution of the geometrical optimization problem within the five percent error. In local optimization, Pre shows larger value due to the small displacement, however, in some cases, Pre cannot reach one point zero due to the contradictions in the geometrical constraints. has the value around zero point five through the global optimization process.",
