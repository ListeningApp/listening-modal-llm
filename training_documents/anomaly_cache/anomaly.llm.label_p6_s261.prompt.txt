You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

ba4l | Even though MVT2D has established itself as a stan- dard benchmark in the past, this dataset (especially the tex- tures) is easily solvable for recent methods, and differences are mainly in the sub-percent range, which is only a mi- nor difference in terms of the comparatively small size of the dataset. In the following, we focus on the newer, more challenging MVT3D dataset where the normal data shows

We report the mean and standard deviation over 5 runs for our method. Best results per data domain are in bold. Numbers of listed methods followed by a @ are non-published results obtained by the corresponding authors on request. A * indicates that we used a reimplementation. The numbers from PatchCore are taken from [24].

y219 | more variance and anomalies only partly occur in one of the two data modalities, RGB and 3D.
06ht | The results for individual classes of MVT3D grouped by data modality are given in Table 3. We are able to outper- form all previous methods for all data modalities regard- ing the average of all classes by a large margin of 5.1% for 3D, 5% for RGB and 7.2% for the combination. Fac- ing the individual classes and data domains, we set a new state-of-the-art in 21 of 30 cases. Note that this data set is much more challenging when comparing the best results from previous work (99.1% for MVT2D vs. 86.5% AUROC for MVT3D). Nevertheless, we detect defects in 7 out of 10 cases for RGB+3D at an AUROC of at least 93%, which demonstrates the robustness of our method. In contrast, the nearest-neighbor approach PatchCore [36], which provides comparable performance to us on MVT2D, struggles with the increased demands of the dataset and is outperformed by 11% on RGB. The same applies for the 3D extension [24] using FPFH [40] despite using a foreground mask as well. Figure 1 shows qualitative results for the RGB+3D case given both inputs and ground truth annotations. More ex-
v3r2 | amples can be found in the supplemental material. Despite the low resolution, the regions of the anomaly can still be localized well for practical purposes. Table 4 reports the pixel-AUROC of our method and previous work.
nv42 | For the class peach in the RGB+3D setting, the top of Figure 5 compares the distribution of student-teacher dis- tances for anomalous and normal regions. The distribution of anomalous samples shows a clear shift towards larger dis- tances. At the bottom of Figure 5, the outputs of student and teacher as well as our the distance of corresponding pairs representing our anomaly score are visualized by a random orthographic 2D projection. Note that visualizations made by techniques such as t-SNE [49] or PCA [33] are not mean- ingful here, since the teacher outputs (and therefore most of the student outputs) follow an isotropic standard normal distribution. Therefore, different random projections barely differ qualitatively.
xags | 4.4.2 Ablation Studies
jc47 | We demonstrate the effectiveness of our contributions and design decisions with several ablation studies. Table 5 compares the performance of variants of students with the teacher, which can be used as a density estimator itself for anomaly detection by using its likelihoods, given by Eq. 2, as anomaly score. In comparison, a symmetric student- teacher pair worsens the results by 1 to 2%, excepting the RGB case. However, the performance is already improved for RGB and 3D+RGB by creating the asymmetry with a deeper version of the student than the teacher by doubling the number of coupling blocks to 8. This effect is further

Bottom: Random orthographic projections of student and teacher outputs grouped in non-defective (left plot) anomalous regions (right plot) for the class peach. The plotted student-teacher distance repre- senting the anomaly score is clearly higher for anomalous regions since the student is not able to match the teacher outputs, as it was only trained on non-defective regions.
xek3 | enhanced if the architecture of the NF-teacher is replaced by a conventional feedforward network as we suggest. We also vary the depth of our student network and analyzed its relation to performance, model size and inference time in Table 6. With an increasing number of residual blocks nst_blocks, we observe an increasing performance which is almost saturated after 4 blocks. Since the remaining poten- tial in detection performance is not in relation to the lin- early increasing additional computational effort per block, we suggest to choose 4 blocks to have a good trade-off.
bbpr | In Table 7 we investigate the impact of the positional en- coding and the foreground mask. For MVT3D, positional encoding improves the detection by 1.4% of our AST-pair when trained with 3D data as the only input. Even though the effect is not present when combining both data modal- ities, we consider it generally reasonable to use the posi- tional encoding, considering that the integration with just 32 additional channels does not significantly increase the computational effort.
5zyf | Foreground extraction in order to mask the loss for train- ing and anomaly score for testing is also highly effective. Since the majority of the image area often consists of back- ground, the teacher has to spend a large part of the distri- bution on the background. Masking allows the teacher and student to focus on the essential structures. Moreover, noisy

5vqw | 5. Conclusion
meyw | We discovered the generalization problem of previous student teacher pairs for AD and introduced an alternative student-teacher method that prevents this issue by using a highly different architecture for student and teacher. We were able to compensate for skewed likelihoods of a nor- malizing flow-based teacher, which was used directly for detection in previous work, by the additional use of a stu- dent. Future work could extend the approach to more data domains and improve the localization resolution.
