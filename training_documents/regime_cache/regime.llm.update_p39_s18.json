Reformulating the Poisson equation. Computing the optimal value alpha star defined in expression three point thirteen requires computing the second-order response, as discussed in Section three point three. In particular, this is done by using the recursive expression two point twenty-five, obtained from the Fokker-Planck equation via formal asymptotics. We reformulate expression two point twenty-five for Feynman-Kac systems to compute the second-order response, using that, in view of expression A point three,\n7s4b | Bar psi sub two comma alpha equals quantity negative script L sub zero inverse end quantity dagger of quantity tilde script L sub phys dagger plus alpha tilde script L sub extra dagger end quantity bar psi sub one minus bar lambda sub two comma alpha psi sub zero end quantity, where the value of bar lambda sub two comma alpha is determined by expression A point five. This procedure could be extended to arbitrary orders by identifying terms with the same orders in eta in expression A point one.\nehif | the density of the invariant probability measure for the systems at hand, namely over-damped Langevin dynamics in one and two dimensions, and Langevin dynamics in one dimension. This approach can be straightforwardly extended to solving Poisson equations with nontrivial right-hand sides such as expressions two point twenty-three or the integrand in the asymptotic variance two point forty-three. We start each section by first discussing the discretizations associated with the equilibrium dynamics, after which we mention the modification needed when adding perturbations.\nbuv0 | For all systems, the spatial domain, namely the torus Td equals open bracket zero comma one close bracket d, is discretized into ma points with uniform step size hq equals one over mq in each direction.

Overdamped Langevin dynamics. For a continuous function u: T maps to R, we denote by open bracket u close bracket i equals u of Qi, where Qi equals ihq are the mesh points. Similarly, for a continuous function u: T superscript two maps to R, we denote by open bracket u close bracket i comma j equals u of Qi comma j, where Qi comma j equals open bracket ihq comma jhq close bracket are the mesh points.
