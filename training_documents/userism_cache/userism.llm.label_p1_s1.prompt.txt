You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,

82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

o2kr | Post-Userism
v6sk | ABSTRACT
1wj6 | HCI is focused on improving the interactions we have with technology and innovating new types of interactions, as well as expanding the types of people for whom those interactions are designed. Central to these efforts is the simultaneously empowering and contested construct of the "user." This paper examines what the construct of the user highlights, as well as what it conceals. We introduce post- userism, a perspective that simultaneously acknowledges the limits of, and proposes alternatives to, the central construct of the user as proxy for the "human" in HCI. Drawing on developments across the historical trajectory of HCI, we articulate how the user is enacted across four different levels of representation-systems, interface, design process, and the ideology-and identify situations where the user breaks down. Synthesizing prior work, we offer a series of strategies for grappling with such situations. In doing so, we seek to overcome the limitations imposed by the user and develop a language that will aid in evolving the foundations of HCI by asking what, exactly, we place at the center of our scholarship and design.

dpv6 | INTRODUCTION
8r5j | Human computer interaction examines the interactions between computational systems and human beings. While seemingly obvious, the simplicity of this statement belies numerous underlying tensions. When originally articulated, HCI was "a discipline concerned with the design, evaluation and implementation of interactive computing systems for human use and with the study of major phenomena surrounding them" [50:5]. In other words, the

r5il | primary, or perhaps even the only, kind of interaction of interest was when a human was using a computer. Put differently, users are the raison d'Ãªtre of HCI.
5gui | In this paper, we demonstrate how a myopic focus on the user prevents us from fully accounting for the diversity of interactions between humans and computers, either in our scholarship or in our design work. Enumerating subject positions beyond "user," as well as articulating the relationships among them, helps to broaden the scope of interactions for which HCI can account.
82qc | From User to Post-user
ls7d | HCI has experienced significant successes in its mission to bring the human user to the forefront of both the study and the design of technology. User interface design, groupware, social media, e-commerce-these arenas demonstrate how the practices of user-centered design have empowered technology users, making them the focus both of HCI design and scholarship.
tzt3 | Part of user-centered design's strength comes from a willingness to elevate anyone to the status of user. The most common way to account for the H in HCI is to cast that person as a user. In effect, to "user-ify" people- transforming people into representations within our systems, interfaces, design practices, and discourse-has become more than our method, it has become our ideology. With this ideology comes a set of values, principles, and commitments that shape what we do and how we do it.
t8vv | Engaging people through the lens of the user is a double- edged sword. On the one side, calling someone a user and centering a design around them has significant potential for empowerment. However, HCI also has a fraught relationship with the term "user." Our misgivings are concisely captured in Tufte's popular quote that "only two industries refer to their customers as 'users': computer design and drug dealing" [10]. Meanwhile, faced with more than nomenclature, HCI researchers and practitioners have increasingly encountered interactions with computers that fall outside the traditional scope of use.
qvnu | The broadening scope of human-computer interactions becomes evident in recent work. Numerous studies have identified niches of "invisible" groups [21] who often reside "out there" [83] beyond the well-educated, affluent, industrialized contexts of much technology research. People in developing regions who do not have direct access to or ownership of certain devices (due to cost, lack of literacy,

5746 | access constraints, etc.) will interact with technology via an intermediary, who uses the technology on their behalf [75]. Examples also occur in contexts more familiar to many in the HCI community. Individuals at times create single-use, "throwaway" accounts to post content or questions they do not want linked with their primary online identity [65]. The complexities of algorithmically-based systems, such as search engines, can lead to inadvertent associations, e.g., between gay men and sex offenders [1] or between African Americans and incarcerated criminals [7,82]. Social media profiles for deceased users are transformed by their friends and family into memorial pages [16,17]; the people "using" such profiles differ from the site's representation of who the profile's user is. Recent interest in technology non-use [9,76] is also symptomatic of this larger condition. In each case, there exist relationships and interactions with computing technology-the beneficiaries of an intermediary, individuals with multiple throwaway accounts, subjects of algorithmic discrimination, mourners-that fall beyond the traditional bounds of "user." Focusing on the person who "uses" the computer limits our ability to perceive, let alone to design for, these other kinds of configurations.
7toz | In order to move beyond the "user", we borrow from humanistic discourse and theorizing of subjectivity and subject positions. As described by [5], subject positions speak to the "social roles that people are thrust into" while subjectivity refers to the "felt experience ... of individuals" in a given position [5:134]. Subject positions in HCI include "power users, novices, early adopters, and non- users; [ ... ] gamers, trolls, and n00bs; standard users and admins; [ ... ] makers and hackers; [ ... ] and many more" [5:134]. Subject positions are relational, both exists because of and is defined by its relationships within an ecology of other subject positions. This quality makes them an ideal way to talk about human-computer relationships, and the way that HCI's users frame subject positions and subjective experiences.
j346 | How can we do so in a principled way that facilitates both rigorous scholarship and informed design practice? At first glance, documentation of these alternative subject positions may seem scattershot, a disorganized effort to recapture the remainder. However, looking across such examples, underlying structural similarities emerge that span the diverse niches. Explicating such similarities offers an approach that we term post-userism. In many ways, the user is a modernist notion [74], one that emphasizes the values of efficiency, calculability, and predictability. In turn, the modernist impulse essentializes the subject position of the user [37]. Responding to the modernist thinking that permeates much of the work in HCI [cf. 20], our terminology is meant to invoke concepts from post- modernism, post-structuralism, and post-humanism [22,23,30,36,37,57,62,64]. Doing so can enable HCI, both in scholarship and in design, to account for the diversity of interactions that can occur among humans and computers.

x972 | The argument presented here proceeds as follows. We first track the historical development of the ideology of the user across scholarship in HCI. We then describe how the construct of the user appears and is used differently across four levels of representation: systems, interface, design process, and ideological. These four levels provide an analytic perspective that we use to examine a series of examples from prior work in HCI, describing how post- userism occurs when there are breakdowns across levels of representation. We then synthesize across these examples to present a series of strategies both for identifying and for grappling with post-user scenarios. We conclude by offering an outline of how post-userism can offer a conceptual foundation for simultaneously expanding and strengthening the scope of HCI.
cwrw | THE IDEOLOGY OF THE USER
4i0e | What, then, is a user? To some extent, being a user represents a particular type of relationship, i.e., a particular subject position, that people can have in relationship to technology. In the words of the software engineering ISO standard, "a user is 'an individual or group' who 'uses [a] software product to perform a specific function' and 'benefits from a system during its utilization' [8:3295, citing 52,53]. However, the user is also a rhetorical device used both to justify the existence of HCI as a field and to distinguish it from each of computer science and cognitive psychology [27]. In practice, the user enables us to engage with and account for human beings who will interact with computing technology during the design and evaluation of those technologies. However, as we argue below, the dominance of the user simultaneously constrains the types of human-computer interactions we can meaningfully account for in our research.
h2l3 | To be sure, "user" is not the only term used to refer to human beings in HCI. Experimental subjects, ethnographic informants, social network egos and alters, gamers, museum attendees, employees, citizens-these and many other roles lie within the purview of HCI research and practice. When it comes to design, though, we generally account for these humans who use the technologies we build and study as users. The ideology of the user refers to this impetus to "user-ify" people, that is, to see or place people in the subject position of technology user.
dfzb | The user, however, does not exist as an a priori entity. Rather, it is repeatedly created, enacted, and reified over the historical development of HCI [27,90], albeit with some changes along the way. Here, we track that evolution of "user." In doing so, we show that the notion of the user continues both to exist and to exert significant influence, despite numerous large-scale intellectual and practical shifts in the field.

h27a | articulation of three waves of HCI. For our purposes, these waves can be characterized by their responses to each of three definitional questions:
pdjh | 1. What is a human?
xmgs | 2. What is a computer?
bd9h | 3. What is an interaction?
m047 | Answering these three questions plays an essential role in articulating the default subject position of the user: a human interacting with a computer.
gy8c | First Wave
y4mj | First wave HCI is grounded in its disciplinary ancestors: cognitive/experimental psychology and computer science, most notably exemplified by the text The Psychology of Human-Computer Interaction [25]. This paradigm emphasizes quantitative metrics of improved performance, especially speed (faster is better) and errors (fewer is better). Fitts' law [35] as applied to interface design provides a prototypical example. Both its mathematicality and its objects of interest-time, distance, size-are characteristic of first wave HCI. The modernist [74] values of efficiency, calculability, and predictability become clearly apparent in this formulation. To be clear, research still actively pursues first wave types of questions. Thus, first wave constitutes HCI in the following way:
vpgq | 1. A human is a rational actor trying to optimize performance (increase speed, reduce errors, etc.).
ousl | 2. A computer is an information processing device to enable that rational actor to perform its task.
m4ju | 3. An interaction is an information exchange between human and computer (e.g., GOMS [25]).
a0mb | Thus, the first wave user is a rational actor who functions as part of an information processing loop with the computer. In practice, this generally means a single human sitting in front of and operating a single computer terminal. This model human processor [24,25] becomes the canonical depiction of the user, the one from which future conceptions of the user arise and against which alternative conceptions are contrasted.
ki8m | Second Wave
km8w | Second wave HCI moves, as it were, "from human factors to human actors" [4]. An important component of this shift involves acknowledging the context in which computer use occurs. In the case of second wave, this context was often one of professional work, including the ways that individual technology use both shapes and is shaped by the group(s) and/or organization(s) of which that individual is a member [41,43,69]. Furthermore, the human is treated as a situated actor [81] with her or his own plans, motivations, goals, etc. These shifts result in the following constitution of HCI:
wzno | 1. A human is a situated actor (often a member of an organization) trying to accomplish a task within a particular organizational context, often as part of a
xagm | 6293
iwn5 | CHI 2017, May 6-11, 2017, Denver, CO, USA
uooz | group of other people who may be members of the same or different organizations.
pxbq | 2. A computer is a software application used in the conduct of work (calendar, spreadsheet, word processor, etc.).
jfsr | 3. An interaction involves using software to accomplish a goal, often related to the individual's work context.
u15r | Thus, the second wave user is a situated actor who employs software applications to perform the tasks associated with her or his job within the context of a particular work and/or organizational setting. In these ways, second wave HCI moves to acknowledging the presence of multiple users, each of whom is interacting either with their own or with shared software application(s). The focus on the user, though, is still paramount. Second wave HCI is driven by developing "a better understanding among researchers, and many system designers too, about the 'users' of computer systems" [4:25]. On one hand, Bannon argues convincingly for treating people as more than "just" users, acknowledging that they are simultaneously workers, practitioners, etc. On the other, the focus in second wave very clearly remains on the people who directly interact with, i.e., use, the system.
lq35 | Third Wave
3g9w | The third wave of HCI begins to grapple with life outside of professional and organizational work contexts. Moving beyond the workplace and productivity, computing takes on numerous varied roles: leisure [14,15], socializing [60,61], gaming and sport [3,26], sensing and expressing emotion [12,79], cultural production and meaning making [46,86], etc. As computing moved "off the desktop" [87] into smartphones, mp3 players, cars, tablets, etc., it moved into myriad other facets of our lives. These developments constitute HCI in yet another way:
d09o | 1. A human is a person engaging in (a set of) socio- cultural practices embedded within a numerous broader contexts, including cultural, historical, political, organizational, etc. [52]
ylhz | 2. A computer is a technological system that may consist of a single device, a constellation of devices, an infrastructure, or a more complex assemblage that arises from and is embedded within a particular set of contexts.
a3td | 3. An interaction is the experience [31,91] of leveraging a technological system in the course of an individually, socially, or culturally meaningful practice.
ex5k | Ultimately, the model is of a human using technology to engage in socio-culturally situated practices.
9d4o | Thus, the third wave user becomes a person using technology to engage in socio-culturally situated practices (commerce, leisure, artistic performance, sport, etc.). Work along these lines includes situations involving one user and
