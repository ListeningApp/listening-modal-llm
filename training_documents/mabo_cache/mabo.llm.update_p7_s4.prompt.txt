You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

kqmi | To prove native title, an entitlement to occupy or use particular land needs to be established. The entitlement must be of sufficient significance to demonstrate a locally recognised special relationship between the in- digenous users and the land.36
g8rd | The central concepts to native title are 'presence' upon the land37 and 'connexion' with the land.38 Traditional connexion with the land will be evidenced by the indigenous people's substantial continued acknowledg- ment of traditional laws and customs with respect to the land.39 Native title requires presence on the land which amounts to occupancy.40 How- ever, this need not necessarily amount to possession as it is understood by the common law.41 Such presence must be established at least from the time the Crown asserted its general sovereignty.42
nns9 | What will amount to 'presence' or 'connexion' is governed by the de- mands of the land and the indigenous society in question. Brennan J said:43
9uwy | The nature and incidents of native title must be ascertained as a matter of fact by reference to those laws and customs. The ascertainment may present a problem of considerable difficulty ....
srly | By this reasoning, a nomadic lifestyle per se is not inconsistent with the existence of native title. However, the presence on the land must be more than merely coincidental or truly random.44 Thus, as noted by Deane and Gaudron JJ, native title can result from an indigenous people's established use of land to obtain food, either by cultivation or hunting.45
dl6i | Native title is not, ordinarily, individual title. Presence upon, or connexion with, a particular land giving rise to native title may relate to land either communally or individually held.46 Thus, to note the example provided by Toohey J, a number of groups of indigenous people may come onto the land for ceremonial purposes.47 Upon this basis, native title may be shared between different indigenous groups.48
89ub | Because native title is not an institution of the common law, it is alien- able only in conformity with traditional customs and law. Thus, native
dhle | title cannot be alienated outside the indigenous clan or group,49 though it can be surrendered voluntarily or upon purchase to the Crown.50 Only the Crown can acquire native title. This it can do by virtue of the Crown's capacity as sovereign over the whole of Australian territory. Native title cannot be acquired by those who do not acknowledge and observe the laws and customs of the indigenous people. Brennan J said:51
2nib | It follows that a right or interest possessed as a native title cannot be acquired from an indigenous people by one who, not being a member of the indig- enous people, does not acknowledge their laws and observe their customs; nor can such a right or interest be acquired by a clan, group or member of the indigenous people unless the acquisition is consistent with the laws and cus- toms of that people. Such a right or interest can be acquired outside those laws and customs only by the Crown.
naev | Notwithstanding the Mabo decision, the exact legal character of the native title remains unclear. Brennan J took the view that native title is, in some circumstances, 'proprietary' in nature and thus capable of accom- modating personal usufructuary rights.52 Deane and Gaudron JJ took the view that native title is 'personal' in nature, upon the premise that it is inalienable.53 However, such a personal nature was more than a mere 'per- missive occupancy'.54 Dawson J, who dissented, took the view that na- tive title is only 'permissive occupancy'. Toohey J declined to decide the nature of native title given that, in any case, the Crown, acting appropri- ately, could readily extinguish it.55
7h0h | According to the majority view in Mabo, where an indigenous clan or group have continued to observe tradition and customs concerning their land, the native title remains in existence. Change in the traditional soci- ety over time does not, of itself, extinguish native title. Similarly, native title will not be lost by an indigenous society modifying its traditional way of life.56 However, if the indigenous people abandon their laws and customs relating to the land, or abandon the land or surrender it to the Crown, the native title is lost. Once native title is lost, it cannot be re- vived.57
a64c | The recognition of native title by the common law of Australia thus allows native title to be protected by any legal or equitable remedies which are appropriate to the particular rights and interests as established by the evidence. Such rights and interests may include proprietary, personal and
gi7n | usufructuary interests, whether possessed by a community or a group or an individual.58
3pn1 | An indigenous people's claim to possession of land, based upon na- tive title, can be protected, or their entitlement enforced, by a representa- tive action brought on the community's behalf.59 That is, a single member of an indigenous community has standing to bring a Mabo-style claim on behalf, and for the benefit, of the indigenous community.60
wjuz | HOW MAY NATIVE TITLE BE EXTINGUISHED?
3yxv | With the Crown's sovereignty over the whole of Australia came power to create and extinguish private rights and interests in land within the sov- ereign's territory. It follows that, with sovereignty, came the power to ex- tinguish native title with complete legality.61 Essentially, any Crown grant or alienation which is clearly inconsistent with the continued exercise and enjoyment of native title over the land extinguishes the native title to the extent of the inconsistency.62 In order effectively to extinguish native title, a clear intention to do so must be manifested. Brennan J said:63
d8zj | . the exercise of a power to extinguish native title must reveal a clear and plain intention to do so, whether the action be taken by the Legislature or by the Executive.
ywxn | Such an intention will depend upon all the circumstances of the case, including the terms of any relevant legislation.64
uxhs | However, to focus attention exclusively upon the intent of the Crown may be misleading. Rather, what appears to be crucial under Mabo is how, in fact, the Crown action, if any, affected the right of the indigenous peo- ple to enjoy the native title. Brennan J said:65
ed6e | The extinguishing of native title does not depend on the actual intention of the Governor in Council (who may not have adverted to the rights and inter- ests of the indigenous inhabitants or their descendants), but on the effect which the grant has on the right to enjoy the native title.
6qqm | Upon this basis, the essential inquiry concerning claims to land under the Mabo decision must be the capacity of the indigenous people to con- tinue to enjoy native title. Upon such a premise, it is clear that native title
onum | would be extinguished by a grant of the subject land in fee simple or grant of a lease (unless the lease purports to preserve native rights to enjoy the subject land).66 Similarly, appropriation of land for a road, rail- way or any other purpose, which necessarily precludes continued enjoy- ment of native title to the land, would also extinguish native title.67
3iir | If the Crown's actions are more limited, in the sense that they merely regulate the enjoyment of native title or create a regime of control which is consistent with the continued enjoyment of native title, then native title to the land will not be extinguished.68 Thus, a law reserving, or authoris- ing reservation of, land for indigenous people does not extinguish native title to the area.69 Nor would the dedication of land as a national park or the grant of an authority to prospect for minerals.70
