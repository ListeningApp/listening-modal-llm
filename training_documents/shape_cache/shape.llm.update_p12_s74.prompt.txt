You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

hy0l | We, therefore, reject hypothesis 4.
4jmz | A one-way between-groups analysis of variance explored the FFIT body shape's association with shoul- der-to-shoulder (horizontal) measurements. There was a statistically significant difference at the <LATEX>p < 0 . 0 5</LATEX> level for shoulder measurements for the FFIT's seven body shapes; <LATEX>F \left( 6 , 8 8 . 8 7 \right) = 4 1 . 6 5 8 ,</LATEX> <LATEX>p < 0 . 0 1 .</LATEX> The <LATEX>^ { 2 }</LATEX> was 0.16, indicating a large effect size.

Table 7 presents the post hoc - pairwise - comparisons using the Tukey HSD test, with a Bonferroni adjustment of
b7cq | <LATEX>p = 0 . 0 0 7 .</LATEX> Despite the ANOVA's statistically significant result, there is little difference between shoulder-to-shoulder (horizontal) and the FFIT Body Shapes. While Top Hourglass has a significantly different shoulder meas- urement than every other body shape, other body shapes have at least one insignificant difference. Figure 5 visualises the confidence intervals, revealing the sig- nificant overlap between shoulder measurements and body shapes. Therefore, we cannot imply a person's shoulder-to-shoulder (horizontal) measurement with confidence from the FFIT body shape alone.
0b39 | Discussion Unauthoritative body shape classification
qecd | We show that the FFIT Body shape classification sys- tem is unauthoritative because slight differences in measurement placement definition leads to different
1o7p | shape classifications of the same body: in up to 39.6% of cases. Something likely to occur because of variabil- ities in scanner definition and a lack of clarity regard- ing measurement definitions that hold the same nomenclature. This paper, therefore, highlights a limi- tation in the current body shape calculation methodol- ogies, stemming from applying inconsistent measurement definitions in the FFIT. The results verify the FFIT may classify a single person in up to three different body shape depending on the measurement definitions associated with the named measurement. With a vague definition of body shape between sour- ces, multiple shape interpretations occur depending on where on the body the measurement is placed, highlighted within Table 1.
cp13 | Hourglass and rectangle are the dominant body shapes within our sample, as Table 3 shows. However, the shape classification transforms with the alteration in measurement definitions; see Table 3 and Figure 4. The FFIT's waist, for example, is higher in the waist region than SizeUK's waist, as defined by the SizeUK Measurement Extraction Protocol (SizeUK 2002). The mismatch in measurement definitions emphasises high specificity's importance in the way ergonomists and garment construction practitioners take measurements to extract the repeatable and accurate measurements that drive shape classification.
bgre | Significantly smaller waist measurements in the FFIT causes alternative body shape classifications. These arose when the 3 D body scanner searched for the nar- rowest point within the FFIT's broader waist region of SoB + 6.35 cm. The difficulty here is the 3 D body scan- ner's propensity to place the waist at the ribcage's base, a measurement smaller than the actual waist. The actual waist should occur in the waist region's soft tis- sue (Gill et al. 2014). Furthermore, as Sokolowski and Bettencourt (2020) note, the FFIT assumes the waist region is smaller than the bust and hip. Sokolowski and Bettencourt (2020, 22) show that the FFITs categorisa- tion - as Yim Lee et al.'s (2007) formulate - incorrectly categorises plus-sized women 'often because the waist circumferences were larger than either bust or hip'.
57lp | In summary, ergonomists and garment construction practitioners require a non-equivocal and repeatable set of measurement placement definitions to produce a stable and repeatable body shape classification sys- tem. The FFIT does not adhere to this, using flawed Hip and Waist definitions that can place measure- ments in inappropriate regions. If the FFIT instead uses an anatomically correct Hip definition - as SizeUK's Measurement Extraction Protocol (SizeUK 2002) uses - it will raise a question about the math- ematical descriptors' accuracy, presented in Table A1 in Appendix. The mathematical descriptors were, after all, developed using information from literature, experts' tacit knowledge in apparel design and fit, and the visual analysis of segmental proportions that exist in the female body's bust-to-hips zone. Ergonomists, garment construction practitioners, and researchers cannot, therefore, consider the FFIT as accurate orap- propriate enough for scientific or cultural discussion, a forum requiring non-equivocal categorisation.
ukth | The need for shoulder anthropometrics
kpvt | Our results show two shoulder measurements differenti- ate between the FFIT body shape classifications Shoulder-to-Shoulder (Horizontal) and Shoulder- to-Shoulder (Calliper). While the FFIT shapes may have an eminent power in predicting horizontal shoulder widths (see Table 5), the remaining measurements only show small to medium effect sizes. These close associa- tions show limited power relative to the higher com- plexities of shoulder anthropometrics such as pitch, slope length, and front-to-back depth. Multiple interpre- tations of the FFIT definitions confound this, as Figure 4 outlines. Including shoulder measurements within a more advanced - future - body shape classification sys- tem may lead to more effective and stable shape out- comes that align to newer ISO standards. This outcome is expected yet previously unproven. FFIT has a limited applicability in defining more complex body morph- ology than 'typical' female form - as Sokolowski and Bettencourt's (2020) evolution of FFIT to include
jie2 | plus-sized women proves. Existing knowledge of anthropometric inter-relationships (Pheasant 1986) - and how alternative Body Shape algorithms utilise different body measurements (Johnson 1990; Sheldon 1954; Simmons, Istook, and Devarajan 2004a) - indicates the need for a study addressing body shape that is consist- ent. However, we show Shoulder-to-Shoulder (horizontal) measurements have a large effect size differentiating body shape classification. It is surprising that FFIT excludes the Shoulder-to-Shoulder (horizontal) measure- ment given its importance in industrial ergonomics and garment construction (Beazley and Bond 2003) and use systems that predate FFIT (Farr 2004; Debenhams 2014; Rasband 1994). Measurement selection is, after all, mutu- ally exclusive to anthropometric measurement extraction technology. Through using the FFIT, ergonomists, aca- demics, and garment construction practitioners have a deficiency in how they consider bodies.
