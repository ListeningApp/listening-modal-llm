For example, compared with Sparks and Cameron Park where the median cost of a lot, in nineteen eighty-three prices, was three thousand seven hundred forty-four dollars and three thousand three hundred sixty-two dollars respectively, the corresponding median for all the survey settlements in the Rio Grande City study was two thousand three hundred forty-six dollars-more than one-third less. Moreover, as we saw in Figure two, there is often considerable settlement variation between the survey settlements. In our questionnaire data, the higher prices charged in Mike's colonia have the effect of inflating the overall average considerably, especially given the larger number of data points in that settlement. The averages and median vary somewhat between those in the Control and Study Groups respectively, with Study Group colonias usually being somewhat higher, by three hundred to four hundred dollars or two to three cents per square foot. But, as Table three shows, prices vary markedly between colonias, with the outliers being Mike's which has a higher trimmed mean, T sub X equals three thousand six hundred twenty-eight dollars, and West Alto Bonito, especially if one takes square foot costs in that colonia, around fifty cents per square foot. In conclusion, while unit land prices are more or less the same in Starr County as in other border counties, the actual cost of purchasing a lot is considerably less. Selling smaller-sized lots in Starr County was the way in which developers sought to adjust supply to the potential demand, ensuring affordability in a region that, as we observed earlier, is an exceptionally poor part of the Texas border.\n7w7j | The determinants of land price differentials. The comparison between the Control and Study Groups suggests that neither the presence or absence of title deeds, nor the provision of clear land titles, makes any appreciable difference to land prices. Thus, one might reasonably ask, what does make a difference? As an important sidebar analysis, we are interested, therefore, in trying to explain why settlements seem to vary so much in average lot prices. Is it location, location, location-the classic assertion; or is it location in combination with other physical site characteristics? Alternatively, given that these are poorly serviced communities, does\n51vd | the actual level of infrastructure provision or community-generated improvements shape the price of land?\nbaj1 | On the face of it, location and proximity to RGC do not appear to play any role at all since prices are highest in Mike's and West Alto Bonito, which are the most distant, while Las Lomas, which is much closer in, has lower lot prices. Nor did any of the colonias have any particular servicing advantage at the outset that could explain higher prices, although the expectancy that services might come on line more readily from the mid nineteen nineties might have affected land prices as discussed earlier, but this would only be reflected in those settlements in which lots were sold primarily during this phase. Physical conditions might help to explain the lower cost in B and E, which is steep and relatively inaccessible, tucked away as it is behind another colonia La Puerta Number two. But West Alto Bonito also has a major negative externality of a, sometimes, flooding arroyo running through it, although buyers would almost certainly not have known this when they purchased, so it probably did not affect the asking price.\nn1wo | Thus, we need to explore other variables in order to try to explain what influences land price-setting in colonias and we turn here to explanations that are sometimes referred to in the academic literature as socially determined. Interestingly, and unexpectedly for the study researchers, the single best explanation of the variation on lot and unit prices appears to relate to who developed the colonia in the first instance, and the period of development. As we observed earlier, responsibility for developing these colonias rested primarily with two men-Blas Chapa and Elías López. According to the CRG database, Blas Chapa developed almost half, six hundred eighty-two, of the total lots in the fifteen settlements, while Elías was responsible for eighteen percent, two hundred fifty-four, and they sold ninety-one lots, six point five percent, in partnership. Some twenty-seven percent of lots were recorded as having been sold by others-either smaller developers or by individuals reselling their lots as traspasos. Moreover, while both Blas Chapa\n5bq3 | and Elías López were actively engaging in lot sales from the late nineteen seventies, either individually or in combination, Elías' major involvement only truly kicked in between nineteen eighty-nine and nineteen ninety-four. After nineteen ninety-five-the prohibition on developer sales of this nature-sales are exclusively by others, largely traspasos.\nezla | Like most colonia developers, Blas Chapa and Elías López were intimately engaged in the planning and sale process, and yet unlike most formal real estate developers they retained very close day-to-day ties with the residents, so much so that despite their illegal lot-sale shenanigans they continued to be quite well regarded by those to whom they had sold lots, Blas Chapa especially. Both men felt close personal ties to the settlements, so much so that they often named the settlements for themselves or their relatives: B and E, for Blas and Elías, Mike's, for Elías' son, and Amada Acres, for Elías' wife. West Alto Bonito and Mike's were developed primarily by Elias López who almost always sold lots through Contract for Deed and, while both Blas and Elías developed B and E jointly, Blas undertook the actual business side of the development. Blas Chapa was much more involved in the remaining colonias, but he was less likely to offer purchasers a Contract for Deed, but sold lots much more informally, keeping an accounts book and giving out receipts. He was also known to be more amenable to making more casual deals, taking into account other criteria-such as the buyer being a personal friend or coming recommended by friends and relatives whom he knew and liked. Perhaps he was just softer: certainly, people seem to have fonder memories or enjoyed better relations with Blas Chapa than they did with Elías López-a point that came through strongly in focus group discussions that also formed an important part of the study methodology.\nrsbu | Several interesting and important findings emerge from Figures four and five. First, the histograms show quite clearly that lots sold by Blas Chapa were much cheaper than those sold by Elías López; indeed, they were under\nmagd | two thousand dollars per lot, in nineteen eighty-three prices, compared with three thousand five hundred dollars. Quite how Elías López managed to sell lots at much higher prices is hard to\n",
