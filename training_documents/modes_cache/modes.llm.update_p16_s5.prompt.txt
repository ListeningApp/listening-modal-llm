You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.

chx3 | Therapists who utilize the empathizing mode put a sig- nificant amount of time and effort into striving to un- derstand a client's interpersonal needs and perspective as accurately as possible. They are able to notice and re- spond to the nuances in clients' affect and behavior, and they pay particular attention to clients' emotional experi- ences during therapy. Generally, they listen carefully, are watchful of what their clients communicate, and adjust their approach accordingly (Fig. 4.6).
sfcf | To ensure that they see things from the perspective of the client, therapists utilizing the empathizing mode will periodically summarize what a client has said or make other nonverbal attempts to reflect their understanding of what the client is communicating. This strategy leads a client to either affirm the therapist's accuracy or reassert or reexplain his or her perspective. This process of careful listening and observing inevitably leads to a richer under- standing of what is being communicated. During occupa- tional therapy sessions that involve activity, empathizing
nuxs | requires a brief period of intermission from the "doing" as- pects of therapy so that the therapist can process and con- vey an understanding of what a client has communicated.
umx0 | Therapists utilizing the empathizing mode take the time to accept and validate clients' difficult problems and painful emotions. They do not rush to intervene, solve, or ameliorate them. Instead, they work slowly and cautiously, emphasizing an accurate reflection of the client's perspec- tive and relying on his or her continual striving toward understanding to resolve rifts, obstacles, and conflicts that occur during therapy.
o306 | Strengths of the Empathizing Mode
qm1b | Empathy is vital to a functional and trusting therapeu- tic relationship (Kohut, 1984). Witnessing, validating, actively listening to, and understanding clients' experi- ences in the absence of judgment facilitates emotional healing and enables clients to organize their thinking independently and gain perspective on their difficulties. Empathizing with clients provides a model for them to learn to empathize with themselves and to self-reflect and gain insight into their emotional reactions and behaviors (Fig. 4.7).
n9ms | In addition to these strengths, empathy is fundamental to the resolution of conflicts, rifts, and misunderstandings that occur during therapy. Because therapists who utilize the empathizing mode tend to be patient and understand- ing of negativity when it occurs, they are able to work more effectively with interpersonally challenging clients.
icdp | CASE EXAMPLE 4.4 The Empathizing Mode
wtse | Gretta is an 80-year-old woman who has had many life experiences, including an enduring and loving relationship with her husband. Four months before I met her, she experienced a severe stroke. Follow- ing her stroke and within weeks of beginning out- patient occupational therapy, her beloved husband died. Gretta had been depending on caretaking from her children and in-home attendants. She was referred to outpatient therapy to increase mobiliza- tion and participation in activities of daily living and independent activities of daily living.
bm7g | Immediately, I recognized that Gretta was in a period of intense mourning. I could see that this woman was searching for a human connection. She wanted to grieve and talk about her loss. At that time she was less interested in pursuing occupational therapy goals that would address her functional limitations. I knew I would have to wait to begin work on activities of daily living and, instead, focus on what she wanted to talk about: her husband, what he meant to her, how difficult it was to live in his absence, her thoughts about not wanting to burden her children. . . . I was very conscious about when to
jr68 | talk and when not to talk. .. . I made sure she knew that I had heard what she said and that I understood all of the difficulties she was facing. . . . I also made sure she knew that her thoughts and feelings made sense to me and that I accepted them and honored their importance. For weeks we talked about her current situation, the limitations her stroke caused, how she reacted to it, and how her family reacted. In time, we worked together to create a family situ- ation that would make it easier for everyone to cope with the recent death. I was careful not to mention our discussions or disclose her private thoughts and feelings to her family members. A feeling of mutual trust developed between the two of us. We worked together to manage her stroke and her grieving. Therefore, we also made progress toward the original goals of the therapy.
axix | Gretta taught me the importance of having empathy. For her, it was important that I showed an interest in her grieving and that she could tell a person outside her family about her problems and worries. Because Gretta allowed me to support her through empathy, we both saw the improvements in her emotional condition during therapy.
05y4 | Empathizing tends to disarm clients who are reluctant, resistant, critical, or otherwise negativistic in therapy. When therapists utilize empathy, clients are likely to feel responded to, cared about, and respected. They are more likely to achieve open, honest communication with cli- ents. This typically increases trust and results in a more stable therapeutic relationship.
2fb0 | Cautions of the Empathizing Mode
s9fn | It would seem that a therapist could never empathize too much with clients. However, the empathizing mode is no different than the other modes in that its overuse or mis- use can cause difficulty. For some clients, overemphasis on the empathizing mode can place emotions too much in the foreground of therapy. Some clients may not be ready to see or hear their thoughts, behaviors, or emotions reflected back to them. Instead, they may feel more stable and comfortable focusing on activity and other practi- cal behavioral aspects of occupational therapy. Similarly, if a therapist relies too heavily on empathy, the pacing of treatment is slow, and some of the fundamental tasks of therapy may be delayed or left unaccomplished. For clients who are not yet ready to engage in occupational therapy, this slower pace may be necessary and appropri- ate. However, therapists who rely too heavily on the em- pathizing mode may project their own needs for empathy onto the client. Therefore, they may misread the client's actual level of need for empathy. Therapists who show their own emotional reactions to what the clients are say- ing or that probe too much for emotional expression from the client are perceived by some clients as overinvolved or psychologically intrusive. These clients may respond by recoiling from what they perceive as too much intimacy or emotional intensity.
k5r6 | Even when a client invites or appears comfortable with the empathizing mode, overutilizing it can overprotect clients. Listening and validating may occur at the expense of questioning or challenging clients to engage in occupa- tion when they are ready. Overreliance on empathy may encourage an inappropriate level of dependence in more vulnerable or isolated clients. In addition, there is a risk that some clients may become confused about the goals of therapy and about the role of the occupational thera- pist in his or her treatment. In the absence of appropriate boundaries (e.g., time limits, delineation of the limits of the professional relationship) some clients begin to per-
