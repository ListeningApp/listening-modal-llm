You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

g8rd | Person-Centered Antecedents
nns9 | Although a large number of person-centered character- istics could be considered in a predictive model of voice, practical and statistical concerns limit any single study to a manageable subset of those characteristics (Cohen, 1990). Therefore, in our study, we chose to focus on one person-centered characteristic from each category sug- gested by Van Dyne et al. (1995; i.e., affective characteris- tics and individual differences). Building on past voice research, we chose satisfaction as our affective construct because it is the key antecedent in existing models of voice. Extending past research, we included global self- esteem. Global self-esteem was chosen because of its im- portance in predicting behavior that is somewhat risky to the self.
9uwy | Satisfaction With the Group
srly | Job satisfaction is defined as a pleasurable emotional state resulting from positive cognitive appraisal of one's job or job experiences (Locke, 1976). To date, satisfaction has been the primary antecedent included in models of voice behavior. Researchers typically use Hirschman's (1970) framework and describe voice as a response to dissatisfaction in the context of overall satisfaction or prior satisfaction. Some studies report no relationship be- tween satisfaction and voice (Saunders et al., 1992), and others report a weak but positive relationship (Farrell & Rusbult, 1992; Rusbult et al., 1988; Withey & Cooper, 1989). However, job satisfaction is complex and multidi- mensional (Locke, 1976) and the use of overall job satis- faction may be problematic because it confounds sources of satisfaction. Overall job satisfaction scores based on measures containing multiple components (e.g., work it- self, pay, promotion opportunities, recognition, benefits,
dl6i | working conditions) are ambiguous and can lead to weak or inconsistent empirical findings. For example, an indi- vidual would be characterized as having moderate overall job satisfaction if he or she reported high levels of satis- faction with some things (e.g., work itself, pay, and pro- motion opportunities) and low levels of satisfaction with others (e.g., recognition, benefits, and working condi- tions). Another individual would also be characterized as having moderate job satisfaction if he or she reported moderate levels of satisfaction for everything. Although these two people would have equal overall scores on a measure of job satisfaction, they most likely have different thoughts and feelings regarding their work experience. To the extent that these differences lead to different behav- iors, the use of overall job satisfaction may be problematic (Wanous & Lawler, 1972).
89ub | We suggest that satisfaction with a specific aspect of the work situation rather than overall job satisfaction may be a better predictor of voice behavior. In most organiza- tions, the most proximal work-related source of affect for employees is their group. When employees must interact with others in their work group to perform their jobs, their affective response to this interdependence can be a major source of low and/or high satisfaction (Hackman, 1992). Consistent with social exchange theory (Blau, 1964), we would expect those who are satisfied with their group to be more highly motivated, to invest effort in developing new ideas, and to take the time to communicate these ideas to others in the group. From this perspective, speaking up with constructive recommendations can be viewed as a reciprocal response based on high levels of satisfaction with the group.
dhle | Satisfaction with the group should also relate to voice because those who experience positive affective states are likely to be proactive in taking steps to maintain their good feelings (Carlson, Charlin, & Miller, 1988; George, 1996). According to Locke (1976), "job satisfaction re- sults from the perception that one's job fulfills or allows the fulfillment of one's important job values" (p. 1307). Values are relatively stable and enduring individual beliefs that have pervasive and fundamental effects on behavior (Rokeach, 1973; Schwartz & Bilsky, 1987). Combining the general importance of values and their specific rele- vance to satisfaction, it is reasonable to expect that indi- viduals who are satisfied with their work group should be more attached to the group and more dependent on the group to maintain feelings of satisfaction and to fulfill their values. The implication is that individuals who are highly satisfied with their group should be more likely to engage in proactive behavior (e.g., voice) in the interest of group viability.
2nib | Of course, it is possible that those who are highly satis- fied with their group may have fewer issues about which to offer voice and, therefore, may be less likely to engage
naev | in voice. However, we suggest that individuals who are highly satisfied with their group should be more vigilant and more likely to offer suggestions regarding issues that might detract from the group's long-term viability than individuals who are dissatisfied. Highly satisfied individu- als should also be more willing to invest the time and effort required to deal with these issues (i.e., formulating and presenting ideas and suggestions for change ). Individ- uals who are highly dissatisfied with their group (perhaps due to an awareness of many problems and issues ), on the other hand, should be more likely to express themselves by complaining (e.g., "I am very unhappy with this group because of all the back stabbing"). Complaints are ex- pressions of discontent or dissatisfaction, and unlike voice, do not include or imply suggestions for change or improvement (Kowalski, 1996). Thus, even though highly satisfied individuals may have fewer issues about which to offer voice than dissatisfied individuals, we believe those who are satisfied are more likely to offer construc- tive ideas and suggestions for change. Stated as a hypothesis,
7h0h | Hypothesis 1. Satisfaction with the group will be positively related to voice such that those who are more satisfied with their group will engage in more voice than individuals who are less satisfied with their group.
a64c | Global Self-Esteem
gi7n | Self-esteem is an important predictor of attitudes and behavior in work and nonwork contexts (Brockner, 1988; Wells & Marwell, 1976). Global self-esteem is the degree of positive self-worth that an individual ascribes to him- or herself (Brockner, 1988). It indicates the degree to which individuals believe they are capable, significant, successful, and worthy (Coopersmith, 1981, p. 5) and is often thought of in terms of self-confidence and general- ized self-competence (Tharenou, 1979). Research dem- onstrates that those with high self-esteem conform less (see, e.g., Wells & Marwell, 1976) and exhibit more initia- tive and assertiveness than those with low self-esteem (Crandall, 1973).
3pn1 | By definition, voice behavior requires proactive and assertive nonconformance. Behavior that is change-ori- ented and challenging is risky because organizations often view dissent and other nonconforming behaviors nega- tively (Nemeth & Staw, 1989). In addition, pressure to conform, particularly in work groups, can be substantial because speaking up and engaging in voice can threaten cohesiveness and result in sanctions against those who express divergent opinions (Asch, 1956; Festinger, 1957; Hackman, 1992; Nemeth, 1986). Accordingly, traits such as self-esteem should be important predictors of voice behavior, particularly in the context of work groups. For
