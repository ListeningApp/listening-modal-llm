        "content": "b780 | Another feature of murine minor ZGA is reduced efficiency of splicing and polyadenylation. Spliced transcripts and some degree of termination is detected near the polyA signal and it thus appears that efficiency, rather than specific mechanisms, suppresses processing of nascent transcripts. It may be that the splicing machinery in one-cell pronuclei has limited capacity that would be overwhelmed by nascent transcripts in pronuclei with chromatin highly permissive for transcription. The relaxed control of splicing and polyadenylation correlates with absent nuclear speckles in one-cell embryos and disassembly of nuclear speckles is associated with reduced pre-messenger RNA splicing. While this could explain inefficient processing of nascent transcripts in the larger male pronucleus with its \"na√Øve\" chromatin structure, it is unclear how the same would apply to the female pronucleus, where protamine-histone exchange does not occur. However, next-generation sequencing analysis of parthenogenetic zygotes implies that inefficient splicing exists also in female pronuclei.\nccmb | The significance of minor ZGA in mouse zygotes remains unclear. Why would the zygote produce nascent transcripts across the genome that would be inefficiently processed? Inefficient post-transcriptional processing could have a protective role against misexpression of genes that would compromise development. This could also explain, at least in part, the uncoupling of transcription and translation observed for plasmid-borne reporter genes in one-cell embryos. It is also possible that some transcripts among genes transcribed in one-cell embryos are efficiently spliced and translated into functional proteins important for continued development. Notably, low splicing efficiency would favor protein expression from intron-less genes - in fact, a cluster of intron-less double homeobox genes recently has been implicated in ZGA. Investigation of intron-less genes transcribed during minor ZGA is thus one research direction that could shed more light on the significance of minor ZGA. Finally, as transcription itself is required for some cellular processes, e.g., genomic imprinting, it should be considered that pioneering transcription itself (i.e., not its products) helps to remodel the chromatin during minor ZGA to set the stage for reprogramming of gene expression during major ZGA. This notion resonates with the above-mentioned HiC data showing male pronucleus compartmentalization into active and inactive compartments that aligns with histone four hyperacetylation, which was known to accumulate rapidly in the male pronucleus.\nma93 | Six. The major ZGA in mouse zygotes\nc6hh | Major ZGA in mouse zygotes takes place during the two-cell stage and results in a dramatic change in gene expression. While maternal messenger RNA degradation can be viewed as an oocyte identity-erasing mechanism, major ZGA is a zygotic identity-generating mechanism. This transition is manifested in transcriptome similarities among different stages of OET. Transcriptome profiling by microarrays as well as next-generation sequencing documents an oocyte-like identity of the one-cell transcriptome while the two-cell stage transcriptome profile is shifting to that of the later preimplantation stages. This shift reflects loss of oocyte-like identity through maternal messenger RNA degradation and accumulation of a novel zygotic transcriptome which conveys cellular totipotency.\ny7ea | Importantly, minor and major ZGA differ not only in the volume of transcription, but also in what is transcribed, i.e., the major wave of ZGA is not simply more of the same transcripts expressed during minor ZGA. The estimates of genes transcribed during major ZGA vary according to filtering conditions. For example, microarray profiling of mouse early embryos identified approximately three thousand alpha-amanitin-sensitive genes in two-cell embryos. The bulk of transcription (RNA synthesis) in two-cell embryos occurs in its long G two phase. A small population of genes activated during major ZGA continue their expression in two-cell embryos, but become silenced upon establishment of transcriptionally-repressive chromatin at the end of the two-cell stage. Next-generation sequencing, however, documents that microarrays underestimate the number of expressed genes because arrays lack many non-annotated genes while next-generation sequencing has the sensitivity to detect low abundant transcripts. In addition, single-cell sequencing of hybrid zygotes suggested existence of stochastic monoallelic expression and de novo activation of the paternal X chromosome. In any case, ZGA and reprogramming gene expression entails thousands, not hundreds, of genes.\nnav4 | Seven. Minor and major ZGA in mammals - common and species-specific features\ngem8 | The minor/major ZGA concept developed in mouse zygotes cannot be generalized for all mammals. Human and bovine embryos undergo ZGA several cleavage divisions later (four to sixteen cells), although next-generation sequencing data suggest that transcription could initiate earlier than previously thought. Expression profiling of two-cell mouse zygotes identified greater than three thousand major ZGA genes. Profiling early bovine development identified approximately one hundred transcripts up-regulated at the four-cell stage and approximately one thousand and approximately one thousand three hundred transcripts up-regulated at the eight-cell and sixteen-cell stages, respectively. Profiling of human early development identified approximately two thousand five hundred genes whose expression increased between four-cell and eight-cell stages. According to another study, human ZGA occurs in three waves, with approximately two thousand genes up-regulated between two-cell and four-cell embryos (\"early risers\"), approximately one thousand five hundred genes up-regulated between four-cell and eight-cell embryos (\"middle risers\"), and approximately one thousand four hundred genes up-regulated after eight-cell (\"late risers\").\ne8nr | It might seem that with more sensitive analysis, the ZGA timing in other mammals would shift into earlier stages and the minor ZGA could occur as early as in mice. In fact, Xue et al. reported minor ZGA in human one-cell embryos. However, there are two arguments against this possibility. First, some of the evidence for early human genome activation is possibly an experimental artifact, especially when the analysis is restricted to polyA RNA. Second, the whole transcription correlation data paint a different picture when comparing mice with human or bovine early embryos.\nk78w | The mouse model is exceptional in that minor and major ZGA produce distinct sets of RNAs that are separated by the cleavage between one-cell to two-cell embryos. This can be visualized as a difference in developmental stage transcriptome correlations when",
