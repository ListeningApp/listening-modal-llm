You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

ko3c | The digestibility of starch is an important factor in determining the availability of glucose in feed formulations. The enzyme a-amylase hydrolyses starch into maltose. Additional enzymes, maltase and isomaltase, then hydrolyse maltose further into glucose. These enzymes are present in the gastrointestinal tract of fish and shrimp but their activity and effectiveness vary between species. Data are limited for crustacean species (Table II) but in fish, a reduction in digestibility is observed when the dietary level of starch increases, irrespective of the starch origin.
xek3 | Data sources: Cousin et al. (1996) and Rivas-Vega et al. (2006).
bbpr | According to Stone (2003) the reduction in the digestibility of carbohydrates when dietary levels increase may be the result of an overload on the digestive enzymes that become saturated with substrate. The threshold for enzyme saturation by substrate is unknown in crustaceans and it is not apparent in the data shown in Table II.
5zyf | Herbivorous species of fish have high activity and efficacy of starch degrading enzymes. Omnivorous species have moderate activity whilst carnivores have only a limited ability to digest starch.
9own | Since cellulase is quite rare in the animal kingdom, it is generally believed that the source of cellulase in decapod crustaceans is exogenous - symbiotic organisms living in the hepatopancreas. Even so, Yokoe and Yasumasu (1964) found more cellulase activity in hepatopancreas extracts from Procambarus clarkii than shown by Gram- negative bacteria living in the digestive tract.
bqfb | 3.3 Lipases and esterases
wwdt | Lipids, like carbohydrates and proteins, are cleaved by hydrolysis reactions. Otherwise, lipid digestion and absorption are fundamentally different because lipid is not water soluble and coalesces into large droplets in water. The low surface-to-volume ratio of a large lipid droplet is not conducive to effective digestion by lipases, and so emulsification is extremely important for lipid digestion. Emulsification stabilizes small lipid droplets in

2e62 | aqueous solution by coating them with molecules that are partly hydrophobic (to dissolve in the lipid droplet) and partly hydrophilic (to dissolve in water).
75y3 | Vertebrates produce bile in their livers, which flows into the small intestine. Bile salts are moderately effective emulsifying agents and become much more effective in concert with polar lipids such as monoglycerides (the digestive products of triglycerides) and phospholipids (Kanazawa, 1985) (Fig. 9).
s2g2 | Fig. 9. Phosphatidylcholines, typical phospholipids, are made from glycerol (green), two fatty acids (black) and a phosphate group (red), with another molecule attached to its end (blue). The phosphate end of the molecule orients to water (blue background) due to its electric charge, while the non-polar fatty acid end orients to fat.
q1q2 | Invertebrates do not produce bile. Lipase enzymes attach to lipid droplets which form an emulsion and hydrolyse triglycerides to 2-monoglycerides, some glycerol and free fatty acids. Phospholipids play a significant role in lipid emulsification in crustaceans.
cb7r | Lipases which are capable of hydrolysing triglycerides and phospholipids (Table III) have been observed in several species of shrimp (Deering et al., 1996; González et al., 1994; Moss et al., 2001). Due to their function, lipases are commonly named esterases, although they almost exclusively hydrolyse carboxylic esters.
68xu | The presence of real lipases in the shrimp hepatopancreas has been a point of disagreement among specialists working on the physiology and biochemistry of these species, since most of the techniques employed in their study cannot establish whether the lipolytic activity found was due to real lipases or to non-specific esterases.
hd35 | Both triglyceride lipase and phospholipase have been observed in Litopenaeus vannamei (del Monte et al., 2003; Forrellat et al., 2004). A comparison of substrate specificity of lipases from Litopenaeus schmitti indicated a strong preference for n-3 (w-3) and n-6 (w-6) fatty acids (del Monte et al., 2002). Studies of lipases from Litopenaeus vannamei, Farfantepenaeus californiensis and Farfantepenaeus notialis, showed similar preferences (Forrellat et al., 2004). Note, with the exception of the land snail (Cepaea nemoralis) animals are incapable of de novo synthesis of fatty acids with double bonds in the n-6 (linoleic series) and n-3 (linolenic series) positions; only plants are able to synthesize these fatty acids de novo.
2zpk | Lipases and esterases are associated with the microvilli of R-cells as well as vacuoles of F-cells, the lumen of the hepatopancreas tubules and in intertubular connective tissue (López-López et al., 2005).

b780 | 4. Changes in enzyme activity
ccmb | Large changes in enzyme activity are observed during moulting (e.g. trypsin and chitinase) (Sainz Hernández & Cordova Murueta, 2009). Chitinase digests the old exoskeleton so it can be resorbed and replaced by newly synthesized chitin. The production of digestive enzymes also seems to vary throughout the year and even within a species, depending upon the available nutrient resources or stage of development (e.g. Biesiot & Capuzzo, 1990). The Caridean shrimp (Crangon crangon) has high trypsin activity during the summer and low activity during the winter (Pöhlmann, 2007; Sahlmann, 2008).
ma93 | Adjustments to diet composition for proteases, lipolytic enzymes and amylase have been shown for many species. The responses vary among species. In some species, responses are seen in proteolytic and amylase activity but not in lipolytic activity, but for other species, amylase and/or protease activity seem unresponsive (Gamboa- Delgado et al., 2003; López-López et al., 2005; Moss et al., 2001). A high dietary starch content was found to increase the specific activity of a-amylase and a-glucosidase in Litopenaeus vannamei (Gaxiola et al., 2005; Le Moullac et al., 1997). The same species has shown variation in trypsin and chymotrypsin activity with variation in protein level (Le Moullac et al., 1997; Lemos et al., 2000; Muhlia-Almazán & García- Carreño, 2003; Muhlia- Almazan et al., 2008). The magnitude of the stimulation seems to depend on the species and the dietary protein source.
c6hh | Digestive enzymes seem to be released from the hepatopancreas upon feeding (Ong & Johnston, 2006). Passage of food from the midgut to the stomach has been found to induce additional synthesis and secretion of enzymes (Vogt et al., 1989). The release of digestive enzymes by the hepatopancreas is influenced by the endocrine system. For example, crustacean hyperglycaemic hormone (CHH) induces the release of proteases and amylases from the hepatopancreas (Dietrich, 1988); this organ is also responsive to a variety of vertebrate gastrointestinal hormones (Resch-Sedlmeier & Sedlmeier, 1999).
y7ea | 5. Energy storage
nav4 | In mammals and birds, prolonged fasting induces a mobilization of fat stores whilst minimizing protein loss (Cherel et al., 1992). Fish, such as the Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) respond to starvation by mobilizing hepatic lipids first, then muscle and hepatic glycogen and finally muscle protein (Guderley et al., 2003). Long-term flying insects utilize lipids as their main energy source (Van der Horst & Ryan, 2012) while other insect species can use carbohydrates or proline (Gäde & Auerswald, 2002). In crustaceans, it is thought that protein contributes significantly to energy reserves (New, 1976) a conclusion that is consistent with some reports showing a limited capacity of marine crustaceans to store lipids and carbohydrates (Dall & Smith, 1986; Rosas et al., 2001).
gem8 | The hepatopancreas is the main storage organ in crustaceans, mainly accumulating lipids (Adamczewska & Morris, 1994; Luvizotto-Santos et al., 2003; Yepiz-Plascencia et al., 2000) and to a lesser extent, glycogen (Verri et al., 2001). It has been proposed that in crustaceans, neutral lipids (mainly triglycerides) are preferentially catabolized during starvation, while polar lipids (phospholipids and cholesterol) are conserved due to their role as structural components of cell membranes (Bourdier & Amblard, 1989; Heath & Barnes, 1970; Stuck et al., 1996). A large reduction in total lipids in response to starvation has been reported in larvae, sub-adult and adult lobsters (Ritar et al., 2003; Stuck et al., 1996).
e8nr | Glycogen is the most widely distributed animal polysaccharide and can be readily converted to glucose which, being soluble, can then be transported via the blood (Awapara & Simpson, 1967). Crustaceans utilize glycogen as an energy store but the proportion of all energy reserves depends upon the nutritional history of the individual. For example, in the estuarine grapsid crab Chasmagnathus granulata, 21 days of starvation reduced glycogen reserves by 51% in animals previously fed a high protein diet and by 64% in animals fed a high carbohydrate diet (Oliveira et al., 2004). The difference between the utilization of reserves becomes more significant when one considers the initial glycogen concentrations in the hepatopancreas organs: 1.71% in high protein-fed individuals and 2.82% in high carbohydrate-fed individuals. In these experiments, haemolymph glucose was principally

li1k | maintained by effective gluconeogenesis from protein reserves in animals previously fed a high protein diet and from glycogen reserves in animals previously fed a high carbohydrate diet.
pbea | MOLLUSCS
ccpt | Most bivalve molluscs are microphagous (feed on small particles) and feed on particles that are deposited on the substrate (deposit feeders) or in suspension (suspension feeders). Most of the species that are commercially exploited belong to this latter category and use their gills to filter particulate organic matter, usually phytoplankton, from the water.
0fpw | Suspension feeding requires that organic, digestible, materials are trapped, sorted from indigestible mineral particles and passed to the mouth (LaBarbera, 1981). Bivalves achieve this by means of capture mechanisms of the gills and sorting mechanisms of the gills, labial palps and stomach. Intertidal animals possess a feeding rhythm linked to tides (Morton, 1977; 1983).
dqn8 | Dissolved organic substances (monosaccharides, amino acids) or lipid droplets may be absorbed directly by the epithelium of larvae or adults. Many studies (reviewed in Hily, 1991) have demonstrated the existence of active transfer in the mantle and the gills, while certain carbohydrates present in sea water stimulate the rate of pumping and particle retention. Péquignat (1973) found that Mytilus edulis removed dissolved amino acids and glucose, most of which were absorbed onto the gills before transfer to the mantle and digestive gland. Pasteels (1968; 1969) has suggested that the mucus secreted onto the gills of M. edulis has a digestive as well as a mechanical function. The absorptive mechanism is chemically selective, but small particles are removed non-selectively by pinocytosis.
cop0 | Dissolved organic matter plays an important role in nutrition, possibly as a growth factor, particularly in littoral or estuarine zones. Héral et al. (1983) have established a correlation between the production of flesh in cupped oysters in the Marennes Oléron basin and the concentrations of dissolved organic matter, expressed as carbon or nitrogen.
lhkq | 1. Feeding
82ju | 1.1 The role of the gills in feeding
y2qo | The lateral cilia of the gills draw a water current into the mantle cavity (Fig. 10).
1piq | A typical bivalve filters 30 to 60 times its own volume of water in an hour (Famme et al., 1986). Water must pass between the gill filaments in order to reach the exhalant chamber.
7fqw | 1.11 Food capture
rhaz | As the water passes between the filaments (propelled by lateral cilia), food particles are held back by straining cirri (fused large cilia) and are carried forward to the ventral particle groove of the gill towards the mouth by other cilia in mucous strings (Silverman et al., 1999) (Fig. 11).
wak1 | Suspension feeding bivalves are capable of capturing suspended particles over a wide range of sizes, typically between 10-1 and 102 um (Møhlenberg & Riisgård, 1978).
wtfz | In lamellibranchs, the frontal surface with its cilia is important in the capture of food. For this reason, the frontal surface is large relative to that of other molluscs and, and the filaments are slender. The combined frontal surface of the filaments forms large sheets known as lamellae (this is why bivalves are also known as lamellibranchs). The gill filaments are attached to the central axis, which is itself attached to the mantle (Fig. 12).

uodj | Each gill filament drops ventrally (the descending limb) from the central axis and then climbs dorsally (the ascending limb). The ascending lamellae attach either to the mantle skirt (lateral filaments) or the visceral mass (medial filaments).
