You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete.

To encourage simultaneous internal cooperation and competition among the company units, Haier's corporate cul- ture emphasized internal reputation and performance. Backed up by appropri- ate performance management systems, the company emphasized that the more productive and customer-oriented employees are, the more decision-making autonomy and greater rewards they will receive. The new corporate culture was understandably more receptive to the radical changes in organizational practices in the mid-2000s.
41fx | But beyond employing the organizational culture as a resource, the intro- duction of a new management system required resources such as consultancy fees, new IT systems, and staff training. More importantly, the performance out- comes of Rendanheyi were totally unknown, and unsuccessful implementation could become a major drain on the company's finances. However, Zhang sug- gested that Rendanheyi would proceed even if revenues and profits showed signs of weakening.
7um8 | Fortunately, Zhang did not have to worry about resources or the potential impact on investors when he introduced his new management system in 2005. Haier's revenues in the mid-2000s were soaring, having quadrupled from RMB27 billion in 1999 to RMB 103 billion in 2005. And the Haier Group was under partial public ownership, freeing the company from delivering consistent financial returns.
uow2 | The freedom to allocate resources distinguished Haier from western competi- tors. Indeed, Zhang told us that he specifically discussed the idea of introducing
iat7 | Management Innovation Made in China: Haier's Rendanheyi
ywwr | Rendanheyi with senior management of a very large U.S. multinational firm, and he was reportedly told that "we cannot do it [introduce Rendanheyi] because we need to play by Wall Street rules." On another occasion, a group of visiting European managers from several well-known large enterprises accused Haier of fabricating a "trompe l'œil" with their ZZJYTs and communities of interest, sug- gesting that such radically innovative practices would be "impossible to imple- ment." A focus on quarterly results and steady revenues keeps American and European companies from even contemplating the sort of changes that Rendanheyi requires. In contrast, Haier's resources allowed Zhang to embark on a radical new management innovation, shifting the firm from a traditional manufacturer toward an agile online-platform-driven firm, without any guarantee that this turnaround would actually enhance organizational performance.
0i6j | Lessons for Management Innovators
87cq | The Haier Rendanheyi case produces four key lessons for management innovation. First, it is clear that one good response to a high VUCA world is man- agement innovating, that is, the creation of innovative management systems. We showed how Rendanheyi constituted just such a response for the Haier Group. The Haier case is quite significant, since this is not a company from the buzz- ing IT sector in Silicon Valley or the innovative biotech sector in Britain's Silicon Fen. The white goods industry is traditionally a mature, slow-moving, and low- profit manufacturing sector. Yet, an environment with high VUCA is challeng- ing this sector, too, and the Haier example illustrates the necessity as well as the opportunity for established companies to invent novel management systems in response.
0qs3 | The second lesson revolves around how Haier experimented with Rendanheyi. The case study demonstrates that experimentation is a sine qua non for success in a VUCA environment. In particular, the Haier case demonstrates that leadership may eventually be the single most important contextual factor for making management innovation work. Furthermore, the management innova- tion seemed to co-evolve with the ideas and experiences of Haier's CEO. This sug- gests that those leaders that can actually learn from experiments are best placed to make management innovation work.
z8f7 | Third, we presented an extended process model of management innova- tion, which managers in both emerging and developed countries can apply. The four-stage process model, illustrated in Figure 1, describes each of the stages man- agers go through when undertaking management innovation, with the internal and external contexts influencing all four stages. Managers must carefully con- sider competitive, technological, and institutional constraints when engaging in a new management innovation, while the three organizational contextual factors of structure, leadership, and resources act as enablers or levers for management innovating. Clearly the relative importance of internal and external contexts var- ies from one episode to the next, as emphasized by Zhang:
7w7j | both matter . . . the first big transformation of Haier was based on external factors, as we knew that the market was going to become much more competitive, but the next transformation was based on a fear that we had, or would, become much too bureaucratic, and so we needed to combat the internal tendency.
51vd | Fourth, managers should align the nature of management innovations they create, and how these are created, to the six environmental categories in our model, in line with the Haier case but also following other successful man- agement innovators throughout history. Where leadership in an organization is strong and charismatic, a top-down creation process is more viable, which is how GM came up with the divisional M-form. With slack resources, organizations should attempt to undertake more management innovation, as GE has demon- strated throughout its history with stretch goals, Six Sigma, and the strategic business unit, to mention but a few. Organizations that want to be more effective management innovators have to build structures that allow for more experimen- tation, as Procter and Gamble did with Connect-and-Develop.32 Furthermore, managers must align their attempts at management innovating to what is possi- ble in their institutional environment, Toyota's lean manufacturing being a great example, as noted earlier. Finally, they should increase efforts at management innovation when technological change is frequent and when there is intense competitive pressure, which was part of the reasoning behind Samsung's co- opetition model.
baj1 | Discussion and Conclusion
n1wo | The main contributions of this article are demonstrating how the internal and external contexts mattered for the creation of Rendanheyi to allow Haier to deal with a high VUCA world, drawing lessons from Haier's experimentation process for other firms, and providing an improved explanation of how new management innovations are created.
5bq3 | For the creation of Rendanheyi, leadership was the most important con- textual factor, and our model extends the literature on the role of leadership in management innovation33 by providing a detailed description of how strong lead- ership can drive the development and implementation of management innova- tion. Yet, we suggest that leadership would not have been enough to drive Rendanheyi through, if the other contextual factors were not aligned and pushed in the same direction. In general terms, strong leadership does not always have to be the most important factor for every single management innovation. For instance, the initial development of innovations such as the balanced scorecard at Analog Devices and scenario planning at Shell was neither initiated nor driven by top management.34
ezla | The complexities and uncertainties of the VUCA world are driving firms such as Haier to create management innovations that are appropriate to the con- text in which they operate. This article shows specifically how rapid and timely
rsbu | Management Innovation Made in China: Haier's Rendanheyi
magd | responses to deal with VUCA lead to context-dependent management innovations created by emerging market firms such as Haier. Rendanheyi allows Haier to both connect better to customers and create more internal cohesion, without sacrificing scale advantages, due to technology deployment. Our model suggests that manag- ers must carefully consider the specific context within which they operate before introducing a novel management innovation.
