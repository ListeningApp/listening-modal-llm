You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

on9b | the decrease of <LATEX>\Phi _ { 2 }</LATEX> with increasing irradiance has resulted in a modified method to estimate <LATEX>R _ { \mathrm { d } }</LATEX> (Yin et al., 2009, 2011a). The analysis using the modified method, now known as the Yin method (Tcherkez et <LATEX>a l . ,</LATEX> 2017b), indicates that the inhibition of <LATEX>R _ { \mathrm { d } }</LATEX> by light is less than the original Kok method suggests (Yin et al., 2011a).
a8ge | Less information is available on the change in <LATEX>f _ { \mathrm { a c t } }</LATEX> or in <LATEX>\rho _ { 2 }</LATEX> with <LATEX>I _ { \mathrm { a b s } }</LATEX> that could partly explain the Kok effect. Peltier & Sarrey (1988) indicated that the inhibition of chlororespiration (a pro- cess in chloroplasts that involves a respiratory electron transport chain within the thylakoid membrane) might be responsible for the Kok effect. Data of Zhang et al. (2018) and Ver Sagun et al. (2019) suggested that cyclic electron transport around PSI increased with increasing <LATEX>I _ { \mathrm { a b s } } .</LATEX> If this also applies to the limiting light conditions, an increase in <LATEX>f _ { \mathrm { c y c } }</LATEX> with increasing <LATEX>I _ { \mathrm { a b s } }</LATEX> would pre- dict a part of the Kok effect (Fig. 2d). According to Eqns 2 and 3, <LATEX>f _ { \mathrm { c y c } }</LATEX> has a dual effect on the expression of the Kok effect, that is, via both terms <LATEX>f _ { \mathrm { a c t } }</LATEX> and <LATEX>\rho _ { 2 } .</LATEX> Eqn 3 suggests that parameter <LATEX>\rho _ { 2 } ,</LATEX> related to state transition, could be affected not only by <LATEX>f _ { \mathrm { c y c } }</LATEX> (Fig. 2d) but also by the <LATEX>\Phi _ { 2 } / \Phi _ { 1 }</LATEX> ratio. Tcherkez et al. (2017a) speculated the possible role of state transition in the Kok effect. The model of Eqns 1-3 predicts that an increase <LATEX>\mathrm { i n } f _ { \text { Cyc } } \text { or in } \Phi _ { 2 } /</LATEX> <LATEX>\Phi _ { 1 }</LATEX> with increasing <LATEX>I _ { \mathrm { a b s } }</LATEX> leads to the state transition in favour of PSI with increasing irradiance, and this could engender part of the Kok effect (Fig. 2d).
h27a | The Kok effect is not ubiquitous. Early reports found little Kok effect at low O2 conditions and in <LATEX>\mathrm { C } _ { 4 }</LATEX> plants (Cornic & Jarvis, 1978; Ishii & Murata, 1978). These observations have led to suggestions that photorespiration might be involved in the Kok effect, as confirmed by other studies where photorespiration was manipulated by changing measurement temperatures (Ishii & Schmid, 1981; Way et al., 2019) or by lowering leaf water potential (Sharp et al., 1984). Again, the model analyses of Far- quhar & Busch (2017) demonstrated that the change in <LATEX>\Gamma ^ { * } / C _ { \mathrm { c } }</LATEX> therefore, in relative amounts of photorespiration, with increas- ing <LATEX>I _ { a b s }</LATEX> can explain much of the diminution of the Kok effect in <LATEX>\mathrm { C } _ { 4 }</LATEX> plants and at low O2 or high CO2 concentrations or low tem- peratures. They also showed that the change in <LATEX>\Gamma ^ { * } / C _ { \mathrm { c } }</LATEX> can gener- ate the apparent inhibition of <LATEX>R _ { \mathrm { d } }</LATEX> as inferred by the Laisk method, which is based on <LATEX>A - C _ { i }</LATEX> curves at two or more irradiances (where <LATEX>C _ { \mathrm { i } }</LATEX> is the intercellular <LATEX>C O _ { 2 }</LATEX> concentration). The decrease in <LATEX>C _ { i }</LATEX> with increasing <LATEX>I _ { \mathrm { a b s } }</LATEX> is the result of stomatal regulation, and its influence on estimates of <LATEX>R _ { \mathrm { d } }</LATEX> by the Kok method was noted by Kirschbaum & Farquhar (1987), who proposed a method to cor- rect for this decrease in <LATEX>C _ { \mathrm { i } }</LATEX> ;. The further drawdown in <LATEX>C _ { c } ,</LATEX> relative to <LATEX>C _ { 1 } ,</LATEX> is regulated by <LATEX>g _ { \mathrm { m } }</LATEX> (Evans & von Caemmerer, 1996). The Kok method would underestimate <LATEX>R _ { \mathrm { d } }</LATEX> if light-dependent changes in <LATEX>C _ { i }</LATEX> (Villar et al., 1994) or in <LATEX>C _ { c }</LATEX> (Ayub et al., 2011) are not cor- rected for. Simple <LATEX>g _ { s }</LATEX> and <LATEX>g _ { m }</LATEX> models when coupled with photo- synthesis models like Eqns 1-3 can account for the refixation of CO2 released from respiration and photorespiration (von Caem- merer, 2013), and in fact, the refixation fractions of (photo) respired <LATEX>C O _ { 2 } c a n</LATEX> be calculated analytically from stomatal, meso- phyll and carboxylation resistances (Yin & Struik, 2017). As such, the light inhibition of <LATEX>R _ { \mathrm { d } }</LATEX> predicted for photorespiratory conditions by Farquhar & Busch (2017) and the need to correct

xmgs | for light-dependent changes in <LATEX>C _ { i }</LATEX> and <LATEX>C _ { c }</LATEX> are basically analogous to the statement of Loreto et al. (2001) that the lower <LATEX>R _ { \mathrm { d } }</LATEX> than <LATEX>R _ { \mathrm { d l } }</LATEX> resulted from the failure of the original Kok or Laisk methods in accounting for the refixation of respired <LATEX>C O _ { 2 }</LATEX> in the light.
bd9h | However, there are cases where the Kok effect is not always associated with photorespiration. The change in the slope was occasionally observed to be present under high-CO2 conditions (Sharp et al., 1984), and in <LATEX>\mathrm { C } _ { 4 }</LATEX> leaves and under low-O2 condi- tions albeit to a smaller extent (Yin et al., 2011a). Gong et al. (2015) reported an even lower <LATEX>R _ { \mathrm { d } } : R _ { \mathrm { d k } }</LATEX> ratio in <LATEX>\mathrm { C } _ { 4 }</LATEX> than in <LATEX>C _ { 3 }</LATEX> leaves. Buckley et al. (2017) observed a similar extent of change in the slope under both 21% and 2% O2 conditions for broad- bean (Vicia faba) mature leaves. Nevertheless, the Kok effects reported in the early years (Kok, 1949; Ishii & Schmid, 1981; Sharp et al., 1984) are mostly associated with the abrupt transi- tion in the slope (Fig. 1), whereas the <LATEX>g _ { 5 } - g _ { m }</LATEX> photosynthesis model predicts only a smooth transition (Farquhar & Busch, 2017).
m047 | Of the possible mechanisms (Rg, <LATEX>\Gamma ^ { * } / C _ { c } ,</LATEX> <LATEX>\Phi _ { 2 } ,</LATEX> <LATEX>f _ { \mathrm { a c t } }</LATEX> and/or <LATEX>\rho _ { 2 }</LATEX> highlighted by Eqns 1-3 that potentially explain the magnitude of the Kok effect (Fig. 2), <LATEX>f _ { \mathrm { a c t } }</LATEX> and <LATEX>\rho _ { 2 }</LATEX> are hard to measure accu- rately by existing equipment, especially at low irradiances along the Kok curve. Also, the pattern of changing <LATEX>R _ { \mathrm { d } }</LATEX> in response to <LATEX>I _ { \mathrm { a b s } }</LATEX> is hard to quantify with existing methods. In this study, we will illustrate, using Eqns 1-3, that how <LATEX>R _ { 4 }</LATEX> responds to <LATEX>I _ { \mathrm { a b s } }</LATEX> would have relevance to the Kok effect and in estimating <LATEX>\Phi _ { \mathrm { C O 2 } } .</LATEX> We surmise that if the varying <LATEX>\Gamma ^ { * } / C _ { \mathrm { c } }</LATEX> ratio is a major factor accounting for the Kok effect, as stated by Farquhar & Busch (2017), then the magnitude of the Kok effect should be associ- ated with the <LATEX>\Gamma ^ { * } / C _ { \mathrm { c } }</LATEX> ratio, regardless of how the variation of this ratio is created. To this end, we designed an experiment in which we used various <LATEX>O _ { 2 }</LATEX> and <LATEX>C O _ { 2 }</LATEX> concentrations or temperatures to generate varying relative amounts of photorespiration, that is, various <LATEX>\Gamma ^ { * } / C _ { c }</LATEX> ratios.
