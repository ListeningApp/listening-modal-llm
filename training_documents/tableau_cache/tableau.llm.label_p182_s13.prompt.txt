You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

4gct | 5. From the Context menu for the map worksheets on the dashboard, click on Parameters and then click on the Select a Year parameter.
uuio | 6. The parameter automatically appears next to the Region Quick Filter. It would look better if the two were stacked. So, add a Vertical Layout Container to the Horizontal Container with the header and filter, and then move the Filter and parameter into it.
e34x | 7. Add an extra 100 pixels of height to the dashboard.

x2p2 | Filters and Actions
yhgh | Modifying titles
jjti | We can modify the header of the dashboard to reflect the selection of a year as well. The title is hard-coded to identify CO2 emissions from 2008, but if we select a different year from the parameter, such as 2005, then we need to ensure that the title is updated.
uw2x | We can add the parameter to the title by performing the following steps:
1rbl | 1. Double-click on the title.
wr7g | 2. Delete the hard-coded reference to 2008.
bph4 | 3. Click on the Insert button.
tzxi | 4. Select the parameter that we want to add, as shown in the following screenshot:
o4i7 | Since this title is actually a text object on the dashboard and not a specific worksheet title, we cannot insert field values, but we can insert parameters. It's always a good idea to make it very obvious what your user is looking at so that they don't run the risk of assuming the wrong thing.
2sts | Filtering across multiple Data sources with parameters
zx3s | Parameters are useful when you need to filter across multiple Data sources. We loaded a second Data source, which contains data related to the foreign aid given to various countries by the United States since 1948, into our workbook. There are several fields that have the same name, namely Region, Country, and Year. We created a simple bar graph that shows the total aid in dollars over a period of time on a new worksheet called Aid Graph.
6c25 | [ 164 ]
2ese | www.it-ebooks.info
xvzx | Chapter 8
t08l | We created a filtering field for this visualization that shows only the Year selected in the parameter and the 30 years before it. In this case, we're using the same Year parameter that is being displayed on the dashboard. We also created a Calculated field, referencing it in the Foreign Aid Data sources, and then added it to the Filters shelf, just like we did on the map and line graph, as shown in the following screenshot:
k6vc | We will create a new parameter that allows users to select the visualization that they wish to view in the third of the last workbook, which is where we show granular details. Currently, the Region KPIs worksheet is displayed there, but we would like to provide users with the option of deciding what to see in the workbook.
lnqw | In order to do this, we will create a new parameter. Then, we will create a Calculated field that can be used as a filter in each Data sources.
kdr7 | Let's create a parameter by performing the following steps:
h1ds | 1. Create a new parameter and name it Select Granular Details, which is a string with a list of two possible values.
sgu6 | 2. We have capitalized these two values carefully because Tableau Public is case-sensitive. We will include following values in a Calculated field in the next step. The values are shown in the following screenshot:
47j0 | ° Region Emissions KPIs
1c60 | [ 165 ]
0gex | www.it-ebooks.info
8r7m | 3. Click on OK.
qj19 | 4. In the Foreign Aid Data source, create a new Calculated field. This field will use a case statement to create a string output based on the parameter's selection.
l5ia | [166 ]
ecp0 | www.it-ebooks.info
cujm | Chapter 8
25y0 | 5. We named the field Granular Selection Filter, and we wrote a case statement that states that if Region Emission KPIs is selected, then the output is emissions; otherwise, it's Foreign Aid. If there were more than two values, then we would have another condition, as shown in the following screenshot:
8u4f | 6. Click on OK.
5bai | 7. Add the Granular Selection Filter field to the Filters shelf of the Aid Graph.
2z5m | 8. The string value that corresponds to the current value of the parameter will be displayed in the Filter list. Select it and click on OK.
63p4 | 9. Select Show Parameter Control and select the other value. The graph should now appear.
lvik | 10. Right-click on the Granular Selection Filter field and select Copy. We'll paste it exactly as is into the Data source that contains the other worksheet on that we want to work.
16a3 | 11. Go to the Region KPIs worksheet. In the Dimensions pane, right-click on it and select Paste. The field that you just created now exists in both the data sources.
49ye | 12. Right-click on the Select Granular Details parameter and select Show Parameter Control. You have to do this on every sheet on which you'd like to see it.
850s | 13. Ensure that the value selected corresponds to the graph that you're viewing.

o8es | 14. Drag the Granular Selection Filter field to the Filters shelf and select emissions, as shown in the following screenshot:
2k63 | 15. Click on OK.
p1p2 | Now, we can go back to the dashboard and add the parameter and the new visualization.
muok | We will stack the visualizations into a Vertical Layout Container, and we will hide the title of each so that no space is unnecessarily taken up when it isn't selected. Then, we will modify the space in the title names of account for the parameter selection by performing the following steps:
qozi | 1. First, add a Vertical Layout Container to the bottom of the dashboard and add the Region KPIs and Aid Dollars worksheets into it.
801o | 2. When you do this, the the parameters that appear in these worksheets will be added to the container with the filter and parameter at the top.
6u6r | 3. Add a Horizontal Layout Container within the new Vertical Layout Container.
8jhi | 4. Change the title for this area so that it is not floating and drag it into the Horizontal Layout Container.
n2bw | 5. Drag the parameter from the top into the Horizontal Layout Container as well.
lrko | 6. Modify the text for the title so that it represents exactly what we can see in the following screenshot:

vb88 | Chapter 8
0dzg | 7. Right-click on the title for the Aid Graph and hide it.
qrj3 | 8. Note that when you change the parameter value, both the title and the visualization change.
erv1 | 9. If you're having issues with the visualizations changing properly, the first thing that you need to check is the capitalization and spelling in the case statement. It's fairly common to make mistakes when writing these statements. Therefore, you should check them to ensure that you have written conditions that match the parameter values perfectly:
4u8c | Actions
m3ho | There are three types of actions that you can create on dashboards to add context, relevance, and specificity for your users, namely Highlight, Filter, and URL.
pse1 | The following list describes these three action types:
9wyj | . Highlight actions: These draw attention to marks related to selections in a visualization without filtering other data points on the visualization.
hmko | · Filter actions: These show only the selections made in a source visualization. They can be set up in such a way that when the marks in the source sheet are deselected, the target visualization shows all the marks, shows the filtered marks, or excludes all the marks.
tsxi | . URL actions: These allow you to link to generic URLs or dynamically add selected field values into URLs to link Tableau Public dashboards to external resources. As an example, we'll show you how to insert a country's name into a URL to directly link to its page on the World Bank's website.
fidk | [ 169 ]
ju2k | www.it-ebooks.info
wldo | Highlight actions do not filter visualizations, they only draw attention. URL actions link to external websites. Therefore, they don't have implications in dashboard performance. Filter actions have the following benefits:
ct9a | . They are comparably faster than Quick Filters. Tableau Public does not need to scan the contents of a field before they can function.
rh8p | . They can filter across multiple data sources without setting up join conditions ahead of time, which will be explored later on in this chapter.
vopc | . They allow users to select and view only the granular data that's important to them.
k4qz | Actions have a disadvantage. For a novice author, maintaining actions can be time-consuming. The actions that we will use in the following exercises are designed to allow users to filter all the visualizations to show only the countries that interest them. Then, we'll add a URL action that links to the World Bank's web page for every individual country.
k3w9 | In the dashboard, we have a map that shows every country for which we have data. We have filters for time and other geographic dimensions. Therefore, we have an opportunity to do the following two things with the countries:
lijr | . We can create a filter action that limits the selections in other worksheets to the countries that a user has selected
43dz | . We can create a URL action that allows a user to see the World Bank's web page for each country
fyrt | The first task involves creating the Filter action that runs when a user selects a country from the map by performing the following steps:
2nsv | 1. On the dashboard, click on the Dashboard menu and then click on Actions.
uqlj | 2. Click on Add Action, and then click on Filter.
013l | 3. Name the action Filter on Country. It's important to name actions according to their functions so that when you are editing and testing them later, you know where to look first.

qc4k | Chapter 8
btsb | The following attributes need to be selected:
s1u0 | The source of the action, that is, the visualization from which it originates
ju0a | ° The action that triggers it
e4y0 | ° The fields on which you need to run an action
kpra | 4. For the source, select the CO2 Emissions per Capita sheet on the dashboard.
egbi | 5. Run the action on Select. Thus, when a user clicks on a field, its correlated marks in the target sheet will be highlighted. The alternatives are running the action when a user hovers over a mark or showing a hyperlink to run the action when a user rolls over Menu. We will use Menu for the URL action.
bnhs | 6. Target all the sheets on the dashboard except for the CO2 Emissions per Capita sheet.
ktv2 | 7. Leave the default values to clear the selection. If we had worksheets that we wanted to hide until someone made a selection, which is a great option, we would have excluded all values.
woy6 | 8. Next, we need to establish the fields on which we want the filter to run. When a user clicks on a country, the value for that country is used as a filter for other sheets.
6xev | In case you left the setting on All Fields, then all the attributes of the mark will be passed as a filter, but only to fields of the same name. For example, if you were going through the values for region and country, then each sheet with those exact same field names and values would be filtered.
u2ud | Since we have a secondary Data source, specifically the Foreign Aid data, that does not have the same field name for each country (though the values are the same) and has completely different values for the Region field, we need to establish targets.
3qum | 9. Click on the Selected Fields radio button. Though using specific fields can potentially cause the dashboard to run more slowly with very large data sets, we need to establish the fields on which we need to join the Data sources.

4j8f | 10. Click on Add Filter. Since the action is running from a sheet using the World Bank Climate Change data source, it is the default for the source. Pick the Country Name field. Then, for the target, select the same Data source and field. This tells Tableau Public that for sheets that use this Data source, use the Country Name field as both the source and target. Check out the result in the following screenshot:
e3ba | 11. Click on OK.
8c0j | 12. Click on Add filter again. Select the Country Name field again as the source, but for the target, select the Foreign Aid Data sources and then select the Country field as the target.

a46e | URL actions
ozpq | URL actions are useful when you wish to connect users to external and auxiliary data, whether it's from a public interest website or to a related dashboard. In the next example, you will create a URL action that allows users to view the World Bank's website for each country.
22sy | The URL action that you will build will append the name of each country as a variable to the root URL for the World Bank's well-organized websites.
kuwj | The root URL is http: //www.worldbank.org/en/country/, and in order to get to a specific country, such as South Africa, you need to add the country name so that it looks like http://www.worldbank.org/en/country/southafrica.
b3n9 | There is one issue - there are no spaces in the country names in the URL and yet, there are spaces in the country names in the data source.
ev9d | So first, create a Calculated field that removes the space in each Country name so that we can append it as a token to the URL.
sroj | [ 175 ]
n8ae | www.it-ebooks.info
ojx4 | To remove and append the Country name with a URL, perform the following steps:
skze | 1. Go to the Map worksheet and create a Calculated field in the Data source.
s807 | 2. Name the Calculated field Country Name.
9c3r | 3. In the Calculated field, write a formula that uses the Replace function to remove the spaces in the Country field, as shown in the following screenshot. You need to remove the spaces because in the URL, for each country, there are no spaces. Different websites treat spaces differently, depending on their information management strategy and encoding; others might replace spaces with %20:
hqgv | 4. Add this field to the Detail shelf on the sheet.
tf20 | 5. Note that the percentile table calculation that generates the color for each country no longer seems to work because it was addressing only by Country Name before and it wasn't partitioned (or grouped) by any other values.

mxd4 | 13. Name the URL action with the text that will prompt users to perform a specific action, such as Click on Here for Country Data. You want the result to be very obvious because this action will be a Menu action, which means that the name of the action will appear as a call to an action at the bottom of the tooltip, as shown in the following screenshot:
6z51 | 14. Select CO2 Emissions per Capita as the source sheet.
hxt0 | 15. Run the action on Menu.
q1mg | 16. Paste the root URL for the World Bank into the URL box. Then, click on the arrow to the right of the URL box to see a list of fields that you can insert as a variable token.
