You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

06yq | Microdosing with psychedelics to self-medicate for ADHD symptoms in adults: A naturalistic study
dpv6 | ARTICLE INFO
8r5j | ABSTRACT
2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

0i6j | 6.5 Summary
87cq | As soon as a security management system involves more than a single person, then a Command and Control structure will need to be in to ensure that all aspects of the security management programme are coordinated and controlled in an effective and professional manner. The Command & Control Structure should be able to manage Routine Activities, Minor Incidents and Crisis Situations, and should allow information to be passed up the command chain from front-line responds who have information on any situation and instructions to be passed down the command chain from managers who may well be located far away from the incident site. The ability to create effective command chains is at the heart of effective security management, and it is almost always the case that it is failures in command chain management that is one of the major causes of most security management failures.
0qs3 | In summary:
z8f7 | . A three-level command system - Gold, Silver, Bronze - can be applied to any security operation, and clearly sets out the responsibility associated with each command level
7w7j | . The purpose of any command system is two-fold: to allow information to be passed up the command chain, and orders and directions to be passed down
51vd | . If a command system fails, it is almost always because there has been a break-down in communication
baj1 | . Additional complexity increases the likelihood of failure
n1wo | . Command systems work best when all of the people involved in the operation know each other, have worked together before, and share a common organisational culture
5bq3 | . The more you train together, the more successful the response operation will be

tb74 | Self-assessment 3: Write a report for the CEO of your company, explaining the arguments for the introduction of a GSB command system within the company security department. (Make sure that they system you are describing is large enough to support the GSB system).
8l69 | 7 Maintaining Sustainable Capability
1jyv | 31
olce | As has already been mentioned in previous sections, the secret of creating effective security management capability is to ensure that whatever programmes and protocols are introduced are not seen as one-off events, but are embedded into the organisation so that they become a natural part of its operating procedures and its organisational culture. For many security management systems, this is the hardest part of the management process. Protocols can be written, programmes designed and personnel trained, but to create organisational change is one of the hardest things for any manager to achieve, and even if they have succeeded in doing so, the natural tendency is for organisations to revert to previous practices. This section will introduce some ideas as to how security managers can self-audit their own organisation, and can identify areas where weak practices or lack of management oversight are likely to produce vulnerabilities that could allow small scale potential problems to develop into genuine problems.
erx1 | 7.1 Effective Protocols
b3bt | There is often a desire in security management to try and identify every possible problem, and then to introduce increasingly detailed and situation-specific protocols to try and manage those scenarios. The problem is that if the control systems become too intrusive and disruptive, the natural reaction is to ignore them or to switch them off. This is then not just a problem with that particular situation, but creates a culture where it is not only permissible, but is accepted practice to ignore guidelines and directives. The purpose of the security management team should always be to support the overall operations and objectives of the organisation, and though it may be tempting to introduce more and more controls, that is self-defeating in the long-run. It is better to have a few guidelines that are accepted and adhered to, rather than a whole raft of directives that are ignored.
0w8m | Figure 18: From Incident to Crisis
vcu3 | 7.2 Crisis Cognition
hjzj | 32
j79f | It is a basic rule in life that the earlier you are aware of a potential problem, the more likely you are to be able to deal with it smoothly, effectively and with the minimum of disruption to the rest of the operating network. If you allow that problem to go unmanaged, it is likely to escalate to a level where it sets alarm bells ringing, at which point the system takes notice and responds, but will often need a much higher level of intervention to deal with the situation than if it had been detected and managed earlier in the escalation cycle.
6tbv | . By becoming aware of a potential problem earlier rather than later in its development cycle:
xb13 | · You have more options to deal with it
cxqi | . You can respond with a lower level of intervention
qfmx | · You are safer from both a personal and organisational perspective
rut3 | By being unaware of a potential problem, or by ignoring a problem you are aware of:
m3cp | . You will have less options to deal with it
mq4s | . You will need to respond with a higher level of intervention
95el | . You will be in greater danger from both a personal and organisational perspective
a0a5 | 7.3 'Normal Accidents'
gocl | In most situations, crises do not just happen. They are only the final stage in a long process of gestation and development. In most situations, the reason that a major problem occurs is not because of an outside event, but rather because there is a lack of ability to respond effectively. In almost all situations, there will have been warning signs that the conditions that will allow the crisis to develop are in place, and there are what have been called 'Normal Accidents' that occur on a repeated basis, which highlight the organisational weakness that is allowing those situations to occur, but which are ignored or accepted.
ob1z | 7.4 Complexity
m4cb | Many organisations are complex - that is the nature of our inter-connected world. However, it has been well- recognised that organisational complexity itself creates an increased likelihood of problems arising - or even catastrophic failure, which threatens the continued existence of an organisation. Although the issue of organisational complexity is a subject in itself, from the security managers perspective there are two clear consequences of an organisation's over-complexity which may well (actually, undoubtedly will) create avoidable situations that have the likelihood of developing into genuine and serious problems.
m61y | 7.5 Information Transfer
u2ob | One of the clearest signs of harmful organisational complexity is if there are regular breakdowns in the transfer of information. This can either be because the lines of communications between different sections of the organisation are ineffective, or because different sections of the organisation are unaware of the need to pass information across to other sections. An example that many security managers might recognise is if the Business Development section creates plans to open a new office or factory in a country where there is genuine risk, whether political, social, criminal or health based. These are problems that the security department would be well aware of, and could highlight if they were part of the business development process. A Risk Analysis of any new country (or even city) should be a natural part of the business development process, but this is dependent on the working relationship between the different divisions. A similar example would be if the HR department is responsible for booking flight tickets for travelling executives, but doesn't inform the security department if one of the company's managers is travelling to what could be perceived as a high-risk area. If the first time that the security department is aware of a problem is when the HR department contact them because that executive's wife has called them because she hasn't heard from her husband in five days, then there is clearly a breakdown in organisational communication and planning.
2gnm | 33
emgw | 7.6 Clear Lines of Responsibility
xaqt | One of the hidden effects of organisational complexity is that it blurs lines of responsibility. In some cases, complexity is introduced specifically to allow people to avoid individual responsibility for decisions and policies that they know to be questionable, flawed or even illegal. Many of the major incidents that hit the national headlines are a direct result of organisational over-complexity that left a vaccuum where clear responsibilty and leadership should have been. This includes the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) response to Hurricane Katrina (2005), the Japanese government's response to the Fukushima disaster (2011), the BP response to Deepwater Horizon Gulf iof Mexico oil spill (2010), the G4S failure to supply security personnel to the London 2012 Olympics (2012) or the BBC's failure to adequately respond to the issue surrounding Jimmy Savile and accusastions of child abuse within the organisation (2012).
5rcb | The problem with complexity is not just a theroretical problem, but is reflected in almost every aspect of operation management. The more complex an operation becomes (especially if the additional complexity seems to be unnecessary), the more liley it is to lead to serious, and perhaps catastrophic, failure. Txample of how the break-up of British Rail into separate companies, each of which had the responsibility for a separate asepct of the over-all operation, is just one example of how additional complexity can lead to management breakdown and eventual disaster.
524j | 7.7 Case Study: Railtrack - Complexity and Disaster
xd3m | One of the clearest cases of the conenction between complexity and loss of organisational control was Railtrack, the company that was created after the privatisation of the railway system by the Conservative government in 1996. Formerly known as British Rail, the nature of the railway network was already extremely complex, with a high degree of inter-conenctedness and mutual systems-dependency - (10,346 miles of track and signalling, 40,000 bridges and viaducts, 50 tunnels, 2,508 stations, 1500 signal boxes, 9000 level crossings). Altrhough there were organisational problems with BR before the break-up, at least there was one organisation that was responsible for the entire system, and which had clear lines of responsibility for its maintenance and management.
8qb6 | After nationalisation, different section of BR were broken up into autonomous organisations, each responsible for a specific area of operations, and often developing a competetive or even adverserial relationship with other areas of operation. The trains and rolling stock were owned by three separate companies, that in turn leased them out to twenty-five different train operating companies. Railtrack owned the track, but its role was purely administrative. Responsibility for the maintenance of the track (a critical factor in the operation) was sub- contracted to other companies, which although they were then tasked with the responsibility for the maintenance of the track, in turn sub-contracted it out to other companies to actually deliver the work. Railtrack did not have its' own engineering department, and did not have the technical knowledge within the company to oversee the maintenance work, or even to gauge whether it was being delivered effectively.
wkbn | Another consequence of the break-up of BR was that rather than acting as a single entity with different divisions, each division acted in order to maximise its own profit and minimise any potential liablility. This meant that the highy critical and immensely complex network of relationships between the new companies were controlled by detailed contracts, each of which tried to micro-mange extremely complex operations. There were 224 separate legal agreements covering freight contracts, and apportioning responsibility for delays was based on 1,900 checkpoints, 204 predefined delay causes, and 1,300 delay-attribution points. Railtrack employed fifty people just to account for delays in the Southern region alone. These contractual relationships led to increasingly bitter legal actions between the various companies, which in turn led to a break down in over-all service delivery. Although the government still held nominal responsibility for overseeing the running of Railtrack, that was equally murky, with a raft of different organisations involved in the oversight, including the Office of Passenger Rail Franchising, the Office of the Rail Regulator, Her Majesty's Railway Inspectorate, the British Railway Board, the Rail Passengers Council, and the Transport Secretary. It will be no surprise that rather than working cooperatively and collaboratively, these government agencies often saw each other as rivals for power and influence, and spent more time trying to out-manoeuvre each other than concentrating on the actual objectives.
ftfg | 34
7xi5 | The consequences of this organisational complexity became tragically clear on the morning of 17th October 2000, when an Intercity train travelling at 115 miles an hour was derailed near Hatfield, with the death of four passengers and over seventy injured. Subsequent enquiries found that the cause of the derailment was the failure to repair damaged tracks, despite the fact that the damage and potential consequences were known. The official review into the incident laid the blame for the accident squarely on the lack of clear responsibility for the management of the tracks. This accident led to massive disruption of national rail services (with an estimated loss to UK businesses of £6 million per day), and ultimately caused Railtrack to go into administration in 2002.
w8r5 | 7.8 Regular Reviews
ybik | One of the fundamental developments in security management since 9/11 has been the realisation that rather than something that is limited to a security department, security management should be an integral part of every aspect of an organisation's operations and culture. In a similar way, security protocols are no longer seen as static things that are written and then forgotten, but are living documents that develop and evolve in the same way that any other part of the organisation would develop and evolve. Regular reviews of every aspect of the security management system play an important role in ensuring that security management capabilities are maintained at the highest possible level. As well as reviewing existing protocols and documentation, regular reviews also allow the security managers to develop their relationships with managers and personnel in other divisions or departments, which in turn helps facilitate the personal relationships which underpin effective security management at every level of an organisation.
gii5 | 7.9 And Finally ....
q5eu | In many ways, security management fulfils a different role from every other activity within an organisation. Whilst mistakes in most other divisions are recoverable, and can often be resolved by way of a simple apology, mistakes made in the security department can often have much more significant consequences, are not recoverable, and may, in the worst circumstances, lead to death, injury or catastrophic impacts. The responsibility of the security manager is to create the correct balance between freedom of movement and activity on the one hand, and safety and security on the other, but also to ensure that lessons are learned, mistakes rectified and the overall system strengthened and improved on an on-going and continuous basis. Security management in its fundamental form is a simple art, but it is the ability to maintain standards, and to manage them effectively over time, that is the ultimate test of the success or otherwise of the security management system.
a7ao | 7.10 Summary
29a3 | It is almost certain that the front page of the newspaper you brought this morning carries an example of where failures in security management have had significant impacts, and quite possibly have led to actual disasters. The likelihood is that these failures did not happen because of some catastrophic outside event, but are the result of a breakdown of what should be basic management controls. The reasons for these failures are usually predictable and well known, but have in some way been ignored or side-stepped. The issues covered in this chapter will give any security manager the ability to audit their own operations, and to identify problems that have a high likelihood of leading to significant operational failures.
sb1e | In summary:
w2yn | . You can't always prevent Incidents - but you can take responsibility for how you respond to them
ap6l | . Incidents and crises don't 'just happen'. They develop over time, and the earlier you are aware of potential problems, the more effective you will be as a security manager
iest | . Complexity is the enemy of clarity. Do not allow your systems to become overly complex - especially if that doesn't add to your operational capability
cox8 | . Even the largest and most high profile operations fail for simple reasons - breakdowns in communications, breakdowns in command structures, lack of leadership
ppqi | . Security management is not a single event, but is a never-ending process - review your own operations on a continuous basis, and keep on improving them
