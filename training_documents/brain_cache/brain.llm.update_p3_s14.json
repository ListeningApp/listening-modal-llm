Improvements in mindfulness\npbea | Repeated measures ANOVAs confirmed significant group-by-time interactions for three of the five mindfulness subscales (acting with awareness: F left parenthesis one comma twenty-six right parenthesis equals sixteen point eight seven, P is less than zero point zero zero one; observing: F left parenthesis one comma twenty-six right parenthesis equals seven point zero nine, P equals zero point zero one three; non-judging: F left parenthesis one comma twenty-six right parenthesis equals four point six one, P equals zero point zero four one; describing: F left parenthesis one comma twenty-six right parenthesis equals one point nine five, P equals zero point one seven five; non-reactivity: F left parenthesis one comma twenty-six right parenthesis equals two point seven nine, P equals zero point one zero seven). Paired t-tests confirmed significant increases in the MBSR group (acting with awareness: T left parenthesis thirteen right parenthesis equals three point six six five, P equals zero point zero zero three; observing: T left parenthesis thirteen right parenthesis equals four point two one eight, P equals zero point zero zero one; non-judging: T left parenthesis thirteen right parenthesis equals three point five eight zero, P equals zero point zero zero three), but not the control group (observing: T left parenthesis thirteen right parenthesis equals negative zero point six nine eight, P equals zero point four nine eight; acting with awareness: T left parenthesis thirteen right parenthesis equals negative one point nine nine one, P equals zero point zero six eight; non-judging: T left parenthesis thirteen right parenthesis equals zero point six five seven, P equals zero point five two three; two-tailed). That is, MBSR participants significantly increased their mindfulness scores on these three scales.\nccpt | Three point three. Gray matter changes in a priori regions of interest\n0fpw | The paired t-test within the MBSR group identified a small cluster in the left hippocampus with peak voxel M N I coordinates X comma Y comma Z: negative thirty-six, negative thirty-four, negative eight; T left parenthesis fifteen right parenthesis equals six point eight nine; voxel level P equals zero point zero one four, corrected for multiple comparisons with FWE correction; cluster size K equals thirty. The averaged gray matter concentration within this cluster was then extracted for each individual at each time-point using the Marsbar toolbox and further analyses were performed in S P S S. A repeated measures ANOVA (two groups five times two time-points; age and gender as nuisance variables) showed a significant group by time interaction (F one comma twenty-nine equals four point nine two; P equals zero point zero three five). There was no difference in gray matter concentration within this cluster between the two groups at the Pre time-point.\ndqn8 | sample T t-test for equal variances; T left parenthesis thirty-one right parenthesis equals zero point zero six; P equals zero point nine five six and the control group did not show a change in gray matter concentration from the Pre to Post time-point (paired T t-test; T sixteen equals zero point three four three; P equals zero point seven three six). Pre to Post changes in the other regions of interest were not significant, and changes in the a priori regions were also not correlated with the amount of mindfulness homework practice or with changes in the FFMQ. Furthermore, we performed a paired t-test within the control group in S P M five and applied the same thresholds. No significant voxels were associated with increase or decrease in gray matter concentration from Pre to Post in the control group. To summarize, analyses of gray matter concentration changes in the R O I analysis supported significant increases in the left hippocampus in the MBSR group, confirming that structural changes in this region are detectable within eight weeks following the participation in this mindfulness training program.\ncop0 | Three point four. Whole brain analysis\nlhkq | Exploratory analysis of the entire brain (paired T t-test in S P M five) revealed four clusters with significantly greater gray matter concentration at the Post compared with the Pre time-point in the MBSR group. One cluster was located in the posterior",
