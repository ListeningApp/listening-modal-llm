You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

Unlike the subseafloor brec- cia facies, the seafloor chimneys contain only minor anhy- drite and gypsum. Different chimney types commonly occur together; however, higher-temperature Cu-rich chimneys are more abundant near sites A and <LATEX>\mathrm { D } ,</LATEX> and lower-temperature barite-rich chimneys are common at site B (App. Fig. A20). Mineralized volcanic breccia was recovered from the base of several chimney complexes, where the chimneys have over- grown volcaniclastic material.
p1l0 | The Cu-rich chimneys comprise abundant, massive, coarse- grained chalcopyrite with minor pyrite (Fig. 7A-C). Locally, minor Fe-poor sphalerite and barite line the chimney con- duits. In one sample, trace amounts of microscopic gold are present as inclusions in the chalcopyrite (sample GMA13- 048; Fig. 7C). Distinctly zoned chimneys have layers that are chalcopyrite, pyrite (± marcasite), and sphalerite rich (Fig. 7D-F). Both Fe-rich and Fe-poor sphalerite occur in differ- ent layers. The low-Fe sphalerite commonly has inclusions of fine-grained Pb-As-Sb sulfosalts (jordanite) and minor galena. Late-stage, coarse tabular barite, amorphous silica, and iron oxyhydroxides occupy open spaces.
1i8b | The Zn-rich chimneys are most abundant and consist of dendritic sphalerite and barite with pyrite and marcasite (Fig. 7G-I). These chimneys lack clearly defined vent conduits but have alternating layers of low- and high-Fe sphalerite, similar to beehive chimneys that form by diffuse fluid venting (e.g., Koski et al., 1994). The low-Fe sphalerite commonly contains inclusions of jordanite and galena; fine-grained inclusions of chalcopyrite are present at grain boundaries but are rare. Late-stage tabular barite is followed paragenetically by minor amounts of amorphous silica and trace iron and manganese oxyhydroxides. The Ba-rich chimneys also form bulbous and beehive-like structures with variable amounts of amorphous silica filling or lining open spaces (Fig. 7J-L).
5sfj | Chalcopyrite and pyrite show little compositional varia- tion, although As is relatively enriched in both pyrite (up to 1.42 wt %) and marcasite (up to 2.71 wt %) (App. Table A2). Mercury is also present above detection limits in pyrite, together with Pb and Sb. FeS contents of sphalerite range from 0.02 to 13.98 mol %, with more than 50% of the analyses reporting <2 mol % FeS (Fig. 8). The most Fe-rich sphaler- ite is in chalcopyrite-rich assemblages, and the widest range of FeS values occur in the dendritic barite-rich chimneys. Cadmium (up to 2.04 wt %), In (up to 1.31 wt %), Ga (up <LATEX>\left. t o \quad 1 . 0 3 \quad w t \right) ,</LATEX> and Hg (up to 1.28 wt %) are likely present in solid solution in the sphalerite (e.g., Cook et al., 2009). Cadmium concentrations in sphalerite decrease from an aver- age of 0.33 wt % in the chalcopyrite-rich chimneys (n = 16) to 0.03 wt % in the dendritic barite-rich chimneys <LATEX>\left( n = 7 9 \right) ,</LATEX> suggesting a strong temperature dependence, which is also reflected in the Fe content. Galena contains up to 1.23 wt % Ag, mainly in the barite-rich chimneys. The Pb-As-Sb sulfo- salts have up to 11.91 wt % As and 0.28 wt % Sb, which is close to those of the As end member of the jordanite-geo- cronite series (cf. Biagioni et al., 2016).
