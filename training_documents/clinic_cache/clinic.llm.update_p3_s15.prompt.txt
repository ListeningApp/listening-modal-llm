You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

6bx7 | 2.6 | Data analyses
spl6 | The data were used to assess the prevalence of achieving the aforemen- tioned endpoints at the subject-level and, when possible, tooth level. Although 'stable periodontitis' defines a case at the subject-level, the com- posite measures defining the endpoint <LATEX>\left( P P D \leq 4 m m \right.</LATEX> and <LATEX>P P D = 4 \quad m m</LATEX> + BoP) were used at the tooth level to identify the teeth responsible for not meeting the endpoint. The number of diseased teeth per patient, as per WWC 2017, was calculated using the total number of 'unstable' teeth divided by the total number of (i) subjects and (ii) 'unstable' subjects.
7wzm | Incidence of tooth loss within a minimum duration of 5 years of SPC was recorded at the subject- and tooth-level in relation to the various endpoints. The number of teeth lost per patient per SPC year was calcu- lated using the total number of teeth lost divided by the total number of subjects with tooth loss data divided by the weighted average SPC years.
e9xj | Authors of journal articles were contacted if any queries arose from the data. Where data were unavailable for a subject, the corre- sponding subject was eliminated from the analyses.
9vl6 | Meta-analyses were performed using 'RStudio' application and R core software to determine the association between the incidence of tooth loss during SPC, as a summary risk ratio, and the unsuccessful achievement of various endpoints. Studies answering FQ-2 with zero subjects or teeth within one of the arms (successful or unsuccessful in meeting endpoints) were not included in the meta-analyses, as two arms were required for the calculation of relative risk (RR). The zero count was inflated to 0.5 to avoid computational errors for studies where no events (tooth loss) were observed in one or both arms. Sub- analyses of studies following conventional APT, as per EFP's S3 treat- ment guideline, or those reporting periodontitis-related tooth loss were performed to explore possible causes of heterogeneity among study results. RRs, their ratios and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated as effect sizes. With treatment outcome affected by subject-, tooth- and treatment-related factors, a random effects model was deemed appropriate to calculate the average distri- bution of mean effects, based on clinical and statistical reasoning (Papageorgiou, 2014). The Paule-Mandel method was chosen to

ba1e | The extent and impact of inter-study heterogeneity was assessed by inspecting the forest plots and by calculating the <LATEX>\tau ^ { 2 }</LATEX> (absolute het- erogeneity) and the I 2 statistics (relative heterogeneity), respectively. <LATEX>1 ^ { 2 }</LATEX> defined the proportion of total variability in the result explained by heterogeneity, and not chance, and we considered arbitrarily <LATEX>1 ^ { 2 } > 7 5 \%</LATEX> to represent considerable heterogeneity (Higgins et al., 2003).
en95 | Meta-analytical positive predictive values (PPV; a subject/tooth not meeting an endpoint and experiencing tooth loss) and negative predictive values (NPV; a subject/tooth meeting the endpoint and not experiencing tooth loss) were estimated at the subject and tooth level using pooled sensitivity and specificity for tooth loss across studies. For the meta-analytical pooling of the sensitivity and specificity, the bivariate approach was used as an improvement and extension of the traditional summary receiver operating characteristic (sROC) approach (Reitsma et al., 2005; Rutter & Gatsonis, 2001) and the mada function in R (Doebler & Holling, 2015).
l3do | RESULTS
u9bo | 3.1 Study selection |
7avo | The initial search generated 1682 articles from all databases com- bined, 9 from manual search and 1 via editorial contact (Figure 1).
uzo6 | Following screening of titles and abstracts, 230 articles qualified for full-text screening (Supplemental Material S2). The Cohen's kappa value for inter-reviewer agreement was 0.93 at first stage of screen- ing and 0.92 at the second stage. Corresponding authors of the 62 articles considered potentially suitable for inclusion were con- tacted for confirmation that all requested data were available. IPD were available for nine studies (Barbe et al., 2020; Ciurescu et al., 2021; Collins et al., 2022; Cortellini et al., 2020; De Wet et al., 2018; Nibali et al., 2017, 2020; Saleh et al., 2021; Saydzai et al., 2022) and summaries of the requested data were made avail- able via completed contingency tables for a further six studies (Aimetti et al., 2020; Baumer et al., 2020; Graetz et al., 2020; Jiao et al., 2017, 2018; Sonnenschein et al., 2017). There were no impor- tant issues in checking IPD integrity.
89b4 | 3.1.1 Focused question 1 |
5f7e | A total of 15 studies (Aimetti et al., 2020; Barbe et al., 2020; Baumer et al., 2020; Ciurescu et al., 2021; Collins et al., 2022; Cortellini et al., 2020; De Wet et al., 2018; Graetz et al., 2020; Jiao et al., 2017, 2018; Nibali et al., 2017; Nibali et al., 2020; Saleh et al., 2021; Saydzai et al., 2022; Sonnenschein et al., 2017) were included in the qualita- tive and quantitative analyses (Tables 1 and 2). They included 3 RCTs (both test and control groups were considered in the analyses), 10 cohort (1 prospective and 9 retrospective) and 2 cross-sectional studies.
