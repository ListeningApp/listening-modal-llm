Therapists who use the instructing mode are skilled at providing clients with (appropriately) detailed descriptions of the objectives and tasks of therapy, providing a clear rationale for the content\nucme | occupational therapy activities, and providing feedback to clients about the therapy process. They can speak clearly and confidently about any aspect of the therapy process and excel at being structured, active, and directive.\nqnl5 | They provide their clients with information, direction, recommendations, and, in some circumstances, advice. When functioning in the instructing mode, therapists utilize instructional statements and mini-lectures, role-modeling and demonstrations, statements that convey feedback to the client, and rhetorical questions as the primary form of therapy communication. Therapists functioning in the instructing mode are unafraid to state their professional opinions, set limits, provide feedback, or disagree with clients. When certain clients or circumstances make it necessary, these therapists are skilled at gentle or finessed approaches to confrontation in order to introduce the need for change. Therapists functioning in this mode may approach disagreements with clients by reexplaining their own point of view, providing more of a rationale for their perspective, explaining consequences of a poor decision, or educating clients further about the value of their approach.\nwdx9 | Strengths of the Instructing Mode\nn1xr | The instructing mode is one of the fundamental modes required for the competent conduct of occupational therapy. Without some degree of structure, transfer of knowledge, provision of feedback, and overall leadership, occupational therapy would be something other than what it is.\nohpj | Therapists who utilize this mode tend to be excellent teachers and clear communicators. They empower and inspire their clients by sharing information, noting accomplishments, providing constructive feedback, and training their clients to utilize the tools required for adaptation and participation. They convey caring and hope through their investment in a client's performance and in the positive outcomes of therapy. Therapists who function in the instructing mode tend to be highly organized and systematic in their approach to therapy. They inject a lot of intellectual energy and creativity into the therapy process.\nry5f | Cautions of the Instructing Mode\n31wg | As with any of the other modes, cautions emerge when therapists overutilize or inappropriately and indiscriminately apply the instructing mode with clients. Because the instructing mode usually involves focusing on outcomes more than process, some therapists functioning in\ncelk | CASE EXAMPLE Four point six The Instructing Mode\n3mf9 | Kay is a twenty-six-year-old woman who was severely injured in a skiing accident. She is paralyzed because of a spinal cord injury. Because she also had a hip fracture caused by the accident, her hospital stay was prolonged. I saw her as an inpatient for a period of four months. She is a naturally positive, strong, motivated, internally driven person. She had a creative outlook on occupational therapy and approached her goals in a systematic and self-disciplined manner.\nz2rd | Because Kay was so self-motivated, most of the time I found myself functioning in the collaborating mode when we planned therapy goals and activities. However, there were many times during Kay's therapy when I felt she was asking me to function in the instructing mode. These were times when Kay requested that I teach her specific skills related to activities of daily living. It was common that Kay would\nvqld | this mode may overinvest and thus react more negatively when they cannot get clients to do what they want them to do. Alternatively, they may tend to overinstruct their clients to prevent them from experiencing failure in therapy. These behaviors can undermine clients' confidence, choice, and autonomy.\nljmz | Occasionally, clients who are sensitive to these issues may misunderstand or misinterpret therapists' behavior in the instructing mode as being parental, authoritarian, dominant, controlling, or demanding. Therapists who overutilize this mode may feel obligated to help all clients address their difficulties and may miss the point at which clients want them to simply listen and validate them. Therefore, they are occasionally at risk for getting locked into arguments and power struggles with sensitive or vulnerable clients or parents who require a more empathic approach.\nen1l | Problem-Solving Mode\n45gx | Individuals who favor the problem-solving mode rely heavily on using reason and logic in their relationships with clients. Therapists functioning in the problem-solving mode generally approach the interpersonal aspects\nxgur | begin our sessions by anticipating that she would need to learn a certain skill, such as handling glasses in a restaurant or learning how to cut her own food.\niz66 | Another responsibility included in my role as instructor was to bear witness to Kay's self-monitoring of her own performance. To do this, we put a piece of paper on the wall that listed her functional accomplishments for each day of therapy. Our systematic daily monitoring of her progress made it feel as if she was in school. I believe this was developmentally familiar to her and it gave her a sense of consistency and control. At first, her accomplishments were small. We would write, \"I moved my little finger today\" or \"I rolled to the side by myself.\" Soon her accomplishments progressed to: \"I ate today without Kim dropping any food.\" By the time Kay left the hospital the wall was covered with documentation of her accomplishments.\ndndq | -Kim Eberhardt\nxzce | derived from the Socratic method of inquiry. The key to understanding the types of questions that are asked in this mode is that the questions are agenda-driven. Therapists functioning in the problem-solving mode focus on clarifying and probing the client's beliefs about an issue for three central purposes: to guide the client to think about and approach a problem or challenge in a more adaptive way, to free the client from thoughts and beliefs that inhibit his or her ability to engage in the other aspects of occupational therapy, or simply to help a client clarify their own thinking about an issue. Specifically, these types of questions are aimed at enabling a client to see a wider range of options, consequences, or dimensions of an issue. Therapists often pose these kinds of questions so clients may refine or expand their thinking about an issue or consider alternative perspectives. Therapists in this mode may also lead clients to list pros and cons, or strengths and weaknesses of a given decision or approach. They may,\nw4vd | The Socratic method of questioning is a structured approach to asking a client questions. In the case of the IRM, the questions are designed to test or challenge a client's thinking about a situation to enable the client to think more clearly, rationally,\ncuh0 | CASE EXAMPLE Four point seven The Problem-Solving Mode\nk36t | Madam Bouchard is a forty-seven-year-old woman with schizoaffective disorder. She was admitted to the inpatient unit after a police officer arrested her for driving on the wrong side of traffic on a highway at five o'clock in the morning. She was brought to the hospital because she seemed lost and confused about the incident.\n```",
