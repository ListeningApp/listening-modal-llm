You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

7fh2 | EXTENDING THE REGIME OF LINEAR RESPONSE WITH SYNTHETIC FORCINGS
5isn | 1. Introduction. Statistical physics provides a formulation to study the macro- scopic properties of interacting particle systems based on the behavior of their mi- croscopic constituents. Its numerical realization, known as "molecular dynamics", has played an essential role in science for the past 70 years; see [3] for a historical perspective, and [17, 46, 27, 1] for reference textbooks. One of the major aims of molecular dynamics is to compute macroscopic quantities or thermodynamic proper- ties, typically given by averages of basic dynamical variables, which allows to obtain quantitative information on a system. Molecular dynamics can be thought of as a nu- merical microscope, as it bridges the gap between theoretical and experimental work, playing an important part across (essentially) all of science.
5vry | One particular interest in molecular dynamics is the computation of transport coefficients, such as the mobility, thermal conductivity and shear viscosity. At the macroscopic level, transport coefficients relate an external forcing acting on the system (i.e. a perturbation on the equilibrium dynamics) to an average response expressed through some steady-state flux (of energy, momentum, charged particles etc). From a mathematical perspective, this can be done by introducing a reference dynamics which models systems at equilibrium, and perturbing it by some external forcing of magnitude n E R mimicking the driving exerted on the system to create some flux. This corresponds to the so-called nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) [6].
9w33 | To realize this in molecular dynamics simulations, we consider general perturbed dynamics of the form
johv | dX" =(b(X")+nF(X}))dt +o(X")dWt,
2olp | where F is the external forcing and n E R its magnitude, and Wt a standard Brownian

In general, it is observed that the response En(R) of the system, given by the steady-state average of a physical observable R of interest which has average 0 for unperturbed dynamics (n = 0), is proportional to the magnitude of the forcing for small values of the forcing. This corresponds to the linear response regime; see Figure 1. When this is the case, the linear response p1 is computed as
uadf | PI = Jim En (R). En(R)
wuf4 | (1.1)
lfk1 | By definition, transport coefficients are the proportionality constants p1 relating the response En (R) to the forcing for |n| small. One typical example is the case where the force F is constant and the configuration space is a torus. Such a forcing is considered to compute the mobility of particles in the system, which we discuss in more detail in Section 2.2.3. Another example is the case where F has components in one direction only, whose magnitude depends on the position in another direction. Such forcings can be used to estimate the shear viscosity through the so-called sinusoidal transverse force method [19].
rwjw | In practice, steady-state averages involved in the linear response are computed as ergodic averages over a very long trajectory of the system, obtained as a realization of the stochastic differential equation (SDE) (2.4). Although there are several such ways of computing these steady-state averages, it is typically done in one of two ways: either based on (i) equilibrium techniques based on Green-Kubo formulae, which are integrated autocorrelation functions [20, 26]; or (ii) nonequilibrium steady- state methods where the limit (1.1) is numerically estimated; see [6]. Both numerical methods have advantages and drawbacks, and are constantly undergoing algorithmic advances; see [7, 37], and [43] for a comparison and discussion between the methods. In this work, however, we focus exclusively on the nonequilibrium approach.
iazp | In the NEMD approach, a standard estimator to compute the linear response (1.1) is
ksn3 | (1.2) În,t = |R(X) ds,
8xbx | where the fixed value of n / 0 should be small enough in absolute value in order for the nonlinear part of the response to be negligible. Although there are various sources of error associated with the estimator (1.2), as made precise in Section 2.3, the variance associated with (1.2) is the main issue. In particular, in the context of computing transport coefficients, the large signal-to-noise ratio leads to a very large statistical error, as we are averaging very small linear responses [42]. The estima- tor (1.2), for instance, has asymptotic variance of order O(t-1n-2), much larger than the usual asymptotic variance of order O(t-1) associated with its equilibrium averages counterpart, as the linear regime is only valid for |7| < 1. This motivates the inter- est of variance reduction techniques, which are used to decrease the statistical error in the estimated averages. Examples of standard variance reduction techniques for Monte Carlo simulations, for which a review is provided in [5], are antithetic variables, stratification, control variate methods and importance sampling.
aod5 | One of the main challenges with computing nonequilibrium steady-state averages, however, is that traditional equilibrium variance reduction techniques cannot be used the same way (see [29, Section 5.4] for a detailed discussion on obstructions to this end). Although many practitioners of molecular dynamics realize that the computa- tion of transport coefficients is a difficult numerical issue, there were only a handful
ayqs | EXTENDING LINEAR RESPONSE WITH SYNTHETIC FORCINGS
jnpq | of attempts to develop dedicated variance reduction techniques. Many practitioners still use direct, brute force numerical methods based on a time integration of the dynamics.
r4w4 | In order to reduce the statistical error of order 1/(n2t), one idea is to extend the regime of linear response, which consequently allows to use larger values of n. One approach for doing so is to use synthetic forcings. Such forcings, as presented in this work, were introduced by Evans and Morriss [11] ("synthetic fields", in their terminology) with the purpose to produce a mechanical analog of a thermal transport process. This notion was originally used by Gillan and Dixon [18], then abstracted and extended by Evans and Morriss in [11]. The name synthetic is used to denote that the external fields under consideration do not exist in nature.
sswz | The key idea behind synthetic forcings is that there are infinitely many forcings which lead to the same transport coefficient. This flexibility should be used to develop better numerical methods for the computation of transport coefficients. In theory, one can add an extra forcing to the physical perturbation of the system, as long as this extra forcing preserves the invariant measure of the reference system, which in turn preserves the linear response. We call the resulting perturbation a synthetic forcing, as it has no physical representation; it is a mathematical device used to simplify the problem at hand.
0uoj | The aim is to find synthetic perturbations allowing to reduce the nonlinear part of the response as much as possible (see Figure 1) in order to consider larger values of |7|. In this article, we present a mathematical framework for choosing and quantifying the quality of synthetic forcings, in the context of linear response theory, and discuss various possible choices for them. We illustrate the analysis with numerical results in low dimensional systems.
