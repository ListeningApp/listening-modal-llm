You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

3pn1 | The main endopeptidases for most crustaceans are trypsin and chymotrypsin. Trypsin is considered one of the most important enzymes in decapod crustaceans. In Marsupenaeus japonicus and Melicertus kerathurus, this enzyme accounts for 40-50% of the total proteolysis (Galgani et al., 1984), whereas it is reported to be about 50- 60% in giant tiger prawn (Penaeus monodon), kuruma shrimp (Marsupenaeus japonicus), redtail prawn (Fenneropenaeus penicillatus formerly Penaeus penicillatus) speckled shrimp (Metapenaeus monoceros) and Euphausia superba (Tsai et al., 1986) and 33% in the fiddler crab Uca pugilator (Eizen & Jeffrey, 1969) (Fig. 7).
wjuz | In giant freshwater prawn (Macrobrachium rosenbergii) trypsin and chymotrypsin account for between 55 and 82% of proteolytic activity (Chisty et al., 2009). Some species produce cathepsin L as the main proteolytic enzyme e.g. the North Sea shrimp Crangon crangon and Crangon allmani most individuals of which lack trypsin and chymotrypsin (Teschke & Saborowski, 2005).
3yxv | Trypsins have been described in decapod crustaceans that are capable of hydrolysing the triple helix of native collagen under physiological conditions. These enzymes, discovered in in the fiddler crab Uca pugilator, have been named "collagenolytic proteases" (Eizen & Jeffrey, 1969; Grant et al., 1983). True collagenases are metalloproteases that degrade native collagen under physiological conditions, but are unable to hydrolyse denatured collagen or other native proteins (Woolley et al., 1978). The main difference with the collagenolytic proteinases resides in the structure of the active sites (Sakharov et al., 1994). Proteases able to degrade native collagen have also been found in P. monodon (Lu et al., 1990; Tsai et al., 1991).
d8zj | In crustaceans, amino acids are absorbed by the R-cells and F-cells of the hepatopancreas and, to a lesser extent, by the midgut intestine. Amino acids are transported to the various tissues and are utilised as required, either being incorporated into proteins or used in a range of biochemical processes. Between 25% and 50% of dietary amino acids are incorporated into the body protein. The deposition of protein is consequently a major determinant of amino acid utilization and requirements.
ywxn | 3.2 Carbohydrases
uxhs | The term carbohydrases applies to enzymes that digest carbohydrates. Carbohydrate digestion, like protein digestion, involves hydrolysis of polymeric bonds (the bonds between polymers - chemical compound or mixture of compounds consisting of repeating structural units) and proceeds in stages until the basic units (monosaccharides) are produced. There are two classes of enzymes that hydrolyze polysaccharides (polymers of saccharides): the polysaccharidases and the oligosaccharidases. Polysaccharides are long carbohydrate molecules of up to 3,000 monosaccharide units joined together. An oligosaccharide contains a relatively small number (typically 2-10) of monosaccharides.
ed6e | The most common polysaccharidase enzymes are amylases, which hydrolyze plant starches (amylose and amylopectin) (Fig. 8) and animal glycogen; these all are polysaccharides with a-bonds between the subunits.
6qqm | The oligosaccharidases hydrolyze trisaccharides such as raffinose, and disaccharides, such as maltose, sucrose, lactose (milk sugar) and trehalose (a common insect sugar). Maltose, sucrose and trehalose all contain a glucose bound by an a-bond to a second monosaccharide and are hydrolyzed by a-glucosidases (e.g., maltase and sucrase - also called invertase in invertebrates - and trehalase). Glucose linked to other monosaccharides by a ß-bond (e.g. lactose, cellobiose) is hydrolyzed by ß-glycosidases (e.g. lactase or ß-galactosidase).
onum | Decapod crustaceans are able to hydrolyze a great variety of polysaccharides and oligosaccharides, greatly surpassing the range of herbivorous fish. A wide range of enzymes have been identified in shrimp hepatopancreas and other sections of the digestive tract: a- and ß-galactosidases, a-fucosidase, laminarinase, a-mannosidase, ß- glucuronidase, ß-glucosaminidase, xylanase, a-xylosidase, raffinase, ß-fructofuranosidase, chitobiase and cellulase (Chuang et al., 1992; Chuang et al., 1991a; Chuang et al., 1991b; Gibson & Barker, 1979a; Omondi & Stark, 1996; Trellu & Ceccaldi, 1977; Vega-Villasante et al., 1995).
3iir | The activity of amylases is of great importance for herbivorous crustaceans and in the (omnivorous) common prawn (Palaemon serratus), its activity is more important than proteolytic activity (van Wormhoudt, 1980). Sequencing of three a-amylases extracted from Litopenaeus vannamei has revealed close evolutionary relationships with mammals (59-63% identity) and with insects (52-62% identity) (van Wormhoudt & Sellos, 1996; Van Wormhoudt & Sellos, 2003).
7a0a | The digestibility of starch is an important factor in determining the availability of glucose in feed formulations. The enzyme a-amylase hydrolyses starch into maltose. Additional enzymes, maltase and isomaltase, then hydrolyse maltose further into glucose. These enzymes are present in the gastrointestinal tract of fish and shrimp but their activity and effectiveness vary between species. Data are limited for crustacean species (Table II) but in fish, a reduction in digestibility is observed when the dietary level of starch increases, irrespective of the starch origin.
o1qp | Data sources: Cousin et al. (1996) and Rivas-Vega et al. (2006).
jrik | According to Stone (2003) the reduction in the digestibility of carbohydrates when dietary levels increase may be the result of an overload on the digestive enzymes that become saturated with substrate. The threshold for enzyme saturation by substrate is unknown in crustaceans and it is not apparent in the data shown in Table II.
xv78 | Herbivorous species of fish have high activity and efficacy of starch degrading enzymes. Omnivorous species have moderate activity whilst carnivores have only a limited ability to digest starch.
