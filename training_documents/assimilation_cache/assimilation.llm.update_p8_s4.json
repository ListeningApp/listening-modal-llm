        "content": "rsbu | Assume that the process variables X of I in R of N form a linear process model,\nmagd | X of I equals M sub I X of I minus one plus xi sub I, I equals one through N,\ntb74 | with X of zero follows N of mu, Sigma. The more general process model X of I equals M sub I X of I minus one plus b of I plus xi sub I can be reduced to Equation twenty point sixteen. Assume, furthermore, that the data variables Y of I in R of M are linearly related to the process variables,\n8l69 | Y of I equals H sub I X of I plus zeta sub I, I equals one through N.\n1jyv | The M sub I and H sub I are matrices of suitable dimensions, and the xi sub I in R of N and zeta sub I in R of M are random variables, independent of each other and of X of zero, distributed as xi sub I follows N of zero, Q sub I and zeta sub I follows N of zero, R sub I. The assumptions cover the case where the dimension m sub I of the Ith observation Y of I depends on I or where some of the Y of I are absent.\nolce | Then the theory of multivariate normal distributions implies that the X of I and Y of I are also Gaussian, as are all conditional variables. In particular, X of one follows N of M sub one mu, Q sub one plus M sub one Sigma M sub one transposed. It is therefore sufficient to describe the means and covariance matrices of these variables. We use the following abbreviations:\nerx1 | mu sub I given I minus one equals E of X of I given Y of one to I minus one, Sigma sub I given I minus one equals VAR of X of I given Y of one to I minus one, mu sub I given I equals E of X of I given Y of one to I, Sigma sub I given I equals VAR of X of I given Y of one to I, mu sub I equals E of X of I given Y of one to N, Sigma sub I equals VAR of X of I given Y of one to N, with the convention mu sub zero one zero equals mu, mu sub one zero equals six X of one equals M sub one u and, similarly, Sigma sub O of zero equals Sigma, Sigma sub one given zero equals Q sub one plus M sub one Sigma M sub one transposed. The quantities u are conditional means and the quantities sum conditional covariance matrices. The subscript I given I minus one refers to a forecasting quantity, the subscript I given to a filtering quantity to estimate the current state based on current and past observations, and the simple subscript I to a reanalysis quantity to estimate a past state from all available data. The goal is to obtain recursions for all these quantities. Straightforward computations show that\nb3bt | mu sub I given I minus one equals M sub I M sub I minus one given I minus one, Sigma sub I given I minus one equals Q sub I plus M sub I Sigma sub I minus one given I minus one M sub I transposed, I equals one through N.\n0w8m | As expected, the forecasting distribution does not depend on new data.",
