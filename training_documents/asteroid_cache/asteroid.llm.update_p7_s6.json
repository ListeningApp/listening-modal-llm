        "content": "68xu | The merrillite in Ibitira recorded an earlier event, with the model two hundred seven P b star divided by two hundred six P b star age of four thousand five hundred fifty-two point zero plus or minus eight point eight million years. This value is indistinguishable from its pyroxene two hundred seven P b two hundred six P b isochron age of four thousand five hundred fifty-six point seventy-five plus or minus zero point fifty-seven million years. The whole-rock M n-C r systems also recorded this age four thousand five hundred fifty-seven plus two divided by minus four million years. Thermal metamorphism at approximately four thousand five hundred fifty-five million years is consistent with the records in the eucrites, even though Ibitira came from a different parent body. The forty A r thirty-nine A r age of four thousand four hundred eighty-seven plus or minus fifteen million years for Ibitira is distinctly younger than those from the other chronometers. It is inferred that Ibitira experienced (i) ancient crystallization likely prior to four thousand five hundred sixty million years, (ii) high-temperature thermal metamorphism in the crust at four thousand five hundred fifty-five million years, and (iii) subsequent monotonic cooling until\nhd35 | approximately four thousand four hundred ninety million years. Intense asteroidal collisions prior to four point fifteen billion years?\n2zpk | Our study reveals that the U-Pb system in the phosphates in the three brecciated eucrites recorded multiple impact events prior to four point fifteen billion years. The phosphates U-Pb ages of two other brecciated eucrites, NWA eight thousand nine and Bereba, also recorded the thermal events at\nepu7 | approximately four point twenty-five to four point one billion years. Moreover, the silicate U-Pb systems in some eucrites recorded coincident timings. It is obvious that the parent body, Vesta, suffered intense impacts at greater than or equal to four point fifteen billion years, during which the U-Pb systems in its phosphates and silicates were partially reset. Conversely, only the K-A r system recorded the later bombardment on Vesta at three point eighty-five to three point forty-seven billion years. The absence of approximately three point eighty-five billion-year records in the phosphates U-Pb systems suggests that these later impacts were weaker than the earlier impacts, greater than four point fifteen billion years, resulting in lower reheating temperatures.\n7od1 | The closure temperatures T sub C of the U-Pb system in zircon and apatite, and of the K-A r system in plagioclase are calculated using Dodson's law: T sub C equals E divided by R log open parenthesis A R D sub zero T sub C squared divided by a squared E T prime close parenthesis, where E equals activation energy, R equals gas constant, D sub zero equals coefficient, and A is a dimensionless constant, with known diffusion properties of P b and/or A r. For diffusion scale a, we use typical grain sizes of the minerals in the basaltic eucrites. Cooling rate T prime is an unknown parameter. In high-temperature range twelve hundred degrees Celsius to eight hundred fifty degrees Celsius, T prime for the basaltic eucrites is known to be as rapid as four thousand degrees Celsius per million years. By extrapolating this to the lower temperature range, T sub C becomes approximately five hundred ninety degrees Celsius for the U-Pb in apatite and approximately three hundred degrees Celsius for the K-A r in plagioclase. The detailed conditions for the T sub C calculations and their results are provided in supplementary Table S three. In case of impact-induced reheating and subsequent rapid quenching at the near-surface of the asteroid the closure temperatures are much higher. Assuming a rapid quenching one degree Celsius per day, or, four times ten to the eighth degrees Celsius per million years after impact reheating, T sub C becomes approximately one thousand degrees Celsius for the U-Pb in apatite, approximately five hundred degrees Celsius for the K-A r in plagioclase, and exceed the melting point of basaltic rock for the U-Pb in zircon. This means the U-Pb ages in the eucrite zircon may not be disturbed by impacts without extensive remelting and/or recrystallization, unless our assumption of the rapid quenching is incorrect.\n0bqy | In Fig. 5, we compiled the literature data for the U-Pb and Hf-W chronologies of zircon, the U-Pb system of silicates and phosphates, and the K-Ar system of whole-rock or silicates dated by the forty A r thirty-nine A r method for various basaltic eucrites and mesosiderites. There seem to be three key age groups: (1) prior to four point five billion years, (2) prior to four point fifteen billion years, and (3) near approximately three point nine to three point five billion years.",
