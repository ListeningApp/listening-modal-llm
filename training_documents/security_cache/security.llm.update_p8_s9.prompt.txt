You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

wb1c | 3.2 Self-assessment exercises
ak13 | Self-assessment 1: Choose an organisation, and outline some of the main functions and responsibilities of the Security Manager within that particular risk environment
s7el | Self-assessment 2: Give an example of three situations where a change in the level of Risk Perception has caused a change in the level of security control (for example, being searched at a nightclub, having to show ID to get into an Embassy, having to wear a student ID card to get access to campus buildings).
0lfu | Self-assessment 3: Take one of the examples, and discuss whether, given the perceived level of threat, you think that they have got an appropriate balance between security and freedom, and why you think they have made that decision.
cnjl | Self-assessment 4: Give an example of each of the five security management strategies listed above, and show how the appropriate use of each can add to the overall security of an organisation or operation.
rtdl | 4 Risk Management
norp | For any security manager, whatever their role and whatever the size of operation that they are responsible for, there are three fundamental issues that they will be dealing with, and it is likely that the vast majority of their daily work can be clearly classified as belonging in one of those three categories:
chx3 | 1. 'What are the problems that I need to deal with?'
sfcf | 2. 'What should I do about it?'
nuxs | 3. 'What do I do if something goes wrong?'
umx0 | To put this into more technical terms, we are talking about Risk Assessment, Risk Control and finally Contingency Planning. This module introduces these three basic concepts, and shows how they act as the foundation for all security management operations.
o306 | 4.1 Three-Stage Risk Management System
qm1b | Stage 1: Risk Assessment
n9ms | The purpose of the Risk Assessment is to take all of the thousands of possible or potential risks that might occur, and to give them some kind of comparative value. This will allow us to decide which of them is more serious, and which need to be actively managed. The truth is, that if we take any simple situation - walking from our home to the train station, or delivering a package from your warehouse to a client, for example - there are literally hundreds of possible scenarios that could be considered as risks, from the road being closed or the tube being disrupted, to a twisted ankle or being mugged, and even a major terrorist attack.
icdp | As an example, a risk assessment carried out in a factory might identify realistic possible threats such as workers stealing goods; an electrical breakdown that would stop the production line; a hole in the fence; a phoned-in bomb threat; suspicious activity outside the main gate; a major terrorist attack somewhere nearby, but which would lead to the police putting a cordon around our factory so that no-one could get in, or a breakdown in the access control system.
wtse | This is the first stage of a Risk Assessment, in that we have Identified Potential Threats. However, that is only the first part of the process, because we then need a way of putting them into some sort of order.
bm7g | The accepted way of doing this is to create a Risk Matrix, based on two measures: Likelihood (the likelihood of an event occurring) and Impact (the disruption that event would have on our operations if it did occur). Both of these measures can range from Low (unlikely, low impact) to High (very likely, high impact) See Figure 4 for two different versions of a risk matrix.
jr68 | The Risk Matrix (see figure 5) has been divided into five distinct Risk Zones, based on the Likelihood / Impact values. Each of these areas would identify a different class of problems, which would require different forms of solutions.
axix | Each risk zone would identify a different class of problem, each of which would require a different approach in risk management
05y4 | Stage 2: Risk Control
2fb0 | The purpose of Risk Control is to minimise the likelihood of any identified unwanted event occuring, and minimise the impact of any unwanted event that does occur.
s9fn | Once we have identified the risks and given them a Comparative Risk Value, we can then identify those risks that can be most easily managed through our security systems. For example, if we have identified that the lack of access control means that unauthorised people are walking around our premises, the introduction of a Reception Desk and / or an entry-phone system could be one way of solving that problem.
k5r6 | In order to ensure that the most effective Risk Control measures are put in place, each identified threat should lead to the introduction of a specific Security Protocol / Procedure.
z9v9 | For example, if you are working in a situation where the possibility of a parcel or letter bomb is considered greater than normal, this would be identified during the risk assessment process. As part of your risk control measures, you would then develop specific security protocols to maximise the likelihood of identifying a letter- bomb, and to minimise the effect if any letter bomb that might be sent. This might involve screening all incoming mail at a separate location away from the main offices. You might also have ensured that all mail-room and reception staff had undergone specific training to teach them how to identify suspicious packages and what to do if they were found. Reception staff would also need to undergo the training in case someone hand-delivered a suspicious package, either themselves or using one of the major logistical companies. If a suspicious package was found, you could then isolate the area whilst a specialist police team was called. As this was identified as a high-likelihood potential threat during your Risk Assessment , you should have developed good relationships with the police units, who would be aware of the threat and may well have taken part in joint-exercises with
gpu9 | your staff to respond to a suspect package. All of these actions would be developed in response to the initial identification of a high-impact threat.
u5ws | There have been a number of examples of letter bombs in the UK, and a company might be targeted because it is working in the pharmaceutical industry, or it may be associated with political or national issues that increase the likelihood of attack. In 2007, a single person sent seven letter bombs in the UK to companies associated with DNA testing and various traffic organisations. The Animal Liberation Front have also used letter bombs, as have Arabic organisations targeting both Jewish and Israeli targets, as well as Arab-language newspapers in the UK.
onkh | A security protocol is a set of guidelines outlining how a person should behave in the event that a specific incident was to occur. Figure 7 provides an example of a security protocol that could be used in the event that a delivery lorry arrived at the front gate, but without the appropriate paperwork.
8t55 | The first two stages of any risk management programme, namely Risk Assessment and Risk Control, are designed to prevent an incident occuring. The third stage, Contingency Planning, prepares you to react and respond as effectively as possible when something does happen. In some American risk management models, the difference between the proactive Risk Assessment and Risk Control stages, and the reactive Contingency Planning stage is described as 'Left of Bang' and 'Right of Bang' (see figure 8).
7imw | Stage 3: Contingency Planning
lf1t | The purpose of Contingency Planning is to allow the security team to regain control of the situation, and return to to normal operational status, as quickly and effectively as possible.
tze7 | Once an incident has occurred, it is clear that it will have a negative impact on the normal running of the operation, whether it is someone forgetting the key to the front gate, disruption of your normal supply chain, or a water-pipe bursting in the office above, and flooding your whole control room. (Thii s last example is exactly what happened at the main police control room just before the 2012 London Olympics .... ).
