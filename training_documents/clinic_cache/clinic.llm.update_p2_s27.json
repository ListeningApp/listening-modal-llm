        "content": "sy14 | FQ-one assesses the prevalence of subjects who achieved the aforementioned endpoints at the end of APT/start of SPC.\nghss | FQ-two was the incidence of tooth loss (periodontitis-related when available) for treated subjects who had been in SPC for a minimum of five years and its association with various endpoints.\n3s61 | Study design: Randomized controlled trials, cohort (prospective/retrospective), case-control and cross-sectional studies published from twenty seventeen were included. Cross-sectional studies were included if the original retrospective data from the study could be obtained. Studies selected for FQ-one with a minimum SPC follow-up of five years were used to answer FQ-two.\ns3rm | Two point three Literature search\npqxb | A search strategy was formulated with an experienced librarian using a combination of MeSH and free-text terms, with no language restrictions. Electronic database searches included Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and OpenGrey from twenty seventeen to eighteenth February twenty twenty-two. This was complemented by a manual search of the Journal of Dental Research, the Journal of Clinical Periodontology, the Journal of Periodontology and the Journal of Periodontal Research from twenty seventeen to eighteenth February twenty twenty-two. Reference lists of the included articles and relevant reviews were manually searched. Editors of the above-named journals were contacted about any articles in press that fit the inclusion criteria.\n08qc | Two point four Screening and study inclusion\nhdj2 | Study selection was based on a two-step approach: (i) screening of titles and abstracts and (ii) full-text analysis, with reasons for exclusion. Full texts were obtained for those studies selected by at least one reviewer. Both steps were performed in duplicate by two independent reviewers. Disagreements were resolved by consensus. An arbitrator was consulted if the disagreement could not be resolved. Where studies showed duplication of the subject sample or database, the first published study with all the required data or relevant multi-centre study were selected. Inter-observer agreement at both stages was assessed via the Cohen's kappa statistic. The corresponding authors were contacted to confirm inclusion, as individual patient data are rarely reported.\na57g | Two point five Data collection\ng8m3 | Two point five point one Data extraction\na9av | Data were extracted from journal articles based on the general study and population characteristics. Subject-, tooth- and site-level data for periodontal parameters, P-P-D plus or minus BoP, were extracted from individual six-point pocket charts or datasets, sent by the journal article authors, by one reviewer. Alternatively, the authors completed a summary data collection form if they opted to do their own reanalysis. Depending on availability, data were for subjects accounted for in the sample size of the selected journal article or the whole database on which the journal article was based. Data were entered into tables stratified by study design on\n73l3 | Microsoft Excel. Data consistency, completeness and sequence generation were reviewed by the second reviewer. Any disagreements were resolved by consensus. An arbitrator was consulted if the disagreement could not be resolved.\nornm | Two point five point two RoB assessment\nu2z1 | Quality assessment was carried out by one reviewer and reviewed independently by another reviewer. Included studies were assessed using Cochrane Risk of Bias, RoB, Two Tool for RCTs, the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for cohort and case-control studies, and the AXIS tool for cross-sectional studies. Disagreements were resolved by consensus. An arbitrator was consulted if it could not be resolved.\natmh | Two point six Data analyses\n7hgg | The data were used to assess the prevalence of achieving the aforementioned endpoints at the subject level and, when possible, tooth level. Although \"stable periodontitis\" defines a case at the subject level, the composite measures defining the endpoint, P-P-D less than or equal to four millimeters and P-P-D equals four millimeters plus BoP, were used at the tooth level to identify the teeth responsible for not meeting the endpoint. The number of diseased teeth per patient, as per WWC twenty seventeen, was calculated using the total number of \"unstable\" teeth divided by the total number of subjects and \"unstable\" subjects.\nxwsv | Incidence of tooth loss within a minimum duration of five years of SPC was recorded at the subject- and tooth-level in relation to the various endpoints. The number of teeth lost per patient per SPC year was calculated using the total number of teeth lost divided by the total number of subjects with tooth loss data divided by the weighted average SPC years.\n756b | Authors of journal articles were contacted if any queries arose from the data. Where data were unavailable for a subject, the corresponding subject was eliminated from the analyses.",
