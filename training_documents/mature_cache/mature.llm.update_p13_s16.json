        "content": "vk4h | D: You mean if a girl has sex then maybe she'll do it with me?\nnsm3 | M: Well, uh maybe.\njdfw | D: If that's the question, then NO, no because, uh, well, ((smiles and looks at Bob))\nuc9r | B: We're not that desperate.\nl0ap | D: Yeah, and she's not, huh, she's not what I would call,\nx815 | B: She's NOT good looking.\nepbj | D: Yes, she's not attractive enough.\nnmn2 | B: But ((smiling at Dirk)) she's not exactly ugly though, she's not,\ng3tm | exactly ugly, I mean she does, she's got big boobs, so I don't know ((laughter)).\n5lm9 | The moderator opens up the space for the initial proposition in lines one to two by asking whether they are attracted to \"this kind of stuff.\" Whatever \"this kind of stuff\" is, it is interpreted to be extreme, as seen in the way Dirk and Bob immediately counter it with emphatic denials (lines four to five) and Dirk's display of non-understanding (line seven). This draws up the initial, though potentially overstated proposition that they are not at all interested in \"this kind of stuff.\" What is peculiar, though, is that Bob's and Dirk's denials are crafted with overly exaggerated emphatic stress and with a bit of cheeky smiling at one another, as if they are parodying the act of making a denial by protesting too much. Even Dirk's question to the moderator (line seven) is given with an inquisitive smile face, underscoring the not-being-said aspect of the conversation. This suggests that conceding something positive or of interest about promiscuous girls is something to be oriented to delicately and indirectly. For instance, in line thirteen, as Dirk attempts yet again to display disinterest, he hedges ('because uh well'), and ends up smiling at Bob as he falters to finish his turn. It is as if his soft and hedged account is a way of playing dumb, crafting a weak denial that is itself designed to concede that there is perhaps something attractive or interesting in a promiscuous girl.\nwp2c | Interestingly, the reasons the boys give for their disinterest have to do with her lack of attractiveness (lines ten, seventeen to eighteen) and their lack of desperation (line fifteen). This leaves the possibility that if she were good looking enough and/or if they were more desperate, then they might be interested. As such, their denial of interest is not based in principle, but rather in particular features of the situation. Again, this underscores the concessionary element to their original denial. This is solidified more explicitly in lines nineteen to twenty-one as Bob momentarily demurs with their denials and concedes that there is, after all, something attractive about this promiscuous girl ('she's got big boobs'). By equivocating back and forth with an 'off-the-record' kind of concessionary hedging and qualification, the boys are able to orient to dual concerns. The concessive repair allows them to interactively negotiate a position of not looking obviously duped into, desperate, or na√Øve about what might be at stake, while at the same time implying that given the right situation (the girl being attractive or them being more desperate), they would be potentially attracted to a girl whom they have characterized as promiscuous. The careful deployment of concessive repairs allows both positions to remain open; they allow them to appear sexually interested, but also knowing, in control, and thus mature in the way they display heterosexual interest.\nus5v | Differentiation through caricature\nrs2m | In the following excerpt, the boys differentiate themselves from guys who are only interested in girls for their looks. Showing how one does not possess certain features can be a way of differentiating oneself or resisting membership of the social categories indexed by those features. One way to do this is by \"styling the other\" through actively caricaturing their voices. When heard casually, the reported dialogue or \"caricature\" can\nuz9y | appear to position the \"other\" as extreme, absurd, or problematic in some way. But the caricature need not always establish complete differentiation. Depending on its design, it may work selectively to problematize some features of the \"other,\" while indirectly leaving other features intact. Consider the following excerpt.\n8ov0 | Excerpt five.\nmj9m | Participants: M: Moderator, D: Don, H: Hal, A: Andi\n94h3 | M: Okay listen, so is it that the girls think that the guys are only looking for looks and,\n9jx1 | D: Depends on the guy, cause [some ( )]\nc3lz | M: Is that a common thing [some guys] just look for looks?\nez9s | M: Very common, so you think you all are different from these guys?\nmqot | ((All three boys nod.))\noc99 | M: You think so huh, Hal, you too?\ngipz | H: Yeah, those guys annoy me actually; like the guys that are all OHH she has such a nice butt, OH: I like it so: much' ((laughter))\nb4wj | M: Now are these also kids in your group?\n5xlt | D: Yeah, like we say that, like but if we really wanna go out with 'em, we like just say 'Hey you have a nice ass', just say that and like, but DON'T be like THEY: I WANNA GO OUT ((laughter))",
