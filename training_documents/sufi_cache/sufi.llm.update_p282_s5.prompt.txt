You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

0o5y | You may 'know a man well', even meet him every day of your life, 'share his opinions', exchange ideas. At the same time, you may have no conception of his possession of certain knowledge and even of his capacity to pass it on if the conditions are correct.
dnu3 | He may not seem an enigma to you; but he may be as deeply concealed as anything on earth.
dsty | The conception that one knows all about a person because of shared experiences and the exchange of confidences is not a true one. It is based upon the misconception that people cannot avoid communicating whatever they are discussing with one another.
ci0z | Knowledge does not automatically 'brush off, any more than it can be transmitted by words alone; neither is it to be conveyed by training of any ordinary kind.
sban | You cannot, therefore, learn real knowledge merely by associat- ing with someone who has it - especially if you do not even know that it is there, and if you are not focussed correctly to learn.
hy6w | Someone or something has first to impart to you how to perceive the presence of knowledge. Without preparation there can be no teaching.
wlk5 | As to the need of the Teacher, the great teacher Jami in his Lawaih says (Essay XXI) 'The Absolute does not stand in need of the relative, except for its manifestation, but the relative needs the Absolute for its very existence.' Similarly, the teacher is to be regarded as more important than the student in the situation of learning.
ais9 | That is to say, the Teacher is so to be regarded by the learner. The Teacher himself may regard the learner as more important, but that is a matter for the Teacher, and there is no point dis- cussing his attitudes when the conversation is about learning and not teaching.
cdkq | Remarks upon the Matter of the Dervish Path
ajvs | Q: Can you give us a number of outstanding points which should be studied by those interested in the Dervish, the Sufi, Path? How do the miracles attributed to Sufis come about?
mwef | I. The human environment produces certain subtle changes in the individual which penetrate his whole being. Instead of under- going only these changes, man has a chance to gain access to a form of self which is, by comparison, infinitely superior. To use the technical term: he is at present 'only half awake'.
k8pl | II. This change, although it increases man's awareness of his destiny, does not interfere with his ordinary human relationships. On the contrary, it enriches them.
04f6 | III. In order to take part in this process, there has to be the coincidence of a teacher with the doctrine, the application of the doctrine in a way suited to the pupils; and the right environ- mental circumstances. Nothing less than all these factors will do.
3nhr | IV. One way of rendering the message given here is that there is a deeper truth, and a wider dimension, in which man already partly lives, though he is ordinarily indifferent to it. There is the hope that he can become as aware of it as he is of the familiar world.
4hg2 | V. The self-realisation of this dimension enables a man or woman to attain heights of achievement in the easily-perceptible world and in other areas; and prevents him from becoming the tool of a mere conditional existence, with all its anxieties and ultimate meaninglessness. Man tends to be unhappy not because of what he knows, but because of what he does not know.
v0rl | VI. It is only through the attunement of a group of people, each with the possibility of this attainment, correctly harmonised into a true community (whether physically in contact or otherwise) that
8iyl | true understanding and the next step in human progress can come. VII. The unity and integration of this group are essential to in- dividual as well as collective success. In fact almost the only opportunity for man to realise his individual importance is through the support of a group of suitable people.
asz3 | VIII. This doctrine and the manner of its application have been known and propagated from time immemorial. They are, in fact, the property and destiny of man. They link with a past in which this development was much more widely known, through a present where it has fallen into disuse except for a few, to a future in which The Great Work will be the entire legitimate goal of man- kind.
salu | IX. The New Man', 'The Real Man', 'The Perfected Man' are all terms used in different formulations, throughout the ages, for this activity, which has been called 'secret', 'hidden' or 'initiatory' for reasons other than people realise.
v78z | People are interested in miracles, when they would do better to be interested in Truth. Miracles are by-products or else part of the special extradimensional activity in which certain people are involved. This involvement is because they acquire added functions with every addition of knowledge or capacity, just as in ordinary education but in this case in its own realm.
f0em | An example, among many thousands, of the activity which is carried on by extra-sensory perception in Sufi service shows how 'miracles' are linked with duty. Ibn Arabi in his Ruh al-Quds, tells how one evening he felt an urge to go to see Abu-Abdullah al- Khayyat ('The Tailor') of Seville, and made his way a fair distance to see him. Al-Khayyat said: 'Why were you so long? You have something with you which I need'. Ibn Arabi took the five dirhams which he had in his pocket and gave them to him. The other Sufi told him that he had need of the money for a certain poor man called Ali al-Salawi.
c3sz | Meetings, Groups, Classes
bghr | Q: There is great interest in meetings, groups and classes. Are these forms the aims of Sufi teaching?
fdud | A: People who do not understand how higher teachings operate, or who have been trained to think in a shallow manner about them, are naturally confused when they meet written and spoken materials which do not fit into their preconceived patterns.
8191 | Nowhere is this more strikingly evidenced than in the matter of communication and relationships.
k3he | After hearing a few hundred people explain how they feel, after reading a few dozen letters from 'seekers', even a machine would surely see the pattern of shallow assumption upon which even the most ardent of this type allow themselves to work.
lze6 | People who live in approximately the same area think that they should be grouped together, willy-nilly. People who are not of a mind to read books agitate for 'personal contact'. People who live in distant places crave travels, visits, materials to devour. People with whom you have been out of formal contact become distressed, bitter, interested in sources of readier gratification. People jealously (if unconsciously) cherish the 'cult of the Centre', whose distin- guishing mark is the belief that 'If I could only go to such-and- such a place all would be well.'
c1ys | Virtually none of these people has any true concept of how a real community comes into being, how it develops, how its local manifestations are working, what its future might be-how they could benefit from what is being done.
1tyf | If you circularise people with details of how a local class or group is run, they all want to be in a local class or group. It is just like mentioning a lollipop to a child: it may have been think- ing about something else, but this key-word can possess its think- ing mechanism to the exclusion of everything else.
ktwv | For a moment, as an exercise, transpose this situation into some other field, and you will see that such behaviour is so primi-
0yl7 | tive, so crude, so unfortunately wasteful of energy, or understand- ing, of everything, that it is obvious that something has to be done for such people. Anyone prone to such behaviour-patterns is in no position to benefit from any higher knowledge at that point. He is, however, a suitable prey for one or other of the people or bodies which offer instant assuagement of tensions by going along with the individual's infantile behaviour.
