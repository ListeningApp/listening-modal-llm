        "content": "m61y | After RNA replication starts, eukaryotic innate immune defenses that recognize positive RNA virus double-stranded RNA include RNA interference and multiple pattern recognition receptors. As expected from their structure, positive RNA virus replication complexes strongly sequester viral double-stranded RNA from interaction with such extravesicular factors. Innate immune responses thus might be initiated primarily from rare aberrant replication complexes whose misassembly or other defects render double-stranded RNAs accessible. Accordingly, treatments that increase defective replication complex production might greatly accelerate and stimulate innate immune responses. Intriguingly, crown components SARS-CoV nonstructural protein three and Chikungunya virus nonstructural protein one bind and antagonize innate immune recognition and signaling factors MDA5 and cGAS-STING, suggesting that viral crowns might provide active as well as passive defenses against innate immunity.\nu2ob | Five. Concluding Remarks\n2gnm | In just the past few years, the discovery of crowns in the replication complexes of several distinct viruses has begun to establish these intriguing, strategically placed complexes as critical features in the replication of many if not most positive RNA viruses. While the structure of these crowns is still being unraveled, their recognition is already providing foundations for resolving central questions of replication complex organization, assembly, and function that have been recognized for decades. The identification of crowns emerged from the convergence of revolutionary advances in molecular virology, cryo-EM imaging, and other areas, and these same trends promise accelerating future progress. Further structural and functional studies will undoubtedly provide important insights into multiple key mechanistic issues, many of which are posed above. In this age of heightened pandemic awareness, perhaps chief among these is how our increasing understanding of the machinery and functions of positive RNA virus genome replication and associated processes can best be translated into more effective and ideally more broadly active antiviral control strategies. Gratifyingly, emerging results already imply that dramatic new surprises and productive opportunities for research and applications will be in store as this exciting arena advances.\nemgw | Disclosure Statement\nxaqt | The authors are not aware of any affiliations, memberships, funding, or financial holdings that might be perceived as affecting the objectivity of this review.",
