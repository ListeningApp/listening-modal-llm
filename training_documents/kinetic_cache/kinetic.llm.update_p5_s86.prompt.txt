You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

4jmz | The apparent reduction rate constants <LATEX>k _ { \mathrm { a p p } } ^ { \mathrm { R e d } }</LATEX> were measured at <LATEX>p H = 1 , 3 ,</LATEX> and 5 at various applied potentials, thereby altering the driving force <LATEX>- \Delta G ^ { \circ } .</LATEX> The potential-dependent apparent rate constant of this interfacial ET/PCET system can be described by the MG theory, where the rate constant plateaus at a large driving force. Based on the experimentally measured <LATEX>p K _ { a }</LATEX> of the <LATEX>\mathrm { R u } ^ { \mathrm { I I I } }</LATEX> -OH2 complex attached to ITO, the mechanism was presumed to be ET at <LATEX>\mathrm { p H } = 1</LATEX> but PCET at <LATEX>p H = 3</LATEX> and 5. At low <LATEX>p H ,</LATEX> the axial ligand coordinated to Ru is <LATEX>H 2 O ,</LATEX> and therefore only ET is possible, but at higher pH, the ligand coordinated to Ru is OH , and ET is accompanied by proton transfer to the OH ligand to generate a water ligand. A weak pH dependence was observed for the overall process. When the <LATEX>p H</LATEX> increases from 3 to 5, the maximum rate constant only decreases by around 3-fold rather than decreasing 100-fold, as would be expected according to a model based on a single PCET pathway with <LATEX>\mathrm { H } _ { 3 } \mathrm { O } ^ { + }</LATEX> as the proton donor, or being pH-independent, as would be expected according to a model based on a single PCET pathway with H2O as the proton donor.19
b7cq | <LATEX>R u ^ { I I } - O H _ { 2 } .</LATEX> Here, we focus on the PCET process associated with the reduction of the <LATEX>\mathrm { R u } ^ { \mathrm { I I I } }</LATEX> catalyst37-44 attached to ITO. The two ET and two EPT channels, as well as Ox, OxH+, Red , and RedH for this process, are depicted in Figure 3. As no buffer solution was added in the experiments, the diagram in Figure 1 gives a complete set of the possible ET and EPT channels in this system, which is recreated using system-specific notation in Figure 4. The experimental rate constant was obtained by analyzing the absorbance change of the <LATEX>\mathrm { R u } ^ { \mathrm { I I } }</LATEX> catalyst (the product) as a function of time. In this system, the <LATEX>\mathrm { R u } ^ { \mathrm { I I I } }</LATEX> catalyst, which is the reactant, is generated by photoexcitation. The equilibrium assumption thus requires PT and complex association to be faster than ET and EPT. This assumption is reasonable for this system in the <LATEX>p H</LATEX> and potential range studied experimentally (see the SI). Note that the experimental measurement of the change in total concentration of the reduced species (i.e., the <LATEX>\mathrm { R u } ^ { \mathrm { I I } }</LATEX> catalyst) is consistent with our
0b39 | kinetic model, which tracks the total concentrations of the reduced and oxidized species.
qecd | Prior to analyzing the experimental data, we introduce certain physically motivated assumptions regarding the parameters. We can estimate the values of <LATEX>K _ { 1 }</LATEX> and <LATEX>K _ { 2 }</LATEX> using density functional theory (DFT) calculations in conjunction with the experimentally measured <LATEX>\mathrm { p } K _ { \mathrm { a } , \mathrm { O x } }</LATEX> and <LATEX>p K _ { \text { a } R e d } .</LATEX> These calculations lead to estimates of <LATEX>K _ { 1 } \approx 1 0 ^ { 0 . 2 }</LATEX> and <LATEX>K _ { 2 } < 1 0 ^ { 4 . 5 }</LATEX> (see the SI). Furthermore, since the potential-dependent rate constant can be well described by MG theory, the maximum rate constant has the same expression for both ET and
