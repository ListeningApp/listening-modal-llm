You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

h27a | Narrative interviews, in which the informants make sense of their experiences about the implementation of the client information system, are particularly useful as they allow the researchers the opportunity to explore beyond the implementation process as such. In addition, the hidden aspects, emotions and thoughts underlying the felt meanings and lived experiences that ordinary discourse sometimes fails to engage with can be addressed (Allen, 2017; Charmaz, 2006). The aim of the narrative interviews is to give voice, time and possibilities for the informants to express and reflect on their experiences about the studied phenomenon, connecting the past, present and future at the point of telling (Hyvärinen, 2016; Rossi, 2021). In practice, researcher asked open-ended questions so that the informants could reflect on and make sense of the experiences they have had and the expectations they hold to provide examples of situations where experiences took place and how they acted, felt and thought about what has happened (Charmaz, 2006; Hyvärinen, 2016).
pdjh | The phenomenon-driven, interpretive analysis was aimed at gaining understanding about how the professionals justified their actions, decisions and choices
xmgs | in their everyday work about the usage and implementation of the new information system. Therefore, a five-step coding scheme was utilized to systematically describe the meaning of the qualitative data (Gläser & Laudel, 2013; Rossi, 2021):
bd9h | 1. In the first data-driven step of the analysis process, the relevant and meaningful passages from the transcribed data are marked to capture the meaning of the told experiences.
m047 | 2. These meaningful passages are paraphrased in the second step, staying close to the original expressions of the informants in order to ensure data-driven analysis.
gy8c | 3. In the third step, the third-level categories are formed by summarizing similar paraphrases. This step can also be regarded as clustering the meanings of the relevant paraphrases. Maintaining the informants' original experiences without interpretation is crucial at this step of the analysis process.
y4mj | 4. In the fourth step the second-level categories are generated by clustering the third- level categories based on their similarities. In this step, theoretically informed concepts can be utilized to interpret and understand the lived experience.
vpgq | 5. The fifth and final step is structuring the recently formulated second-level categories under the first-level categories. In this step, the theoretical concepts suitable for explaining the phenomena and experiences play an important role, and the process progresses from a data-driven to a theory-driven analysis. Yet, instead of testing theories, this step focuses on understanding the experiences related to the phenomena under study and through this, exploring what may be helpful to further develop the theoretical and analytical framework.
ousl | Altogether, 148 third-level categories, 22 second-level categories, and finally, six first- level categories were formed during the analysis.
m4ju | Table 1. An example of the categorization related to the first-level category "lack of knowledge and practical relevance".
a0mb | Ensuring the interaction and engaging with the clients (guided the ways the IS was used in practice) IS helps to govern the workload IS is too complicated Terminology of the IS should derive from social services Operational logic of the IS and access to information is dependent on the organizational structures and work roles (makes the multi- actor collaboration difficult and causes delays in everyday work) Data Protection Act limits the use of IS in practice
ki8m | Table 2. First and second-level categories
km8w | In practice, data analysis is always an iterative process alternating between data, analysis and theorizing (Cunliffe & Coupland, 2011; Eisenhardt, 1989; Strauss & Corbin, 1998). To conclude, the research approach relies on the interpretation of experiences of the professionals about the implementation of the new information system and the ability of the case study to identify the being as the logics and mechanisms of institutional arrangements (the ontological dimension) behind the doing as the observed action (the epistemological dimension).
wzno | Results
xagm | Next, we will explore how the professionals experienced the implementation and usage of the new patient information system. The findings reveal that (1) lack of knowledge and practical relevance created uncertainty about how to use the IS in practice; (2) unlearning old practices and operational logic of the previously used IS was seen difficult; (3) attitudes, beliefs and lack of support guided the street-level bureaucrats' expectations towards the implementation process; (4) implementation happened individually during the everyday work practices; (5) ensuring the interaction and engaging with the clients guided the ways street-level bureaucrats used IS in practice; and (6) technical, organizational and institutional aspects affected the implementation process.
iwn5 | Lack of knowledge and practical relevance (created uncertainty about how to use the IS in practice)
uooz | When remembering the time prior to the implementation, the street-level workers recognized a need to familiarize oneself with the IS to reduce uncertainty. They had experienced uncertainty because they did not know what to expect from the new technology. The fear was that they lacked knowledge and skills to use the IS in practice, causing hesitation and negative interpretations about the new IS. In addition, the street- level workers were worried that the IS would be too heavily reliant to the logic of healthcare services.
pxbq | Just because we were the first group [who implemented the new IS in social services] and none of us knew. There was not, what the second and third groups have, that they already know that someone has used it and that they have survived, and we will also survive ... We didn't know what to expect ... although we had used the test system at the trainings, but then, it is just not the same than using the actual system. (H2).
jfsr | There was a time gap between the training sessions and the actual implementation of the new IS. The version of the IS used at the training sessions was not completed, causing frustration and lack of trust towards the IS. To ensure the practical relevance of the trainings, the street-level workers emphasized a need to get accustomed with the features and functions of the IS which is eventually implemented. After the training the IS was developed further. Thus, the workers were expecting the implementation with hesitation and even fear. When the implementation finally took place after several months, the IS
u15r | seemed difficult due to the changes made, and because the street-level workers had already forgotten what they had learned.
lq35 | Overall, the street-level workers' experience was that the training sessions were too abstract, and it was, for them, difficult to understand how they would be using the new IS in practice during their everyday work. Thus, the training sessions lacked practical relevance which would have fostered the implementation and usage of the IS. Looking back at the time of the interviews, the street-level workers stated that they lacked motivation to learn the IS at the training sessions.
3g9w | Unlearning old practices and operational logic (of the previously used IS was seen difficult)
d09o | Prior and also during the implementation, the comparison of the operational logics of the old and new IS' caused uncertainty and frustration among the street-level workers. The workers wondered whether the newly recruited staff was in a better position because they did not have expertise about the previously used IS and, therefore, learning to use the new IS would be easier for them. Thus, without experience of the previous systems there is no need to unlearn old practices.
ylhz | A: I think that it might just be that ... when you have used a certain system for tens of years, it is then difficult to give up, like I said that it [the old IS] affected even the language they used and the ways one made sense of their work. And this relates to the old IS.
a3td | Q: It [the implementation] might have been more difficult for those who have unlearned the old ...?
ex5k | A: Yes. Versus me who came in as a new and takes over the new IS. (H7)
9d4o | The overall impression was that the previously used IS did not guide the work practices, were much more simplistic and, thus, easier to use because workers knew where to find the information needed and how to navigate the system. Due to this simplicity, the previous information systems were also seen as outdated.
cjq2 | Our old system was, like, really old [laughs] and really simple. You couldn't do anything with it, like there were perhaps three things that you could do there. It was really simple. And this was a good and bad thing about it, of course. And what was difficult at least for me was that Apotti was so versatile, even too
5esx | versatile. We were told over and over again that one cannot make too big a mistake there even when you would not do things in a certain way. Yet somehow, when you were accustomed with the previous, like, there was only one way of doing things because the old system did not proceed if you did not tick a box. (H5)
m5ka | The street-level workers emphasized that the differences between the IS' operational logics created a need to unlearn old and to learn new practices and ways of working. For them, it was difficult to give up on the previously learnt practices and therefore the implementation of the new IS was difficult; the street-level workers knew how to use the previous system but not how to operate with the new, more up-to-date and nuanced IS.
byu8 | It was like 'this is impossible, this system, it's impossible to learn how to use it and only if we could still use the previous system, and this we did not need to do in the old system ... ' We felt that the menus were difficult and where is everything, and we kind of got stuck to these little details like ... 'what is this, I cannot get pass this because I don't know what to click or, where do I find this and that, or how do I start to get accustomed with the view which has these different options', like this kind of basic stuff. (H1)
76b0 | In addition, the new IS was based on different terminology than the previously used information system. Even after the implementation, the street-level workers had noticed that the terminology and commands used in the previous IS were still used, guiding the practices of their everyday work. They stated that this was one source of frustration and confusion; people were still using the outdated terminology to make sense of and to help others in their everyday work.
zxz6 | Attitudes, beliefs and lack of support (guided the implementation process)
xnth | Prior to the implementation, negative atmosphere among the street-level workers affected their attitudes and beliefs towards the implementation process and the new IS. The street- level workers admitted that this negative atmosphere towards the new IS caused difficulties for both learning and development of the system. Partially, the negative interpretations about the new IS were created and strengthened by the news media, impacting the street-level workers' motivation and willingness to use and to further develop the IS.
vafm | And perhaps, I feel that the negative views about Apotti is due to news media also, like what I have seen is that the news, which might not have anything to do with Apotti, but the headlines scream Apotti and something [laughs] negative after it, it is quite funny for me because I have used the system since the implementation and it troubles me that this ready-made negative atmosphere does not help, I mean that the employees have these negative attitude beforehand towards the system. It's a shame. (H4)
2zmw | The street-level workers were worried about how the new IS would change their work and its practices. All in all, the uncertainty experienced about the new IS as well as worries that would their own skills be sufficient affect the street-level workers attitudes towards new IS. The uncertainty about one's capabilities as a learner, fear of mistakes as well as lack of courage and skills sustained the negative attitudes towards the implementation. The street-level workers' impression was that a successful implementation of the new IS required technical skills, curiosity towards the new and unknown as well as courage to try-and-possibly-fail when using the IS in practice. Curiosity and courage were needed mostly because the street-level workers felt that the operational logic of the new IS was profoundly different to the ones they had previously used, and at the implementation phase the street-level workers' focus was heavily on questioning the operational logic of the IS. In addition, they did not feel that they had possibilities to influence this operational logic, which made it difficult to accept the change causing frustration. Using and testing the new IS in practice, thus, required skills and courage to try, and those street-level workers who felt that they lacked the skills needed, were hesitating to use the IS and feared that they would make mistakes: "I noticed that people are extremely cautious with Apotti, there are all kinds of arrows and stuff, yet people are afraid to open or click those, people are super cautious to utilize all that you could do with it [the IS]. "(H5)
bf9k | The street-level worker's own positive attitude towards new technology and learning was seen as a crucial aspect of a successful implementation process. They relied extensively on the individual's capabilities, attitude and willingness in learning to use the new IS and technology in general. Indeed, the implementation was not difficult for all street-level workers, and those who were both interested in technology and had a positive attitude towards learning were more positive towards the implementation: "And somehow, this colleague said that it [the implementation] is not a big deal for her, it's like
otkr | starting a new job where you have a new system that you need to learn, it was not that big of a deal to many." (H3) In addition, street-level workers' attitude towards the new IS, its implementation and their own capability to learn were more positive when they had already had previous experiences of successful implementation processes or had previously learnt to use different information systems.
ibgs | When the new IS had been in use for a while - approximately one and a half years by the time of the interviews - the street-level workers had noticed a change in attitudes and beliefs towards the IS: " I think that people only noticed Apotti's positive aspects after using it for some time, when I was in the middle of the chaos in the beginning, the talk was really negative and people got stuck to the negativity." (H1) When they had incrementally learnt to use the new IS in practice, the attitudes were more positive, and the IS had become a common tool for their everyday work. Changes in the attitudes from criticism towards acceptance had clearly benefitted the implementation process. However, this change in attitudes took time.
colo | Although leaning extensively towards the individual workers' attitudes and their capabilities to learn, the street-level workers talked only little about the role of their managers. This absence of managerial impact for the implementation process is something worth reflecting; was the lack of support from the managers on how to use the IS in practice influencing the street-level workers' ability to successfully implement the new IS?
d6r4 | And it was just bypassed [by the managers] like, 'don't use it, then as long as you do something'. Or that you don't need to use it. Or just try ... this was the conversation. And of course, if you give your employees the possibility that they can do something difficult if they want to, then obviously they won't do that and will use the easier way, Perhaps in some units the managers have stated more clearly that this is how we do things, everyone does like this, and there are no other options. And when people start doing it, that is when you learn, and it becomes a routine. (H5)
9mrz | Importantly, the street-level workers lacked understanding about the IS' usage for statistical and reporting purposes, and they felt that it was the managers' responsibility to ensure that these requirements were sufficiently met. Thus, managerial support and vision about how to implement the new technology in practice was lacking and called after.
pk06 | Implementation happened individually (during the everyday work practices)
7wn9 | The implementation was done during the street-level workers' everyday work with the clients. Due to their busy schedules, learning to use the new IS along with the everyday work felt difficult. The street-level workers felt that there was no time for them to focus on really understanding how the IS operates. Instead of fully understanding the operational logic, the time restrictions limited the use of the IS only to the crucial features necessary for everyday work practices.
