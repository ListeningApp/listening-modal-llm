        "content": "ywwr | Using transient absorption spectroscopy and monitoring the recovery of the MLCT absorption of the R u two plus complex, the interfacial ET and PCET reaction kinetics were quantified from pH zero point seven to six point eight. The kinetics as a function of the applied potential for the reaction at each pH are provided in Figure seven C, and a plot of the maximum rate constant for the PCET reaction as a function of pH is shown in Figure seven D. For pH less than five, we observed the same behavior as in our previous study. The K subscript a p p left parenthesis E right parenthesis curves for pH greater than three are shifted toward lower potentials compared to the curve for pH equals zero point seven. For the maximum rate constant, the value at pH equals three point one zero is similar to that at pH equals zero point seven, and a weak decrease is observed in the pH range of three to five. On the other hand, the K subscript a p p left parenthesis E right parenthesis curves for pH equals six point six three is right on top of the curve at pH equals five point eight nine, indicating pH independence in this pH range. The plot of K subscript m a x comma a p p also levels off when pH is greater than five. These experimental observations provide validation for our model prediction that the apparent maximum PCET rate constant will become pH-independent at higher\n0i6j | pH. CONCLUSIONS\n87cq | In this paper, we developed a multichannel kinetic model to describe the pH dependence of PCET reactions. The apparent standard potential and apparent rate constant can be expressed as functions of the mole fractions of different forms of the reactant (i.e., the protonated and deprotonated forms), which in turn depend on pH. We derived the general expressions for the apparent rate constants of both homogeneous and electrochemical PCET reactions and the specific expressions corresponding to Butler-Volmer and Marcus-Gerischer kinetics. The power of this model is that the multiple competing channels encompass both sequential and concerted mechanisms and, in contrast to common square schemes, the possibility of more than one proton donor and acceptor.\n0qs3 | We also applied this model to the light-initiated electro- chemical reduction of an ITO-attached Ru-based water oxidation catalyst and explained the experimentally observed weak pH dependence of the maximum rate constant for pH between one and five. Our analysis indicates that the hydronium ion is not directly involved in a concerted PCET reaction involving proton transfer from the hydronium to a hydroxide axial ligand upon reduction of the ruthenium center. Instead, our analysis suggests that the dominant channels are either ET, where the axial ligand is water, or PCET via an ETPT mechanism, where reduction of the ruthenium is followed quickly by protonation of the hydroxide axial ligand. At low pH, the dominant channel is ET, whereas at higher pH, the mechanism becomes PCET via the ETPT mechanism. The observed pH dependence arises from the intrinsic difference between the rate constants of these two channels and the dependence of their relative contributions, as determined by the reactant mole fractions, on pH. Our model also predicts that the maximum rate constant will become pH-independent at higher pH. This prediction was confirmed by our experiments for this water oxidation catalyst attached to ITO\nz8f7 | by siloxane anchor groups, where the maximum rate constant is clearly pH-independent at pH greater than five.\n7w7j | Although this specific model is consistent with the experimental data and its prediction was validated, we cannot rule out the possibility that other models might yield similar results. In particular, the assumption of a potential-dependent pKa,Ox has not been verified on an ITO surface. In addition, our calculations assumed that the rate constants can be described by MG theory and that the electronic coupling is the same for the ET two, EPT one, and EPT two channels. The association equilibrium constants and reorganization energies were computed with DFT methods that also introduce some assumptions. As further experimental data become available, we will refine the assumptions used to determine the fundamental quantities as well as further test the model itself.\n51vd | This general multichannel model for describing the kinetics of both homogeneous and electrochemical PCET reactions will have widespread applications. For each system, all relevant reaction channels must be identified. Then, a combination of computational and experimental data can be used to determine the various equilibrium constants and intrinsic rate constants or, in some cases, reasonable ranges for them. Within the framework of this multichannel model, analysis of the dominant forms of the redox species and the dominant channels as a function of pH will provide a deeper mechanistic understanding of PCET reactions.\nbaj1 | ASSOCIATED CONTENT\nn1wo | AUTHOR INFORMATION\n5bq3 | Corresponding Author\nezla | This material is based on work solely supported as part of the Center for Hybrid Approaches in Solar Energy to Liquid Fuels, an Energy Innovation Hub funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences under award number D E dash S C zero zero two one one seven three.
