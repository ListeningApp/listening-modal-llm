You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

yhb2 | And there is another, Himalayan block, which we scarcely consider. It is that for 2,000 years the West has been under a most terrible tyranny, the Christian religion. (I am aware that at this point, readers are sighing, thinking vaguely, 'How very nineteenth century.') But it was, historically speaking, an extremely short time ago. I have met people who came into conflict with the churches, when all they wanted was to opt out of certainties and dogma into agnosticism. Wives and husbands left them, they lost jobs, were socially ostracised, were cast off from families - and went to the colonies. There I met them, as a child. Now the churches have a benevolent, harmless aspect, half social agency, half genial bully; they cajole people into thinking that they really have to be born again, or belong to something or other. But for 2,000 years we were kept in a mental straitjacket, and even the most limited rebellion was horribly punished. Luther's was limited. He said, I insist on the right to talk with God directly, without the mediation of the church. He did not say, For many thousands of years
4f8w | there have been people in this world who have had the techniques, the information, to enable those with sufficient preparation to make use of these tools, to achieve states of mind, or of spirit, that the churches know nothing about. (But at this point I have to make it clear that Sufism respects all religions, saying that the Truth is at the core of each. It is the tyrant, benevolent or wicked, who has to be exposed.) What I would like to know is this: how is it that, underrandina that our culture has had two millennia of a certain kind of indoctrination, we, our scientists, are not researching the effects on our mental processes? For these effects are there; once you begin thinking on these lines, they are very evident. It is as if the ban, the ukase, the no of the churches into thinking about, for instance, what Jesus and his associates were really thinking (for the Sufis claim Jesus as one of the real Teachers of mankind, whose message has been obliterated by institutions) had been absorbed into the very stuff of our minds, making it impossible for us to look in certain directions.
vusg | And this no can operate in the minds of scientists as strongly as in anyone's.
zde4 | What I am sketchily, inadequately, outlining here is a whole series of blocks and impediments that amount to a mental prison. Well, the Sufis say we live in such a prison, and it is their concern to give us the equipment to free ourselves. We are all conditioned, as we now claim so easily and trippingly; but perhaps being able to say that it is not enough to enable us to see how.
5dpg | If we want to approach the Sufis, their ways of looking at life, at some point it is necessary to swallow the unpalatable fact that they think of us as backward, barbarian, ill-equipped, ill-informed, and primitive, with closed minds in areas where it is vital to our futures that we open them.
