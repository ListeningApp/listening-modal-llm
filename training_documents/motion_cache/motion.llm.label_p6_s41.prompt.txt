You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

gc7v | V. Equation Sets Comparison
wqfv | A. Reference Mission Scenario
j30a | To assess and compare the accuracy of the derived equation sets, we considered a reference target orbit inspired by the HLEPP study [10,11]. The study considers a human-assisted robotic mission on the lunar surface, where rovers are tele-operated by astronauts on board a station in lunar orbit, the DSG. Access to the station by vehicles incoming from both the Earth and the lunar surface is one of the most critical aspects of the mission. The study of the relative dynamics for this scenario, and the design of maneuvers for rendezvous and docking with the DSG will provide a step forward in the overall mission design.
7bdk | The candidate family of orbits for the DSG is the Earth-Moon L1 NRHO [10,22,23]. An example of NRHO belonging to the south subfamily is shown in Fig. 3. The orbit was provided by ESA.
fim0 | In Fig. 3 the region of the orbit suitable for rendezvous, as suggested by [10,11], is highlighted. To identify the rendezvous region, the mean anomaly of the NRHO must be introduced:
ojro | M(1)=2m-
l6t9 | where, in analogy to the Keplerian orbits, t is the time from the periselene passage, and T is the orbit period. For the orbit in Fig. 3, the average period is T = 6.9867d. The periselene is defined as the point where the orbit crosses the x-z plane of the Moon frame .M closest to the Moon, whereas the aposelene is defined as the point crossing the same plane farthest from the Moon. The analysis of the stable and central manifolds of the orbit as a function of the mean anomaly was used in [10,11] to identify the recommended rendezvous region M € [80°, 280°]. In this region the existence of the central manifolds enables the design of hovering or station keeping trajectories that can be exploited in the waiting for the clearance for the final approach.
1ujy | B. Simulations Setup
qzor | The equation sets defined in Sec. IV.C were tested and compared, in order to assess their accuracy for different initial spacecraft separations.
a0by | Spacecraft motion was simulated according to the ER3BP. The reference scenario discussed in Sec. V.A was used as a benchmark, and the presented NRHO orbit was chosen for selecting target initial states with respect to the Moon.

87vz | The three simplified equation sets previously defined, namely, the ELERM, the CNERM, and the CLERM, were implemented in MATLAB/Simulink 2014b. The ENERM set was not included in the comparison because for the ER3BP it corresponds to the exact description of the relative motion. Two relative motion equation sets based on the two-body problem were also considered, in order to understand their applicability to restricted three-body scenarios:

6tbv | Two different Monte Carlo simulations were performed to assess the accuracy of the equation sets. The distance test analyzes the accuracy as the initial relative separation increases. In particular, for each target initial condition, a given number of relative distances were chosen. For each one, a random initial relative position vector with norm equal to the chosen distance was computed, and the equation sets were propagated. Relative velocity was kept fixed to zero for all the simulations. Conversely, in the speed test a set of initial relative speed was chosen, and associated relative velocity vectors were generated randomly. In both tests, target initial conditions were chosen in terms of mean anomaly M along the NRHO orbit. The equation sets were tested over an interval of 12 h. MATLAB solver settings are listed in Table 1. Monte Carlo test parameters are given in Table 2.

bl28 | C. Distance Test Results
d5bz | The results of the distance test are shown in Figs. 4-6. The ELERM is the most accurate set, with a position error in the order of the meter for almost all the simulated conditions. The CR3BP assumption introduces a significant error, as can be seen com- paring the position error of ELERM and CNERM in Fig. 4. In particular, the position error is in the order of the meter only for initial relative distances lower than few kilometers. The linearization of the CNERM does not introduce a great difference in the results, except for target initial conditions near the perise- lene. This difference can be observed comparing the values of the error index near the mean anomalies M = 0 and M = 360° in Figs. 6b and 6c.

mov9 | Fig. 10 Average position error ep in the rendezvous zone for the CR3BP-based equation sets.
ks7m | The two-body-based equations perform worse than the other sets for all the analyzed initial conditions. However, LERM equations show an acceptable error in the order of the meter when the target starts its motion far from the periselene, for initial mean anomalies M € [10°, 280°].
w1w1 | All the equation sets showed good accuracy in terms of relative velocities, with values of speed errors always below the meter per second, except for large separations in the case of two-body-based equation set (in particular for initial distances above 10 km, with target starting its motion near the periselene).
h8gv | D. Speed Test Results
kwkp | The aim of this test is the analysis of the equations accuracy when the initial relative velocity is not zero, as in the distance test. The results are presented in Figs. 7-9.
yj0m | The ELERM confirmed their higher accuracy compared with the other sets. The CR3BP assumption produces a significant growth in both the position and velocity errors, though in the latter case remain acceptable (below the meter for almost all the tested conditions). Again, there are no significant differences between the CNERM and the CLERM sets.
ewfp | The two-body-based equation sets showed the worst accuracy, in both position and velocity computation. In particular, for all the test conditions, the position error is above 100 m for the LERM, and above 1 km for the Hill's equations.
oczy | The analysis of the error index v surfaces in Fig. 9 confirms the overall higher accuracy of the ELERM, with respect to the other equation sets.

his3 | E. General Remarks
m50z | 1. Applicability of CR3BP at the Aposelene
me84 | From the analysis of the position accuracy of the equation sets based on the CR3BP assumption, Figs. 6b, 6c, 7b, and 7c, a region can be found at the aposelene, where the error is small enough to provide a reliable estimation of the chaser relative state. This is highlighted in Fig. 10, where the average position error for the distance and speed tests is evaluated in the rendezvous zone. In the distance test the position error at the aposelene is less than a centimeter for distances below 100 m; see Figs. 10a and 10b. In the speed test, at the aposelene the position error is of the order of the meter for relative speeds below 0.1 m/s. Therefore, CNERM and CLERM equation sets are suitable for relative guidance system design for terminal rendezvous at the aposelene. In particular, CLERM equations are appealing for the design of classical robust controllers due to their linear nature and the reduced number of time- varying parameters, which are the target position with respect to the Moon and the LVLH angular velocity and acceleration vectors. These parameters can be modeled as bounded uncertainties, defined by a prior analysis of their values around the aposelene. Because of the reduced target velocity at the aposelene, the parameters' rate of change will be limited and robust control techniques can be successfully applied.
o56m | 2. Linearization Error
slz6 | The effects of the linearization are evident near the periselene. Considering, for instance, the distance test, the error index v at the periselene is larger for the linearized sets ELERM and CLERM than for the nonlinear set CNERM; see Figs. 6a-6c. In Fig. 11 the values of
