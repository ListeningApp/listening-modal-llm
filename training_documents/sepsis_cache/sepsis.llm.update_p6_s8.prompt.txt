You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

rzhj | Participants randomized to therapeutic warming had lower 28-day mortality than those in the control group (18% vs 43%; absolute risk reduction, 25%; 95% CI, -48 to -2; Fig. 3). Post hoc adjustment of the 28-day mortality outcome for enrollment SOFA score revealed similar effect of treatment group allocation (adjusted odds ratio, 0.151; 95% CI, 0.029-0.789). They also had more 28-day hospital-free days (2.6 d; 95% CI, 0-11.6 d). There were no differences between 28-day ventilator-free days or the 48-hour delta-SOFA score. Secondary infec- tions were common (30%), but they were not different between the two groups (Table 2).
bfax | Safety Outcomes
f2y8 | Participants randomized to therapeutic warm- ing had similar vaso- pressor doses and vital signs during their inter- vention period compared to control participants (Supplemental Fig. 2, http://links.lww.com/ CCM/H35). A predeter- mined safety stopping point for an increase in
o7qm | vasopressor dose was reached in two participants (7%) leading to termination of warming, but the same vasopressor criterion was met in four control partici- pants (14%). No participants met the predetermined stopping rules for HR or respiratory rate.
d52l | DISCUSSION
qlbb | In this pilot randomized controlled trial, we dem- onstrated that therapeutic hyperthermia in afebrile critically ill patients with sepsis was feasible, but we
nhsg | did not observe a difference in monocyte HLA-DR expression, induced IFN-y production, or lympho- penia. We also did not observe more adverse events in the therapeutic hyperthermia group. We did, how- ever, observe decreased mortality and increased 28-day hospital-free days in the group that under- went therapeutic hyperthermia. These are important observations because they suggest there may be a clinical benefit of this treatment, although the bio- logical mechanism and replicability in a larger trial remain unknown.
hy0l | The risk of hypothermia and the survival benefit of fever in patients with sepsis are well described (2-8, 45). A meta-analysis of observational studies cited a pooled estimate of a 47% mortality in hypothermic patients with sepsis versus 22% mortality in those with fever (6). While the control group mortality in our trial was high, it tracks closely with the mortality observed in prior cohorts of afebrile critically ill sepsis patients (2-5). Perhaps more compelling, participants allocated to therapeutic hyperthermia experienced a mortality that was more closely aligned with expected mortality in fe- brile sepsis patients (2-6). Studies of antipyretic therapy in sepsis have demonstrated little benefit (46, 47). A single trial of external cooling in febrile sepsis patients showed reduced vasopressor doses and lower early mortality in febrile patients cooled to normo- thermia (48), but these findings were not replicated in a subsequent randomized trial (49). The inflammatory cascade, cytokine expression, and transcription factors in febrile sepsis patients are likely different from afe- brile sepsis patients, and having experienced fever may confer benefit to immunocompetent sepsis patients that cannot be undone with cooling.
4jmz | The mechanism through which therapeutic hyper- thermia may have affected clinical outcomes in this study is unclear. Previous data have demonstrated that, compared to afebrile patients with sepsis, febrile patients had a greater increase in monocyte HLA-DR early after sepsis diagnosis (9), suggesting a lower
