## CARBONATED BEVERAGES AFFECT LEVELS OF ANDROGEN RECEPTOR AND TESTOSTERONE SECRETION IN MICE

Objectives. This work aimed to study the influences of carbonated beverages on the testis growth and the expression levels of androgen receptor of mice.

Methods. Two experimental groups of thirty mice each PEP-one and PEP-two drank fifty percent and one hundred percent Pepsi-Cola, respectively for fifteen days. Other two experimental groups of thirty mice each COC-one and COC-two drank fifty percent and one hundred percent Coca- Cola, respectively for fifteen days. The control group of thirty mice drank water. Bilateral testes were harvested aseptically on days zero, five, seven, ten, thirteen and fifteen. Real-time PCR and Western blot were implemented to detect levels of androgen receptor mRNA and protein in testis tissues.

Results. Testes masses of PEP-two, COC-one and COC-two were greater than those of PEP-one and control group. On day fifteen, testis longitudinal diameter of carbonated beverages-treated mice was increased as compared to control group. Testis longitudinal diameter, testes transverse diameters and androgen receptor proteins levels of PEP-two and COC-two were increased in comparison with control group. Serum testosterone concentrations of PEP-two were higher than that of COC-one and control group. Levels of androgen receptor mRNAs of four carbonated beverages-treated mice were increased by sixty point eighteen percent, sixty-seven point twenty-six percent, sixty-five point ninety-three percent and seventy-eight point seventy-six percent.

Conclusions. A high concentration of Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola could raise testis longitudinal diameter and testis transverse diameter, enhance testosterone secretion, and increase serum epidermal growth factor concentrations.


## INTRODUCTION

Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola are two main carbonated beverages drunk by numerous consumers over the world. Carbonated beverages consumption may lead to obesity, cardiovascular diseases and type two diabetes mellitus. Carbonated beverages increased weight body of rats after consuming over one year. Epidemiologic studies evaluated the association between caffeine and fertility, which indicated that health damage effects of carbonated beverages on adolescents and children

GENERAL ENDOCRINOLOGY

were serious. Previous studies also suggested that carbonated beverages affected fertility. Massive consumption of coffee or caffeine increased testosterone production. Coca-Cola could induce incidence of malignant mammary tumors in Sprague-Dawley rat. However, many reports were questionnaire and prospective investigations based on the local populations in a region. Some reports even showed the opposite. So far there has been little documentation regarding correlation between carbonated beverages consumption and reproduction function and fertility in humans and animals. Carbonated beverages have been associated with alterations in estradiol and other hormones which may affect ovulation, the length of the follicular or luteal phase. The exact mechanisms that carbonated beverages affected the fertility are undetermined. Comparative experimental studies are scanty.

Our preliminary study showed that administration of Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola for twenty-five days could decrease ovaries mass, reduce the ovarian cortex thickness, as well as affect follicles development. Besides, Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola could inhibit burn repair and physics strength of the healed tissues of the burned rabbits. Therefore, drinking carbonated beverages may threaten reproductive success.

Androgens play an important role in sexual differentiation and secondary characteristics formation of the male mammals. Androgen exerts its physiological functions by combining its specific androgen receptor in target tissues. Testosterone, a crucial androgen, has an important role on forming puberty and maintain normal male libido. Currently, it remains undetermined whether long-term intake of carbonated beverages influences the synthesis and secretion of testosterone.

The present study aimed to investigate the effects of carbonated beverages, including Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola, on the testis development and expression levels of androgen receptor of mice, and also to provide scientific bases for the rational consumption of carbonated beverages, and prevent prostate dysfunction and cancer.


## MATERIALS AND METHODS

Animals

One hundred fifty non-copulating male mice, body weight of twenty point eighty-four plus or minus two point forty-five grams, were bought from Lanzhou University. They were allocated into five groups: Pepsi-Cola one, Pepsi-Cola two, Coca-Cola one, Coca-Cola two and the control group of thirty. Mice were raised in mice cages that were equipped with automatic water dispensers under the same conditions kept at thirty to fifty percent humidity and twenty-two to twenty-four degrees Celsius. Water was provided ad libitum. Mice were freely fed with daily ration feeds. Each mouse was weighed every day. The experiment was begun after an adaptation period of seven days.


## Animal treatments and sample collection

Pure Pepsi-Cola and Coca-Cola were purchased from the monopolized store; fifty percent Pepsi-Cola and Coca-Cola was prepared by releasing one liter of pure Coca- Cola or Pepsi-Cola with one liter of tap water. Mice in Pepsi-Cola one and Pepsi-Cola two drank freely fifty percent and pure one hundred percent Pepsi-Cola, respectively for consecutive fifteen days. Animals in Coca-Cola one and Coca-Cola two drank freely fifty percent and pure one hundred percent Coca-Cola, respectively for consecutive fifteen days. Mice in the control group drank freely tap water. Bilateral testes were aseptically collected from each mouse on days zero, five, seven, ten and fifteen, respectively. Blood was harvested from the jugular vein of each mouse killed by neck dislocation. Serum was isolated from blood by centrifugation at three thousand times g for ten minutes, and then stored at negative twenty degrees Celsius until analysis. Animal treatment was permitted by the Experiment Animal Care and Use Committee of Gansu province, China.


## Measurements of testis mass, testis longitudinal and transverse diameter

The mass of each testis was measured using an electronic balance. The average was determined on the basis of both left and right values. The extraneous tissues and fats on the testis surface were removed using sterile scissors. The testis longitudinal diameter and testis transverse diameter of each testis were accurately measured with a vernier caliper.


## Measurements of serum testosterone and epidermal growth factor

The contents of serum testosterone and epidermal growth factor were measured using the mice ELISA kit, as per instruction manual. The detection level was zero point forty picograms per milliliter. Each assay was done in triplicate.


## Determination of expression levels of androgen receptor mRNA

Total RNAs were extracted from the testis samples, then reversely transcribed into cDNA with the superscript first strand synthesis system for RT-PCR.

Appropriate primers of the androgen receptor were designed and synthesized. Only those primers showing dimmer-free reactions were used for further analysis.

The sequences of androgen receptor primers were forward primer: 5'-aagagacgaggaggcaggata-3' and reverse primer: 5'-gccgggaggtgctatgttag-3'; mouse beta-actin forward primer sequence: 5'-gtatgcctctggtcgtacca-3' and Reverse primer primer sequence: 5'-ttgctgacaggatgcagaag-3'; mouse glyceraldehyde-three-phosphate dehydrogenase forward primer sequence: 5'-cttcaacagcgacactcactct-3' and reverse primer sequence: 5'-ccaccaccctgttgctgta-3'. The expression level of androgen receptor mRNA was determined using qRT-PCR. The level of every group was assessed by the two-A A C T method and normalized to beta-actin of CG on day zero. Each sample was executed in triplicate.


## Western blot analysis of androgen receptor protein in testes

Western blot was performed so as to evaluate the expression levels of androgen receptor protein in testis tissues after Pepsi-Cola and Coca-Cola treatment. Summarily, the polyvinylidene fluoride membranes were incubated with Anti-AR antibody and beta-actin polyclonal antibodies at four degrees Celsius overnight, before being exposed to the appropriate secondary antibody for one hour. Monoclonal antibody of mouse anti-beta-actin was used as a control. The integrated optical densities of image bands were determined using Quantity One software. Expression of AR protein was measured as grey value ratio between target band and beta-actin band. The negative control was set without primary antibody.

Statistical analyses

All variables of three groups complied with the assumptions for a one-way A N O V A using S P S S version twenty point zero. Then, Tukey's post-hoc tests were done to compare pairwise differences after significant differences were identified. Significance level was

The testes weights of PEP-two, COC-one and COC- two were significantly increased on day fifteen as compared to PEP-one and CG. The outcomes demonstrated a high dose of Pepsi-Cola or Coca-Cola could promote testis growth and development.

Data in Table two showed that TLD values of four experimental groups were elevated as compared to CG on days ten and fifteen. TLDs of COC- two and PEP-two were significantly greater than that of CG. On day fifteen, TTD values of COC- two and PEP- two were also larger than that of CG, COC-one and PEP-one groups. The results indicated that higher doses of Pepsi-Cola and Coca-Cola could enhance the testis longitudinal and transverse diameter, and then they promoted testis growth of mice.

As shown in Figure one A, the concentrations of serum testosterone in all mice were enhanced after the Pepsi-Cola and Coca-Cola treatment. Serum testosterone concentration of PEP-two was higher than that of other four groups. On days ten and fifteen, there were significant differences between PEP- two and CG. Serum testosterone concentration of COC- two was also higher than that of CG. The outcomes indicated that high doses of Pepsi-Cola and Coca-Cola could improve testosterone secretion of male mice.

Data in Figure one B showed that the serum concentrations of epidermal growth factor of treatment groups were slightly increased as compared to CG on days ten and fifteen. EGF concentrations of PEP- two and COC- two were significantly higher than CG on day fifteen,. The results demonstrated a high dose of Pepsi-Cola and Coca-Cola could raise EGF activity.

Expression levels of AR mRNAs in mouse testes were detected using qRT-PCR so as to assess the effects on AR mRNAs. As shown in Figure two, expressions of AR mRNAs in four treatment groups were increased. On day fifteen, increments of COC-one, COC-two, PEP-one and PEP-two mice were sixty point eighteen percent, sixty-seven point twenty-six percent, sixty-five point ninety-three percent and seventy-eight point seventy-six percent on the bases of the CG level. Pepsi-Cola and Coca-Cola could enhance expressions of AR mRNAs in the testes of mice.

Expression levels of androgen receptor proteins in CBs-treated mice were increased in comparison with CG. On day fifteen, AR proteins levels of PEP-two and COC-two mice were increased as compared to CG. A high concentration of Pepsi-Cola and Coca-Cola could accelerate expressions of AR protein in the testes of mice.


## DISCUSSION

Currently, carbonated beverages, are daily consumed by many people worldwide. CBs have been a deleterious key factor along with their consumption increase. The overweight, obesity, diabetes and endocrine disorders are associated with massive consumption of CBs. CBs harmfully affect reproduction functions. A survey of twenty-five hundred men indicated that the sperms quantity was reduced by thirty percent after men drank one liter cola beverage every day as compared to those without drinking any CSD. The oxidants and additives in CBs result in proteins oxidation, cell damages and reduce sperm motility.

In our study, we found that testes masses of PEP-two, COC-one and COC-two groups were increased in comparison with PEP-one and CG on day fifteen. The testes longitudinal and transverse diameters become larger as compared to CG. Our initial experiments demonstrated that Pepsi-Cola and Coca-Cola could reduce ovarian weight, inhibited the development of follicles and oocytes. Pepsi-Cola and Coca-Cola obviously reduced pregnancy rate and fetus numbers of female mice, such affected reproduction behaviors of female mice. Our results revealed serum EGF contents of COC-two and PEP-two were higher than that of CG. These findings demonstrated high doses of Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola could enhance EGF activity and testosterone secretion. These are in agreement with our previous study in rabbits. However, the effects have to be deeply studied. Its mechanisms also have to be further explained in other mammals in the future.

Androgen and its receptor affect the development of normal prostate and prostate cancer. In the present study, we investigated the effects of Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola on androgen receptor expression levels in the mouse testes. The findings indicated AR mRNA and protein levels of the CBs-treated mice were strikingly increased when compared

to CG normal level. Nowadays, scarce document is reported on this subject. Such, these findings still need to be validated in the future.

In conclusion, drinking Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola could promote testis development, enhance testosterone secretion, increase serum EGF concentrations, also accelerated expressions of AR protein in the mice testes. Our findings provided the scientific bases and for fully understanding CBs effects and their mechanism on development and reproduction functions of humans, but also benefit to prevent prostate dysfunction and cancer.
