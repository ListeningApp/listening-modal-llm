In particular, at first glance, this might suggest that the smaller the inexactness tolerance eta, the more iterations MINRES is expected to perform before NPC detection. We argue that this is not the case. Firstly, an upper bound on the number of MINRES iterations until a NPC direction is encountered is independent of the termination criteria eta. In fact, by construction, the MINRES iterates are independent of the termination tolerance eta and the magnitude of norm g norm see discussion and numerical examples around (Assumption four). Additionally, in the case where g is not in the range of H, we always have norm r (t - one) norm is greater than or equal to norm (I - H H dagger) g norm, which is clearly independent of eta. Together, these lines of argumentation constitute our justification for Assumption three point six.\n3dfm | Recall that Algorithm one includes a manual verification of user specified strongly positive curvature over K t H, g in D type equals SOI case, while Algorithm two only certifies strict positive curvature through the NPC condition nine. Liu and Roosta demonstrated that as long as the NPC condition nine has not been detected, we have T t is positive where T t in the real numbers t by t is the symmetric tridiagonal matrix obtained in the tth iteration of MINRES (see Appendix A for more\nhjmm | Inexact Newton-type Methods for Optimisation with Nonnegativity Constraints\ns0s6 | details). Our next assumption strengthens this notion.\ncxx7 | Assumption three point seven. There exists sigma is greater than zero such that for any x k in the sequence of SOL type iterates returned by Algorithm two, we have\nuzqc | T t is positive sigma I. Assumption three point seven implies that, as long as the NPC condition nine has not been detected, for any v in K t H, g we have〈v, Hv〉is greater than or equal to sigma norm v norm squared. Assumption three point seven is satisfied by an objective function whose Hessian contains positive g-relevant eigenvalues (eigenspaces not orthogonal to the gradient) uniformly separated from zero. A simple example is an under-determined least-squares problem.\ndqwn | Together, Assumptions three point six and three point seven allow us to control the curvature of our step, which is necessary to obtain an improved rate over Algorithm one using a Lipschitz Hessian upper bound. We now present the convergence result for Algorithm two. We defer the proof to Appendix C.\ng58m | Theorem three point eight (Global Complexity of Algorithm two). Let epsilon g in (zero, one). Under Assumptions three point one, three point two and three point five to three point seven, if we choose delta k equals epsilon k equals epsilon g to the power of one half, Algorithm two produces an Eg-FO point in at most big O epsilon g to the power of negative three halves iterations.\nkf9u | Remark three point nine. A direct corollary to Theorems three point three and three point eight, under some mild additional assumptions, is a bound on the operational complexity in terms of gradient and Hessian-vector product evaluations. In particular, to produce an epsilon g minus FO point, the operation complexity for Algorithms one and two is, respectively, big O epsilon g to the power of negative two and big O tilde epsilon g to the power of negative three halves see Appendix D.\ntl2g | Remark three point ten. In all our algorithms, each step includes the Newton-MR component. The integration of the gradient and Newton-MR step is feasible in our algorithm due to the properties of the MINRES iterates (Lemmas A point two and A point three), allowing for a more flexible analysis with only first-order information. In contrast, it appears that second-order information is crucial for achieving descent with the capped-CG procedure, a central aspect of Xie and Wright. This constraint prevents the algorithm from taking a step simultaneously comprised of gradient and Newton-CG components.\nxy74 | Three point four. Local Convergence",
