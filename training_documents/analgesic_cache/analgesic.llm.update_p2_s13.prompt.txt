You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

3g2y | Cats were administered acepromazine (0.1 mg kg 1; Acepran 0.2%; Vetnil Indústria Comércio Produtos Veterinários Ltda, SP, Brazil) intramuscularly as premedication. After 15 mi- nutes, a 22 gauge catheter (Angiocath; Becton Dickinson, SP, Brazil) was placed in a cephalic vein and anesthesia was induced with IV propofol (5-8 mg kg ; Propovan; Cristália Produtos Químicos e Farmacêuticos Ltda, SP, Brazil); mainte- nance was accomplished with isoflurane (Isoflorane; Cristália Produtos Químicos e Farmacêuticos Ltda) in 60-70% oxygen (air-oxygen mixture) administered through a rebreathing cir- cuit. Pressure-controlled ventilation (Anesthesia Machine In- ter Linea A; Intermed, SP, Brazil) was instituted with a peak inspiratory pressure of 7-8 cmH20, tidal volume 8 mL kg , inspiratory:expiratory ratio of 1:2 and positive end-tidal expi- ratory pressure 1 cmH2O. The respiratory rate (fR) was adjusted to maintain end-tidal carbon dioxide partial pressure within 30-40 mmHg (5.0-6.0 kPa). End-tidal isoflurane concentration and inspired oxygen concentration were measured using a side stream gas analyzer (POET IQ2; Criticare Technologies Inc., WI, USA). Heart rate (HR), rhythm (DX 2020 multiparametric monitor; Dixtal Biomédica Indústria e Comércio Ltda, SP, Brazil) and Doppler systolic arterial pressure (SAP; Doppler 811-B; Parks Medical Electronics, OR, USA) were monitored during the entire procedure. Intraoperative IV fluid therapy was lactated Ringer's solution (3 mL kg 1 hour-1).
gc7v | A remifentanil constant rate infusion (CRI; 0.2 ug kg-1 minute-1; Ultiva 2 mg; GlaxoSmithKline Brasil Ltda, RJ, Brazil) was administered IV with a syringe driver (ST670 syringe pump; Samtronic, SP, Brazil) starting after induction of
wqfv | anesthesia and finishing during abdominal closure. If SAP and/ or HR increased or decreased by >15% of values immediately before skin incision, remifentanil CRI was increased or decreased, respectively, by 0.1 µg kg 1 minute-1.
j30a | Cats were randomly assigned by an online random sequence generator (http://www.randomization.com) to one of three groups, 10 cats in each. At 10 minutes before the end of the remifentanil CRI, during skin closure, cats were administered IV analgesics according to the assigned group: group D25, dipyrone (25 mg kg every 24 hours; D500; Zoetis Inc., SP, Brazil); group D12.5, dipyrone (12.5 mg kg - every 12 hours); or group M, meloxicam (0.1 mg kg 1 every 24 hours; Max- icam 0.2%; Ouro Fino Saúde Animal, SP, Brazil). The drugs were diluted in 0.9% saline solution to a final volume of 0.5 mL for each group. A collaborator prepared the injections so that the evaluator would be unaware of the group assignment. In the first 24 hours after anesthesia, the drugs were administered IV. At hospital discharge, the clients were directed to admin- ister the same drug orally for 6 days (dipyrone) or 3 days (meloxicam).
7bdk | All the procedures were performed by a single anesthesiol- ogist (LAG) and a single senior surgeon (JMM) with an assis- tant using a standardized surgical protocol.
fim0 | Measurement of ex vivo COX activity
ojro | Ex vivo COX-1 and COX-2 activities were determined by measuring concentrations of their major enzymatic products [thromboxane B2 (TXB2) and PGE2, respectively], according to an adaptation of a previously described technique (Duz et al. 2015). Blood samples (2 mL) were drawn from the cephalic vein catheter of six randomly selected cats per group and were transferred to a heparin tube (MiniCollect heparin 1 mL; Greiner Bio-One Ltda, SP, Brazil) and a glass tube at the following time points: immediately before the first analgesic administration and at 30 minutes, 4 and 24 hours. At 24 hours, blood was collected before the next drug administration.
l6t9 | For TXB2 analysis, immediately after collection, 1 mL of whole blood in the glass tube was incubated at 37 ºC for 1 hour. Afterwards, the blood was centrifuged at 3000 g for 5 minutes at 4 ℃ and 100 uL of the supernatant plasma was harvested, added to 400 µL of methanol and homogenized. This solution was then centrifuged at 6000 g for 10 minutes and stored at -80 ℃ until COX-1 activity was determined by means of a technique previously described (Brideau et al. 2001).
1ujy | For ex vivo COX-2 activity, heparinized blood (1 mL) was immediately transferred into two 1.5 mL polypropylene tubes (500 µL each). One tube contained 10 µL of lipopolysaccharide isolated from Escherichia coli 0111:B4 in 0.1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution. The sec- ond tube contained 10 µL of PBS and was used as the negative control sample. Samples were then incubated at 37 ℃ for 24
qzor | hours. Afterwards, samples were centrifuged at 2000 g for 5 minutes at 18 ℃, 100 µL of plasma were added to 400 µL of methanol and homogenized. This solution was then centri- fuged at 6000 g for 10 minutes at 18 ℃; supernatant was harvested and stored at -80 ℃ until the time of PGE2 con- centration analysis.
a0by | All tests were performed in duplicate and the quantification of TXB2 and PGE2 concentrations were performed with com- mercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits (Thromboxane B2 ELISA kit and PGE2 ELISA kit monoclonal; Cayman Chemical, MI, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
