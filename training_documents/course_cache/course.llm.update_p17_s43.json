        "content": "gici | K : square root of P. Aurelia equals left five twenty minus three hundred right divided by five twenty equals forty-two point three. square root of P . datum equals left three sixty minus two hundred right divided by three sixty equals forty-four point four percent. seventeen\nowaw | Laboratory Experiment Two\nz6xu | Thomas Park's, nineteen forty-eight, Three Grain Beetle species (Tribolium confusum, Tribolium castaneum and Oryzaephilus surinamensis)\nknw2 | Variable - Climatic conditions (temperature and moisture) and food availability\nmxnw | Monitoring of competitive outcome (highest fitness) among three grain beetles\nbdx4 | Moisture gradient: Dry - Moist\nl01c | Temperature gradient: Hot - Warm - Cold\nyphh | Demonstrations of Fundamental and Realised niches\n3yor | Tribolium castaneum: hot-moist specialist\nf9sc | Tribolium confusum: cold-dry specialist\no5l0 | Fundamental niches\nc1wq | Hot-moist versus cold-dry specialists\ngr2b | Both species of beetles exhibit identical climate niches in allopatry\njkky | Climatic extremes represented in only one of the two species, with the other species occupying the middle range\n7vxr | In sympatric medium, Tribolium confusum always eliminates Oryzaephilus surinamensis because of its higher rate of reproduction and better predation ability\nqzyn | An extra dimension, for example space in the form of glass tubes, allows co-existence of the two species\nrcl1 | Oryzaephilus\n9qpf | Interspecific Competition - Field Experiments\ny5cx | Joseph H. Connell's, nineteen sixty-one, Tidal Barnacles (Balanus balanoides and Chthamalus stellatus)\nhexk | Adult Chthamalus usually occur above Balanus\nc05v | Chthamalus larvae do settle in Balanus Lower Tide Zone\n1ytq | Adult Balanus never in high tide zones (due to desiccation)\ntkax | Methodology - Connell suspected that adult Balanus out competed adult Chthamalus. He kept removing Balanus adult in lower zones in experimental plots in one set as well as removing Chthamalus from upper zone in another\n6mpz | Results\nbi1x | One. Removing Balanus from lower zones caused Chthamalus to survive\nbnve | Two. Balanus never settled in upper zone even as Chthamalus was removed there\n7gvc | Conclusion\njf19 | One. Adult barnacles compete over space in lower zones\n6hx6 | Two. Balanus is superior (crushing Chthamalus) leaving a small realized niche (upper zone) for Chthamalus\nxcql | Three. Fundamental niche of Chthamalus includes dry upper zones where Balanus cannot withstand desiccation twenty-three\nxcxb | Interspecific competition - Field Experiment Two\nci51 | Brown and Davidson's Granivorous Desert Ants and Rodents in Arizona\njaj7 | Ants and rodents were observed to overlap in seed utilization, and the question was then: Are they competing for a limited resource equals seeds?\nuc0w | Experimental Design\n494y | One. Ant-Removal Plots were sprayed with pesticides regularly\n5whs | Two. Rodent-Removal Plots were fenced and subjected to intensive trapping protocols\nkigc | Three. Both ants and rodents removed\nk5st | Four. Control Plots with both ants and rodents present\nd8e8 | Results\ngb7b | One. Rodents removed - Ant colonies increase above control plots\njxu0 | Two. Ants removed - Rodents densities increase above control plots\nl1bb | Conclusions\ni3e0 | One. As one competitor is removed the remaining increase. Density Compensation occurs - Release of extra resources that is no more utilized by the removed species\n78dj | Two. Ants and rodents have overlapping limited food resource niche, seeds, over which they compete\nc1pj | Interspecific Competition - Field Experiment Three\n6v9y | Paine's, nineteen sixty-six, starfish (Pisaster) in rocky intertidal zones of the U.S.: Predator-mediated Coexistence\ndeen | Pisaster, a keystone predator, predates differentially on the dominant competitors (bivalves and acorn barnacles)\n27bo | Removal of the predator showed that the more dominant competitors crowded out the inferior species (goose barnacles, limpets and chitons)\n72k6 | This reduced the total number of coexisting species from fifteen to eight\nemhp | A classic example of Top-Down control of communities, trophic cascading effects or predator-mediated coexistence at lower trophic levels.

Diamond's, nineteen seventy-five - Two Honeyeaters on three Papua New Guinea mountains\nhgm4 | Fundamental niche: similar - Phylidonyris guiseyi equals three hundred to three thousand five hundred meters; Phylidonyris peristriata equals two hundred to three thousand eight hundred fifty meters\nnc42 | Fundamental niche: overlap\ntbfm | eighty-eight percent. Ranged reduced, allopatry to sympatry, from two hundred to three thousand seven hundred to three thousand to three thousand eight hundred fifty meters:\nok18 | twenty-five percent. Realised niche of inferior species, Phylidonyris peristriata, only twenty-five percent of the fundamental niche\npgqe | Another example of habitat related altitudinal, vertical spatial, Ecological Release\nqo9m | Contiguous Allopatry - Natural Experiment Three H.
