You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

i3w4 | Second-order Methods. By incorporating Hessian infor- mation, second-order methods hold the promise to alleviate many of the well-known deficiencies of first-order alterna- tives, e.g., they are typically better suited to ill-conditioned problems (Xu et al., 2020b). For constrained problems, generic projected (quasi) Newton methods involve iterations of the form <LATEX>\mathrm { x } _ { k + 1 } = \mathrm { x } _ { k } + \alpha _ { k } \mathrm { p } _ { k }</LATEX> where
ta7u | <LATEX>\mathrm { p } _ { k } = \arg \min _ { \mathrm { x } \in \Omega } \langle \mathrm { g } _ { k } , \mathrm { p } \rangle + \langle \mathrm { p } , \mathrm { B } _ { k } \mathrm { p } \rangle / 2 ,</LATEX> (3)
qqu2 | where <LATEX>\alpha _ { k }</LATEX> is an appropriately chosen step-size, e.g., back- tracking line search, and <LATEX>\mathrm { B } _ { k }</LATEX> captures some curvature infor- mation of <LATEX>f</LATEX> at <LATEX>\mathrm { x } _ { k }</LATEX> (and also potentially the step-length as in the proximal arc search). For <LATEX>\mathrm { B } _ { k } = \mathrm { I }</LATEX> we recover a projected gradient variant, whereas for <LATEX>\mathrm { B } _ { k } = \mathrm { H } _ { k } ,</LATEX> or some approxi- mation, we obtain projected (or more generally proximal) Newton-type methods (Schmidt et al., 2009; 2011; Becker & Fadili, 2012; Lee et al., 2014; Shi & Liu, 2015). The main drawback of this framework is that the subproblem, (3), may no longer be a simple projection even when <LATEX>\Omega</LATEX> is a simple, and one has to resort to an optimisation subroutine to (approximately) solve (3).
lpgr | An alternative is the interior point framework (Nocedal & Wright, 2006), where the constraints are directly integrated into the objective as "barrier" functions. While the subprob- lems in this framework amount to solving linear systems, to produce accurate solutions the barrier function must ap-

fh0y | proach the constraint, which can lead to highly ill condi- tioned subproblems. Some recent works (Bian et al., 2014; Haeser et al., 2017; O'Neill & Wright, 2020) consider in- terior point methods for (1). In particular, in (O'Neill & Wright, 2020), capped Newton-CG with a preconditioned Hessian is used to optimise a log barrier augmented objec- tive. Due to issues arising from increasingly ill-conditioned subproblems, the practical efficacy of this method seems to be inferior when compared to projection-based methods, including those of first-order (Xie & Wright, 2023).
4g6f | The issue with the general purpose second-order methods discussed so far is that, unlike projected gradient, they do not leverage the simplicity of the nonnegativity con- straints and the corresponding projection. In this light, a naïve adaptation of the projected gradient would imply di- rectly projecting the Newton step on the constraints, e.g., <LATEX>\mathrm { x } _ { k + 1 } = \mathcal{P} _ { \Omega } \left( \mathrm { x } _ { k } - \alpha _ { k } \mathrm { H } _ { k } ^ { - 1 } \mathrm { g } _ { k } \right) .</LATEX> Unfortunately, such a direct adaptation may lead to ascent directions for the objective function at the boundary. To that end, the two-metric projec- tion (TMP) framework (Bertsekas, 1982; Gafni & Bertsekas, 1984) offers an ingenious solution. Specifically, at each iteration, the component indices, <LATEX>\left\lceil d \right\rceil ,</LATEX> are divided into the approximately bound, <LATEX>\mathcal{J} _ { k } ^ { + } ,</LATEX> and free sets, <LATEX>\mathcal{J} _ { k } ^ { - }</LATEX> , given by
fpm1 | (4)
ycds | <LATEX>\mathcal{J} _ { k } ^ { + } = \left\{ i \in \left[ d \right] \mid \mathrm { x } _ { k } ^ { i } \leq \delta , \mathrm { g } _ { k } ^ { i } > 0 \right\} , \mathcal{J} _ { k } ^ { - } = \left[ d \right] \setminus \mathcal{J} _ { k } ^ { + } .</LATEX> where <LATEX>\delta > 0 .</LATEX> A matrix, <LATEX>\mathrm { D } _ { k } ,</LATEX> is then chosen to be "diagonal" with respect to set <LATEX>\mathcal{J} _ { k } ^ { + }</LATEX> , that is,
duzw | <LATEX>\left( \mathrm { D } _ { k } \right) _ { i j } = 0 , i \in \mathcal{J} _ { k } ^ { + } , j \in \left[ d \right] \setminus \left\{ i \right\} ,</LATEX> and the update is simply given by
a7jq | <LATEX>\mathrm { x } _ { k + 1 } = \mathcal{P} \left( \mathrm { x } _ { k } - \alpha _ { k } \mathrm { D } _ { k } \mathrm { g } _ { k } \right) .</LATEX> (5)
s9lx | It has been shown that TMP is asymptotically convergent under certain conditions and reasonable choices of <LATEX>\mathrm { D } _ { k } .</LATEX> For example, for strongly convex problems, the non-diagonal portion of <LATEX>\mathrm { D } _ { k }</LATEX> can consist of the inverse of the Hessian sub- matrix corresponding to the indices in <LATEX>\mathcal{J} _ { k } ^ { - }</LATEX> . In this case, (5) reduces to a scaled gradient in <LATEX>\mathcal{J} _ { k } ^ { + }</LATEX> and a Newton step in <LATEX>\mathcal{J} _ { k } ^ { - }</LATEX> . Bertsekas (1982) also shows that, under certain conditions, TMP can preserve fast "Newton like" local convergence. Practically, TMP type algorithms has been successfully ap- plied to a range of problems (Gafni & Bertsekas, 1984; Schmidt et al., 2007; Kim et al., 2010; Haber, 2014; Kuang et al., 2015; Cai et al., 2023). In large scale and nonconvex settings, employing the Newton step as part of (5) may be infeasible or even undesirable. Indeed, not only can Hessian storage and inversion costs be prohibitive, the existence of negative curvature can lead to ascent directions.
