You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

bfax | The coming to power of Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed in Ethiopia in April 2018, at the cost of TPLF dominance over the government,32 initiated a new approach to formal bilateral relations between Addis Ababa and Asmara. Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed reached out to President Isaias Afwerki of Eritrea and asked for peace between the two brotherly peoples, reassuring him that Ethiopia would respect and implement the Algiers peace agreement and its border demarcation decision. There was no immediate response from Asmara, however. It was not until Ethiopia removed the two most prominent representatives of TPLF control of the Ethiopian 'system' - the army chief of staff Samora Yunis and intelligence head Getachew Assefa - that President Isaias Afwerki was convinced that a genuine shift of power had occurred within the EPRDF government coalition.33 Thereafter, on the sym- bolic Martyrs' Day of 20 June 2018, President Isaias Afwerki commented on the political changes in Ethiopia, stating that the 'end of the TPLF's shenanigans' made a peace process with Ethiopia possible.34 President Isaias Afwerki's statement underlines the thesis that the war was between the Tigrinya-speaking political elites, and had been converted into an inter-state war. The inter-state border subsequently cemented the schism between the borderlands people created by the war, until subaltern processes driven by the borderlands populations gradually reduced the physical and political division.
f2y8 | After a brief period of talks, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed travelled to Asmara and met for the first time with President Isaias Afwerki. Together they signed a brief five-point 'Joint Declaration of Peace and Friendship between Eritrea and
o7qm | Ethiopia', stating: "The state of war between Ethiopia and Eritrea has come to an end. A new era of peace and friendship has been opened'.35
d52l | Immediately after the signing of the friendship declaration in Addis Ababa in July 2018 diplomatic relations and communication lines between the two countries were restored, and soon Ethiopian Airlines commenced regular flights between the two capital cities. Subsequently, on 11 September 2018, the military trenches were dismantled and President Isaias Afwerki and Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed opened the border crossings on the ground, and Eritreans and Ethiopians in thousands crossed into each other's countries to reconnect with friends and families on the other side who they had not seen for twenty years.36 Before this official rapproche- ment, however, there had been a gradual process over several years of people- to-people contact and reconciliation on the ground, ignoring and undermining the formal enmity between the two states and governments and the solidity of the inter- state border.
qlbb | People-to-people reconciliation during conflict
nhsg | People-to-people37 contact and reconciliation between Tigrinya-speakers in Eritrea and Ethiopia has been a continuous subaltern process since 2000, primarily mani- fested by Eritreans fleeing their country and seeking refuge in Ethiopia. Over 500,000 Eritreans have crossed over to Tigray since the Eritrean political crack- down in September 2001, despite the official narrative portraying Ethiopia and Tigrayans as the enemy. Reportedly, and confirmed by all Ethiopian and Eritrean sources consulted over the last eighteen years of research, not one Eritrean refugee has reported harassment or vindictive incidents when seeking protection on the Ethiopian side of the border; all informants confirm they had been well received and offered hospitality by the borderland Tigrayans with whom they first came in contact.38 The informal and formal reception of Eritrean refugees in Tigray con- firms the close affinity between the two peoples. Both Ethiopian and Tigrayan authorities have gone far beyond the requirements in the refugee convention to host and care for their Eritrean brethren.
hy0l | The Eritrean-Ethiopian Afar regional state border (in the south-east) has always been much more porous than the Eritrea-Tigray border in the north-west; long stretches are without any military fortification. The Afar, a semi-nomadic pastoral people, are divided between Eritrea, Ethiopia and Djibouti. They consider them- selves to be first and foremost Afaris, and hence do not regard state borders as
4jmz | socially or culturally relevant to their own livelihoods.39 Consequently, the flow of people across the Afar Eritrea-Ethiopia border has been more prevalent since 2001; many Eritrean Afars have moved across to Ethiopia and settled there tempor- arily until the Eritrean political situation improves. Few Afars register as refugees in Ethiopia, as they are looked upon as integral members of the Ethiopian Afar communities. This can be seen, for instance, in the case that over 20 per cent of employees in the Afar regional state administration of Ethiopia, are allegedly Eritrean Afars.4º
b7cq | Hosting refugees, however, is not in itself proof of mutual reconciliation between the peoples living in the two countries. For that to transpire, sustained two-way cross-border social interaction would need to take place.
0b39 | As in any war or conflict zone, smuggling operations across no man's land were soon established. Early in my research I heard details of petty trade and movement of contraband, although it was impossible to verify the extent. Across the north- west Tigray-Eritrea border, informal small-scale livestock trade occurred on and off, when the villagers managed to avoid the Eritrean border guards. Similarly, the Afars have conducted traditional low-scale trade across their border, also in live- stock and possibly some commodities shipped in across the Red Sea.41 As contra- band will flow across any border regardless of the political context, such activities can not necessarily be regarded as instances of 'reconciliation'.
qecd | The first concrete reconciliatory incidents involving a substantial number of peo- ple occurred during the annual Maryam Zion religious festival in Axum, a city in northern Ethiopia. (Conducted around 30 November every year, the Maryam Zion festival attracts tens of thousands of Christian Orthodox pilgrims from across Ethiopia and Eritrea.) Axum locals informed the research team that, in 2009, Eritreans participating in the religious celebration, later returned to their home vil- lages inside Eritrea. Then, in November 2015, several hundred, mostly elderly, Eritreans reportedly flocked to Axum. Tigrayan friends and families there played host to them, before they returned to their home country.42 The common Christian Orthodox identity in the Eritrean-Ethiopian highlands runs deep, and transcends parochial, ethnic, and national identities, and is, as such, a convenient reconcili- ation medium.
1o7p | Life in the 'buffer zone'
cp13 | The Ethiopian borderlands have been backwaters since 2000, missing out on the development elsewhere in the country. The border towns and districts have been slowly dying, as the young move to other Ethiopian cities or migrate abroad for
bgre | better opportunities.43 As explained by an elderly farmer in the Irob district: 'We have failed them. Our community has failed them. Ethiopia has certainly failed them'.44
