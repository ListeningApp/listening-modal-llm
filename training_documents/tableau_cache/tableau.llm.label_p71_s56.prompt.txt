You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

06yq | Microdosing with psychedelics to self-medicate for ADHD symptoms in adults: A naturalistic study

2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

rgva | Summary
mlcd | In this chapter, you learned one of the most critical concepts of using Tableau Public and producing accurate, informative data visualizations- connecting to, transforming, and loading data. The precepts that we discussed, such as making sure that your data source is clean and formatted properly, are relevant to working with data.
2qe7 | In the next chapter, we will discuss the different types of visualizations that you can make with your data and how to use each type correctly and in the most compelling manner.

091m | 4 Visualization - Tips and Types
sot6 | A journalist or blogger who uses Tableau Public must convert data to visualizations so that readers can quickly understand large quantities of data that have been distilled down to a single graphic. The role of an author is data abstraction, the conversion of real-life data into visual cues (primitives, as some people who work in the field of data science call them), such as colors, shapes, lengths, and positions. The role of your reader is to do the reverse, consume data primitives and convert them back into real-life things, events, and phenomenon. If you have done a poor job choosing the elements of your data visualization, your readers will have a difficult time relating your visualization to the real world, which means that the story that you're telling isn't as compelling as it should be. Your visualization will not have the value that you wanted, because the connection between the data visualization and the underlying data has been broken.
d6sf | Before you create a visualization for people to utilize, there are several considerations that go into the design. The following are some of these considerations:
7haq | . The purpose of the visualization: Which questions should it answer?
ubwu | · Content: What should be included? (Start small, as less is often more).
ucme | · The visualization structure: What do you actually want to measure or show?
qnl5 | . The readers' platform: How have your readers approached your questions before? Which tools have they used to do so?
wdx9 | In this chapter, we will discuss the following topics:
n1xr | · The lifecycle of visualization
ohpj | · Iterative design and what it means
ry5f | · Creating visualizations and visual perceptions

en1l | An overview of the development lifecycle
45gx | Perform the following steps to develop a high-quality, compelling visualization:
xgur | . The first step is to devise a purpose for the visualization - a question that you would like the data to answer - and envision the possible visualization types that can best answer that question.
iz66 | . Next, define the content and find your relevant data; determine how much data should be shown and the level of details required. A large part of your visualization project should be spent on finding and cleansing data. Do not skimp on this step, because it will make your visualization more clear and useful to readers. You may have to scrape data from the Internet or combine it from multiple sources.
dndq | . Wherever you get your data, make sure that you have both validated and attributed it properly.
xzce | 1
w4vd | We surveyed a few experts in Tableau Public, and anecdotally, they estimate that they spend 70% to 80% of their total development time building data sources.
cuh0 | . The third step (with respect to this book) is to try various view chart types using the Show Me feature of Tableau Public. Try various view types to answer the question, experiment with various views, add or subtract data, manipulate components, and explore the question in greater detail or find other questions.
k36t | . The next step in building a visualization is considering the platform- print, desktop, laptop, tablet, and smartphone. The medium that your consumers use to interact with your visualizations and develop insights is critical.
z1wx | · The last step is publishing your work, or delivering content to your visualization consumers. Your data visualization should start a conversation. So expect feedback.

ds29 | Ten visualization tips
qcmr | Data visualization is an art and a science. Much has been researched, studied, and published on the topic of what a great visualization is composed of. In this section, let's attempt to clarify some of these findings via some brief explanations, as shown in following list. As with everything in life, your mileage may vary, and there are always exceptions to rules. However, consider these general rules as condensed, combined, and paraphrased here as compared to the industry standards and academic research as you develop visualizations:
7c6p | · Readers should be able to understand data visualization quickly. Make it easy for your consumer to read your data visualization. Don't use font sizes that are less than 10 pt if you can manage it, and use common fonts that are designed for ease of use. The key is that visualizations are not too flashy, complex, or artistic just for the sake of it. Do not use 3D in any way, it distracts and can mislead readers by distorting data. Follow the form over function principle, and the amount of time required to understand the data will work itself out.
d1ee | · Consider the format for the reader. Print, computer screens, and mobile devices use large fonts for titles, and consider the format of consumers' devices. Scrolling is not good in most cases, and you should manage white space carefully.
itx4 | · Every element should have a reason for being in a virtualization. Choose colors carefully. Use colors for categories instead of quantities; don't use colors randomly. Shapes, colors, legends, and labels should add to the understanding of the visualization.
vwrs | . Be consistent in the placement of objects, elements, and colors. Your work is your digital brand, it literally is your product. Your consumers may not know you in person. Their perception of you and your skills is determined by how they relate to your visualizations. Do not use variety for variety's sake. The organization of elements and colors is important, as it helps readers navigate through the visualization.
xjkw | . Use the correct context for data and consistent axes for elements on a chart. Help readers understand the data and what they are looking at. Do not mislead readers by using mismatched axes for charts that compare the same measure, nonzero axes, and other misleading tactics.
wght | . Simplicity comes from clarity, and this helps readers understand data. Keep it simple! Some data sets are inherently complex. In such cases, try to show a part of the data set, or break up the visualizations to show the various aspects of the data. Be clear in your organization and approach, and simplicity (for readers) will follow.

x5l2 | Visualization - Tips and Types
ilrs | • Consider calculating differences for readers instead of plotting multiple lines or bars in an effort to show the comparisons and differences. For example, a line chart of the city budget versus the city expenditures may be interesting, but an even better option is to use a bar chart, with a baseline set to the budget and bars above or under the baseline. Alternatively, you can set reference lines in a chart by using mean or target values.
0a03 | . Choose the best type of view (chart) for the data. Read the following sections and understand the key elements of every major chart type and what the main objectives of each chart type are.
auae | · Understand the different visualization primitives (color, length, area, shapes, position, direction, and angle) and how humans perceive them in terms of data visualization.
5b6y | . Experiment with the Tableau Public Show Me feature to choose a view type and make changes of your own, such as selecting the shelf items that you need to include, and their characteristics. Experiment and refine, and think in terms of a visualization cycle of exploration rather than a linear route from data to visualization creation.
1y10 | The perception of visual clues
6mnx | Our brains interpret visual signals in specific, predictable ways, and modern user interfaces and consumer products are based on extensive study in this area. The way we interact with visual signals was first formally studied and discussed by William Cleveland and Robert McGill (at the time, with AT&T Laboratories) in their seminal paper named Graphical Perception: Theory, Experimentation, and Application to the Development of Graphical Methods, as published in the Journal of the American Statistical Association in September 1984. This paper is readily available via a quick Internet search, and it is worth a quick read.
tynp | In addition to Cleveland and McGill, who were statistical scientists (and later professors) focused on researching how we process visual cues, Stephen Few has written extensively on this topic in his books and on his blog, which can be viewed by visiting http://www.perceptualedge.com/.
ob0u | The authorities on this matter have concluded that the human brain correctly perceives numerical values in a way that is different from how it perceives various visual primitives.
50o1 | [ 56 ]
cw76 | www.it-ebooks.info
lkk5 | Chapter 4
molj | In the descending order of accuracy, visual primitives are as follows:
5pto | . Position: This shows how marks relate to an axis, like in a scatter plot.
mo6k | . The bar or line length: This is why line graphs and bar graphs remain the first and the most popular forms of data visualization.
zh6q | . Angle: This should be used sparingly, as the human brain actually is not good at differentiating angles within a circle. Pie charts are effective if you wish to communicate measures as long as about five dimensions are included and the slides are labeled with their respective percentages of the whole.
kp04 | · Area: It's actually fairly difficult for us to differentiate numerical values from each other based on the size of a shape. Therefore, you should use bubble graphs and tree maps sparingly and label them properly when you do use them.
3e8r | . Saturation and hue: These are the worst primitives that you can use to encode numerical values because not only are a significant number of readers color-blind, but also they are used inconsistently and designed for perception rather than judging.
8g7g | . Color: This is best used for categorization into groups rather than to measure quantity. However, you can use it effectively in heat maps and highlight tables, as long as you are using it properly and labeling the values.
5j4f | Your mileage may vary, but consider the hierarchy of visual clue perception carefully. Some conservative data authors will try to stick to scatter plots, line charts, and bar charts (and their derivative chart types) almost exclusively and avoid most other charts such as pie charts, bubble charts, and heat maps.
4xe7 | Leveraging your understanding of how our brains interpret visual clues will help you select the proper chart type. Fortunately, there is a built-in assistant in Tableau Public called Show Me that will help you choose a chart type based on the data elements (measures and dimensions) that you select.

d7eu | Visualization - Tips and Types
xndr | Tableau Public has a great tool embedded into the software called Show Me (or the Show Me button). This tool is an expression of Tableau Software's vision of self-service analysis because it allows largely nontechnical users to develop useful graphs and charts based on their data. The Show Me button is at the top right-hand side of the Tableau Public interface. Clicking on this button opens the Show Me dialog box (with 24 chart type icons in Tableau Public 9.x), as seen in the following screenshot:
m6hi | The Show Me tool suggests graph types based on the view that the user has created and/ or the fields that the user has selected from the Data window or the shelf areas.
vpkf | Only the graph icons that fit the data types available or selected are enabled. For example, none of the geographic maps on icon row number 2 are enabled, because there is no geographic data in the data set used to make this screenshot.
4d67 | The Show Me tool also tells you which additional field types you need to select in order to create a specific visualization, which is a great way to learn.
e7j2 | To use the Show Me tool, select one or more dimensions or measures from the Data window and then click on the Show Me button in the upper right of the Tableau window to see the suggestions in the Show Me dialog box. The following are some examples:

u7a3 | 1
w409 | [ You can't auto-hide the Show Me dialog box once it is displayed and the user has made a selection from it. Click on the Show Me button again to hide the Show Me dialog box.
m04y | In addition to creating new visualizations using the Show Me card, you can modify the existing graph. When you select a new graph type from one of the highlighted buttons, Tableau Public will change your visualization for you, and by doing so, it might remove fields on the visualization that aren't part of the new one.
23jk | Show Me contains 24 chart types in Tableau Public 9.x, but many more advanced or customized charts can also be created by adding different data elements and tweaking the existing chart that you have built. Items that help users better understand the data include tool tips, trend lines, color indicators, row separators, and reference lines. We will explore these additions in detail later in the chapter.
oa63 | Answering questions using Show Me chart types
e3lv | Of the many chart types available in the Show Me tool in Tableau Public 9.x, there are several common chart types that are frequently used - tables, line charts, bar charts, geographic maps, and scatter charts. Pie charts are often used in popular culture, particularly in infographics, but you should use them sparingly and always label the slices with the percent of the total.
rqv6 | Charts and graphs exist to answer questions, and some charts can naturally answer certain types of questions better than other charts.
oa48 | The following sections discuss in detail some important chart types offered in Tableau Public, but this is not a comprehensive list due to limitations pertaining to space in this book. In order to help you learn how to construct different visualizations, the screenshots in these sections include the placement of different fields on the shelves and cards of the workspace.

7mv3 | About dimensions and measures
der6 | In Chapter 3, Connecting to Data, we discussed dimensions and measures in detail. Let's bring up a few more points so that we understand the chart creation process a little better. Tableau Public separates data source into dimensions (qualitative fields) and measures (quantitative fields).
8xg2 | When you drag a field onto a worksheet, its new instance is called a pill. The dimensions and discrete fields will be blue, while continuous measures will be green pills. Each of these pills has a right-click on the shortcut context menu and can have icons on them that correspond to the Marks card shelves that they belong, to as well as the set and group icons (if they are part of a group or set).
njvp | When we use a dimension, Tableau Public creates column or row headers for a chart (view). On the contrary, measures typically create an axis in the chart in case the measure is classified as continuous, as described in the next section of this chapter. Measures can be aggregated (mathematical calculations such as summation, averaging, counting, and so on) based on the selected aggregation function (SUM, AVG, COUNT, and so on) for each item in the dimension used in the chart.
s8b5 | Tableau Public automatically determines whether a data field is a dimension or a measure, but sometimes, the software makes mistakes. For instance, if your data source has numeric unique identifiers, such as account numbers, then they will be grouped as measures by default, unless the field name contains the ID string. In this case, you can change a data element to either a dimension or measure by dragging it to the correct pane in the Data window (to the Dimensions pane or the Measures pane). It is more likely that you will have to convert measures into dimensions (because all numeric values are not measures). To convert a measure into a dimension, you can either drag it to the Dimensions pane or right-click on the measure and select Convert to Dimension from the shortcut context menu. If this conversion is needed for only one chart, you can locally convert the measure on a shelf in the same manner (by selecting the Convert to Dimension command from the shortcut context menu).
