        "content": "fj24 | But if our empire has left us with the rewards of (former) membership, it has also left us with liabilities of an educational nature. Imperialism afforded lessons in how to divide the world. It taught people to read the exotic, primitive, and timeless identity of the other, whether in skin color, hair texture, or the inflections of taste and tongue. Its themes of conquering, civilizing, converting, collecting, and classifying inspired educational metaphors equally concerned with taking possession of the world-metaphors that we now have to give an account of, beginning with our own education.\nuz3c | Educational Accountability\nd5bi | In thinking about how schools are ill prepared to address the history of identities that imperialism has bestowed upon us, I think we need to begin with the intersection between imperialism's legacy and education within our own lives. When my great-grandmother's family arrived in America in the eighteen eighties, they were in search of a Europe they had not been able to find in Russian Poland. After centuries of internal colonization in Eastern European shtetls, the Jewish people were being depicted at the time of their emigration as a race apart from Europeans. They were said to be a \"secret race\" and a \"nation within a nation,\" as new scientists of race were obsessively given to measuring Jewish feet, noses, and gait. It hardly needs to be added that this shift culminated in the Nazi campaign to eliminate a defiled, mongrel race, a rootless Jewish nation.\nba4l | Fortunately, long before the shoah, my family were making their way across the New World on what might be taken to be a journey away from anti-Semitism and toward whiteness. It often meant joining in on the displacement of others, such as American Natives and African Americans. While holding to their religion (although conversion was embraced by some), Jews sought to deracialize their family's lives through the language they spoke and\nffx8 | WHERE IS HERE?\ns6su | the education they sought. My mother recalls formally debating in her Saturday Hebrew school class whether Judaism was a religion or a race. She held with religion, but the racial barriers would take another generation to fall. My grandfather was barred from the post that he coveted and qualified himself for on the faculty of the University of Toronto, for as late as the nineteen forties there were no Jewish professors in Canada. In the decade leading up to the Second World War, Canada had the worst record of any nation in restricting Jewish immigration; and during the war, riots in Montreal led to the smashing of Jewish shop windows. While I was growing up, after the war, my parents were still not able to join the local golf and country club, but for my family these were the last such outposts of racial privilege associated with defining and maintaining the whiteness of here. Although it would not have occurred to my family to hold the forces of imperialism responsible for racial discrimination, imperialism had fostered and been well served by the science of race that through the nineteenth and into the twentieth century gave a thoroughly modern legitimacy to anti-Semitism and other forms of racism.\ny219 | My own education felt race-free, outside the occasional school-yard slander. Still, I kept my Jewishness protected and quiet well into my days as a schoolteacher. What could this aspect of my \"background\" have to do with the wonders of Western culture that I studied and ended up teaching to others? It didn't occur to me that \"the best that had been thought and said,\" in Matthew Arnold's famous phrase, was based, as he also put it, on discriminating between Hebraic and Hellenic influences in favor of the glory\n06ht | that was Greece. On the rare occasions in this race-unspoken education when the Jew made an appearance, it was in the form of Shylock in my introduction to Shakespeare, or Fagin featured in my first Dickens, and there was scarcely a comment from anyone, least of all me, on what had been made of these characters. In science class, it's true, there was the inevitable poster of the wild-haired Albert Einstein as eccentric scientist-hero. Meanwhile, I took my history and geography lessons on a world split between civilized and primitive, West and East, male and female. So, keeping my Jewishness for the Woody Allen moments in my life, I went on to make an Arnoldian education my business and my life. It must have been a common experience for teachers in current and former British colonies around the globe, except that through one generation and a terrible war, I had been freed of the racial designation.\nv3r2 | Only now have I finally come to ask how I so eagerly acquired an education that was indifferent, where it was not negative, toward aspects of my life and generations of my family. Who was I to be, what was I to make of this culture that was not meant to be mine, a culture that had been built, after all, on realizing such discriminations of character and identity? I had been taught to think the world of Ezra Pound, T. S. Eliot, and D. H. Lawrence, and did- only to learn sometime later that they would have found in me a distasteful and racialized Jewishness. I realized then that I had distanced myself from the Jewish culture that T. S. Eliot and Co. did not care much for.\nnv42 | This critical return to what our education makes of us is one that feminist scholars have been pursuing for some time, following Virginia Woolf's disquieting footsteps through the British Museum and Oxford University in A Room of One's Own, all the while asking how it is that we make ourselves worthy of the West's best arts and sciences. Such reconsideration is, of course, what one should be about as an educator, always being drawn back to one's own never-adequate education, as if to affirm Eliot's all too well-known lines:\nxags | Yet when I now recall these lines from Four Quartets, they speak both to the age of exploration and to \"where we started\" in a new way (\"for the first time\"). They speak to an education in who I was to be, for all appearances,\njc47 | WHERE IS HERE?\nko3c | and who I was not to be: \"What might have been and what has been / Point to one end, which is always present.\"",
