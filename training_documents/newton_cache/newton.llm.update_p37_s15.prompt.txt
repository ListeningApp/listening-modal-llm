You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

7qi5 | From (46) it is clear that we can do away with the <LATEX>\mathrm { D } _ { \mathrm { t y p e } } = \mathrm { N P C }</LATEX> case and Assumption 3.7. With this in mind, we now demonstrate that the step size produced by the line search in Algorithm 4 is bounded.
9f5r | Lemma E.2. Assume that <LATEX>f</LATEX> satisfies Assumption 3.1 and <LATEX>x</LATEX> is <LATEX>a</LATEX> local minima of (1) satisfying Assumption 3.12. Then if <LATEX>\mathrm { x } _ { k } \in B \left( \mathrm { x } _ { * } , \min \left\{ \Delta _ { \mathrm { c w } } , \Delta _ { s e p } \right\} \right)</LATEX> the step size produced by the line search in Algorithm 4 satisfies <LATEX>\alpha _ { k } \in \left[ \bar { \alpha } , 1 \right]</LATEX> where
j3tt | <LATEX>\bar { \alpha } \triangleq \min \left\{ 1 , \frac { 2 \left( 1 - \rho \right) \mu } { L _ { g } } , \frac { \delta } { \| \mathrm { p } _ { k } ^ { \mathcal{I} } \| } \right\} . ,</LATEX> (47)
zoz0 | Proof. <LATEX>\mathrm { x } _ { k } \in B \left( \mathrm { x } _ { * } , \min \left\{ \Delta _ { \mathrm { c v x } } , \Delta _ { \mathrm { s e p } } \right\} \right)</LATEX> implies that <LATEX>\mathcal{I} \left( \mathrm { x } _ { k } , \delta \right) = \mathcal{I} \left( \mathrm { x } _ { * } , 0 \right) \neq \emptyset</LATEX> and (46) holds. It follows that MINRES always selects <LATEX>\mathrm { D } _ { \mathrm { t y p e } } = \mathrm { S O L }</LATEX> step.
3blu | The result follows from the step size selection procedure in Algorithm 4 and the analysis in the SOL case of Lemma C.1.
xv2l | Building on Lemma E.1, our next result, Lemma E.3, will show that, close enough to <LATEX>\mathrm { X } _ { * } ,</LATEX> the active set update will be large enough and the inactive set update small enough that the zero bound constraints at <LATEX>\mathrm { x } _ { k + 1 }</LATEX> coincide with the zero bound constraints at X*, i.e., <LATEX>\mathcal{A} \left( \mathrm { x } _ { k + 1 } , 0 \right) = \mathcal{A} \left( \mathrm { x } ^ { * } , 0 \right) .</LATEX> The intuition for this result is that the gradient and hence the step (cf. (20)) in the inactive indices should be going to zero as <LATEX>\mathrm { x } _ { k }</LATEX> approaches <LATEX>\mathrm { X } _ { * } .</LATEX> By contrast, in the active set, a non-degeneracy condition (Assumption 3.11) ensures there is positive gradient in the active indices arbitrarily close to the boundary. When <LATEX>\mathcal{A} \left( \mathrm { x } _ { k + 1 } , 0 \right) = \mathcal{A} \left( \mathrm { x } ^ { * } , 0 \right) ,</LATEX> the fixed active set and small inactive step can also be used to ensure that our iterates do not drift too far from the starting point. This is the second part of Lemma E.3.

ti78 | Lemma E.3. Suppose that <LATEX>f</LATEX> satisfies Assumption 3.1. Let <LATEX>X _ { 2 }</LATEX> be a local minima satisfying Assumptions 3.11 and 3.12. If <LATEX>\delta</LATEX> is chosen according to (44), then the following two results hold:
k5pk | 1. There exists <LATEX>\Delta _ { b m d } > 0</LATEX> such that <LATEX>\mathrm { x } _ { k } \in B \left( \mathrm { x } _ { * } , \Delta _ { b n d } \right)</LATEX> implies
n093 | <LATEX>\mathcal{A} \left( \mathrm { x } _ { k } , \delta \right) = \mathcal{A} \left( \mathrm { x } _ { k + 1 } , 0 \right) = \mathcal{A} \left( \mathrm { x } _ { * } , 0 \right) .</LATEX> 2. Given a <LATEX>\Delta > 0 ,</LATEX> we can choose <LATEX>\Delta _ { c l s } \in \left( 0 , \Delta _ { b n d } \right)</LATEX> such that <LATEX>\| \mathrm { x } _ { k } - \mathrm { x } _ { * } \| < \Delta _ { c l s }</LATEX> implies that
4khi | <LATEX>\| \mathrm { x } _ { k + 1 } - \mathrm { x } _ { * } \| < \Delta .</LATEX> Proof. We stipulate that <LATEX>\Delta _ { \mathrm { b n d } } \leq \min \left\{ \Delta _ { \mathrm { s e p } } , \Delta _ { \mathrm { e v x } } \right\} .</LATEX> Note that, in this case, <LATEX>\mathcal{A} \left( \mathrm { x } _ { k } , \delta \right) = \mathcal{A} \left( \mathrm { x } _ { * } , 0 \right)</LATEX> by Lemma E.1 and <LATEX>\alpha _ { k } \in \left[ \bar { \alpha } , 1 \right]</LATEX> where
