You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

94h3 | ATPase cation transporting 13A2 (ATP13A2), another lysosomal protein which localises on its membrane (Figure 1A) with unknown function, has been implicated in PD (PARK9, Table 1). Autosomal recessive, early-onset parkinsonism due to ATP13A2 mutations were first noted in Kufor-Rakeb Syndrome, followed by recent studies in other forms of parkinsonism (Di Fonzo et al. 2007; Eiberg et al. 2012; Park et al. 2011; Ramirez et al. 2006). Fibroblasts from these patients showed impaired lysosomal acidification and proteostasis, leading to inefficiency in substrate degradation and autophagosome clearance. These observations were replicated in ATP13A2 knockdown dopaminergic cell lines, where its restoration re-established lysosomal homeostasis and ameliorated cell death (Dehay et al. 2012). Downregulation of ATP13A2 was also seen in nigral neurons of sporadic PD patients, along with traces in Lewy bodies (Dehay et al. 2012). A loss-of-function ATP13A2 mutant mouse model revealed age related lysosomal dysfunction, protein aggregation, and gliosis leading to motor abnormalities. Interestingly, the levels of total and oligomeric a-synuclein was normal, despite ubiquitinated protein aggregation, cathepsin-D dysfunction, and autophagy defects (Kett et al. 2015). These observations suggest that ATP13A2 mutations may lead to PD through an a-synuclein independent mechanism.

c3lz | 7.1. a-synuclein:
8bwk | Misfolded a-synuclein can trigger PD pathogenesis in the presynaptic terminals of nigrostriatal neurons (Imbriani et al. 2018; Kramer & Schulz-Schaeffer 2007; Spinelli et al. 2014). This may as well be one of the earliest pathogenic events in PD, where a-synuclein aggregates target SV endocytosis, SV trafficking, and autophagy components of E-L system to initiate or exacerbate dopaminergic neuronal dysfunction.
ez9s | a-Synuclein and other family members function in presynaptic terminals, where they modulate SV distribution and neurotransmission (Burre 2015; Greten-Harrison et al. 2010; Vargas et al. 2017) (Figure 1C). The biophysical properties of synucleins reveal their ability to sense and modify membrane curvature (Shen et al. 2012; Westphal & Chandra 2013; Middleton & Rhoades 2010). These functions suggest that synucleins regulate SV exocytosis and endocytosis (Vargas et al. 2014; Greten-Harrison et al. 2010). Studies in KO mice in fact show that synucleins normally function post SV exocytosis, in fusion pore expansion and/or control the kinetics of SV endocytosis by facilitating membrane curvature (Lautenschlager et al. 2017; Logan et al. 2017; Vargas et al. 2014). a-Synuclein also appears to control SV availability for release by regulating SV clustering (Diao et al. 2013; Vargas et al. 2017).
mqot | On a pathological level, several studies show that overexpression of a-synuclein inhibits neurotransmission. The locus of this consistent effect is not clear. Studies have shown that elevated a-synuclein levels and oligomeric a-synuclein inhibit SV exocytosis in a SNARE- dependent manner or affecting SV clustering (Huang et al. 2019; Nemani et al. 2010). On the other hand, considerable evidence suggests that aggregated a-synuclein primarily impacts SV endocytosis, which is of relevance to E-L system genes linked to PD. In lamprey giant synapses, injection of aggregated a-synuclein is identified to inhibit clathrin un- coating as evidenced by the accumulation of CCVs when SV recycling was evoked by high- frequency stimulation (Busch et al. 2014). A recent study also suggests that extra synuclein might sequester Hsc70 thus effect clathrin uncoating, subsequently causing SV recycling defects (Banks et al. 2019). Similar observation was made in mammalian Calyx of Held synapse, where acute elevation of monomeric and mutant a-synuclein levels decreased SV endocytosis with frequency dependent effect on SV exocytosis. This was also seen upon transgenic expression of a-synuclein (Eguchi et al. 2017; Xu et al. 2016). . Overexpression of mutant a-synuclein also affects dopamine transporter trafficking on the presynaptic membrane, leading to dopamine dyshomeostasis (Kisos et al. 2014). The observations that overexpression and deletion of synucleins have similar effects on SV exo- and endocytosis (Lautenschlager et al. 2017) suggest that SV cycling is exquisitely sensitive to a-synuclein levels. Further understanding of the precise mechanisms for interactions of a-synuclein and synaptic E-L system proteins involved in PD will provide crucial insights on early causal pathogenic events in PD.

Deficiency of VPS35 in dopaminergic neurons impairs endosome-to-Golgi retrieval of receptors like Lamp2a, accelerating its lysosomal degradation. Lamp2a is a critical receptor for chaperone-mediated autophagy of misfolded a-synuclein, so its deficiency leads to a vicious cycle of a-synuclein accumulation (Tang et al. 2015a), which might be the case in patients with VPS35 mutations. Overexpression of a-synuclein also directly compromises macroautophagy through inhibition of Rab1a (Winslow et al. 2010). It is also pertinent to note that aggregated a-synuclein in the soma is a key target of treatment strategies in development through induction of macroautophagy (Suresh et al. 2017; Suresh et al. 2018a).
