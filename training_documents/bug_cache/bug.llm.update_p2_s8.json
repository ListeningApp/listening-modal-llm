        "content": "ap5o | From an empirical perspective there is evidence that voice is different from other behaviors. In a recent study, Van Dyne and LePine presented initial construct validity support for a six-item measure of voice behavior. In their study, supervisors, peers, and employees differentiated in-role from extra-role behavior, and also distinguished between two forms of promotive extra-role behavior-helping and voice. Using multigroup confirmatory factor analysis, they demonstrated that their three-factor (in-role, helping, and voice behavior) measurement model was fairly stable over time (six months) and across raters (self, peers, and supervisor). They also found that supervisors recognized and rewarded voice because employees who exhibited voice at Time one received higher performance ratings at Time two.\n7zvf | However, despite the empirical evidence that voice is distinct from other work-related behaviors and has practical importance in work group contexts, researchers have not had much success in predicting voice. We suggest that this can be attributed to at least two factors: (a) focusing on satisfaction and excluding other theoretically relevant predictors, and (b) utilizing measures of voice with questionable construct validity.\nmov9 | Focus on Satisfaction\nks7m | Research on voice has emphasized the person-centered antecedents of satisfaction, dissatisfaction, or both. This emphasis can be attributed to Hirschman, who proposed that voice is a \"political\" response (as opposed to exit, which is an \"economic\" response) of organizational members or customers to their dissatisfaction with organizational-level decline. Researchers extended Hirschman's theory by proposing that voice is also a response to dissatisfaction with specific aspects of work in the context of high levels of overall job satisfaction or prior job satisfaction. This research on voice made a contribution because it provided an initial theoretical framework for assessing a key antecedent of voice. The emphasis on a single antecedent (satisfaction) or type of antecedent (person-centered) is also consistent with initial research in many areas.\nw1w1 | Researchers have traditionally attempted to predict human behavior using either person-centered (e.g., affect, abilities, personality) or situation-centered (e.g., job characteristics, social settings) variables. Recently, however, researchers have begun to recognize that most human behavior is influenced by many independent factors and that relationships may vary systematically depending on the situation and vice-versa \nh8gv | VOICE IN WORK GROUPS\nkwkp | . Thus, there is a need to develop predictive models that consider the independent and joint effects of theoretically relevant personal and situational variables.\nyj0m | Several recent studies on behaviors closely related to voice illustrate the use of both personal and situational antecedents in the same model. Near and Miceli, for example, theorized that individual and situational variables affect the outcome of whistle-blowing. Scott and Bruce found support for their hypotheses relating both individual and situational variables to innovative behavior. Ford included both individual and situational variables in his model of creative behavior. Finally, and more directly relevant to our approach, Van Dyne et al. proposed an initial nomological network for voice that included both person-centered (affective states and individual differences) and situational (contextual factors) antecedents. In summary, given that satisfaction is only one of several theoretically relevant variables, it is not surprising that predicting employee voice behavior has been difficult.\newfp | Measurement of Voice\noczy | Schwab pointed out that concern for measurement has been viewed as secondary to substantive issues in the early stages of research on most new constructs. We suggest that this has been the case with research on voice and the result has been weak and inconsistent empirical findings. First, voice scales used in past research included items with questionable content validity. For example, Leck and Saunders's five-item scale contained the items \"Voluntarily wear clothing (hat, jacket, pin, etc.) that bears your organization's symbol or insignia\" and \"Say good things about your job even when others criticize it.\" The inclusion of such items in scales designed to measure voice inevitably causes construct contamination and construct stretching, which may inflate or deflate observed validity coefficients depending on the extent of criterion contamination or deficiency. Second, researchers have used voice scales with low internal consistency reliability. Low reliability attenuates validity coefficients. Third, most research on voice has used self-reported frequency or intentions/likelihood of engaging in voice behaviors rather than observed frequency of actual behavior. Because of the challenging nature of voice, it is problematic to assume that intentions translate into behavior. To the extent that this assumption does not hold, intention-based measures of voice lack construct validity, which may inflate or deflate the size of relationships depending on what is actually being measured.\n2ttg | Summary\nhis3 | To date, researchers have not had great success in predicting voice. This shortcoming can be attributed to (a) focusing on a single antecedent and (b) using measures with questionable construct validity. Although such shortcomings often occur in relatively new research domains, developing and testing more detailed models and using measures with construct validity will advance theoretical understanding and suggest interventions that can be applied by managers. The objective of this article is to use theory and recent empirical findings to develop and test an initial set of voice antecedents. Following the general recommendations of interactionists and more specific recommendations regarding voice, we propose and assess a predictive model of voice including both person-centered and situational antecedents. In addition, we use a measure of voice with initial evidence of construct validity.\nm50z | Person-Centered Antecedents\nme84 | Although a large number of person-centered characteristics could be considered in a predictive model of voice, practical and statistical concerns limit any single study to a manageable subset of those characteristics. Therefore, in our study, we chose to focus on one person-centered characteristic from each category suggested by Van Dyne et al.; i.e., affective characteristics and individual differences. Building on past voice research, we chose satisfaction as our affective construct because it is the key antecedent in existing models of voice. Extending past research, we included global self-esteem. Global self-esteem was chosen because of its importance in predicting behavior that is somewhat risky to the self.\no56m | Satisfaction With the Group",
