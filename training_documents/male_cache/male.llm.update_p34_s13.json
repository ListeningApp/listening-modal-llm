        "content": "c8ra | i) Maturational Changes of Spermatozoa: As spermatozoa emerge from the testis and appear in the caput epididymis, they possess no progressive motility and have no in vivo fertilizing capacity. Sperm acquire these two properties gradually during transit through the epididymis. Maturation may involve deposition of specific glycoproteins on the sperm surface. Additional changes include a change in net sperm surface charge; alterations in sperm-lectin binding properties; changes in immunoreactivity and iodination characteristics; acquisition of an increased capacity for glycolysis; modification of adenylate cyclase activity; alterations in cellular phospholipid and phospholipid-like fatty acid content; formation of disulfide bonds within the nucleus and tail and oxidation of sperm membrane sulfhydryl groups; and an increased ability to adhere to the zona pellucida. Full fertilization capacity and motility of spermatozoa is probably not achieved until they reach the cauda epididymis. The motility and fertilization capacity of epididymal sperm is regulated by androgens.\np1l0 | d) Release of Spermatozoa: The release of spermatozoa during ejaculation is mediated by short, adrenergic contractions of the cauda epididymis and vas deferens. Spermatozoa are then mixed with the secretions of the accessory glands.\n1i8b | e) Elimination of Aged Spermatozoa: Although the epididymal environment is favorable for survival of sperm, they are not preserved indefinitely and gradually age and lose their viability:\n5sfj | i) After prolonged sexual rest, the spermatozoa first lose their fertilizing ability, then motility, and finally disintegrate.\nvk4h | ii) Unejaculated spermatozoa may be eliminated by phagocytosis or spontaneous emissions or may be flushed from the urethra by urine.\nnsm3 | iii) Unless older spermatozoa are eliminated at regular intervals, their incidence in the ejaculate increases with less frequent intercourse. After long periods of anejaculation, the first few ejaculates contain more aged spermatozoa, and fertility may be reduced.\njdfw | f) Summary of Epididymal Function\nuc9r | i) Sperm maturation\nl0ap | ii) Stabilization of condensed chromatin\nx815 | iii) Changes in surface charge of the plasma membrane\nepbj | iv) New sperm surface proteins\nnmn2 | v) Sperm storage\ng3tm | vi) Sperm transport by peristalsis\ntfra | Sixteen) Vas Deferens: is located within the spermatic cord. The vas deferens is severed at the time of vasectomy, a simple surgical sterilization procedure.\n5lm9 | a) Lining epithelium: Pseudostratified columnar cells\nwp2c | b) Muscular wall: Inner and outer layers of longitudinally oriented muscle separated by a middle circular layer.\nus5v | Seventeen) Spermatic cord: contains not only the vas deferens, but also the cremaster muscle, spermatic artery and veins of the pampiniform plexus.\nrs2m | Eighteen) Ampulla: the dilated portion of the ductus deferens leading to the ejaculatory duct, which passes through the prostate to empty into the prostatic urethra at the seminal colliculus.\nuz9y | Nineteen) Prostate: The largest accessory gland of the male urogenital tract consisting of thirty to fifty branched tubuloalveolar glands that empty into the prostatic urethra. Prostatic fluid contributes fifteen to thirty percent or about zero point five milliliters to the volume of the semen. The clear, slightly acidic fluid is characterized by a high citric acid content, as well as acid phosphatase and zinc. Citric acid may be important in maintaining the osmotic equilibrium in semen. Prostatic fluid contains the enzymes required for liquefaction of the ejaculate coagulum.\n8ov0 | a) Regions of the Prostate:\nmj9m | i) Periurethral mucosal glands\n94h3 | ii) Periurethral submucosal glands\n9jx1 | iii) Peripheral compound glands (main glands)\nc3lz | b) Cell types: The glands are lined by simple or pseudostratified columnar epithelium. The lumen contains prostatic concretions (corpora amylacea) rich in glycoproteins and sometimes calcium deposits.\n8bwk | c) Prostate Functions: Prostatic fluid contributes fifteen to thirty percent or about zero point five milliliters to the volume of the semen. The clear, slightly acidic fluid is characterized by a high citric acid content, as well as acid phosphatase and zinc. Citric acid may be important in maintaining the osmotic equilibrium in semen. Prostatic fluid contains the enzymes required for liquefaction of the ejaculate coagulum. Secretions are acidic, pH six point five. The prostate secretes prostate-specific acid phosphatase, prostate-specific antigen-amylase, and fibrinolysin.\nez9s | Twenty) Seminal Vesicles: The epithelial cells have a large Golgi with secretory granules. The fluid from the seminal vesicles contributes forty-five to eighty percent or two point zero to two point five milliliters of the ejaculate volume. The fluid is rich in fructose and prostaglandins. Fructose is the major source of glycolytic energy available to the spermatozoa. Fructose is often used as a marker for seminal vesicle presence function and ejaculatory duct obstruction in the azoospermic human. The seminal vesicles and the vas deferens are derived from the same embryonic origin. If the vas deferens is congenitally absent, the seminal vesicles will also be absent, and fructose will be absent in the ejaculate. Therefore, the absence of fructose in the ejaculate is indicative of congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens and or seminal vesicles. The absence of fructose may also be indicative of obstruction of the ejaculatory ducts. Seminal prostaglandins may play a role in the urethral muscle contractions that occur during ejaculation or may aid sperm transport in the female reproductive tract. Fluids from the seminal vesicles also contain the enzymes required for the formation of the ejaculate coagulum. The seminal vesicle is an androgen-dependent organ that is characterized by the presence of:\nmqot | i) Outer connective tissue layer\noc99 | ii) Middle circular and longitudinal smooth muscle layer\ngipz | iii) Inner folded mucosa: Lined by simple cuboidal-to-pseudostratified columnar epithelium\nb4wj | b) Function of the Seminal Vesicles:\n5xlt | i) Fructose\n9bz4 | ii) Fluid: Contributing about fifty to seventy percent of the seminal fluid\nyfv2 | Twenty-one) Male Accessory Structures:\npujl | a) The urethra in a human male is twenty centimeters long\n3rqe | i) Prostatic urethra: Receives the ejaculatory duct and ducts of the prostate\nnsi3 | ii) Membranous urethra: The shortest segment\nnil3 | iii) Penile urethra: Receives the ducts of the bulbourethral glands\n68a1 | iv) Cell Types:\nseik | (one) Transitional urothelium: changes from a pseudostratified-to-stratified columnar epithelium in membranous and penile urethra.\noq7c | (two) Muscle layer: in membranous urethra with smooth muscle sphincter, involuntary, and a striated muscle sphincter, voluntary, that controls the passage of urine or semen.\nz4mi | b) Cowper and Littré Glands: The Cowper, bulbourethral, glands and glands of Littré, urethral glands, secrete the fluid forming the first part of the ejaculate. The combined secretions of these glands, equal to approximately zero point one to zero point two milliliters, about five percent of the total ejaculate, is a clear fluid rich in mucoproteins, which are thought to lubricate the distal urethra.\nhkft | i) Bulbourethral glands:\njai3 | (one) Histology: Lined with mucus-secreting epithelium",
