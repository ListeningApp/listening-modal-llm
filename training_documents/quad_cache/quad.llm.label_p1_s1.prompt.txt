You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

1pjs | Quadratic Voting How Mechanism Design Can Radicalize Democracy
o2kr | Vickrey (1961) launched mechanism design as a project to implement Lerner (1944)'s "so- cialist" dreams of welfare optimality absent a benevolent and omniscient planner. When Vick- rey became a Nobel Laureate, he announced that he planned to bring this vision to the broader public using the "bully pulpit" the prize afforded him, but he sadly died days later. Furthermore, while Vickrey's ambitions gained some early ad- herents (Tideman and Tullock, 1976), experi- ence (Ausubel and Milgrom, 2005; Rothkopf, 2007) and Vickrey's own warnings suggested his exact scheme was usually impractical.
v6sk | Thus, while mechanism design transformed economic theory, the novel mechanisms it sug- gests have largely been treated as a series of insightful theoretical curiosities of little practi- cal relevance or applied in quite narrow settings, for example to spectrum and internet advertising auctions (Milgrom, 2004; Edelman et al., 2007). In a book that will come out as this article does (Posner and Weyl, 2018) one of us aims to re- vive the more radical ambitions of mechanism design and suggest they may offer a solution to the economic, political and social crisis of our times.
1wj6 | Perhaps the most glaring element of that crisis has been the struggles of democracies to resolve majority-minority conflicts and the resulting as- cendancy of "populist" tyrannies of the major- ity or plurality. This oldest and most persis- tent problem of democracy seems particularly to lend itself to Vickrey's approach both because of its sweeping scope and because the basic prob- lem seems to be precisely the lack of markets.

dpv6 | sion to each voter, preventing potential Pareto- improving trade. When we complain about the failure of standard democracy to account for in- tensity of preference or knowledge, we mean that it blocks trades where some citizens would be willing to give up their influence on some is- sues to gain more influence on others. Further- more, given that the standard market system of exchange may be derived as a limit of Vickrey's procedure in a large society (Tideman and Plass- mann, Forthcoming), it seems natural that apply- ing a similar logic to public goods could yield a solution.
8r5j | Yet, to our knowledge, prior to our work on the subject no simple and flexible pricing sys- tem for collective decisions that could apply to common settings such as binary decisions had been proposed.1 Groves and Ledyard (1977) and Hylland and Zeckhauser (1980) proposed closely related market systems for choosing con- tinuous public goods, but groups of voters rarely directly choose continuous public goods. Here we propose a simple version of Hylland and Zeckhauser's scheme for the common setting of communities making repeated binary collective decisions. As with the market system for pri- vate goods, it is the large population limit (this time for public goods) of Vickrey's scheme and we will show that it is the unique way to price votes that achieves optimality in a "price-taking" model analogous to the conditions under which markets achieve optimality.
2taz | I. Price-Theoretic Model
o3ya | Consider a society of N voters i = 1, . .. N where many binary collective decisions (e.g. referenda or choice of leaders) arise. To create the opportunity for market trade, each voter is endowed with a large stock of "voice credits" that they may spend influencing the outcome of
r5il | PAPERS AND PROCEEDINGS
5gui | these decisions. As is common in the analysis of markets for private goods (Willig, 1976), we assume there are enough issues and that each is sufficiently inconsequential that every voter has a quasi-linear "continuation value" for retaining voice credits for future votes. As in the theory of fair resource allocation (Varian, 1974), we as- sume that voice credits have been distributed in a manner (such as equal division) considered fair by the relevant society in the sense that max- imizing total equivalent continuation value in units of voice credits defines social optimality.
82qc | Consider some particular decision. Call the value that voters would receive, in units of voice credits, for seeing alternative A prevail over al- ternative B 2uj, with negative values indicat- ing a preference for B over A. The commu- nity votes to determine which alternative is im- plemented, with each voter choosing a continu- ous number of votes vi either positive or nega- tive depending on which alternative she favors. A is implemented just when i Vi ≥ 0. Each voter pays a cost c (vi) voice credits for her votes where c is differentiable, convex, even and strictly increasing in |vi| to a central clearing house. We describe c as a vote pricing rule.
ls7d | A game-theoretic analysis would specify be- liefs of each voter about the distribution of val- ues and derive an equilibrium strategy. We con- duct such an analysis, which involves narrow as- sumptions about beliefs and behavior and sta- tistical subtleties, elsewhere (Lalley and Weyl, 2017). We focus here instead on a price- taking approximation (Weyl, Forthcoming) that appears to be valid more broadly (Weyl, 2017) and shows simply the core logic.
tzt3 | We thus assume that each voter, in decid- ing how many votes to purchase, weighs the marginal cost of an additional vote against the perceived chance the vote will be pivotal in swinging the election. The price-taking assump- tion we adopt, originally proposed by Mueller (1973) and Laine (1977), is that all voters agree on this marginal pivotality of votes p. Under this assumption, a rational voter will choose vi to maximize 2pvjuj - c (vi). By our assumption that vote credits are distributed fairly, society wishes to implement A exactly when Lilli > 0. We say a vote pricing rule is robustly optimal if, for every p > 0, N and vector u, each price- taking voter i chooses votes v so that it has the same sign as Li Ui.

qvnu | II. Uniqueness
kggw | Our main result is that the set of robustly op- timal vote pricing rules are precisely the set of quadratic rules.
xrd1 | THEOREM 1: A vote pricing rule is robustly optimal if and only if it is quadratic.
5746 | PROOF:
7toz | See our online Appendix.
j346 | The central idea of the omitted formal proof is that quadratic functions are the only ones with linear derivatives and thus the only functions where a voter buying votes equates her marginal benefit and cost at a number of votes propor- tional to her value. Consider the class of vote pricing rules c(x) = xª for a > 1. The first- order condition for voter optimization is, by dif- ferentiation,
v8uq | 2pui = a (Vi)a1 =
x972 | 1 = sign(4) (2) a-1 Ui a-I 1
cwrw | If a = 2 this leads to vt proportional to u; and thus robust optimality. For any other a, vt is not proportional to uj and thus the costly voting rule will be suboptimal for some arrangements of values and p.
4i0e | In constrast, consider the extremes of a -> 1 (as voting cost approaches linear) and a > co (as voting cost becomes very convex). In the for- mer case, the power on ui determining vå be- comes infinite and thus voters with only slightly greater values will vote infinitely more. Linear voting thus leads to dictatorship of the most in- tense voter, as in Casella et al. (2012). This re- flects the common intuition against vote trading: allowing it will lead to capture by the most in- tense special interests.
h2l3 | In the case of a > co, the power on ui ap- proaches 0 so all voters buy exactly one vote in the direction of their preference as in 1p1v. In this sense, QV is an optimal intermediate point between the extremes of dictatorship and major- ity rule. It is the one vote pricing rule under which voters who intend only their own gain are led, as if by an invisible hand, to advance the in- terests of society. We refer to voting based on a quadratic pricing rule as Quadratic Voting (QV) for obvious reasons.

awvu | III. Practical Promise
on9b | While price-taking is a useful heuristic, it is unlikely to literally hold in game theoretic mod- els of voter behavior. In other work, we have considered a variety of these models. In Lalley and Weyl (2017) we consider the most canonical case from the game theoretic literature, in which voters values are drawn independently and iden- tically from a known value distribution and act as rational, risk-neutral expected utility maxi- mizers. We show that under appropriate condi- tions and in all symmetric Bayes-Nash equilib- ria in large populations the price-taking assump- tion approximately holds for almost all voters and thus that the welfare losses from QV decay, generically at a rate - as the population grows. In another parallel to markets, this is the same rate of convergence of private goods markets to- wards efficiency as competition grows.
a8ge | The structure of game theoretic equilibrium is quite subtle and thus our rigorous mathematical proof of this result is long and technical. How- ever, taking the approximations that we rigor- ously prove hold in this case to hold, appropri- ately adjusted, in other cases and using numeri- cal methods, allows analysis of QV for other en- vironments. In Chandar and Weyl (2017) one of us, with another co-author, considers the base- line model in smaller populations for a range of distributions numerically and finds that the wel- fare lost from QV relative to the optimum is very small (rarely more than a few percentage points) while that lost under 1p1v may easily be near one hundred percent.
h27a | In Weyl (2017) one of us uses these approxi- mations to allow for collusion, uncertainty about the value distribution and the possibility that vot- ers are not perfectly rational and consequential- ist. In some of these settings QV performs better than in our baseline and it rarely has more than a very small welfare loss, again in contrast to 1p1v. Furthermore, laboratory experiments on QV (Goeree and Zhang, 2017; Cárdenas et al., 2014) are largely consistent with these robust- ness conclusions. While participants do not play precisely as game theoretic equilibrium would predict, votes are generally linearly proportional to values with some noise, leading to outcome much closer to optimal than 1p1v.
pdjh | Each of these results has important limitations on its own; some are in stylized, or specific ex-

bd9h | perimental, settings, while others are approxi- mate or numerical. Together, however, we be- lieve they suggest significant promise as they illustrate the robustness of this simple yet (ap- proximately) optimal voting rule. This contrasts with other voting rules which are either optimal, but widely seen as too fragile to apply in prac- tice, or which do not aim at optimality.
m047 | In the first category, the most famous pro- posal was Vickrey's original scheme as refined by Clarke (1971) and Groves (1973), the first fully optimal mechanism. However, this ap- proach is extremely sensitive to collusion by even a very small group (Ausubel and Milgrom, 2005). It also requires large and highly uncer- tain expenditures of money that make it heavily dependent on using real money rather than voice credits (Greenberg et al., 1977), a possibility that may be unjust given the inequality of wealth in most societies (Laurence and Sher, 2017; Ober, 2017). As noted in our introduction, to address these problems, Groves and Ledyard (1977) and Hylland and Zeckhauser (1980) proposed mech- anism closely related to QV, but only applica- ble to continuous public goods problems, which rarely arise in practical applications. Other op- timal mechanisms proposed in the literature are even less robust (Weyl, 2017). Given this, prac- tical attention has primarily focused on mecha- nisms that do not aspire to even approximate op- timality, such as ones that do not allow expres- sion of preference intensity (Brams and Fish- burn, 1978) or are like QV but with a linear costly voting function (Casella, 2005; Hortala- Vallve, 2012) and thus induce dictatorship of the most intense voters.
gy8c | QV aims to combine the simplicity and practi- cality of this latter group of designs with an ap- proximation to the optimality of the first. This has allowed applications to polling and survey research (Quarfoot et al., 2017; Holland, 2017), where evidence from initial studies shows sig- nificant improvements over existing methods of preference elicitation. Higher-stakes applica- tions to politics (Posner and Weyl, 2015) or cor- porate governance (Posner and Weyl, 2014) re- main far more speculative and are not advis- able without further experimentation at smaller scales.

vpgq | IV. Radical Democracy, Radical Markets
ousl | However, cautious but increasingly ambitious experimentation seem warranted given the po- tential of QV to create a truly radical democ- racy in several senses. First, and most mechani- cally, QV may also be viewed as individuals re- ceiving votes equal to the square root or radi- cal of the voice credits they spend. Second, QV gets to the roots of what the framers of mod- ern democratic institutions, such as Alexander Hamilton, the Marquis de Condorcet and Jeremy Bentham, viewed as the aim of democracy: to ensure the state serves the general happiness of the people maximally. Third, QV radically ex- pands the rights of citizens to fully and freely ex- press their political views, liberating them from the straight jacket of 1p1v influence rationing. In this sense, it shows how mechanism design can suggest fundamental and yet also practical reforms of social institutions.
