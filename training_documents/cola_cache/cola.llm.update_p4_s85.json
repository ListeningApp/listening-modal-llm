The oxidants and additives in CBs result in proteins oxidation, cell damages and reduce sperm motility.\notkr | In our study, we found that testes masses of PEP-two, COC-one and COC-two groups were increased in comparison with PEP-one and CG on day fifteen. The testes longitudinal and transverse diameters become larger as compared to CG. Our initial experiments demonstrated that Pepsi-Cola and Coca-Cola could reduce ovarian weight, inhibited the development of follicles and oocytes. Pepsi-Cola and Coca-Cola obviously reduced pregnancy rate and fetus numbers of female mice, such affected reproduction behaviors\nibgs | of female mice. Our results revealed serum EGF contents of COC-two and PEP-two were higher than that of CG. These findings demonstrated high doses of Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola could enhance EGF activity and testosterone secretion. These are in agreement with our previous study in rabbits. However, the effects have to be deeply studied. Its mechanisms also have to be further explained in other mammals in the future.\nd6r4 | Androgen and its receptor affect the development of normal prostate and prostate cancer. In the present study, we investigated the effects of Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola on androgen receptor expression levels in the mouse testes. The findings indicated AR mRNA and protein levels of the CBs-treated mice were strikingly increased when compared\n9mrz | Carbonated beverages effects on androgen receptor in mice\npk06 | to CG normal level. Nowadays, scarce document is reported on this subject. Such, these findings still need to be validated in the future.\n7wn9 | In conclusion, drinking Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola could promote testis development, enhance testosterone secretion, increase serum EGF concentrations, also accelerated expressions of AR protein in the mice testes. Our findings provided the scientific bases and for fully understanding CBs effects and their mechanism on development and reproduction functions of humans, but also benefit to prevent prostate dysfunction and cancer.\nwcd0 | Conflict of interest\ncaos | Ethical Approval\nqrvy | The research protocol was approved by the Experiment Animal Care and Use Committee of Gansu province, the People's Republic of China. All mice were treated as per ethical rules.\npn9j | Funding/Support\n1pmc | The work received the support of the Project of National Key research and Development Program of China in thirteenth Five-year Plan, the Reproductive Biotechnology Innovation Team of Animals of Colleges and Universities of Gansu Province of China, and National Natural Science Foundation of the People's Republic of China.\n```",
