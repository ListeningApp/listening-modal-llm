You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

byu8 | Quadratic Voting How Mechanism Design Can Radicalize Democracy
76b0 | Vickrey (1961) launched mechanism design as a project to implement Lerner (1944)'s "so- cialist" dreams of welfare optimality absent a benevolent and omniscient planner. When Vick- rey became a Nobel Laureate, he announced that he planned to bring this vision to the broader public using the "bully pulpit" the prize afforded him, but he sadly died days later. Furthermore, while Vickrey's ambitions gained some early ad- herents (Tideman and Tullock, 1976), experi- ence (Ausubel and Milgrom, 2005; Rothkopf, 2007) and Vickrey's own warnings suggested his exact scheme was usually impractical.
zxz6 | Thus, while mechanism design transformed economic theory, the novel mechanisms it sug- gests have largely been treated as a series of insightful theoretical curiosities of little practi- cal relevance or applied in quite narrow settings, for example to spectrum and internet advertising auctions (Milgrom, 2004; Edelman et al., 2007). In a book that will come out as this article does (Posner and Weyl, 2018) one of us aims to re- vive the more radical ambitions of mechanism design and suggest they may offer a solution to the economic, political and social crisis of our times.
xnth | Perhaps the most glaring element of that crisis has been the struggles of democracies to resolve majority-minority conflicts and the resulting as- cendancy of "populist" tyrannies of the major- ity or plurality. This oldest and most persis- tent problem of democracy seems particularly to lend itself to Vickrey's approach both because of its sweeping scope and because the basic prob- lem seems to be precisely the lack of markets.
vafm | One-person-one-vote (1p1v) rations a sin- gle unit of influence on any collective deci-
2zmw | sion to each voter, preventing potential Pareto- improving trade. When we complain about the failure of standard democracy to account for in- tensity of preference or knowledge, we mean that it blocks trades where some citizens would be willing to give up their influence on some is- sues to gain more influence on others. Further- more, given that the standard market system of exchange may be derived as a limit of Vickrey's procedure in a large society (Tideman and Plass- mann, Forthcoming), it seems natural that apply- ing a similar logic to public goods could yield a solution.
bf9k | Yet, to our knowledge, prior to our work on the subject no simple and flexible pricing sys- tem for collective decisions that could apply to common settings such as binary decisions had been proposed.1 Groves and Ledyard (1977) and Hylland and Zeckhauser (1980) proposed closely related market systems for choosing con- tinuous public goods, but groups of voters rarely directly choose continuous public goods. Here we propose a simple version of Hylland and Zeckhauser's scheme for the common setting of communities making repeated binary collective decisions. As with the market system for pri- vate goods, it is the large population limit (this time for public goods) of Vickrey's scheme and we will show that it is the unique way to price votes that achieves optimality in a "price-taking" model analogous to the conditions under which markets achieve optimality.
otkr | I. Price-Theoretic Model
ibgs | Consider a society of N voters i = 1, . .. N where many binary collective decisions (e.g. referenda or choice of leaders) arise. To create the opportunity for market trade, each voter is endowed with a large stock of "voice credits" that they may spend influencing the outcome of
colo | these decisions. As is common in the analysis of markets for private goods (Willig, 1976), we assume there are enough issues and that each is sufficiently inconsequential that every voter has a quasi-linear "continuation value" for retaining voice credits for future votes. As in the theory of fair resource allocation (Varian, 1974), we as- sume that voice credits have been distributed in a manner (such as equal division) considered fair by the relevant society in the sense that max- imizing total equivalent continuation value in units of voice credits defines social optimality.
d6r4 | Consider some particular decision. Call the value that voters would receive, in units of voice credits, for seeing alternative A prevail over al- ternative B 2uj, with negative values indicat- ing a preference for B over A. The commu- nity votes to determine which alternative is im- plemented, with each voter choosing a continu- ous number of votes vi either positive or nega- tive depending on which alternative she favors. A is implemented just when i Vi ≥ 0. Each voter pays a cost c (vi) voice credits for her votes where c is differentiable, convex, even and strictly increasing in |vi| to a central clearing house. We describe c as a vote pricing rule.
9mrz | A game-theoretic analysis would specify be- liefs of each voter about the distribution of val- ues and derive an equilibrium strategy. We con- duct such an analysis, which involves narrow as- sumptions about beliefs and behavior and sta- tistical subtleties, elsewhere (Lalley and Weyl, 2017). We focus here instead on a price- taking approximation (Weyl, Forthcoming) that appears to be valid more broadly (Weyl, 2017) and shows simply the core logic.
pk06 | We thus assume that each voter, in decid- ing how many votes to purchase, weighs the marginal cost of an additional vote against the perceived chance the vote will be pivotal in swinging the election. The price-taking assump- tion we adopt, originally proposed by Mueller (1973) and Laine (1977), is that all voters agree on this marginal pivotality of votes p. Under this assumption, a rational voter will choose vi to maximize 2pvjuj - c (vi). By our assumption that vote credits are distributed fairly, society wishes to implement A exactly when Lilli > 0. We say a vote pricing rule is robustly optimal if, for every p > 0, N and vector u, each price- taking voter i chooses votes v so that it has the same sign as Li Ui.
7wn9 | II. Uniqueness
wcd0 | Our main result is that the set of robustly op- timal vote pricing rules are precisely the set of quadratic rules.
caos | THEOREM 1: A vote pricing rule is robustly optimal if and only if it is quadratic.
qrvy | PROOF:
pn9j | See our online Appendix.
1pmc | 2pui = a (Vi)a1 =
5z6q | 1 = sign(4) (2) a-1 Ui a-I 1
yeoh | If a = 2 this leads to vt proportional to u; and thus robust optimality. For any other a, vt is not proportional to uj and thus the costly voting rule will be suboptimal for some arrangements of values and p.
b8hf | In constrast, consider the extremes of a -> 1 (as voting cost approaches linear) and a > co (as voting cost becomes very convex). In the for- mer case, the power on ui determining vå be- comes infinite and thus voters with only slightly greater values will vote infinitely more. Linear voting thus leads to dictatorship of the most in- tense voter, as in Casella et al. (2012). This re- flects the common intuition against vote trading: allowing it will lead to capture by the most in- tense special interests.
