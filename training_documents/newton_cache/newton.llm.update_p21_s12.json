Proof of Theorem three point three. We posit that the algorithm must terminate in at most\na9ul | K equals ceiling of F subscript zero minus F subscript asterisk times epsilon subscript g to the power of negative two over minimum of c subscript one, c subscript two iterations, where\n9jxp | c subscript one equals rho minimum of two varsigma times one minus rho minimum of one, varsigma C subscript varsigma, L subscript g squared over L subscript g, varsigma C subscript varsigma, L subscript g, two times one minus rho omega squared over L subscript g, omega, with omega equals eta over square root of eta squared plus L subscript g squared, c subscript two equals rho minimum of one half, one half minimum of two times one minus rho over L subscript g, one, minimum of one, varsigma, and C subscript varsigma, L subscript varrho is as in equation twenty. Suppose otherwise, that is, the algorithm fails to terminate until at least iteration K plus one. For iterations k equals one, to K, the termination conditions must be unsatisfied. We divide the iterates up in the following manner\nejzi | K subscript one equals k in the range K such that I of X subscript k, epsilon subscript g to the power of one half is not empty, norm of g subscript k by I is greater than or equal to epsilon subscript g, and\nlgbb | K subscript two equals k in the range K not in K subscript one such that A of X subscript k, epsilon subscript g to the power of one half is not empty, there exists I in A of X subscript k, epsilon subscript g to the power of one half, g subscript k by I less than negative square root of epsilon subscript g or norm of diag of X subscript k by A, g subscript k by A is greater than or equal to epsilon subscript g. Since the algorithm has not terminated, ceiling of K equals K subscript one union K subscript two. If k in K subscript one we apply Lemma B point three and combine the SOL and NPC\nhdy5 | cases with epsilon subscript q less than one to obtain F of X subscript k plus one minus F of X subscript k is less than negative rho minimum of two varsigma times one minus rho minimum of one, varsigma C subscript varsigma, L subscript g squared over L subscript g, varsigma C subscript varsigma, L subscript g, two times one minus rho omega squared over L subscript g, omega epsilon subscript g squared equals negative c subscript one epsilon subscript g squared.\nrlsz | Inexact Newton-type Methods for Optimisation with Nonnegativity Constraints\nwf16 | If k in K subscript two, we instead combine the results of Lemma B point four to obtain\nsyuf | F of X subscript k plus one minus F of X subscript k is less than negative rho minimum of two minimum one minus L subscript g.\nn8b1 | two times one minus P point one minimum of one, five, greater than epsilon subscript g less than or equal to negative C subscript two six epsilon subscript g.\nwurf | Finally, we obtain\nv7s4 | F subscript zero minus F subscript X is greater than or equal to F subscript zero minus F of X greater than or equal to F of X minus F of X subscript k plus one greater than or equal to absolute value of curly brackets C subscript one plus absolute value of K subscript two squared subscript k equals zero to K minus one\nyg3g | greater than or equal to absolute value of K plus absolute value of K subscript two minimum of c subscript one, c subscript two equals K minimum of c subscript one, c subscript two,\n7fo3 | which contradicts the definition of K.\nmwxk | C.
