You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

ob1z | We have developed a Bayesian changepoint identification algorithm, which (1) segments the genomic sequence into regions of the constant BAD using dynamic programming to maximize the marginal likelihood and then (2) assigns BAD with the maximal posterior to each segment (see "Methods"). An additional preprocessing employs distances between neighboring SNVs to exclude long deletions and centromeric regions from BAD estimation. The BAD caller in action is illustrated in Fig. 2a for two chromosomes using ENCODE K562 data (see the segmentation map of the complete genome with multiple deletions in Supplementary Fig. 2).
m4cb | We performed the BAD calling for 2556 groups of variant calls, where each group consisted of calls obtained from ChIP-Seq alignments for a particular cell type and GEO series or ENCODE biosample ID (i.e., for K562 cells of different studies, the BAD calling was performed independently). In BAD calling, recurrent SNVs sharing dbSNP IDs and found in different data sets within the same group were considered as independent observations. To systematically assess the reliability of the resulting BAD maps, we compared the predicted BADs at all SNVs with the ground truth BADs estimated from COSMIC28 CNV data for 76 matched cell
m61y | types, with K562 and MCF7 being the most represented. For K562 and multiple other cell types, the Kendall <LATEX>\tau _ { b }</LATEX> rank correlation was consistently better for joint data sets with higher numbers of SNVs (Fig. 2b), which justifies the usage of read counts at SNVs as point measurements of BAD.
u2ob | Genome structural variations are the most likely yet not the only reason for unbalanced allelic dosage in a particular genomic region. In our case, the agreement of BAD and COSMIC copy- number maps confirms the validity of BAD estimates. However, even suboptimal agreement between a BAD map and the copy- number profile is not a problem as soon as the allelic dosage is estimated correctly.
2gnm | Particularly, we found that BAD maps of MCF7 agreed poorly with COSMIC independently from the number of SNVs in the data set. To clarify the issue, we processed external deep genomic sequencing data for MCF7 with the ADASTRA pipeline (see "Methods"). The resulting BAD map from these data was not dependent on the ChIP procedure but agreed reasonably well with the MCF7 BAD maps from ChIP-enriched data sets, thus validating the ChIP-Seq-based BAD maps for MCF7 cells (see Supplementary Fig. 2).
emgw | Of note, the ChIP-independent BAD map for MCF7 still rather poorly agreed with the COSMIC copy numbers markup (SNP- level Kendall <LATEX>\tau _ { b }</LATEX> ~0.2), suggesting that for MCF7 the latter is likely an inadequate proxy for the actual BAD. We have no ultimate explanation for this observation but would like to remark that MCF7 was found among the most unstable cell types29, which probably leads to discrepancies between exact CNV profiles and BAD estimates for cells originating from different studies.
xaqt | Additionally, we have analyzed microarray-based CNV estimates for major cell types29, including 13 cell types matching across these data, COSMIC, and our study (Supplementary Fig. 3). Interestingly, when compared to COSMIC, those data showed a higher correlation for MCF7 rather than for K562 cells. To a varying degree, such discrepancies can be observed for other cell types. Thus, careless recruitment of copy-number profiles obtained with different methods from different data sources as estimates of BAD may reduce the reliability of called ASBs, the disadvantage that is avoided by using BAD estimates directly from ChIP-Seq data.
5rcb | As a separate test, we used the predicted BAD maps as multiple binary classifiers for different BAD values using SNP calls across all cell types. With the COSMIC data as the ground truth, we plotted a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and a precision- recall curve (PRC) for each BAD (Fig. 2c, d). For the most widespread BADs (1-3) covering more than 90% of candidate SNVs (Supplementary Fig. 3), we reached >0.83 area under curve for ROC and 0.66-85 for PRC (Supplementary Table 3), proving the reliability of the predicted BAD maps.
524j | With BAD maps at hand, we segregated the variant calls from all data sets by BAD and by fixed read coverage either at reference or alternative alleles. Then, for each such set of SNVs, we fitted the background distribution as a mixture of two negative binomial distributions with BAD-determined p parameters (see "Methods"). ASBs were called independently for the reference (Ref-ASB) and the alternative (Alt-ASB) allele using separately fit background distributions for the fixed read counts at alternative and reference alleles, respectively, thus accounting for general read mapping bias.
xd3m | Overview of the ADASTRA database. The results of the ASB calling are provided in the ADASTRA database (the database of ADASTRA factor binding sites). In ADASTRA, each dbSNP ID can have several ASB entries for different TFs or cell types. ADASTRA consists of two parts: the first part (TF-ASB, 233290
8qb6 | ASBs at 147909 SNPs) contains ASB obtained by aggregation of individual P values for each TF over cell types. The listed ASBs passed multiple testing correction (P <0.05 after Benjamini-Hochberg adjustment for the number of tested ASBs). P value estimation (see below), aggregation, and multiple testing correction were performed separately for ASBs with preferred binding to the reference (Ref-ASB) and alternative (Alt-ASB) alleles, and for each TF. The other part of the database (CT-ASB, 351967 ASBs at 252469 SNPs) contains a similar aggregation of individual ASBs over TFs for each cell type.
wkbn | TFs and cell types were unequally represented in the source data. Thus, the numbers of the resulting ASB calls were also biased toward most studied cell types and TFs (Fig. 3a, b), with the top contributions from CTCF for TFs and K562 for cell types. However, the top 8 TFs and top 5 cell types covered only half of ASB calls (for cell types) or less than a half of ASB calls (for TFs);
ftfg | thus, the produced data on ASB events is diverse across different samples.
7xi5 | Next, we assessed how ASBs and candidate SNVs are distributed in different genomic regions (Fig. 3c). Compared to all SNVs and tested candidate ASB sites, the significant ASBs were enriched in enhancers (~4x more than expected from the number of SNVs for which there were candidate ASBs, Fisher's exact test P < 10-300) and promoters (~3x more than expected, P < 10-300). We consider this observation consistent with both the actual location of functional TF-binding sites and deeper coverage of the actual TF-binding regions with ChIP-Seq reads. In fact, ASBs are likely to cluster at the scale of the typical ChIP- Seq peak width, as revealed by the distribution of pairwise distances between SNVs with and without ASBs, which has a bimodal shape (Supplementary Fig. 4). This effect is likely caused by peak-scale clustering of ChIP-Seq reads allowing for higher

ybik | and19, respectively. We additionally assembled a reproducible ASB set consisting of 2039 SNPs with ASBs detected in any two of those four ASB sets and found that ADASTRA included 1573 (77%) of the respective SNPs. Of note, taking pairwise, these four existing ASB data sets also poorly overlap each other (see Supplementary Table 4), suggesting that the major fraction of
