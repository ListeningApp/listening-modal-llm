        "content": "0fpw | Life in the 'buffer zone'\ndqn8 | The Ethiopian borderlands have been backwaters since two thousand, missing out on the development elsewhere in the country. The border towns and districts have been slowly dying, as the young move to other Ethiopian cities or migrate abroad for\ncop0 | better opportunities. As explained by an elderly farmer in the Irob district: 'We have failed them. Our community has failed them. Ethiopia has certainly failed them'.\nlhkq | While the borderland population thus has most to gain in development by reconnecting with their Eritrean counterparts, recent fieldwork in the twin villages of Kinin and Kinto on the Tsorona frontline indicates that similar sentiments are harboured on the Eritrean side too. This area has been militarily controlled by Ethiopian defence forces since a two thousand eleven border skirmish. The Eritrean villagers remained, however, and it is now administered by the neighbouring Ethiopian district (woreda) of Glomekeda in Adigrat zone. But the villagers are caught in a precarious situation, always worrying about possible snipers or the outbreak of a fire-fight, as the Eritrean trenches skirt the villages. While visiting the area, our research team had to stay in the shadows on the Ethiopia-facing side of the small dwellings, in order to stay hidden from Eritrean snipers.\n82ju | Life in the 'buffer zone' was full of challenges and villagers expressed their grievances about the lack of opportunities and development as long as the border was closed. After adolescence, the youth crossed the border to the south, either to migrate to third countries or seek educational or employment opportunities in Ethiopia. The alternative of staying in the village or going to Asmara or other Eritrean towns did not exist, since they knew that they then would end up in never-ending National Service duty. Even so, Geresus (name altered), a farmer in his early sixties, explained that they are in general doing fine as their livelihood is secured with plenty of farming land in no man's land's zone:\ny2qo | Although we do not receive any help or assistance from our local [Eritrean] authorities, Tigray administration is supplying us with all that we need in terms of social assistance and health care. And our children attend the local Tigrayan community school, as equals to their Ethiopian friends.\n1piq | But Geresus grieved for the separation of the two people, and longed for the time when the political leaders would allow the people to reconnect at the grassroots. 'We see that our children are friends with their Tigrayan school companions as if the war never happened. Hence, if only the rulers could leave us alone, things would get back to normal quickly'.\n7fqw | In several places in no man's land, children of both countries met while tending the cattle or fetching water from the springs located there. While visiting the trenches of Zalambessa in November two thousand seventeen, we talked to the young Ethiopian herders. They regularly played with Eritrean children to pass the time. A young boy regretted however, that they were not allowed to visit each other's houses, since they then had to pass the enemy trenches. Playing in no man's land under the watchful eyes of snipers from both sides, however, was allowed and a 'normalised' activity.\nrhaz | Citizens' reconciliation committees\nwak1 | The twin villages of Kinin and Kinto may not be representative of the broader Eritrean border population sentiment, as the area is still under Ethiopian military control. The interest of Eritrean border villages to reconnect with communities on the Ethiopian side, however, has manifested itself in several ways. For instance, the Ethiopian frontline commander in Zalambessa (the main crossing-point between Eritrea-Ethiopia on the road between Mekelle and Asmara) received a request in two thousand seventeen by the three neighbouring Eritrean villages to organise a joint market day for them to buy and sell their produce in Zalambessa. The Ethiopian commander accepted the request, on condition that they also received permission from Asmara in order to safeguard their security when crossing the militarised zone. No such permission was granted by Asmara, however.\nwtfz | At this time, individuals in Zalambessa and Senafe, the border town on the Eritrean side, were working to reestablish social interaction between the twin border settlements. This was later energised by the formal peace declaration, and citizens' reconciliation committees were established to lobby the authorities for an open border. During the summer of two thousand eighteen they started to prepare for the first public joint reconciliation celebration in Zalambessa on the first of September. Being impatient with the sluggishness of the opening of the border on the ground (as only air traffic opened in July), they wanted a public event to mark the new beginning of peace rapprochement at the grassroots. Although supported by local authorities, Zalambessa's reconciliation committee was a private citizens' initiative. On the day, Eritrean and Ethiopian artists were to entertain the crowds and traditional foods would be shared between the people. The event was sponsored by Ethiopian business enterprises, including food suppliers and a local beer brewery. Their counter- part reconciliation committee in the Eritrean border town of Senafe had organised a delegation of three hundred people to join in at the festivities in Zalambessa, and had received prior permission by the Eritrean force commander to cross over to the Ethiopian side. Early morning on the first of September the inhabitants of Zalambessa, in anticipation of the arriving Eritrean delegation, flocked to dismantle the Ethiopian defence line to clear the way for their Eritrean brothers and sisters. As time passed without any delegation appearing, and news spreading that they had been stopped\nqy1i | by the Eritrean military, two Ethiopian priests crossed the no man's land zone to clarify the matter with the Eritrean front line commander. There, they discovered that the former force commander and his unit had suddenly been removed, and a new force commander had been placed in charge. He excused himself to the Ethiopian priests saying that he had only been in that position for three days and had received no orders to allow Eritreans to pass into Zalambessa to participate in the reconciliation event.\n1k9e | It appears that the two governments in the capitals far from the borderlands would not allow their formal bilateral process to be overtaken by a grassroots-led reconciliation initiative aiming to soften the rigid inter-state border. The power to do so and to sanction 'reconciliation', was equal to the power to define 'enmity' and war, and was thus the prerogative of the political elites in the respective capitals.\n5bjs | The reconciliation event was conducted despite the absence of the formal Eritrean delegation. Many Eritreans living in Tigray, and a small delegation of Eritrean Afars crossing the border in the lowlands, still participated in the celebrations. At the event, the zonal administrator of Adigrat gave a moving speech addressing the shared history and community among the people of Eritrea and Ethiopia and pledging that the mistakes of the past should be rectified. He was optimistic that the border would be opened up for on-the-ground crossing after the eleventh of September, the Ethiopian New Year. Less than two weeks later, just before going to Jeddah to sign the second peace agreement, President Isaias Afwerki and Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed presided over the official opening of the border on the ground at Zalambessa, and the town was flooded by Eritreans who wanted to reconnect and reconcile with their Tigrayan counterparts.\nuodj | A faltering peace process\nk16v | A year and a half after signing the Eritrea-Ethiopia peace agreement - as this article was written - there appeared to have been no further formal institutionalisation of the peace rapprochement. No agreement formalising cross-border traffic, trade, tariffs, immigration, etc. had been ratified, nor had any information on the operations of the so-called High-level Committee, or its sub-committees mentioned in the peace agreement, been made known.",
