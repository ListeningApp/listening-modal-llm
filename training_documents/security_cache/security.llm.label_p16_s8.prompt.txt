You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

y2qo | There are two organisations that are widely recognised to have integrated best-practice security and risk management into every aspect of their wider management operations, one dealing with the issue of normal, daily low impact high-likelihood scenarios, and the other dealing with potentially more serious low-likelihood- high impact threats.
1piq | The first is Disney World, which has created a self-contained Kingdom within which one of the main selling- points for potential visitors is its safety. Although Disney World is designed to deal with a massive amount of people with the freedom to choose to do a massive amount of different activities, the underlying management system is one based on total control of their territory, so that once you are inside Disney World you are actually experiencing a totally managed experience. The second organization is El Al, the Israeli national airline, which since the first political hijacking of a plane on 21st June 1967 of an El Al plane from Rome to Tel Aviv airport (following the end of the 6-Day War), has maintained security in its airports and planes across the world for 45 years. Despite a couple of notable exceptions, specifically the killing of 26 people in an attack on Lod Airport (now Ben Gurion) in 1972 by members of the Lebanese-trained Japan Red Army, El Al is still considered as perhaps the most effective security management system in the world, and its methodologies are widely accepted as setting the bench-mark for securing mass access public areas. Although Disney World and El Al are seemingly faced with radically different threats, the methods they have devised to manage them are remarkably similar.
7fqw | 16
rhaz | The first concept common to both systems is Territory. Territory is that space over which you have control, and for which you take responsibility. For both Disney World and El Al, their territory begins a long way before you reach any actual buildings. In Orlando, Florida, there are signs welcoming you to Disney World from 30 miles away, telling you what documents you will need, informing you of what attractions are available, telling you what radio station to tune to for Disney world information. In Israel's Ben Gurion airport, the first check points are 2Kms from the actual airport, and are designed to give you the positive feeling that you are entering a safe zone, one where possible threats and problems have been identified and effectively mitigated. This First Point of Contact (FPoC) has two purposes. The first is to clearly mark the territory where you accept responsibility for creating and managing a safe space. The second is to allow the FPoC to act as an initial filtering system, allowing the initial security team to identify people who will not move through the system smoothly, who can then take be taken to the side and dealt with on an individual basis, without disrupting the main flow of business.
wak1 | The concept of Control of Territory is continued once the visitor is 'inside'. There is nowhere within Disney World, or within an Israeli airport or airline section, that is not under the control of someone who has the specific responsibility for maintaining the safety of that area. One writer told how his daughter developed a blister during a visit to Disney World and removed her shoes and socks. She was immediately identified and confronted. When told that this was not allowed 'for the safety of visitors', and that failure to replace her footwear would result in them being escorted from the grounds, she decided that the she would undergo the pain in order to be allowed to remain within the funfair.
wtfz | The second concept common to both organisations is the fact that 'Everyone is involved in security'. It is reasonable to presume that a small security team cannot maintain control and 'eyes on' to every possible situation that might develop. However, if everyone within the organisation is security aware, then the likelihood is that someone will become aware of a potential problem before it escalates into an actual threat, and that information can be passed on to the security team, who can then intervene in the most appropriate manner. This is not only relevant to traditional security threats, but is valid for any actions that could threaten the organisation. Although it seems that this is a simple principle, you only need to read the papers each day to see how organisations are putting themselves into danger because simple problems are allowed to develop into major threats, because although people are aware of them, no-one has taken the responsibility to inform someone in authority.
qy1i | The third principle of security management that both systems are based on is that of 'Tight Management'. Writing security manuals and lists of protocols is easy. Delivering and maintaining them at an effective level over time is almost impossible. The truth is that most security programmes fail because the policies that have been put into place are not adhered to, and then a culture of laziness or ignorance becomes embedded into the organisation. Both of the organisations discussed here have a very strong management system in place, so that there is a clearly-defined organizational culture that security management is important, everyone understands what they have to do, and control systems are in place to ensure that they do so. If you want to test the system, drop a chewing gum wrapper on the floor at Disney World and see how long it takes for someone to pick it up, and then inform you that littering is not allowed.
1k9e | The question therefore, is how can we adapt the lessons learned from these global security leaders, and introduce these highly effective security management models into our own organisations? Here are some of the basic security concepts that are common to both Disney World and El Al, and which can be easily applied to any operational situation.
5bjs | 5.2 Principle 1: Territory: Security in Depth
uodj | Territory is not just 'Space'. For example, if you were the manager of a factory with an attached car park, but you had no information about what was happening within that car-park, it could not be considered your 'Territory'. Even if you had information about the car-park - for example, through use of CCTV monitored from a central Control Room - but could only observe what was happening without being able to do anything about it, you would still not be able to consider that area your territory. So, one definition of Territory is 'that area over which you have both information and control'.
k16v | 17
b2lm | Once the concept of Territory as a function of information and control is accepted, the next question concerns exactly where our territory starts. This is a critical question in the process of developing an effective security management capability.
ti7f | Figure 9: The Attributes of Territory
oksu | Territory is defined by a Boundary. This is where the FPoC is made. Access Control allows easy entry to that territory for those who pose no problem, and gives the security system the opportunity to identify potential problems before they are able to make an approach to higher-risk areas deeper within the system (see Figure 9).
wtow | Any Territory is defined by Boundaries. It should be clear to anyone coming into your territory that they are now coming under your control - though that should be done in a friendly, welcoming way, rather than an officious, impersonal way. The Boundary is marked by the FPoC. Although the FPoC might be overtly security-based, as in a government building or military base, depending on the general threat environment it can also be seen in terms of 'Meet and Greet'. This form of security as 'customer care' can be seen in hundreds of different situations where security managers want to clearly mark the beginning of their territory, such as bars, where there is a Door Supervisor outside the door, 5-star hotels, where there is a doorman waiting to greet you, corporate headquarters, where there are security personnel who will show you to the reception desk, or shopping centres, where there are (or at least, should be!) security personnel at the main entrance.
o22k | There is always a balance between Freedom and Security. One way that we can calibrate the level of security is the distance between the FPoC and the thing that we are securing, and the number of barriers you need to pass to get there. As a basic rule, the greater the distance between the FPoC and the target, and the greater the number of barriers, the safer you are.
nwfz | 18
nvfy | Additional security can be created by increasing the distance from the FPoC and the main area that is being protected, and by the introduction of additional barriers. The basic principles behind Security in Depth (figure 10) are the same whether it is limiting access to the backstage area at a concert, the VIP room of a club, the Chairman's office in a major corporation or the research laboratories in a technology company.
mror | Figure 10: Security in Depth
zlxc | 5.3 Principle 2: Total Cover: Everyone is Responsible for Security
k0bw | One of the fundamental principles of both Disney World and El Al is that security is not just a single event - you show your pass to someone, and then the security checks are finished - but that security is in-built into every aspect of that organisation's functions. For example, whilst the security teams in both systems are highly-trained, extremely professional and well-resourced, they are not the only people responsible for security. The car park attendants, the toilet cleaners, the peanut-sellers, the people taking the rubbish out of the kitchen are all considered to be part of the security management programme. In this way, it is possible to have total cover of an organisations' territory, where someone will be bound to spot any potential problem before it becomes an actual danger. The role of that person is then to inform the security team that something is not quite right, and they will then be able to respond in an appropriate manner, assess the situation and take the necessary actions.
aq5a | 19
sc5y | 5.4 Principle 3: Tight Management
0yab | David Veness, the former head of Metropolitan Police Special Operations Unit, who was later a Special Adviser to the United Nations Commission on Security, used to have only one sign on his desk. It read 'Security is the management of complacency'. Any effective security management programme has to be one which can be maintained over time, without any loss of capability. Although this is a simple idea to put into words, it is possibly one of the hardest aspects of security management to actually control.
w95z | People are lazy, systems that are considered too intrusive are switched off, good practices are left to wither, systems are not maintained, and often after a certain amount of weeks or months, things return to how they were. It is well recognised that to create genuine organisational change is one of the hardest things to achieve, and yet to a large degree that is the purpose of the security manager. After all, if everything was OK, there would be little need for the security manager in the first place.
0i1k | Although there are often limits in what a security manager can achieve (it is often true that the security manager is relatively low in the organisational power chain), there are a number of basic rules that will make it easier to achieve organisational change, and introduce an effective security management system that will at least move towards the creation of a safe organisation.
dqlg | The first is that it is better to have a few rules that everyone follows, rather than many rules which are mainly ignored. The purpose of the security management programme is to support the overall activities of the organisation, so any rules that are introduced should be simple, easy to adhere to and understood by everyone. If there is a system of access passes, that should be used by everyone. If there is a rule that lone workers should log where they are going to be, and then confirm that all is well in a final call before they go home, that should be adhered to.
p6pq | The second rule is that the security management system needs to be supported by everyone, from the Chairmen to the toilet cleaner (as outlined in principle 2, above). Security is not just the responsibility of the security team, but is one of the basic functions of everyone who works within that organisation.
zse6 | And the third rule is that security is for ever. It is the role of the security management to ensure that the level of security awareness and readiness is maintained, and that standards are not allowed to slip. The Second Law of Thermodynamics (also known as Entropy) states that unless extra energy is put into a system, it will tend to slow down, lose effectiveness and generally come to a halt. This is equally true of security management. Effective security management is not a natural state. It is the role of the security manager to ensure that the necessary protocols are adhered to, just as much as writing the initial security management programmes in the first place.
p2n3 | 5.5 Kaizen ....
ohh7 | Having taken two examples from American and Israeli organizations, we can finish off this Module with another concept, this time from Japanese management systems. Kaizen is the idea of 'Continuous Improvement', and has become one of the leading general management theories in the last twenty years. In its simplest terms, Kaizen is built on the principle of incremental improvement - identify a weakness, find a way of improving it, implement it. It is a philosophy as much as a method, and believes that everyone has expert knowledge of their own field - the car-park attendant is as expert at being a car park attendant as the chief scientist is as being a research manager. They might also be aware of ways in which the security of the car park might be improved which no one else in the organisation has. Arsene Wenger, the Arsenal manager, put it another way: 'If you improve a hundred things by one per cent, you get a hundred per cent improvement'. Whilst this may not be strictly true from a mathematical perspective, it is an excellent way of managing security kaizen.
vbni | 5.6 Summary
dgcw | Security has to begin and end somewhere, and that point is decided by how we define the territory that we accept responsibility for. Security in Depth describes the way that we can utilise our own resources in order to
gvwz | 20
sk5m | create progressively more secure environment. These simple principles of security management are used by two of the most well-respected organisation in global security management, each of which is facing completely different potential threats.
qws8 | These principles are easy to understand, simple to implement, and can be adapted to almost any security situation.
877u | In summary:
rzhj | . Total Security Management (TSM) allows you to be proactive in developing a safe organisation, rather than responding to individual risks / threats
bfax | . TSM can be Vertical - as in Supply Chain Management - or Horizontal , through control of Territory
f2y8 | . Territory is Space which is defined by Boundaries, and for which you have Information and Control
o7qm | . Safety is increased by Security in Depth,
d52l | . Everyone in an organisation is part of the Security Management Programme
qlbb | . Kaizen allows for a culture of continuous improvement across the organisation
nhsg | 5.7 Self-assessment exercises
hy0l | Self-assessment 1: An organisation has been identified as being involved in an oil spill in Alaska. The Board have decided that the security system around its HQ offices on the 13th-20th floors of an office block in Canary Wharf need to be reviewed, and if necessary improved. Using the principles covered in this module, what recommendations could you make to the Board?
4jmz | Self-assessment 2: Your Chairman has returned from a visit to Japan, where he has heard about Kaizen. He has requested you give a presentation to the next Board meeting, identifying how Kaizen can be of use to the overall security management of the organization. Put together a PowerPoint briefing (about twenty minutes), that could be given to the Board, together with notes that could be distributed to the Board at the meeting.
b7cq | 21
0b39 | Self-assessment 3: Your company has taken over a production factory in Ukraine. It stands in its own area within a larger industrial park. As Head of Security EMEA, you are going to visit the facility to assess the level of current security, and to identify possible areas that might need improvement. Put together a checklist of points that you would need to cover during your visit to the facility.
