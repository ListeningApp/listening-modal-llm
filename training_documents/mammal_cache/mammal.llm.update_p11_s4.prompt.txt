You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

u8nw | CpGs linked to life span in various taxonomic orders and tissues
l2v9 | To pinpoint CpGs associated with <LATEX>\log</LATEX> mum life span independently of phylogenetic order or tissue type, we conducted a meta- analysis of EWAS findings from 25 distinct strata comprising phylogenetic order and tis- sue type. Using a nonparametric meta-analysis approach (rankPvalue), we assessed the EWAS of life span (meta.lifespan) in these strata to identify CpGs unconfounded by tissue type or phylogenetic order (table S24). Our meta.life- span results demonstrated significant overlap with the previously mentioned EWASs of life
afbe | span in all eutherian species (hypergeometric <LATEX>P = 1 \times 1 0 ^ { - 1 7 5 }</LATEX> Fig. 6A). By contrast, none of the meta.lifespan CpGs overlapped with EWASs of age, which further supports the idea that methylation of life span-related CpGs does not change with age in mammalian tissues. The top four CpGs from the meta.lifespan analysis are depicted in Fig. 6B, showing significant posi- tive correlations for CpGs near LOXL1 and ZSCAN29 (exons) and negative correlations for those near RAB29 (exon) and GATA3 (down- stream), with log maximum life span across various taxonomic orders and tissue types. Similar to our above-mentioned results, CpGs implicated by our meta.lifespan analysis (FDR < 0.05) overlap significantly <LATEX>\mathrm { \left( F D R \right. } < 0 . 0 \mathrm { I } \mathrm { \left. \right] }</LATEX> with genes involved in organ morphogenesis, RNA biosynthesis, increased rib number in mice, Wnt signaling (Fig. 6C), and genes altered by transient expression of pluripotency-inducing factors in mouse models (nominal Fisher's ex- act <LATEX>P < 1 0 ^ { - 5 }</LATEX> for skin and meta.lifespan; <LATEX>P < 1 0 ^ { - 1 1 }</LATEX> for kidney and meta.lifespan; Fig. 6D).

CpGs having a high or low mean methylation level tend to have positive or negative correla- tion test Z statistics for life span, respectively (Fig. 7, A and B).

s2v1 | A biclustering analysis between chromatin annotations and comethylation modules based on fold enrichments (Fig. 8 and tables S21 and S22) revealed that the 55 mammalian comet-
jkp9 | hylation modules fall into three large group- ings (referred to as meta-modules). The bar plot to the left of Fig. 8 shows different mean methylation levels of the CpGs underlying the three meta-modules: mean methylation = 0.23, 0.66, and 0.77 for meta-modules 1, 2, and 3, respectively.
z8tt | Meta-module 1 contains several chromatin states that are associated with Polycomb repres- sion, including strong polycomb-repressed state ReprPC1 and bivalent promoters (BivProm1-2). Further, meta-module 1 contains chromatin states related to TSSs (TSS1 and TSS2) and several flanking promoters (PromF2, PromF3, PromF4, and PromF5). TSS1, PromF4, and PromF5 (as- sociated with negatively life span-related CpGs) were previously associated among universal chromatin states with the strongest enrich- ments for CpG islands (71 to 101 fold) (41). The color band under Fig. 8 reveals that six mod- ules underlying meta-module 1 are sensitive to murine life span interventions. Meta-module 1 is enriched with CpGs that have low methyl- ation levels in long-lived species (overlap with EWASs of life span, tan and greenyellow mod-
