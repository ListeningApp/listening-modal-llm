As discussed in Rae et al., large language models reflect contemporary and historical discourse about different groups (such as gender groups) from their training dataset, and we expect the same to be true for Chinchilla. Here, we test if potential gender and occupation biases manifest in unfair outcomes on coreference resolutions, using the Winogender dataset in a zero-shot setting. Winogender tests whether a model can correctly determine if a pronoun refers to different occupation words. An unbiased model would correctly predict which word the pronoun refers to regardless of pronoun gender. We follow the same setup as in Rae et al. (described further in Section H point three).\na5u1 | As shown in Table ten, Chinchilla correctly resolves pronouns more frequently than Gopher across all groups. Interestingly, the performance increase is considerably smaller for male pronouns (increase of three point two percent) than for female or neutral pronouns (increases of eight point three percent and nine point two percent respectively). We also consider gotcha examples, in which the correct pronoun resolution contradicts gender stereotypes (determined by labor statistics). Again, we see that Chinchilla resolves pronouns more accurately than Gopher. When breaking up examples by male/female gender and gotcha/not gotcha, the largest improvement is on female gotcha examples (improvement of ten percent). Thus, though Chinchilla uniformly overcomes gender stereotypes for more coreference examples than Gopher, the rate of improvement is higher for some pronouns than others, suggesting that the improvements conferred by using a more compute-optimal model can be uneven.\nry7u | Sample toxicity. Language models are capable of generating toxic language-including insults, hate speech, profanities and threats. While toxicity is an umbrella term, and its evaluation in language models comes with challenges, automatic classifier scores can provide an indication for the levels of harmful text that a language model generates. Rae et al. found that improving language modelling loss by increasing the number of model parameters has only a negligible effect on toxic text generation (unprompted); here we analyze\n5mda | whether the same holds true for a lower language model loss achieved via more compute-optimal training. Similar to the protocol of Rae et al., we generate twenty-five thousand unprompted samples from Chinchilla, and compare their Perspective A P I toxicity score distribution to that of Gopher-generated samples. Several summary statistics indicate an absence of major differences: the mean (median) toxicity score for Gopher is zero point zero eight one (zero point zero six four), compared to zero point zero eight seven (zero point zero six six) for Chinchilla, and the ninety-fifth percentile scores are zero point two three zero for Gopher, compared to zero point two three eight for Chinchilla. That is, the large majority of generated samples are classified as non-toxic, and the difference between the models is negligible. In line with prior findings, this suggests that toxicity levels in unconditional text generation are largely independent of the model quality (measured in language modelling loss), i.e. that better models of the training dataset are not necessarily more toxic.\ni4li | Five. Discussion and Conclusion\nr8sm | The trend so far in large language model training has been to increase the model size, often without increasing the number of training tokens. The largest dense transformer, M T - N L G five hundred thirty billion, is now over three times larger than G P T-three's one hundred seventy billion parameters from just two years ago. However, this model, as well as the majority of existing large models, have all been trained for a comparable number of tokens-around three hundred billion. While the desire to train these mega-models has led to substantial engineering innovation, we hypothesize that the race to train larger and larger models is resulting in models that are substantially underperforming compared to what could be achieved with the same compute budget.\ncuin | We propose three predictive approaches towards optimally setting model size and training duration, based on the outcome of over four hundred training runs. All three approaches predict that Gopher is substantially over-sized and estimate that for the same compute budget a smaller model trained on more data will perform better. We directly test this hypothesis by training Chinchilla, a seventy billion parameter model, and show that it outperforms Gopher and even larger models on nearly every measured evaluation task.\nn1i7 | Whilst our method allows us to make predictions on how to scale large models when given additional compute, there are several limitations. Due to the cost of training large models, we only have two comparable training runs at large scale (Chinchilla and Gopher), and we do not have additional tests at intermediate scales. Furthermore, we assume that the efficient computational frontier can be described by a power-law relationship between the compute budget, model size, and number of training tokens. However, we observe some concavity in log N O P T at high compute budgets (see Appendix E). This suggests that we may still be overestimating the optimal size of large models. Finally, the training runs for our analysis have all been trained on less than an epoch of data; future work may consider the multiple epoch regime. Despite these limitations, the comparison of Chinchilla to Gopher validates our performance predictions, that have thus enabled training a better (and more\n0r5m | lightweight) model at the same compute budget.\n```",
