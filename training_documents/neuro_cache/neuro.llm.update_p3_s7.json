In this case, although all of the other processes would be running at the outset, they would not need to run to completion to perform the task. On the contrary, there is good reason to assume that all parts of the brain are 'running' at the same time, and that what changes during task performance is how intensively each one is operating. When processing shifts over time, this is reflected by increased activity in areas that implement the relevant processes.\nqecd | In contrast, when faced with a non-canonical view, the object would not be recognized with confidence initially (if it were novel, as ours were). Thus, it would be identified only tentatively, and this best-matching representation in associative memory would serve as the basis for a hypothesis. At this point, the information look-up process would continue to operate, looking up characteristics associated with this hypothesized object, and would pass information needed to shift attention appropriately and to prime the object-properties-encoding system to encode the expected characteristic. A characteristic at the specified location would then be encoded into the visual buffer, and would thereafter be processed in the object-properties-encoding and spatial-properties-encoding systems, which would then provide input to associative memory. If the expected part or characteristic was in fact located (as indicated by a match in the object-properties-encoding system) and was located in the correct place (as registered in the spatial-properties-encoding system), this might be enough input to associative memory to identify the object. If not, an additional cycle might be necessary.\n1o7p | In short, we expected the entire system to cycle more times for the objects seen from non-canonical perspectives; and in fact, we found activation in areas that correspond directly to those subsumed by figure one. The only mystery was activation in what we initially took to be the motor strip; however, subsequent evidence has shown that this area probably corresponds to the human frontal eye fields.\ncp13 | However, many areas were activated, and one cannot help wondering what sort of results would have disproved the theory. One can make two non-exclusive moves at this point. First, a set of results such as ours can be viewed as a set of structured hypotheses. One has now identified areas that are theorized to perform specific roles in information processing (such as matching visual input to stored modality-specific visual memories, or encoding spatial properties), and hence one now knows where to look for additional, more focused evidence.\nbgre | Second, one need not study the putative function of each area separately, but rather one can design studies of the entire system that rely on different tasks. Ideally, the tasks should on the surface not appear similar, and thus one can have confidence that the interpretation of the functions of the areas is coherent if the same areas are activated in both tasks. For example, Kosslyn et al. expected the system of figure one also to be used when one forms visual mental images. In this case, one 'primes' the object-properties-encoding system so strongly that\n57lp | information lookup\nukth | attention shifting\nkpvt | efferent connections literally force a pattern of activation in the areas that implement the visual buffer. This pattern of activation corresponds to the mental image, which once present can in turn be scanned by the attention window, portions recognized individually, locations noted, and so forth, in the same way that occurs during visual perception. For example, when asked to report the number of windows in their living room from memory, most people claim that they visualize the room and shift their attention along the walls, 'seeing' each window in turn. In the course of counting, they may notice characteristics of the windows (such as the types of locks that are present) that they had not previously considered. The information was implicit in the representations in visual memory (in the object-properties-encoding system) but never identified. Similarly, if asked what shape are a cat's ears, most people visualize the animal's head and 'look' at the ears, categorizing their shape. If asked this question several times in succession, they memorize the answer explicitly and no longer need to use the image.\njie2 | In addition, if multiple parts need to be added to an image, one can visualize an overall shape envelope, and then shift attention to the location of a part to be added, just as one would during top-down hypothesis testing during perception; however, in this case, once one is focused on the appropriate location, one forms an image of the part.\nd0ik | Kosslyn used a task originally designed by Podgorny and Shepard to test the idea that visual mental images are built up a part at a time. In this task, subjects see a four by five grid that contains a single X mark in one cell. The subjects are asked to visualize a block letter in the grid, and report whether the X mark would have fallen on part of the letter if it were actually present. Kosslyn found that the time to respond depended on the location of the X mark. In fact, when other subjects were surreptitiously observed drawing block letters in such grids, they typically drew the segments in very consistent orders. For example, for an upper case letter F, they drew the vertical line on the left first, the top horizontal line second, and the middle horizontal line third. The order in which these subjects drew the segments neatly predicted how quickly other\n0x0s | subjects could determine whether an X mark would have fallen on the letter if it had been in the grid. Indeed, the more segments one would need to draw to reach the location of the X, the longer it took to determine whether the X would have fallen on the letter if it had been in the grid. This result is exactly as expected if one were in fact sequentially shifting attention, and forming an image of each segment in sequence.\n4exe | The theory outlined in figure one, then, led us to expect the same set of areas to be involved in the two tasks, identifying named pictures seen from non-canonical versus canonical points of view and deciding whether an X mark would fall on an imaginary letter. Thus, Kosslyn replicated the experiment of Kosslyn and also asked the subjects to perform the image-in-grid task. The control condition for the imagery task was the identical set of stimuli, but presented before subjects had seen the block letters or knew anything about the imagery task. For the control, subjects simply responded as soon as they saw each stimulus, alternating the side of response over trials. The results revealed that two thirds of the areas activated during either task were activated in common. The functions of these areas are organized well by the theory outlined in figure one.\n0myz | However, we must note that to address this type of question, one must design pairs of tasks that differ in a single way, which is not as straightforward as it might seem. One problem is that we cannot know in advance whether manipulating a single feature of the task in fact alters only one aspect of processing. It has long been known that changing one aspect of a task can lead subjects to adopt qualitatively different strategies. Nevertheless, in my view this approach is still superior to using rest or an 'off' state as the baseline; a rest condition surely differs in more than one way from most experimental conditions, and it is impossible to know in which ways the conditions differ.\n```",
