You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,

82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

s6su | The risk of hypothermia and the survival benefit of fever in patients with sepsis are well described (2-8, 45). A meta-analysis of observational studies cited a pooled estimate of a 47% mortality in hypothermic patients with sepsis versus 22% mortality in those with fever (6). While the control group mortality in our trial was high, it tracks closely with the mortality observed in prior cohorts of afebrile critically ill sepsis patients (2-5). Perhaps more compelling, participants allocated to therapeutic hyperthermia experienced a mortality that was more closely aligned with expected mortality in fe- brile sepsis patients (2-6). Studies of antipyretic therapy in sepsis have demonstrated little benefit (46, 47). A single trial of external cooling in febrile sepsis patients showed reduced vasopressor doses and lower early mortality in febrile patients cooled to normo- thermia (48), but these findings were not replicated in a subsequent randomized trial (49). The inflammatory cascade, cytokine expression, and transcription factors in febrile sepsis patients are likely different from afe- brile sepsis patients, and having experienced fever may confer benefit to immunocompetent sepsis patients that cannot be undone with cooling.
y219 | The mechanism through which therapeutic hyper- thermia may have affected clinical outcomes in this study is unclear. Previous data have demonstrated that, compared to afebrile patients with sepsis, febrile patients had a greater increase in monocyte HLA-DR early after sepsis diagnosis (9), suggesting a lower

nv42 | prevalence of sepsis-induced immunosuppression in patients with fever. Fever and therapeutic hyper- thermia, although, are fundamentally different condi- tions, and the relationship between fever and HLA-DR expression may be mediated via the inflammatory cascade involved in fever production rather than by heat itself. Notably, the survival curves in our study diverged around day 10, which indicates the effect of warming may be late. Given the breadth of immune changes caused by hyperthermia in animal and in vitro studies, immune-related mechanisms may have played in a role in the clinical outcomes seen in this study, despite our negative immune findings. Alternatively, therapeutic hyperthermia may benefit septic patients through nonimmune mechanisms, such as direct effects on microbial clearance, augmentation of an- tibiotic activity, or temperature-dependent changes in blood flow. Regardless, this is the first article that has supported the hypothesis that temperature plays a causal role in survival from life-threatening infection.
xags | Another interesting observation in this trial was that forced-air warming alone could effectively warm patients in a short time, even above 37â„ƒ. This finding suggests that the absence of fever was not an adaptive process associated with a change in set point. Rather, insufficient cytokine response or mitochondrial dys- function may have contributed to hypothermia, and when adequate heat was applied, substantive temper- ature elevations could be realized.
jc47 | Our observation should be confirmed in a mul- ticenter clinical trial powered for clinical outcomes. That trial should better elucidate the most effective temperature target, duration of treatment, and mech- anism of effect to fully understand how temperature management might be used in clinical practice. Better understanding the impact of temperature on sepsis physiology and the heterogeneity of treatment effects will be critical to defining the clinical application of sepsis warming.
ko3c | This trial has several limitations. First, tempera- ture augmentation was modest, with over 25% of our warmed participants not achieving febrile-range hy- perthermia. Second, we used a warming technique that was limited in its ability to achieve very high temperatures. Future trials targeting higher tempera- tures may need to use technology able to transfer more heat. Third, our control group mortality was very high. Although prior studies of hypothermia in sepsis have
xek3 | observed similarly high mortality, our inclusion crite- ria intentionally selected a group of participants with high predicted mortality. Fourth, our primary outcome could not be measured in one participant who died or in any patients were immune suppressed. These eligi- bility criteria may limit generalizability if hyperthermia were ultimately found to be effective. Finally, our small sample size also makes type I error more likely, so fu- ture larger multicenter trials should be conducted to ensure balance on important covariates.
bbpr | In conclusion, induced hyperthermia did not im- prove early markers of immune function, but in our pilot randomized trial warming was associated with lower mortality. The pathway responsible for our find- ings is unclear. Future work should seek to confirm our clinical findings in an adequately powered multicenter clinical trial and to better understand mechanistic changes in sepsis physiology associated with temper- ature modulation.
