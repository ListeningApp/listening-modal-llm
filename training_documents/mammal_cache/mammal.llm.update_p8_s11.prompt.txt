You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.

wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

l6t9 | We investigated whether a transient expres- sion of the Yamanaka factors in the 4-factor (4F) mouse affects the module eigengenes. The experimental design is shown in Fig. 4D, with additional details reported in the original article (39). Four of six of the above-mentioned murine intervention modules showed a nom- inally significant dose-dependent rejuvenation in murine skin <LATEX>\left( P < 0 . 0 6 \right) ,</LATEX> and two modules showed the same in kidney (dose refers to the duration of 4F treatment: 0, 1, 7, and 10 months of intermittent expression of 4F factors) (Fig. 4E). The purple, ivory, and lavenderblush3 modules were particularly sensitive to the <LATEX>4 F</LATEX> treatment (Pearson's <LATEX>r - 0 . 6 4</LATEX> in skin). In addition, the purple RelativeAge+ module's re- sponse to the 4F treatment is consistent with bioinformatic findings that OCT4 is an upstream regulator of this module. Among the life span modules, only the black module de- monstrates an increase <LATEX>\left( P = 0 . 0 0 7 \right)</LATEX> in skin of 4F treated mice, but this was not observed in the kidney.
1ujy | Epigenome-wide association analysis of maximum life span
qzor | We performed epigenome-wide association studies (EWASs) to identify individual CpGs with methylation levels that correlate with maximum life span. To reduce bias resulting from different levels of sequence conservation, our EWASs of maximum life span focused on 333 eutherian species, excluding marsupial and monotreme species. We restricted the analysis to 28,318 high-quality probes that are con- served between humans and mice.
a0by | When relating individual CpGs to log- transformed maximum life span, we used several modeling approaches (for details, see the supplementary text). Briefly, our first approach, generic modeling, applied regres-
u1ky | sion analysis ignoring tissue type and age. In our second approach, we repeated the regres- sion analysis after focusing on a given tissue type. Third, we focused on specific nonover- lapping age groups: young animals (defined as age <1.5 times the age at sexual maturi- ty), middle-aged, and old (defined as age >3.5 times the age at sexual maturity; fig S19). Some of these regression models were further adjusted for average species weight (denoted LifespanAdjWeight).
htm9 | For brevity, we will focus on linear regres- sion models because phylogenetic regression models led to qualitatively similar conclusions (tables S13 and S14). The most significant life span-related CpGs are located in the distal in- neighboring TLE4 (Pearson's <LATEX>r =</LATEX> <LATEX>0 . 6 8 , P = 5 . 8 \times 1 0 ^ { - 4 6 } ; \text { Fig. } 5 A \text { and table Sill and }</LATEX> HOXA4 <LATEX>\left( r = 0 . 6 6 , P = 7 . 5 \times 1 0 ^ { - 4 5 } ; \text { Fig. } 5 A , \right.</LATEX> module) and are negatively correlated with a intron of GATA3 <LATEX>\left( r = - \quad 0 . 6 5 , \right.</LATEX> P = 8.8 x <LATEX>1 0 ^ { - 4 2 } ;</LATEX> remained so after phylogenetic as the CpGs neighboring TLE4 and HOXA4 (P = <LATEX>4 . 2 \times 1 0 ^ { - 5 }</LATEX> and <LATEX>P = 4 . 8 \times 1 0 ^ { - 3 } ,</LATEX> respectively; fig. S17 and tables S11 and S12). The top 1000 life span- related CpGs (comprising 500 positively and 500 negatively life span-related CpGs) significantly overlapped (Fisher's exact <LATEX>P = 5 . 5 \times 1 0 ^ { - 1 3 4 }</LATEX> with those found in our weight-adjusted analysis (LifespanAdjWeight).
8hul | In general, methylation of life span-related CpGs does not change with age in mammalian tissues (Fig. 5B and fig. S20). The same can be seen from EWASs of life span restricted to ani- mals of a given age group (e.g., only very young animals; fig. S20D). The EWASs of life span in all animals (irrespective of age) is highly corre- lated <LATEX>\left( r > 0 . 7 \right) ,</LATEX> with the analogous EWASs re- stricted to animals that are young, middle-aged, or old.
87vz | EWASs of life span showed good consis- tency with the eigengene-based analysis in the mammalian comethylation network. As expected, the following previously discussed life span- related modules were enriched with CpGs im- plicated by our EWAS of life span: midnightblue (hypergeometric test <LATEX>P = 2 . 2 \times 1 0 ^ { - 4 7 }</LATEX> 67/249 overlapped CpGs), greenyellow (hypergeometric

The gene expression levels of 16 of these genes exhibited a highly significant repeated-measures correlation with chronological age (rmCorr <LATEX>P</LATEX> value <LATEX>< 1 0 ^ { - 5 0 }</LATEX> in different human tissues (Fig. 5C).
