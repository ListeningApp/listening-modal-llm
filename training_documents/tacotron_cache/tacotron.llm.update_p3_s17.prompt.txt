You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021.

lrry | We first describe a building block dubbed CBHG, illustrated in Figure 2. CBHG consists of a bank of 1-D convolutional filters, followed by highway networks (Srivastava et al., 2015) and a bidirectional gated recurrent unit (GRU) (Chung et al., 2014) recurrent neural net (RNN). CBHG is a powerful module for extracting representations from sequences. The input sequence is first convolved with <LATEX>K</LATEX> sets of 1-D convolutional filters, where the k-th set contains <LATEX>C _ { k }</LATEX> filters of width <LATEX>k</LATEX> (i.e. <LATEX>\left. k = 1 , 2 , \ldots , K \right) .</LATEX> These filters explicitly model local and contextual information (akin to modeling unigrams, bigrams, up to K-grams). The convolution outputs are stacked together and further max pooled along time to increase local invariances. Note that we use a stride of 1 to preserve the original time resolution. We further pass the processed sequence to a few fixed-width 1-D convolutions, whose outputs are added with the original input sequence via residual connections (He et al., 2016). Batch normalization (Ioffe & Szegedy, 2015) is used for all convolutional layers. The convolution outputs are fed into a multi-layer highway network to extract high-level features. Finally, we stack a bidirectional GRU RNN on top to extract sequential features from both forward and backward context. CBHG is inspired from work in machine translation (Lee et al., 2016), where the main differences from Lee et al. (2016) include using non-causal convolutions, batch normalization, residual connections, and stride=1 max pooling. We found that these modifications improved generalization.
hvhm | 3.2 ENCODER
863b | The goal of the encoder is to extract robust sequential representations of text. The input to the encoder is a character sequence, where each character is represented as a one-hot vector and em-
fj24 | bedded into a continuous vector. We then apply a set of non-linear transformations, collectively called a "pre-net", to each embedding. We use a bottleneck layer with dropout as the pre-net in this work, which helps convergence and improves generalization. A CBHG module transforms the pre- net outputs into the final encoder representation used by the attention module. We found that this CBHG-based encoder not only reduces overfitting, but also makes fewer mispronunciations than a standard multi-layer RNN encoder (see our linked page of audio samples).
uz3c | 3.3 DECODER
d5bi | We use a content-based tanh attention decoder (see e.g. Vinyals et al. (2015)), where a stateful recur- rent layer produces the attention query at each decoder time step. We concatenate the context vector and the attention RNN cell output to form the input to the decoder RNNs. We use a stack of GRUs with vertical residual connections (Wu et al., 2016) for the decoder. We found the residual con- nections speed up convergence. The decoder target is an important design choice. While we could directly predict raw spectrogram, it's a highly redundant representation for the purpose of learning alignment between speech signal and text (which is really the motivation of using seq2seq for this task). Because of this redundancy, we use a different target for seq2seq decoding and waveform syn- thesis. The seq2seq target can be highly compressed as long as it provides sufficient intelligibility and prosody information for an inversion process, which could be fixed or trained. We use 80-band mel-scale spectrogram as the target, though fewer bands or more concise targets such as cepstrum could be used. We use a post-processing network (discussed below) to convert from the seq2seq target to waveform.
ba4l | We use a simple fully-connected output layer to predict the decoder targets. An important trick we discovered was predicting multiple, non-overlapping output frames at each decoder step. Predicting r frames at once divides the total number of decoder steps by r, which reduces model size, training time, and inference time. More importantly, we found this trick to substantially increase convergence speed, as measured by a much faster (and more stable) alignment learned from attention. This is likely because neighboring speech frames are correlated and each character usually corresponds to multiple frames. Emitting one frame at a time forces the model to attend to the same input token for multiple timesteps; emitting multiple frames allows the attention to move forward early in training. A similar trick is also used in Zen et al. (2016) but mainly to speed up inference.
ffx8 | The first decoder step is conditioned on an all-zero frame, which represents a <GO> frame. In inference, at decoder step <LATEX>t ,</LATEX> the last frame of the <LATEX>r</LATEX> predictions is fed as input to the decoder at step <LATEX>t + 1 .</LATEX> Note that feeding the last prediction is an ad-hoc choice here - we could use all <LATEX>r</LATEX> predictions. During training, we always feed every r-th ground truth frame to the decoder. The input frame is passed to a pre-net as is done in the encoder. Since we do not use techniques such as scheduled sampling (Bengio et al., 2015) (we found it to hurt audio quality), the dropout in the pre-net is critical for the model to generalize, as it provides a noise source to resolve the multiple modalities in the output distribution.
s6su | 3.4 POST-PROCESSING NET AND WAVEFORM SYNTHESIS
y219 | As mentioned above, the post-processing net's task is to convert the seq2seq target to a target that can be synthesized into waveforms. Since we use Griffin-Lim as the synthesizer, the post-processing net learns to predict spectral magnitude sampled on a linear-frequency scale. Another motivation of the post-processing net is that it can see the full decoded sequence. In contrast to seq2seq, which always runs from left to right, it has both forward and backward information to correct the prediction error for each individual frame. In this work, we use a CBHG module for the post-processing net, though a simpler architecture likely works as well. The concept of a post-processing network is highly general. It could be used to predict alternative targets such as vocoder parameters, or as a WaveNet-like neural vocoder (van den Oord et al., 2016; Mehri et al., 2016; Arik et al., 2017) that synthesizes waveform samples directly.
06ht | We use the Griffin-Lim algorithm (Griffin & Lim, 1984) to synthesize waveform from the predicted spectrogram. We found that raising the predicted magnitudes by a power of 1.2 before feeding to Griffin-Lim reduces artifacts, likely due to its harmonic enhancement effect. We observed that Griffin-Lim converges after 50 iterations (in fact, about 30 iterations seems to be enough), which is reasonably fast. We implemented Griffin-Lim in TensorFlow (Abadi et al., 2016) hence it's also part of the model. While Griffin-Lim is differentiable (it does not have trainable weights), we do not impose any loss on it in this work. We emphasize that our choice of Griffin-Lim is for simplicity; while it already yields strong results, developing a fast and high-quality trainable spectrogram to waveform inverter is ongoing work.
