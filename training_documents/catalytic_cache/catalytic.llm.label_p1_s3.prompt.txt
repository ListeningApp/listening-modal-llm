You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

2taz | We report an environmentally friendly strategy for the synthesis of FezC/Fe/graphitic carbon based on hydrothermal carbonization and graphitization of carbon spheres with potassium ferrate (K2FeO4) at 800 °C. The obtained sample consisting of Fe3C/Fe nanoparticles and graphitic carbon (FC-1-8) delivered an enhanced pseudocapacitance of 428.0 F g 1 at a current density of 1 A g 1. After removal of the FezC/Fe electroactive materials, the graphitic carbon (FC-1-8-HCI) possessed a large specific surface area (SSA) up to 2813.6 m2 g-1 with a capacity of 243.3 F g-1 at 1 A g-1, far outweighing the other amorphous carbon electrodes of FC-0-8 (carbon spheres annealed at 800 ℃ without the treatment of K2FeO4). The graphitic material with a porous structure could offer more electroactive sites and improved conductivity of the sample. This method provided guidelines for the synthesis of superior performance supercapacitors with synchronous graphitic carbon and electroactive species.
o3ya | 1. Introduction
r5il | The ever-increasing demand for energy all over the world has promoted intensive research in the field of energy storage materials. Among various types of emerging power devices, supercapacitors (SCs) owing to their excellent output capability, quick charge-discharge rate and long cycle stability have attracted much attention of researchers.1,2
5gui | Carbon-based materials, such as activated carbon and gra- phene, have been regarded as the most common electrode materials. The hydrothermal carbonization technique is a green and soft chemistry method to synthesize carbon-based mate- rials under mild temperature and self-generated pressure.3 The whole process involved a series of reactions, such as hydrolysis, dehydration, polymerization and aromatization, leading to the formation of brown hydrochar and soluble chemicals.4 Biomass-derived carbon materials are low-cost and have been reported as good candidates for carbon-based electrodes.5
82qc | The properties of specific surface area (SSA), porosity and conductivity of these materials have a big influence on their performance of electrochemistry.6-8 As we all know, the larger SSA value is favorable to obtaining electrode material with excellent performance. Till now, various strategies have been proposed to develop porous structure, including carbonization under KOH,9 ZnCl2 (ref. 10 and 11) and CO2.12 Despite the remarkable increase

t8vv | in the SSA value and pore size after activation, most materials display unsatisfied specific capacitance because of the low conductivity. Creating graphitic carbon leading to lower internal resistance is a possible method to solve the problem. Generally, the conventional graphitization transformation requires rigorous conditions, like high temperature (>1000 ℃) or high vacuum degree, which do not only needs a huge energy input but also leads to a decreased porosity of the host.13,14 However, using transition metal (Fe, Co or Ni) functioned as a catalyst during the pyrolysis process could achieve graphitization transformation at low temperature.15-17 Metal organic frameworks (MOF), as a kind of porous coordination polymers, are promising materials in the field of supercapacitor and battery.18 Pang et al. studied a series of MOF composite as excellent electrochemical energy storage material, such as [Ni(thiophene-2,5-dicarboxylate)(4,4'-bipyridine)] n MOF nanocrystals,19 Co3O4 nanocube@Co-MOF.20 In some cases, the derived species could serve as electroactive species as well and can be used to prepare SCs with high performance. For example, Li et al.21 fabricated carbon hybrids by g-C3N4 and iron oxalate as electrode, which delivered an enhanced pseudocapaci- tance. In this process, iron oxalate was further reduced to metallic Fe followed by carbide reaction. Fe-based nanomaterials, such as encapsulated FeP nanoparticles with graphene,22 nano Fe-C3 with in situ grown CNT on N doped hollow carbon cube,23 N-doped carbon nanotubes grafted onto MOF-derived carbon nano- materials (Fe-NCNT) were proved to display efficient electro- chemical performance. ß-FeOOH@carbon derived multi-shelled Fe2O3 microspheres by calcination in air could deliver a high capacity up to 630 F g 1 at 1 A g-1.24

K2FeO4, in this article, is not only used as the activating agent but also functioned as the precursor of catalyst (Fe) in the graphitic transformation process. The derived Fe3C/Fe NPs serve as electroactive species as well and compared with the other amorphous carbon electrodes of FC-0- 8 (carbon spheres annealed without the treatment of K2FeO4), the K2FeO4-derived Fe3C/Fe/graphitic carbon exhibited an outstanding pseudocapacitance of 428.0 F g 1 at 1 A g 1 working as an electrode material for SCs. After removal of the Fe3C/Fe electroactive materials, the graphitic carbon (FC-1-8- HCl) with a much high SSA up to 2813.6 m2 g 1 displayed a capacity of two times higher than that of the other type of amorphous carbon electrode, FC-0-8. Fe3C/Fe/graphitic carbon exhibited synchronous performance of graphitic carbon and electroactive species, which was inspirational and provided a novel route to design electrode material.

4i0e | Glucose (C6H12O6, AR) was purchased from Aladdin Reagent Inc. Potassium ferrate (K2FeO4, >98%) was obtained from Bei- jing Innochem Chemical Co., Ltd. All the chemicals were used as received without further purification.
h2l3 | 2.2 Hydrothermal synthesis of carbon spheres
dfzb | The carbon spheres were synthesized using glucose as a precursor through hydrothermal carbonization. In a typical procedure, a certain concentration of glucose was transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave (100 mL), followed by heating at 140-200 ℃ for 10 h before being naturally cooled to room temperature. The precipitates were isolated by centrifu- gation and rinsed sequentially with deionized water and ethanol, and dried in an oven at 60 ℃ overnight. Several kinds of parameters were investigated and the details were displayed in Table 1. The samples were named as Gx-T-t, where X is the concentration of glucose, T is the hydrothermal temperature, t is the reaction time. For example, G1-200-10 means 1 M glucose was hydrothermally treated at 200 ℃ for 10 h.
