        "content": "tp8g | However, more important than uncertain volume estimates, is the question what proportion of this total can be utilized for underground hydrogen storage under the parameters presented here. For example, as fields in the Weser-Ems and Elbe-Weser sector located in the Rotliegend formation may reach depths of two thousand five hundred to five thousand meters. From an economic point of view,\ngxfd | Frontiers in Energy Research\ns2v1 | storing gas at these depths is not profitable due to the high compression costs. Typical depths of natural gas storage facilities are one thousand to one thousand two hundred meters. Physical constraints limit the storage of hydrogen to depth of three thousand seven hundred meters below which hydrogen is thought to percolate through the cap rock and, hence, confinement loss. Details on the specific gas production, horizon and depth are, however, not listed. Former gas deposits in carbonates of the Stassfurt formation, common in the eastern part of the North German Basin and the Thuringian Basin, may prove unsuitable as they contain significant amounts of hydrogen sulphur. However, former gas deposits in the Tertiary sandstones in the Upper Rhine Graben could again show suitable potential and supplement storage capacities in saline aquifers and the UGS facilities Stockstadt, Hähnlein, and Frankenthal. According to forecasts, this could be the end point of the North-South hydrogen pipeline. However, the nearby industrial clusters would depend on an economical and steady supply of hydrogen, which could be ensured by underground hydrogen storage facilities. For the Munich area, on the other hand, there are no pipeline plans according to the Gas Network Development Plan twenty twenty-two-twenty thirty-two or the IPCEI project plan. The question, therefore, arises as to how the supply will be ensured, and here, too, underground hydrogen storage could be of significance. Future research should therefore focus on the technical storage potential matching it with planned hydrogen infrastructures and industrial demands. This is of paramount importance in the South of Germany where storage potential is lower than in the North, making targeted planning necessary.\njkp9 | Five point two. Assessment of underground hydrogen storage costs\nz8tt | Early economic analyses have shown that the cost of service for hydrogen is approximately equal to the costs of storing natural gas, but have stressed that the costs are very site specific and that a range of costs is possible for each type of underground storage. In a more recent life cycle cost analysis, Lord et al. conclude on a cost per kilogram of hydrogen basis that depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs and aquifers would be the economically attractive options, considering costs for pipelines and wells, compressors, cavern mining, and base gas. The overall costs for UHS amount to one point six dollars per kilogram for salt caverns, zero point zero four dollars per kilogram for depleted hydrocarbon fields, zero point zero eight dollars per kilogram for aquifers, and two point seventy-five dollars per kilogram for hard rock caverns. This methodology has been adapted with most recent cost estimates as of two thousand nineteen in a review by Raza et al. for UHS to be zero point fourteen to fourteen point zero three dollars per kilogram for salt caverns, one point forty-two dollars per kilogram for depleted hydrocarbon fields, one point forty-nine dollars per kilogram for aquifers, and zero point thirty-six to three point twenty dollars per kilogram for hard rock caverns. However, a comparison of natural gas storage costs in Europe and the United States shows that storage costs in Europe could be twice as high, not least because of higher regulatory requirements. But unlike in the United States, where these figures are sometimes published, cost estimates in Europe are rather poor. Something that all cost estimates for hydrogen pore storages have in common is the substantial\n9g22 | influence of cushion gas on the ultimate costs of service, similar to natural gas storage facilities. At the same time it is considered more economic to leave some gas in the reservoir than to invest in the additional pumps and compressors to empty it completely. Therefore, one way to reduce these costs is to use lower cost cushion gas, but further research is needed to investigate the possibility of mixing, viscous fingering and gravity override that needs to be considered. The economics will therefore depend on the quantity of the cushion gas, the quality of the recovered hydrogen gas, and costs of gas separation if required.\n41fx | Five point three. Hydrogen purity requirements\n7um8 | Probably the most important parameters influencing the economic development of underground hydrogen storage are biotic and abiotic reactions. Potential contaminations may result from biotic reactions, such as for instance in the town gas storage Lobodice in which methanogens were shown to transform hydrogen and carbon dioxide to methane. Or abiotic reactions like in the town gas storage Beynes where pyrite reduction is believed to be responsible for the observed rise in hydrogen sulphide within the reservoir. There are several process engineering options for removing hydrogen sulphide from natural gas and the hydrocarbon industry has decades of experience. In Germany, too, a large proportion of all natural gas reserves contain varying amounts of hydrogen sulphur, which have been processed at the Großenkneten desulfurization plant since the nineteen seventies. Here the hydrogen sulphur is removed from the gas and converted to elemental Sulphur used as feedstock by the chemical industry. However, this is a costly process and the purity requirements of hydrogen extracted from the storage facility will ultimately depend on the end user. Fuel cells, for example, require hydrogen of ninety-nine point ninety-seven percent purity because contaminants such as carbon monoxide and hydrogen sulfide can impede electrode charging, while ammonia causes irreversible effects on fuel cell performance. In contrast, fuel quality specification for applications other than proton exchange membrane fuel cell, that is, combustion processes in hydrogen boilers will tolerate higher concentrations of impurities of about ninety-eight percent. In contrast, industrial combustion applications, for example, for sintering processes, heating of furnaces and domestic appliances such as boilers and cookers are more tolerant with respect to the hydrogen content and impurity levels resulting in fuel-types similar to \"town gas\" with hydrogen contents of around fifty percent. Generally, these higher impurity levels could facilitate hydrogen utilization by increasing the heating value but replacement by other components, for example, oxygen or carbon monoxide have to be considered carefully with regards to safety, decarbonization and cost-effective level of purity for end user applications and quality measurements.\nuow2 | Frontiers in Energy Research\niat7 | Six Summary",
