Fivefold cross-validation showed the prediction accuracy was zero point five five four one and zero point six zero one eight for the retainability of flesh firmness and crispness, respectively. The predictability of these models was not only better than that of the activator-depleted substrate model, but also better than that of pure GS by ridge regression BLUP, the accuracy of which was more than zero point four for apple firmness after storage and was zero point zero eight to zero point four five for changes in fruit firmness. The improvement in predictability of the GAP models may be attributed to the taking into account non-additive allelic effects. Additive, dominant, and even over-dominant non-allelic epistasis or interactions among\nwkbn | One thousand thirty-two Bei Wu et al.\nftfg | QTLs or candidate genes for fruit firmness were detected in tomato. Dominant or partially dominant allelic effects were common in this study for apple flesh firmness and crispness retainability.\n7xi5 | Conclusion\nw8r5 | Fifty-six candidate genes for apple flesh firmness and crispness retainability were predicted from the intervals of sixty-two QTLs. GAP models were developed using genotype effects of the QTL-based marker, and the prediction accuracy of the GAP models was zero point five seven one two and zero point six five eight five for the retainability of flesh firmness and crispness, respectively. On the QTL hotspot of chromosome three, an eight-base pair deletion in the MdERF-three promoter perturbed the binding of MdDOF-five point three, reduced MdERF-three expression, relieved the inhibition on MdPGLR-three, MdPME-two, and MdACO-four expression, and ultimately decreased the flesh firmness and crispness retainability. From a QTL on chromosome sixteen, a three-base pair deletion in the promoter of MdERF-one hundred eighteen decreased its expression by perturbing the binding of MdRAVL-one, which increased MdPGLR-three and MdACO-four expression and reduced flesh firmness and crispness retainability. The results implied a sophisticated genetic variation network regulating flesh firmness and crispness retainability. The GAP models can be potentially applied in apple breeding.\nybik | Experimental procedures\ngii5 | Plant materials and growth conditions\nq5eu | The plant materials were two thousand six hundred sixty-four bi-parental hybrids derived from 'Zisai Pearl' x 'Red Fuji' (one thousand one hundred eighty-five), 'Zisai Pearl' x 'Golden Delicious' (nine hundred sixty-seven), and 'Jonathan' x 'Golden Delicious' (five hundred twelve). 'Zisai Pearl' is a Chinese apple cultivar that belongs to Malus asiatica Nakai., while the other three parents are commercial cultivars belonging to M. domestica Borkh. All the hybrids were grown at a density of two point five meters times zero point five meters under conventional management and pest control in the Fruit Experimental Station, China Agricultural University (Changping District, Beijing, China).\na7ao | In two thousand sixteen to two thousand seventeen, fruit samples were harvested at commercial maturity based on fruit background colour and starch degradation (selected at seven on a scale of one to ten). After harvest, apples were cold-stored at one degree Celsius with negative ninety-five percent relative humidity in polyethylene bags. Flesh firmness and crispness of three apples per hybrid (all two thousand six hundred sixty-four hybrids if fruit samples were available) were measured at zero to sixth month with one month interval. Apples from hybrids with year-stable extremity phenotypes (randomly five hybrids from each phenotype type) were used for ethylene measurement in two thousand seventeen. Flesh tissue of 'Zisai Pearl', 'Red Fuji' and hybrids with phenotype type I (twelve-one hundred ninety, seventeen-one hundred three, and fourteen-one hundred seven) and type II (zero one-zero sixty-seven, eleven-one hundred sixty-nine, and seventeen-one hundred thirty-eight) of flesh firmness retainability were used for qRT-PCR analysis for MdERF-three and MdERF-one hundred eighteen relative expression. The fruit flesh and leaf samples were collected, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at negative eighty degrees Celsius until use.\n29a3 | Apple calli induced from the flesh of the cultivar 'Orin' were sub-cultured every three weeks on Murashige and Skoog medium used for Agrobacterium tumefaciens infection.\nsb1e | Measurements of flesh firmness and crispness and the retainability\nw2yn | To evaluate the ability of flesh firmness and crispness retention during cold storage, the maximum time (months as unit) till which the apples maintained acceptable flesh firmness (greater than or equal to seven point zero kilograms per square centimeter) and crispness (greater than or equal to zero point seven kilograms per square centimeter) was recorded as the retainability of\nap6l | flesh firmness and crispness, respectively. Flesh firmness and crispness were measured with a computer-controlled texture analyser TAXT. The diameter of the penetrating probe was zero point two centimeters, and the penetration depth was zero point five centimeters. Punctures were performed on the maximum equator of each apple. Three biological replicates were performed, and each included at least three technical replicates.\niest | Measurements of ethylene production\ncox8 | To determine ethylene emission, each fruit was weighed and enclosed in a gas-tight container and incubated for two hours at room temperature (twenty to twenty-five degrees Celsius). One milliliter of gas was sampled from the headspace in the container using a BD syringe. The ethylene concentration of gas samples was measured with a gas chromatography equipped with a flame ionization detector. The fruit ethylene production was calculated as described previously.\nppqi | BSA-seq and QTL identification\noxou | As hybrids with longer flesh firmness and crispness retainability over six months can only be detected in the population of 'Zisai Pearl' x 'Red Fuji', hybrids from this population were used to make BSA bulks. Thirty hybrids were randomly chosen from each phenotype type: type I, type II, and type III for flesh firmness or crispness retainability, respectively. Totally six phenotype extremity bulks were constructed. Genomic DNA from each hybrid was extracted from young leaves and pooled. Each bulked DNA sample was sequenced to obtain thirty times genome coverage using a paired-end one hundred fifty-base pair read strategy. The parental cultivars have been re-sequenced previously. The re-sequencing data were processed, and QTLs were identified using the BSATOS software package.\n495n | RNA-seq\n```",
