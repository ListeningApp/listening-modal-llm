You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

wzno | For ex vivo COX-2 activity, heparinized blood (1 mL) was immediately transferred into two 1.5 mL polypropylene tubes (500 µL each). One tube contained 10 µL of lipopolysaccharide isolated from Escherichia coli 0111:B4 in 0.1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution. The sec- ond tube contained 10 µL of PBS and was used as the negative control sample. Samples were then incubated at 37 ℃ for 24

iwn5 | hours. Afterwards, samples were centrifuged at 2000 g for 5 minutes at 18 ℃, 100 µL of plasma were added to 400 µL of methanol and homogenized. This solution was then centri- fuged at 6000 g for 10 minutes at 18 ℃; supernatant was harvested and stored at -80 ℃ until the time of PGE2 con- centration analysis.
uooz | All tests were performed in duplicate and the quantification of TXB2 and PGE2 concentrations were performed with com- mercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits (Thromboxane B2 ELISA kit and PGE2 ELISA kit monoclonal; Cayman Chemical, MI, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
pxbq | Laboratory tests
jfsr | Blood samples (2 mL) were collected for measurement of he- patic function tests (alanine transaminase; alkaline phospha- tase; aspartate aminotransferase; gamma-glutamyltransferase; serum albumin and total protein) and renal function tests (creatinine; urea) 7 days before and 7 days after anesthesia (clinical laboratory of the Veterinary Teaching Hospital of FMVZ-USP). Symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) concentra- tion was also measured at 7 days before, 24 hours and 7 days after anesthesia in samples from all cats used in the COX in- hibition evaluation (IDEXX Laboratories Inc., ME, USA).
u15r | Adverse effects
lq35 | Adverse effects and short-term postoperative complications were monitored in the 24 hours after first analgesic adminis- tration and reassessed on postoperative days 7 and 10 (suture removal). Through daily telephone contact, the owners were asked about their cats' general condition, presence of emesis, sialorrhea, diarrhea, changes in food and water intake, abnormal behavior and general aspect of the surgical wound.
3g9w | Physiological variables
d09o | Measurements of HR, fR, rectal temperature (RT) and blood glucose concentration (Glucometer Optium Xceed; Abbott Laboratories, Philippines) were obtained immediately before the premedication (baseline) and 1, 2, 4, 8, 12 and 24 hours after first analgesic administration.
ylhz | Pain and sedation assessment
a3td | Pain and sedation were evaluated at the same time points as the physiological variables. Subjective pain scores were ob- tained from four pain scales; the visual analogue scale (VAS) (Jensen et al. 2003), Colorado State University feline acute pain scale in English (CSU-FAPS) (Hellyer et al. 2006), UNESP- Botucatu multidimensional composite pain scale for assessing postoperative pain in cats in Portuguese (MCPS) (Brondani
ex5k | et al. 2012) and Glasgow feline composite measure pain scale (CMPS-Feline) (Reid et al. 2017). Sedation was evaluated using a scale (0-3; no effect, mild, moderate and severe) adapted from Valverde et al. (2004).
9d4o | Rescue analgesia
cjq2 | Rescue medication tramadol hydrochloride (2 mg <LATEX>\mathrm { k g } ^ { - 1 } : \mathrm { C r o }</LATEX> nidor 2%; Agener União Saúde Animal, SP, Brazil) was administered IV if CMPS-Feline scores were <LATEX>\geq 5 .</LATEX> Additional tramadol, <LATEX>1 \mathrm { m g } \mathrm { k g } ^ { - 1 } \mathrm { I V } ,</LATEX> could be administered if analgesia was inadequate after 30 minutes. The person that performed pain assessment (MAAP) was unaware of the drug administered. Cats administered rescue medication were reassessed 30 mi- nutes after tramadol administration and up to 24 hours; however, the physiological variables data, pain and sedation scores recorded after rescue analgesia were excluded from the analysis.
5esx | Statistical analysis
m5ka | A sample size calculation was performed for ex vivo COX ac- tivity and pain assessment [COX-1 activity inhibition in humans after oral administration of 500 mg of dipyrone of <LATEX>7 2 . 9 5</LATEX> (Hinz et al. 2007); need for rescue analgesia of 70% and 20% of dogs submitted to ovariohysterectomy and IV administration of 15 or 25 mg <LATEX>\mathrm { k g } ^ { - 1 }</LATEX> of dipyrone (Imagawa et al. 2011), respectively].
byu8 | Data are expressed as mean <LATEX>\pm</LATEX> standard deviation (para- metric variables) or median (range) (nonparametric variables) as appropriate. The data were tested for normality using a D'Agostino-Pearson test. A two-way analysis of variance was used to evaluate parametric data and a Kruskal-Wallis test was applied on nonparametric data. Post hoc analysis was performed with Tukey or Dunn tests to identify differences among time points and groups. The Spearman's rank corre- lation between pain scales was evaluated. The number of cats that required rescue analgesia was compared among groups using the Fisher exact probability test. Statistical significance was attributed if <LATEX>p < 0 . 0 5 .</LATEX> Analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism Version 7.03 (GraphPad Software Inc., CA, USA).
76b0 | Results
zxz6 | A total of 37 cats were initially selected for participating in the study. Overall, four cats were excluded because of non- compliant preoperative behavior and three cats were excluded because of pregnancy. Groups D25, D12.5 and M did not differ significantly regarding body weight <LATEX>\left( 2 . 7 \pm 0 . 5 ; 2 . 7 \pm 0 . 4 ; 2 . 7 \right.</LATEX> <LATEX>\pm 0 . 5 \mathrm { k g } ,</LATEX> respectively), age <LATEX>\left( 1 3 \pm 5 ; 1 2 \pm 9 ; 1 5 \pm 1 3 \right.</LATEX> months, respectively) and surgical time (28 ± 6; <LATEX>2 5 4 ;</LATEX> 30 <LATEX>4</LATEX> mi- nutes, respectively).
