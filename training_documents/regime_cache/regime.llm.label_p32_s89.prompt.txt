You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

ba1e | The choice <LATEX>\alpha ^ { \star } ,</LATEX> namely the one that cancels the second order response <LATEX>\rho _ { 2 } ,</LATEX> performs quite well for the Feynman-Kac and divergence-free forcings, as seen in Figures 3a and 3c. It allows to extend the range of linearity for <LATEX>\eta > 1 ,</LATEX> an increase of over tenfold when compared to the original response curve for <LATEX>\alpha = 0 .</LATEX> This allows for a variance reduction of a factor of order 1000 for the estimator (2.38), as documented in Section 4.5.
en95 | Figure 3b illustrates the discussion of Section 3.3 about choosing the values of <LATEX>\alpha</LATEX> allowing to stay longer in an approximate linear response. Although the value of the parameter <LATEX>\alpha</LATEX> such that <LATEX>\rho _ { 2 } \left( \alpha \right) = 0</LATEX> is <LATEX>\alpha ^ { \star } = 1 . 0</LATEX> for the modified fluctuation-dissipation, we see that <LATEX>\alpha _ { \star } \left( 0 . 0 5 \right) = 0 . 6 3 9</LATEX> is a much more nicely behaved curve, staying within 5%

uzo6 | 4.3. Overdamped Langevin dynamics - two-dimensional case. We now present the numerical results for overdamped Langevin dynamics in dimension two, defined on <LATEX>\mathcal{X} = \mathbb{T} ^ { 2 } ,</LATEX> with the following periodic potential energy:
89b4 | <LATEX>V \left( q \right) = \frac { 1 } { 2 } \cos \left( 2 \pi q _ { 1 } \right) + \cos \left( 2 \pi q _ { 2 } \right) + \kappa \cos \left( 2 \pi \left( q _ { 1 } - q _ { 2 } \right) \right) ,</LATEX> with <LATEX>\kappa \in \mathbb{R} .</LATEX> The observable considered here is of the same form as (4.5), and reads
5f7e | <LATEX>R \left( q \right) = \left( a \cos \left( 2 \pi q _ { 1 } \right) + b \sin \left( 2 \pi q _ { 1 } \right) \right) \mathrm { e } ^ { \beta V \left( q \right) } .</LATEX> For observables of this form, expressions (4.6) and (4.7) can be generalized to higher dimensions to compute the normalization constants. As in Section 4.2, this ensures that <LATEX>\rho _ { 1 } = \rho _ { 2 } = 1</LATEX> when <LATEX>\kappa = 0 .</LATEX> When <LATEX>\kappa</LATEX> is nonzero but not too large, <LATEX>\rho _ { 1 }</LATEX> and <LATEX>\rho _ { 2 }</LATEX> are of order 1, which is convenient to observe deviations from the linear regime.
h83u | For all numerical results presented here, we considered <LATEX>\kappa = 0 . 3</LATEX> and a constant nongradient forcing <LATEX>F = \left( 1 , 0 \right) \in \mathbb{R} ^ { 2 } .</LATEX> The spatial domain <LATEX>\mathbb{T} ^ { 2 } = \left[ 0 , 1 \right) ^ { 2 }</LATEX> was discretized using a regular product mesh of <LATEX>m _ { q } = 2 0 0</LATEX> points per dimension.
kjoa | The results presented in Figure 4 correspond to response curves for each of the synthetic forcings discussed in Section 3.2.2. Figure 4a corresponds to the Feynman- Kac forcing (3.9), with <LATEX>\xi = \left( 1 , 0 \right) \in \mathbb{R} ^ { 2 } .</LATEX> It is observed that this extra forcing is more effective in extending the linear regime when it is in the same direction as the physical perturbation <LATEX>F ,</LATEX> hence our choice of <LATEX>\xi .</LATEX> We generalize the exponential divergence-free vector field (4.8) presented in Section 4.2 to higher dimensions as <LATEX>\widetilde { \mathcal{L} } _ { \mathrm { e x t r a } } = \mathrm { e } ^ { V } \left( \nabla \cdot \right) ,</LATEX> <LATEX>\begin{array}{} \text { presented n } \\ \text { Overall } \end{array}</LATEX> in Figure 4c.
wb1c | the results are qualitatively similar to those from Section 4.2, apart from two main differences. First, we present a divergence-free vector field of the form <LATEX>\nabla V ^ { T } A \nabla ,</LATEX> with <LATEX>A</LATEX> the symplectic matrix given by (3.11), which has an un- derwhelming impact on increasing the linear regime as seen in Figure 4d, even for <LATEX>\alpha _ { \star } \left( 0 . 0 5 \right) = 2 . 0 .</LATEX> It seems therefore not to be a good option to consider. Second, Figure 4e shows that the Feynman-Kac forcing performs better than the exponential divergence-free field. On the other hand, the modified fluctuation-dissipation (3.8) is once again underwhelming, as seen in Figure 4b, with response curve for <LATEX>\alpha _ { \star } \left( 0 . 0 5 \right) =</LATEX> 0.59 once again performing better than <LATEX>\alpha ^ { \star } = 1 . 3 0 1 .</LATEX> Note that the value <LATEX>\alpha _ { \star } \left( \varepsilon \right)</LATEX> was not computed for the Feynman-Kac and the exponential divergence-free forcings, as <LATEX>\alpha ^ { \star }</LATEX> sufficiently extends the regime of linear response for those cases.
ak13 | 4.4. Langevin dynamics - one-dimensional case. We present here the nu- merical results associated with the one-dimensional Langevin dynamics (2.18), where the potential energy function is the same as the one used for the one-dimensional overdamped Langevin dynamics case, namely (4.4), and the same observable (4.5) as in Section 4.2. The normalization constants <LATEX>a</LATEX> and <LATEX>b</LATEX> for <LATEX>\rho _ { 1 }</LATEX> and <LATEX>\rho _ { 2 }</LATEX> are chosen to be

qm1b | <LATEX>p _ { \max } = 1 0 .</LATEX> The results presented in Figure 5 correspond to the response curves for each of the synthetic forcings discussed in Section 3.2.3. Figures 5a and 5b correspond to the position and momentum components of the modified fluctuation-dissipation forcing presented in Example 3.5, respectively, namely
n9ms | <LATEX>\widetilde { \mathcal{L} } _ { \mathrm { e x t r a } } = - \partial _ { q } ^ { * } \partial _ { q } , \quad \widetilde { \mathcal{L} } _ { \mathrm { e x t r a } } = - \partial _ { p } ^ { * } \partial _ { p } .</LATEX> Figures 5c and <LATEX>5 d</LATEX> correspond to the position and momentum components of the Feynman-Kac forcing presented in Example 3.6, respectively, namely
icdp | <LATEX>\widetilde { \mathcal{L} } _ { \mathrm { e x t r a } } = \partial _ { a } ^ { * } = V ^ { \prime } - \partial _ { q } , \quad \widetilde { \mathcal{L} } _ { \mathrm { e x t r a } } = \partial _ { p } ^ { * } = p - \partial _ { p } . ,</LATEX> Lastly, Figure 5e corresponds to the divergence-free forcing (4.8).
wtse | For both modified fluctuation-dissipation forcings, Figures 5a and 5b, we see that <LATEX>\alpha ^ { \star }</LATEX> does not preserve linearity for a large <LATEX>\eta</LATEX> regime, suggesting instead that <LATEX>\alpha _ { \star } \left( \varepsilon \right)</LATEX> is the better choice for practical applications; the same conclusion was drawn for the modified fluctuation-dissipation forcing for overdamped Langevin in Section 4.2. Among the two forcings, it seems better to modify the fluctuation-dissipation in <LATEX>p</LATEX> as the response remains longer in the linear response regime for the optimal value
bm7g | <LATEX>\alpha _ { \star } \left( \varepsilon \right) .</LATEX> Both Feynman-Kac forcings showcase great potential in extending the linear regime. Once again, Figures 5d and 5f suggest that opting for the extra forcing in the <LATEX>p</LATEX> variable is the superior choice.
jr68 | Lastly, the divergence-free forcing greatly increases the linear regime, as seen in Figures 5e and 5f. This behavior, as well as the ease to implement it in Monte Carlo simulations, make it is the most appealing choice of forcing, allowing to substantially reduce the variance of the estimator (2.38), as discussed in Section 4.5. Although the Feynman-Kac extra forcing also demonstrates great potential in extending the linear regime, the challenges associated with its implementation render it an impractical choice.
axix | 4.5. Scaling of the variance. We discuss in this section the scaling of the variance <LATEX>\sigma _ { R , \eta } ^ { 2 } / \eta ^ { 2 } ,</LATEX> defined in (2.43), with the addition of synthetic forces, and in par- ticular numerically illustrate the potential of synthetic forcings as a tool for variance reduction. See Appendix B for details on the numerical computation of (2.43). We emphasize that the bias on the estimator (2.38), made precise in (2.40), is negligible when compared to the variance, hence we concentrate on the variance. We anyway want to remain in the linear response regime so, by construction, the bias should be small.
05y4 | Recall from Section 2.3, and in particular in Proposition 2.4, that the estima- tor <LATEX>\widehat { \Phi } _ { \eta , t }</LATEX> defined in (2.38) has asymptotic variance of order <LATEX>\sigma _ { R , \eta } ^ { 2 } / \eta ^ { 2 } .</LATEX> Indeed, (2.42) suggests that this asymptotic variance is of the same order as the one associated with the equilibrium estimator, i.e. <LATEX>\sigma _ { R , 0 } ^ { 2 } / \eta ^ { 2 } ,</LATEX> up to a small bias of order
