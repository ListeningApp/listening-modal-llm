You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

7od1 | Particulate MMO. Mechanistic studies of pMMO are far behind those of sMMO, due to ongoing difficulties isolating highly active purified enzyme and uncertainty as to the atomic details of the active site (vide supra).9 Density functional theory (DFT) and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/ MM) studies suggest that a monocopper Cu"-oxo species or a di (p-oxo)Cu"Cu" species could oxidize methane and that formation of the dicopper species is more favorable.126 Calculations using a dicopper active site model suggest that either a u-n1 :n2-peroxo Cu'Cu" or u-n2:n2-peroxo Cu"Cu" species is formed first and then is transformed into the more reactive di(u-oxo)Cu"Cu" species after O-O bond cleav- age.12
0bqy | 126,127 In later studies, a (-oxo) (u-hydroxo)Cu"Cu1II center was proposed to be the active species and was calculated to be more reactive toward methane than a di (u-oxo) Cu"CuIII species. Formation of this (u-oxo) (u-hydroxo)Cu"Cu" species is proposed to be facilitated by proton transfer involving residues Tyr374 and Glu35 (M. capsulatus (Bath) numbering, Tyr374 is not structurally conserved in other pMMOs) in the second coordination sphere of the dicopper center.12 It is important to note that these intermediates have been calculated based on the moderate resolution crystal structures of pMMO and have not been detected experimentally. Related to these ideas are recent studies of the zeolite Cu-ZSM-5, which can oxidize methane to methanol. Spectroscopic studies and DFT calculations show that the zeolite active species is a mono(u- oxo ) Cu"Cu" core formed from a u-n2:n2-peroxoCu"Cu" intermediate. 129,130 Although pMMO and the zeolite are fundamentally different, this work does suggest that it may be feasible to oxidize methane in an enzyme with a dicopper site.
b780 | One putative oxygen intermediate has been detected experimentally for pMMO. When reduced pMMO is reacted with H2O2 or reduced spmoB is reacted with O2 or H2O2, a new species with an absorbance feature at 345 nm is formed.131 The energy and intensity of this feature are consistent with a u- n2:n2-peroxo Cu"Cu" species like those formed in oxy-

Importantly, this intermediate does not form in variants of spmoB in which the ligands to the dicopper center have been mutated, consistent with O2 binding at the proposed active site. In addition, this species disappears in the presence of methane,11 and some methanol product is detected, indicating that it may be a relevant intermediate during methane oxidation. The identity of the actual species that reacts with methane, the pMMO equivalent to Q, remains unclear. Several studies using chiral alkanes suggest that C-H bond activation by this unknown species proceeds via a concerted, nonradical mechanism.136
c6hh | CONCLUSIONS
y7ea | The two methane-oxidizing enzymes in nature, sMMO and pMMO, are completely different. The sMMO hydroxylase component, MMOH, is a soluble a28212 dimer, whereas pMMO is an a38373 trimer with both membrane-bound and periplasmic regions. The active site of sMMO is a well- characterized diiron center, but the atomic structure of the pMMO copper active site remains unclear. Similarly, the structural basis for substrate and product access to the sMMO active site has been partially elucidated but is not well-defined for pMMO. Both MMOs oxidize a range of hydrocarbon substrates, but pMMO has a narrower substrate specificity. sMMO exhibits higher turnover numbers than pMMO both in cells and in isolated enzyme preparations, but neither enzyme achieves levels desirable for biological gas-to-liquid conversion processes. The delivery of electrons to the sMMO active site in MMOH and the roles of MMOB and MMOR are reasonably well understood on the molecular level, although some aspects remain controversial. By contrast, the source of electrons for pMMO is still under debate, and possible protein interaction partners such as MDH require further investigation. The catalytic cycle of sMMO has been mapped out, and the intermediate that breaks the methane C-H bond, Q, has been characterized. Although mechanistic possibilities for pMMO have been considered, its mechanism cannot be further elucidated until lingering questions about the active site are resolved. Despite all these differences, the two systems share the unique ability to oxidize methane, and it is remarkable that nature has evolved two distinct large enzyme complexes for oxidation of a small gaseous substrate. Further study of how each MMO orchestrates the delivery of methane, oxygen, protons, and electrons to the active site, and how the O-O and C-H bonds are broken is essential to understanding these enzymes, their roles in the environment, and their potential biotechnological applications.
