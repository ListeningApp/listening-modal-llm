        "content": "x95m | To that end, Waugh initiated a global network of conversations around that question, using the company's technology infrastructure along with face-to-face gatherings to support the dialogues. Just by exploring the practical implications of the question in a disciplined way, the Lab began to see productivity gains. But one day, an HP Lab engineer came into Barbara's office and said, \"That question is okay, but what would really energize me and get me up in the morning would be asking, 'How can we be the best industrial research lab for the world?'\"\nyfum | That one small shift changed the entire game by scaling up the meaning of and shifting the assumptions embedded in the original question. It profound-\nppx4 | THE ART OF POWERFUL QUESTIONS\nqf11 | ly altered the context of the inquiry-to become the best for the world as the larger context for becoming the best in the world. This question obviously \"traveled well\"-it was no longer just the Lab's question, but something that many others at HP began to ask themselves as well. Employees at HP Labs and throughout the whole company responded to this new focus with a tremendous surge of collective energy.\n8oqt | Once they reworded the original question, Barbara and her colleagues could change the scope of related questions depending on the situation. For example, shifting the scope downward meant focusing on \"What does HP for the World mean for me? What does it mean in my life, in my own work?\" HP employees could also scale up the scope by asking, \"What does HP for the World mean for my work group? For my department? For HP as a company? And what might it mean for the world itself?\"\n6zah | HP's E-Inclusion effort, a major project to enable the world's poor to enter the new economy while providing critical medical and other information to communities in the third world, stemmed in large measure from the HP for the World exploration. The question has now traveled far beyond the company: \"What does it mean for us to be 'for the world'?\" was a key question explored at a State of the World Forum with a group of more than one thousand global leaders from every continent.\n4v5o | Creating a Sales \"Community.\" Another case in which a catalytic question empowered leaders in new ways occurred in the sales organization of a major U.S. corporation. Mike Pfeil, the area director of sales, wondered how a community, rather than a traditional company, might deal with the challenges it confronted. As a learning experiment, he began to host conversations with employees from all levels in his organization to explore the meaning of community at work and how they might apply community principles to enhance performance.\nha9e | To depart from the group's traditional focus on problems, the sales director framed questions that shifted the context within which workers normally look at their organization. He asked people to examine their best experiences of community and to reflect on\nxrnt | THE ART OF POWERFUL QUESTIONS\nc8ra | times they had participated in a community experience that really worked, using queries such as, \"What allowed that positive experience to happen? What kinds of activities were taking place? How did you fit into that?\" As members shared what they knew from their own best community experiences, they began to see the analogies to business life. They posed follow-up questions, such as, \"How does a community deal with adversity and adapting to change? What happens with members who don't uphold the community's standards?\"\np1l0 | As the conversations evolved, important values that people really\n1i8b | HOW CAN I FRAME BETTER QUESTIONS?\n5sfj | Here are some questions you might ask yourself as you begin to explore the art and architecture of powerful questions. They are based on pioneering work with questions being done by the Public Conversations Project, a group that helps create constructive dialogue on divisive public issues.\nvk4h | Is this question relevant to the real life and real work of the people who will be exploring it?\nnsm3 | Is this a genuine question-a question to which I or we really don't know the answer?\njdfw | What \"work\" do I want this question to do? That is, what kind of conversation, meanings, and feelings do I imagine this question will evoke in those who will be exploring it?\nuc9r | Is this question likely to invite fresh thinking or feeling? Is it familiar enough to be recognizable and relevant-and different enough to call forward a new response?\nl0ap | What assumptions or beliefs are embedded in the way this question is constructed?\nx815 | Is this question likely to generate hope, imagination, engagement, creative action, and new possibilities or is it likely to increase a focus on past problems and obstacles?\nepbj | Does this question leave room for new and different questions to be raised as the initial question is explored?\nnmn2 | Adapted from Sally Ann Roth Public Conversations Project circa nineteen ninety-eight\ng3tm | cared about started to come forward-values like learning, mutual respect, contribution, and sharing with others. Another simple but powerful question emerged from those early dialogues: \"How can we create a community at work that enables each person to contribute our best, inspires us to keep learning, and produces valued results?\" This simple shift of lens led other leaders in the company to look how it functioned within the larger communities in which it operates. The learnings from this project informed subsequent work in the area of corporate responsibility and in the creation of mission goals that include the perspectives of both internal and external stakeholders in creating the company's future.\ntfra | The local leader who launched this effort is now a corporate vice president. In looking back on his experience with engaging powerful questions to shift the context for exploring business realities, he shared the following:\n5lm9 | \"As we learned more, the meaning of the question continued to evolve. We asked ourselves, \"How can we go out and plant this seed? How do we frame it as we bring other people into the conversation?\" The question always worked in stimulating the dialogue. Sometimes as leaders it's important not to collectively work on what the answer is but to work on what the question is. That was a big insight for me as we did this work. The question never failed us.\"\nwp2c | Improving Questions at Pfizer. In another recent case, professionals at Pfizer, the world-renowned pharmaceutical firm, are experimenting with a systematic method of improving the quality of their questions. Through a custom-designed workshop, marketing and finance professionals in Pfizer's European business unit have been learning to articulate powerful questions. These executives have discovered that meetings have more energy and creative ideas flow more quickly when they place attention on formulating catalytic questions. With this discipline in place, new ideas are more easily finding their way into key products and services.\nus5v | From these examples, it's clear that improving the quality of the questions you ask and creating a framework of engagement that encourages their exploration can create business value. Because learning to engage thoughtful questions can lead to insight, innovation, and action, doing so will become an essential strategic capability for leaders of organizations who want to create sustainable results in the face of both short- and longer-term challenges and opportunities.\nrs2m | Fostering Strategic Inquiry",
