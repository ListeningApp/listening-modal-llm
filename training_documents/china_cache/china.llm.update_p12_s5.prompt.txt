You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

oksu | Attitudes towards the British government
wtow | MOOD also shows that the public had limited knowledge about the 'Empire' and impe- rial relations. Many had little interest in British politics, which could be observed when British members of parliament visited Hong Kong in 1976. Apart from knowing that MPs were elected, the Hong Kong public had virtually no idea about what members of parliament did. The report pointed out that 'some respondents believed that the visits were for the purpose of "checking up" on the Hong Kong government'.108 Despite the degree of autonomy enjoyed by Hong Kong, the public still held the impression that the colonial state was 'to a large extent, "controlled" by the United Kingdom government'. The UK parliamentary members were viewed as 'inspectors'.109 The same report also reflected the absence of confidence and scepticism towards both the colonial state and the British government. Many contacts argued that local officials would not present the parliamentary members with an accurate picture of the situation in Hong Kong:
o22k | They assumed quite intuitively that government officers would try to show the visitors only the better side of things. It simply did not occur to them that Hong Kong government very often tried to make visitors see Hong Kong's difficult and intractable problems in the hope that they could be better understood.110
nwfz | The only information respondents of all classes and educational backgrounds had about the British government was its 'deteriorating economy', notably the 'shrinking pound'.111
nvfy | The royal visit by the Queen in 1975 enabled MOOD to evaluate attitudes towards the head of state and answer students' radicalism. The announcement of the trip 'did not arouse much enthusiasm, particularly from the grass-roots level'. Many even denounced the trip as 'untimely' under the 'gloomy economic situation' as they misbelieved that a substantial amount of public expenditure would be spent.112 Despite the warm welcome
mror | upon the Queen's arrival, most families certainly were not 'well-wishers'.113 They only considered the royal visit 'no more than items of entertainment'. People 'do not regard themselves as subjects of the Queen of Great Britain, but rather as Chinese people com- ing by choice and force of circumstance to live under an alien government'. Most respondents called Queen Elizabeth II either neoi wong (+ E, the Queen) or jing neoi wong ( E, the Queen of England). MOOD interpreted this as an absence of political allegiance to both the United Kingdom and the British Crown. Hong Kong's grass roots and junior civil servants were apathetic. Some identified the Queen as either si tau po ( 事 頭 婆 ,the female boss) or baau zou po ( 包 租 婆 ,the landlady), demonstrating that their relations with the Crown were practical and instrumental.114 Similar reactions were detected in the celebration of the Silver Jubilee in 1977 and the visit of Prince Charles in 1979. The 1977 MOOD again suggested that most Hong Kong people did not 'con- sciously think of themselves as British subjects', 'except when they actually seek to travel on a British passport'.115 The visit of Charles was 'very well received' in 1979 only because Charles was often described by the mass media as 'charming, friendly and approachable', and that 'no lavish decorations or public funds had been wasted'.116 The visit did not instil 'public confidence and trust in the British government'.117
zlxc | Although some students started a campaign to boycott the royal visit in 1975, Hong Kong society in general was 'on the whole unsympathetic towards the boycott'. The majority believed that the boycott was 'meaningless and of no avail' since it certainly would have zero impact on the colony's constitutional position.118 The lower income groups, in particular, paid no attention to it. A 'non-conformist and aggressive attitude' was spreading from university to senior secondary students. Nonetheless, the post- secondary students were 'on the whole divided'. Graduates, in particular, were more pro- establishment. While some undergraduates believed that they could use the campaign as a channel to express their discontent, most were 'indifferent' and showed 'reluctance to get personally involved over the issue, either as a supporter or critic of the boycott'. In private conservations, many even 'expressed disapproval'.119 The growing student move- ment in the 1970s did not only divide the student community, but also the general public. Some viewed rising student political engagement as 'a healthy and beneficial trend for the community'. However, more believed that young students were 'impulsive and immature'.120
k0bw | Attitudes towards China
aq5a | According to MOOD, before 1967, most Chinese migrated to Hong Kong as they 'dis- liked communist ideology' and 'hated and feared the Central People's Government'. Most immigrants looked at communism 'with suspicion and hostility'.121 Some even worried that any link with the communists would 'get them into black books of the Hong Kong government'.122 In terms of political allegiance, some were loyal to the Kuomintang and viewed Taiwan as the legitimate government of China. They hoped that Taiwan would eventually take over China.123 MOOD reveals that despite the unpopularity of the leftist-inspired 1967 riots, the public was less hostile to China in the mid-1970s because it was clear that the central Chinese government had no intention of taking back Hong Kong early. By avoiding direct confrontation with the colonial government, communist
sc5y | China seemed content to maintain the status quo in Hong Kong for 'cogent and important reasons'.124 China's willingness to supply Hong Kong with scarce resources, such as water during droughts in the 1960s and oil during the oil crisis in 1974, also gave the general public an impression that China was 'quite ready to help Hong Kong'.125 According to the observation of the Home Affairs Department staff, it became more prevalent to 'celebrate' the National Day of the PRC in the colony:
0yab | The number of 'celebration dinner parties' has increased significantly. It appears that invitations have been very widely distributed to non-communist groups, including associations known to have right-wing connections or sympathies. Many more 'neutral' people have accepted the invitations. They feel much less inhibited about attending such parties. Some of them even regard it as an honour to have been invited.126
w95z | Different views were shared by former migrants from China and the locally born young generation. A large proportion of middle-aged and elderly groups still viewed commu- nism with scepticism. The young generation took a relatively 'relaxed attitude' about 'the likelihood of Hong Kong returning to China'. Most post-war baby boomers however 'still preferred the status quo' and did not 'cherish returning to live in China under a com- munist regime'.127 The general optimism towards China stretched into the late 1970s: 'a general feeling of relief and confidence currently prevails'.128 While it was convention- ally believed that 'older Chinese had often kept their negative views of the PRC', MOOD shows that attitudes of the middle-aged and elderly towards China had improved signifi- cantly in 1978.129 Many were 'now more relaxed about China and welcome the improve- ment of Hong Kong and Beijing relations'.130 For the young generation, the Return Home Movement lost momentum and MOOD detected 'no significant trend' of students wanting to return to China.131
