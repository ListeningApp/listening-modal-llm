        "content": "jc47 | One may well ask whether works of this sort, which stand at the limits of some internal strife, are not at the same time a point of departure. Such minds require landmarks. To interpret the configuration of the future, a fortune-teller must seek its first lineaments in dim stains and meanders deposited by dregs in the bottom of a cup. As accident defines its own shape in the chances of matter, and as the hand exploits this disaster, the mind in its own turn awakens. This reordering of a chaotic world achieves its most surprising effects in media apparently unsuited to art, in improvised implements, debris and rubbish whose deteriora-\nko3c | tion and breakage offer curious possibilities. The broken pen that spits out ink, the shredded stick, the rumpled paintbrush, are all struggling in troubled worlds; the sponge sets free moist passages of light, and granulations of the wash sparkle where it is spread. Such an alchemy does not, as is commonly supposed, merely develop the stereotyped form of an inner vision; it constructs the vision itself, gives it body and enlarges its perspectives. The hand is not the mind's docile slave. It searches and experiments for its master's benefit; it has all sorts of adventures; it tries its chance.\nxek3 | At this very point, a visionary like Hugo parts company from a visionary like Blake. Yet, the latter is also a great poet and a man who could use his hands. His very energy is like a laborer's. Blake is a painstaking worker, a craftsman or, rather, he is an artist of the Middle Ages whom a sudden mutation brought forth in England at the threshold of the Machine Age. He does not entrust his poems to the printer, but he writes them out and etches them, ornamenting them with floral motifs, like a master illuminator of long ago. He retraces the blinding visions that haunt him, his Stone Age Bible, his age-old spiritual antiquities of man, for the most part in a ready-made form, in the debased style of his own day - sad athletes with kneecaps and pectorals carefully drawn, heavy devices, Hell as found in Gavin Hamilton and in the studio of David. A vulgar respect for Ideal Form and for the aristocratic manner neutralizes his own profound idealism. Thus, we find spiritualists and amateur Sunday-painters both full of deference for the most worn-out academicism. All this is what we should expect: in them the soul kills the mind and paralyzes the hand.\nbbpr | We take refuge in Rembrandt. Is not his story one of a progressive liberation? His hand was first a slave to pleasing baroque festoons and mordents, then to a finely lacquered execution, but at length, toward the end of his life, his hand became master not\n5zyf | of an unconditioned freedom, nor of a greater virtuosity, but of the necessary daring to take new risks. Simultaneously it takes hold of form, tone and light. It brings the eternal hosts of shadow into the daylight of living men. It piles up centuries in the passing of an instant. It evokes the grandeur of the unique in ordinary men. To familiar things and to everyday dress it imparts the poetry of the exceptional. It extracts fabulous riches from the filth and weariness of poverty. How? Rembrandt's hand plunges to the heart of matter to force it to undergo metamorphosis; one might say that he submits it to the smelting action of a furnace, and that the flame, lapping at these rocky plains, now calcines them, now gilds them. It is not that the painter multiplies caprice and experiment. He rejects curious procedures in order to travel boldly along his way. But the hand is present. It does not indulge in mesmerism. What it creates is not a flat apparition in empty space, but a substance, a body and an organized structure.\n9own | By contrast, what an extraordinary proof of all this I once discovered in some marvellous photographs which a friend brought me from Suez! A clever and sensitive man in those parts had posed some local rabbis before his camera. He cast about them effects of light worthy of an old master. One would think that light emanates from them, from their secular meditation in a shadowed ghetto of Egypt. The foreheads bent over the wide-opened Talmud, the noses of noble oriental curvature, the patriarchal beards, the priestly cloaks with their fine folds - everything about them suggests and affirms Rembrandt. Here indeed are his prophetic old men, enthroned beyond time in the misery and splendor of Israel. What discomfort, however, seized me in looking at these incredibly perfect images! Here is Rembrandt minus Rembrandt. Here is pure perception robbed of substance and density, or rather, here is a dazzling optical souvenir, fixed in that crystalline memory which retains everything, the darkroom. Matter,\nbqfb | hand, man himself, are all absent. Such an absolute void in the totality of presence is a very strange thing. Perhaps I have before my very eyes an example of a future poetic expression; but as yet I cannot people this silence and this waste land.\nwwdt | In considering masters who are full of warmth and freedom, do we not, however, limit ourselves to a type, a group? Have we banished from our reflections, as we might banish artisans with a purely mechanical skill, those masters who with exquisite and faultless patience have evoked more concentrated dreams from choice materials and in refined forms? Is the hand of the engraver, the goldsmith, the illuminator and the lacquerer merely an adroit and complacent servant broken into the practice of fine work? Is what we call perfection, then, the virtue of a slave? Working in the smallest scope, sure of itself and of its direction, such a hand has already become a prodigy, because it subjects the enormous scale of man and of the world to the dimensions of the microcosm. It is no mere device for reducing something. The discipline of restricted size is less important to it than its own capacity for action and truth. At first sight, the festivals and battles of Callot appear to be plates from a book on entomology, migrations of insects in a landscape of molehills. In the Siege of La Rochelle, are not the forts and the ships like toys? Numerous, packed together, precise, complete in every detail, do they not appear as if seen from the large end of an opera glass? Is it not the marvel of this handmade thing that everything is understood and ordered within the limits of a stage that is not only diminutive but immense? Isolate any figure or any ship, examine it under a magnifying glass and it appears not only in its simple grandeur, its viability - while having lost nothing if brought up to normal scale - but it is authentic. By this I mean that it resembles nothing else, that it has the accent of Callot's own handwriting, the inimitable line of his nervous elasticity, of that art of his which\nmn1r | is so attentive to the suppleness of clowns and tightrope walkers, so like elegant fencing, so like the greatest violin playing. Callot writes \"with a clerk's hand,\" as was once said of calligraphers; he writes with the hand of a master - but this hand, so proudly clever, never loses its sympathy for life or its ability to evoke movement. In the ritual of perfection it preserves the sense and practice of freedom.",
