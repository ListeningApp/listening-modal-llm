        "content": "hd35 | El-Guindi et al. used stool colour (clay), US signs (triangular cord sign, contractile gallbladder, gallbladder length greater than or equal to twenty point five millimeters, hepatic artery diameter greater than or equal to two point zero five millimeters, hepatic artery diameter/portal vein diameter greater than or equal to zero point four four five millimeters, hepatic subcapsular flow), laboratory tests and histopathology to develop a twelve-parameter diagnostic score to discriminate biliary atresia from other causes of neonatal cholestasis, reporting a sensitivity and specificity of one hundred percent each. The main concern is the reproducibility of these measurements and of this diagnostic score; Macaluso et al., applying the same diagnostic score to their population, obtained less encouraging results: global sensitivity was thirty-one percent (five out of sixteen) with a specificity of ninety point nine percent (ten out of eleven).\n2zpk | Chen et al. developed a noninvasive algorithm to identify biliary atresia in cholestasis using five predictors (shear wave speed greater than one point three five meters per second, triangular cord sign, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, abnormal gallbladder and clay stool). They divided patients into three risk groups and achieved high diagnostic performance (sensitivity of ninety-eight point seven percent and specificity of ninety-one point four percent) in the high and intermediate risk groups.\nepu7 | Discussion\n7od1 | According to this analysis, MR cholecystopancreatography has no role in the diagnosis of biliary atresia mainly because of the absence of visibility of the normal extrahepatic bile duct, considered a diagnostic criterion by most authors, is observed in almost forty percent of non-cholestatic neonates leading to low specificity. Moreover, MR cholecystopancreatography is more complex to perform than US and has lower diagnostic performance. This conclusion is in agreement with ESPGHAN\n0bqy | (European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition) and NASPGHAN (North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition) guidelines.\nb780 | Concerning hepatobiliary scintigraphy, this analysis shows its very limited role in the diagnosis of biliary atresia because its specificity is very limited with false-positive results in patients presenting with severe medical cholestasis with very limited or even absent choleresis. This again is in agreement with ESPGHAN and NASPGHAN guidelines.\nccmb | More invasive imaging techniques with direct opacification of the biliary tract using percutaneous cholecysto-cholangiography or endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography have been evaluated and show good diagnostic performance. However, the use of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography is very limited by the need of specific endoscopic equipment with trained operators. Percutaneous cholecysto-cholangiography has very good diagnostic performance to confirm or rule out biliary atresia in difficult cases.\nma93 | Percutaneous liver biopsy remains an important but imperfect tool for the diagnosis of biliary atresia since histological biliary atresia features vary with time related to the evolution of the disease and may overlap with non-biliary atresia cholestatic diseases.\nc6hh | According to the results of our systematic review, parts one and two, and consensus of the ESPR Abdominal Taskforce, we proposed at the twenty nineteen ESPR annual meeting in Helsinki a biliary atresia decisional flowchart. In a neonate with conjugated hyperbilirubinemia with or without acholic stools, US should be the first imaging examination. The sufficient duration of fasting for US (greater than four hours) is of paramount importance, and we suggest repeating US on the same day after adequate fasting in doubtful cases. Gallbladder abnormalities, triangular cord sign, micro- or macrocyst, polysplenia, intestinal malrotation, preduodenal portal vein, interrupted inferior vena cava and abdominal heterotaxia have to be searched for and, if possible, elastography should be applied to assess liver stiffness. Dilated intrahepatic bile ducts can rule out biliary atresia. In an infant (less than thirty days old) with low clinical suspicion and normal US findings, we could consider repeating clinical examination, US and biological tests every week; if US findings are normal and cholestasis resolves, no further imaging is needed, but if cholestasis with acholic stools persists or occurs, percutaneous cholecysto-cholangiography or endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography should be performed at the same time as liver biopsy. In cases of equivocal findings on US and very young patients with partially acholic stools, atypical patterns suggestive of medical causes or normal US findings and children between thirty and sixty days of age, we propose percutaneous cholecysto-cholangiography or endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, according to local facilities, and liver biopsy. In cases of suggestive US liver findings and syndromic presentation or suggestive US liver findings and high clinical and biological suspicion, biliary opacification should be done under general anesthesia in the operating room and\ny7ea | followed by surgical biopsy and a Kasai procedure if normal bile ducts are absent.\nnav4 | Our study has several limitations. The papers included a patient age range of three to three hundred sixty days, which is very large for an evolutive pathology that we must diagnose as early as possible, and it creates a real bias especially because some US signs (triangular cord sign and hilar cysts) are age dependent as are the results of liver biopsy. Patient characteristics among studies were different; for example, cystic forms of biliary atresia were excluded in some studies. There is a heterogeneity of study design and we included only English language papers.\ngem8 | Conclusion\ne8nr | Early diagnosis of biliary atresia is of paramount prognostic importance and is the main goal of imaging. No single diagnostic test has an accuracy of one hundred percent and, because biliary atresia is a progressive disease, the diagnostic signs could have a late onset; hence, sensitivity and specificity will vary with age. Among imaging techniques, US has a high specificity, although a normal US examination does not rule out biliary atresia diagnosis. Other imaging techniques with direct opacification of the biliary tree associated with percutaneous liver biopsy have roles in doubtful cases. MR cholecystopancreatography and hepatobiliary scintigraphy have no role in diagnosing biliary atresia. According to the results of our systematic review parts one and two and consensus of the ESPR Abdominal Taskforce, we propose a decisional flowchart for biliary atresia diagnosis based on US signs, including\nk78w | elastography, percutaneous cholecysto-cholangiography or endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and liver biopsy.\ng9du | Declarations\nf682 | Conflicts of Interest None",
