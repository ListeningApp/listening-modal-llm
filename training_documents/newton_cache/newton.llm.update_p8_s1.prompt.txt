You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

usfq | Inexact Newton-type Methods for Optimisation with Nonnegativity Constraints
4jnl | 4. Numerical Experiments
ows8 | We now compare the performance of our method for solving (1) with several alternatives using various convex and non- convex examples. Specifically, we consider Algorithm 2 (denoted by MR), projected Newton-CG (denoted by CG) as in Xie & Wright (2023, Algorithm 1), and projected gradient with line search (denoted by PG) (Beck, 2017). For convex problems, we also include FISTA with line search (Beck & Teboulle, 2009), while for non-convex settings, we compare against the proximal gradient with momentum and fine-tuned constant step size (denoted by PGM) from Lin et al. (2020, Algorithm 4.1). We exclude proximal Newton methods due to the difficulty of solving its subproblems at each iteration. We also do not consider the Newton-CG log barrier method (O'Neill & Wright, 2020) due to poor practical performance observed in Xie & Wright (2023).
qkak | For all applicable methods we terminate according to (7) with <LATEX>\epsilon _ { g } = 1 0 ^ { - 8 } .</LATEX> Instead of the highly implementation dependent "wall-clock" time, here we plot the objective value against the number of oracle calls, i.e., the number of equivalent function evaluations. For completeness, however, we also include plots of objective value against wall-clock time in Appendix F.5. The PyTorch (Paszke et al., 2019) implementation for our experiments is available here. All experiments were performed on a GPU cluster. See Ap- pendix F.3 for further experimental details.
39ur | 4.1. Sparse Regularisation With <LATEX>\ell _ { 1 }</LATEX> Norm
nlm3 | We first consider sparse regression using {1-regularisation
muf5 | <LATEX>\min _ { \mathrm { x } \in \mathbb{R} ^ { d } } f \left( \mathrm { x } \right) + \lambda \| \mathrm { x } \| _ { 1 } ,</LATEX> (12)
lqjf | where <LATEX>f</LATEX> is a smooth function. Although the objective function in (12) is nonsmooth, it can be reformulated into a smooth optimisation problem with nonnegativity con- straints; see Appendix F.2 for details. We consider two examples in this context.
7z7b | Multinomial Regression. In Figures 1 and 2, we consider convex multinomial regression with <LATEX>C</LATEX> classes where <LATEX>f \quad i s</LATEX> given by (62). The FISTA method is applied directly to (12). While FISTA clearly outperforms the others, our method is competitive. Further simulations showing fast local con- vergence of our method on these examples are given in Appendix F.4.
tv8z | Neural Network. Figure 3 shows the results using a two layer neural network where <LATEX>f</LATEX> is non-convex and defined by (63). Again, PGM is applied directly to (12) and its step size is fine-tuned for best performance. We once again observe superior performance of our method compared with the alternatives.
wj6v | <LATEX>\left( d = 2 7 , 6 5 7 \right) \text { with } \lambda = 1 0 ^ { - } .</LATEX> 4.2. Nonnegative Matrix Factorisation
ax4d | Given a nonnegative data matrix <LATEX>\mathrm { Y } \in \mathbb{R} _ { + } ^ { n \times m }</LATEX> nonnegative matrix factorisation (NNMF) aims to produce two low rank, say <LATEX>r ,</LATEX> nonnegative matrices <LATEX>\mathrm { W } \in \mathbb{R} _ { + } ^ { n \times \eta }</LATEX> and <LATEX>\mathrm { H } \in \mathbb{R} _ { + } ^ { r \times m }</LATEX> such that <LATEX>\mathrm { Y } \approx \mathrm { W H } .</LATEX> This can be formulated as
gtbn | <LATEX>\min _ { \mathrm { W } \geq 0 , \mathrm { H } \geq 0 } D \left( \mathrm { Y } , \mathrm { W H } \right) + R _ { \lambda } \left( \mathrm { W } , \mathrm { H } \right) ,</LATEX> (13)
ui4d | where <LATEX>D \left( \cdot , \cdot \right)</LATEX> is a 'distance' and <LATEX>R _ { \lambda } \left( \cdot , \cdot \right)</LATEX> is a regularisation term. In Figure 4, we consider a text dataset and cosine similarity based distance function, while in Figure 5, we use an image dataset and a Euclidean distance function with a nonconvex regulariser; see Appendix F.3 for details. Clearly, our method outperforms all others across both problems.

5bgd | A. MINRES and Newton-MR
m3bl | In this section, for completeness, we discuss MINRES (Algorithm 3) and provide some of its fundamental properties. We note that our presentation is essentially that of Liu & Roosta (2022b, Appendix A) as the notation and implementation is well adapted to our setting. Recall that MINRES combines the Lanczos process, a QR decomposition, and an updating formula to iteratively solve a symmetric linear least-squares problem of the form
7ul5 | min |Hs + g||2.
1b57 | We now discuss each of these aspects in detail.
rwom | Lanczos Process. Recall that, starting from v1 = g/||g||, after t iterations of the Lanczos process, the Lanczos vectors {V1, V2, ... , V+1}, form a basis for the Krylov subspace K+1 (H, g). Collecting these vectors into an orthogonal matrix
