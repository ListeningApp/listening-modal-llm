You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

uzo6 | In this paper we propose a characterization of the relative dynamics in a restricted three-body context as seen in a frame local to a target. In particular, we consider a pair of spacecraft, in the following referred to as chaser and target, flying in the vicinity of the smallest primary, in a region where the third-body effect must be explicitly considered into the relative dynamics. Spacecraft position and velocity vectors are expressed with respect to the smallest primary center of mass. Considering, for instance, the Earth-Moon system, this feature is particularly useful in the case one of the spacecraft loses the line of sight with the ground stations on Earth, because measurements are taken with respect to the Moon. In addition, target orbits in restricted three-body scenarios are generally expressed with respect to the smallest primary. The LVLH frame centered on the target is used as a local frame. As opposed to [17-19], the LVLH frame is defined with reference to the smallest primary, in analogy with the frame definition used for rendezvous in Earth orbits, because vehicles incoming from its surface are expected to approach the target. A general set of equations of relative motion in the restricted three-body problem is derived. Conversely to the aforementioned references, the derivation is performed directly in the LVLH frame, making the resulting equation set particularly appealing for rendezvous and docking operations. The only assumption made is the spacecraft having negligible masses with respect to the primaries. Thus, the equations have general validity, and are not restricted to the elliptic or circular three-body problem. Then, the ER3BP and the CR3BP are considered, in order to derive simplified equation sets. A linearization of the sets is also performed in order to provide linear models useful for preliminary relative guidance, navi- gation, and control system design. The accuracy of the equation sets is analyzed by means of extensive Monte Carlo simulations. The HLEPP is used as a reference mission scenario, and an Earth-Moon NRHO is considered for the target. Linear two-body-based equation sets were also considered in the analysis, and their accuracy compared against the three-body based sets. Given the chosen reference mission, and in order to ease the general readability, in the paper we will refer to the Earth-Moon system. Nevertheless, application of the proposed equation to other three-body systems is straightforward, because the simplifications considered in the paper are not based on any peculiar characteristic of the lunar orbit or of the Earth-Moon system.

5f7e | The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II a brief review of the ER3BP and of the CR3BP is provided, and the spacecraft equations of motion with respect to the Moon are derived. Section III discusses the derivation of equations of relative motion for the exact description of the relative dynamics of a chaser spacecraft with respect to a target in the restricted three-body problem context. Possible simplifications of the relative dynamics are discussed in Sec. IV, where four equation sets are derived. The accuracy of the sets is analyzed in Sec. V. Conclusions are drawn in Sec. VI.
h83u | II. Restricted Three-Body Dynamics
kjoa | Consider the three-body system composed by the Earth and the Moon primary bodies and a spacecraft i, with masses Me, Mm, and mi, respectively. Their positions with respect to an inertial frame I is denoted with Re, Rm, and Ri, respectively.

s7el | Me[Rel = GMmMerem + GmiMerei rem rei
0lfu | Mm[Ämlz = - G- Pam ent 2 + G- mįMm
cnjl | where rei = Ri - Re and rmi = Ri - Rm denote the position of the spacecraft i with respect to the Earth and to the Moon, rem = Rm - Re is the position of the Moon with respect to the Earth, and G is the universal gravitational constant. Relative positions norms are indicated with rei, "mi, and rem. The notation [R]z denotes the acceleration of the body as seen from the inertial frame.

chx3 | (1)

umx0 | We now assume that the mass of the spacecraft i is negligible with respect to the primaries masses (i.e., m; < Me and m; < Mm); that is, we consider the restricted three-body problem. Under this assumption the orbital motion of the two primaries is not affected by the spacecraft, and Eqs. (1) and (2) simplify to:
o306 | (3)
qm1b | where He = GMe and um = GMm are the primaries' gravitational parameters.
n9ms | Assume now that the primaries revolve around their common barycenter in elliptic orbits (elliptic restricted three-body problem). The motion of the two primaries can then be obtained from the solution of the classical two-body problem.
icdp | The equations of motion for the spacecraft i are generally written in a frame that rotates with the primaries. A Moon or synodic reference frame M: {Rm; Îm, jm, km} is introduced, with origin in the Moon center of mass, and unit vectors defined as follows:
wtse | Îm =_ Tem, Îm=Km XÎm, Km = Amle , hmle
bm7g | where hmle = rem X [ emlz is the specific angular momentum of the Moon with respect to the Earth, and hm/e = |hm/e ||; see Fig. 1. The Earth-Moon system, and consequently the frame M, rotates with respect to the inertial frame I with angular velocity @m/i =@m/ikm.
jr68 | The acceleration of the spacecraft i in the frame M is given by:
axix | [Ïmilz = [ÏmilM + 20m/i > [imilm + [@m/i]MX Imi + @m/i
05y4 | X (@m/i XImi)
2fb0 | (4)
s9fn | where 200m/i X [milM is the Coriolis acceleration and @m/i X (@m/i XImi) is the centripetal acceleration term.
k5r6 | In the Moon frame we have that rem = - remÎm, and the spacecraft position vectors with respect to the Moon and to the Earth are defined as follows:
z9v9 | I'mi = x{m + ViĴm + 2 Km, "ei = (X; - Tem)Îm + ViÎm + z;km
