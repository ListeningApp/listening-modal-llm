You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

06yq | Microdosing with psychedelics to self-medicate for ADHD symptoms in adults: A naturalistic study
dpv6 | ARTICLE INFO
8r5j | ABSTRACT
2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

tuu3 | notes:
4lo0 | When you add objects, like worksheets, into a horizontal or vertical layout container, the widths and heights of the objects will be sized automatically, unless you specify otherwise. In case you're using actions, which will be discussed in the next chapter, it's particularly useful to use containers for sizing automatically.
yskz | Setting the size of dashboard elements
1y6b | Usually, dashboard elements such as containers can be set by manipulating the border handles of each container and resizing them to a suitable size. Tableau Public also offers a Size feature, as shown in the following screenshot, that allows for more control in the positioning and sizing of these dashboard elements:
ihhb | 1
xvgt | The dashboard element must be in the floating mode so that it can be sized and positioned. In case the container or element is not already in the floating mode, it can be set to floating by clicking on the dashboard element and checking off the Floating checkbox, as shown in the previous screenshot.
k2yr | notes
y5vm | To change the positioning of the dashboard element, enter the x and y coordinates (this will take some trial and error) in the corresponding Pos: fields, or scroll up and down with the arrows for fine correction. To change Size, enter the width (w) and height (h) values in the corresponding fields using the up and down arrows for fine adjustment.

r4hn | Dashboard Design and Styling
7nts | In the Size section of the Tableau Public controls on the left side of the dashboard, you can also choose to show the title of a particular chart by selecting or deselecting the Show Title checkbox. You must first select the dashboard element either in the dashboard, or in the Layout section of the Tableau Public controls. To show or hide the title of the dashboard, you can click on the Dashboard field in the Layout section and select or deselect Show Title. This may also be done, as described earlier in this chapter, by using the Dashboard | Show Title menu command.
68kv | Sizing the dashboard
0b1o | Tableau Public presents many size options for the entire dashboard. This feature helps you select a size either for a blog or other website, or optimized for a tablet computer. To set the dashboard size, click on Dashboard in the Layout section of the Tableau Public controls.
xogx | There is also an option to resize the entire dashboard. For example, you may find that scrollbars appear to the right, or at the bottom of the dashboard, that you don't want to see. Alternatively, you may prefer matching the dashboard to a standard web page or computer desktop size. Again, in the Layout section, select Dashboard, or ensure that no worksheet or other elements are selected on the dashboard itself. The Size section presents a drop-down menu with a variety of dashboard size options.
cusa | Many sizing options are available for selection depending on your needs. Blog, iPad, Laptop, Desktop, Exactly, and Automatic are some of the typical settings. It will take some trial and error to properly size a dashboard for your needs.
yrit | It is important to consider the methods in which you will be publishing your dashboard. If you are publishing your dashboard to your blog, you need to make sure that it properly fits into the layout that you have selected.
xwzi | Building a dashboard
7rjv | In order to build a sample dashboard, which has a title, aggregate data, change over time, detailed data, and proper context, as shown at https : //public.tableau. com/views/Chaper7-Dashboards/CO2EmissionsDashboard.

iroe | Chapter 7
m9bf | Perform the following steps to build the dashboard:
44d4 | 1. Create a new dashboard by clicking on the dashboard creation icon in the filmstrip.
5rgr | 2. Name it CO2 Emissions Dashboard; the name is important because it will be part of the URL for the workbook.
a1gl | 3. Size the dashboard so that it fits a blog, as shown in the following screenshot. This size fits in a typical WordPress blog, and it is also narrower than most mobile devices and laptops. Therefore, the size will work well for users of multiple devices:
vxin | 4. We added containers knowing that we wanted to have a title, aggregate data, supporting details, and conclusions. We added a vertical layout container so that our visualizations and objects will stack on top of each other. The following steps will guide you to add data-map in the layout container:
vj4s | 1. We dragged the aggregated data-map of CO2 Emissions per Capita into the vertical layout container.
x4c3 | 2. We then dragged the next worksheet, Emissions Over Time, into the very bottom of the vertical layout container so that the worksheet and the map would be automatically sized.
jhyp | 3. We dragged the worksheet from the Dashboard pane to the bottom of the container and dropped it when we saw the wide gray border, as shown in the following screenshot:

9ejb | Dashboard Design and Styling
3dzn | 5. We assessed that the dashboard shown in the following screenshot isn't pretty. It still needs a title, and it should be rearranged:
tnh4 | 6. We added a title before rearranging it, by performing the following steps:
cn2s | 1. Drag a Text object to the very top of the vertical layout container above the map.
seh0 | 2. Populate the title (Carbon Dioxide Emissions by Country in 2008) and then format it in 18 pt black Arial, which is wide enough to fit in the screen.

3i2y | 7. The layout needs some work. Color legends need to move closer to their respective visualizations, and we need to change it so it can be fitted in some visualizations, as shown in the following screenshot:
qo5h | 8. Move the Percentile color legend for the map by performing the following steps:
vg7d | 1. Click on it to select it.
768z | 2. Click on its context menu.
8ant | 3. Change it to floating.
ub5e | 9. Move it below the center of the map (we will move it again later).
ec6h | 10. We decided to remove the color legend for Region altogether.
w6yy | 11. Remove the size legend for Avg. Once we have actually used a bar in the heat map; you can check it out by clicking on it.
3cxo | 12. We removed the last color legend, which is for the heat map. The colors are used to indicate rank, and they follow the same color scheme as that of the map (brown is bad, and blue is good).
zxlu | 13. Adjust the fit of the containers as:
165g | ° The heat map needs to be fit differently. Therefore, click on its context menu, select Fit, and choose Fit Width.

932d | 14. Next, add titles by performing the following steps:
eab8 | 15. Add a text object above the line graph; the title should be highly descriptive. It tells our users exactly what they are looking at, and it also tells them how to get more details. We used 14 pt black Arial font for the main title, and the call to action (that is, the text that tells the user what to do) is in 10 pt gray Arial, as shown in the following screenshot:
78uf | ]
d4u8 | [ You can also add an image above the line graph. We added an image of a simple gray line that we created in Microsoft Paint and then saved as a bitmap.
hi2c | ° We also added a floating title for the heat map because we had extra horizontal space but less vertical space. We used the same fonts as that of the previous title and added a light gray shade so that it's visually separated from the graph itself.
xhx2 | 16. Add more context with tooltips and labels; it's important for users to know exactly what they are looking at, how the data points relate to each other, and how it relates to them. You can modify the tooltip for the map by performing the following steps:
64tz | 1. Click on Map Visualization to select it.
myvp | 2. Click on the Worksheet menu.
nr73 | 3. Select Tooltip.
a2o9 | 4. Modify the contents and font so that they add obvious context and do not require users to do a lot of work to figure out what they are viewing, as shown in the following screenshot:
e4rj | [ 146 ]
7u2p | www.it-ebooks.info
l5og | Chapter 7
x06y | 5. Repeat these steps for other visualizations. Make sure that you use the same font face and size in each tooltip. Consistency of design is critical.
lhv3 | 6. Modify the data labels, particularly for the line graph.
d14u | 7. Navigate to the worksheet, and place the appropriate fields on the Label shelf in case they were not there already.
w90k | 17. Format dashboard so that the right emphasis is created.
2vn7 | Change their location relative to each other on the dashboard so that they are all legible by clicking on individual labels and then dragging them elsewhere.
mv86 | We felt comfortable making custom placements because we do not have a filter on the dashboard. (We will discuss filters in the next chapter.) We are confident that, with a specific size of the dashboard, the labels will always appear where we placed them.
8miy | If you want to undo custom placements, you can right-click on the label and select undo the custom location, as shown in the following screenshot:
h5l3 | ° Adjust the size of the dashboard to 540 x 900 pixels because it appears compressed. Unfortunately, this means that we'll have a vertical scroll bar when not using a studio monitor, but we needed to make sure that the visualizations were legible. It's better to have a vertical scroll bar than a cramped dashboard. If no one can read it, it's a waste of time and effort.

It tells the story of not only how carbon dioxide emissions have changed geographically over time, but also what compounding factors may be contribute towards the future growth of Tableau Public.
m5cf | Summary
ug1e | In this chapter, we discussed best practices of dashboard design as well as how to build an empathetically designed user experience that tells a concise story with data. You also learned that Tableau Public dashboards are composed of one or more sheets (chart visualizations) with added elements such as text, captions, and interactivity such as filters and actions. Dashboards may also contain, or open web pages and can pass dashboard information into the web page in some instances.
txjz | Keep in mind that a good dashboard design helps you convey a pertinent message to the reader. Have a goal in mind pertaining to what you wish to get across to the readers. Elements of a good dashboard design start with good data and visualizations, and these visualizations come together in an aesthetically pleasing, intuitive dashboard that helps users tease out conclusions and discoveries of their own. Knowing your audience is critical to dashboard design.
tahh | In the next chapter, we will explore filters and actions, which are important tools in adding interactivity to dashboards.

lu5d | Filters and Actions
mw2y | Dashboard filters and actions in Tableau Public enable users to precisely select the information that they would like to explore, which is powerful. Selecting what's interesting makes a data story personal and relevant to users; all of this is done without shifting their attention or their mouse away from the dashboard. Filters and actions create true interactivity. They also give you, as an author, the ability to connect disparate sources of data or web pages to complete user experience.
kba4 | In this chapter, we will discuss the following topics:
lxpp | . Adding and using Quick Filters
xvte | . Filtering the Data sources with parameters
3qkr | . Filtering the Data sources with controller worksheets
5y46 | · Highlighting actions
9dqf | . Action Filters
vugf | · URL Actions
7d5n | Adding and using Filters
22rs | Filters are designed to meet several needs of your users; the following are some of these needs:
bjpt | · Limiting the scope of an analysis
vkpg | . Allowing users to view only what interests them
yix9 | · Removing outliers
iaod | [149 ]
t8jd | www.it-ebooks.info
nz5q | Using a filter to limit the data that is extracted into your workbook improves the performance of the workbook. However, the following are the two disadvantages of using filters on dashboards:
a2fr | . Using many filter actions with multiple Dimension members can slow down a dashboard's performance.
hm2f | . Filters can be applied to only one data source at a time. So, in case multiple data sources are being used on one dashboard, you'll need to use parameters or controller worksheets to filter all of them.
rrgl | In this chapter, we will use the dashboard that we created in the previous chapter. You can download the finished product by visiting https://public.tableau.com/ views/Chaper7-Dashboards/CO2EmissionsDashboard ?: embed=y& : display_ count=yes& : showTabs=y. The dashboard uses only one data source at this point. As we progress through this chapter, we'll add another dashboard along with a fourth visualization.
yf3c | Adding Filters to worksheets
ptp0 | In the dashboard that we are using, we have already filtered the map to show only the data for 2008, which is a blue pill on the Filters shelf, because it is a discrete number. You will also see that there are green pills for Latitude and Longitude. Both of these pills are continuous numbers, and they are included on the Filters shelf because we filtered out the null values, as shown in the following screenshot:
qtyd | If a field is not already on the Filters shelf, you can drag it there from the Data window. Alternatively, you can create a Quick Filter by right-clicking on it in the Data window and selecting Show Quick Filter, as shown in the following screenshot. Tableau Public will then display the Quick Filter on the upper right-hand side of the workspace, but you can easily move it around the worksheet, as shown in the following screenshot:
ju7r | [ 150 ]
ggbe | www.it-ebooks.info
vefl | Chapter 8
k6et | For instance, if a field is a part of a visualization and it's on the Rows or Columns shelf, the Marks card, or anywhere else, you can click on its Context menu and select Filter.
mw5f | There is a catch to adding filters. If a field is not on the Filters shelf of a worksheet, you won't be able to add it as a filter on the dashboard. In the following screenshot, we navigated to the worksheet in the workbook that has the map on it and added the filter there. In the next section of this chapter, we will go back to the dashboard and add the Quick Filter.
m1ik | To add a Quick Filter for Region, perform the following steps:
aj2w | 1. Right-click on Region in the Data window.
xhz8 | 2. Click on Show Quick Filter.
aqos | 3. Then, it's time to make a selection. With a discrete field such as Region, you will see the dimension members that you can choose. The Filters dialog box is shown in the following screenshot:
209y | [ 151 ]
yrjp | www.it-ebooks.info
hzcm | 4. In the General tab, we can perform the following operations, as shown in the preceding screenshot:
dz5o | ° Select from list (A): This uses either a custom list of values, or all the values.
m2rl | ° The search box (B): We can search for a text string that is present in a dimension member.
ek0a | ° Checkboxes (C): Click on the checkboxes next to the dimensions that we want to keep or exclude.
e4tl | ° The filter (D): This sets the filter to show fewer values, which means that it shows the values that are automatically limited by the selections of other filters, and it doesn't show all the discrete values in the field.
voil | ° All or None (E): You can select All or None, as required.
24g5 | ° Exclude (F): This excludes the values that we have selected. If you are excluding values, be careful when exposing the filter to users. They might need some extra instructions about what the exclusion means and how to use it.
j1i2 | ° Summary (G): This shows a summary of your selection.
22xo | ° Reset (H): This resets all values.
ye4p | ° OK, Cancel, and Apply (I): Click on Apply and then on the OK button to filter and set worksheet.
xdal | 5. In our example, we selected all the values and then deselected Aggregates.
i4yy | 6. Then, we clicked on OK.
