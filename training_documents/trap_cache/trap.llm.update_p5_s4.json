Where data are available, we include some comparisons with past experiences of earlier graduates to H I, especially to show that earlier graduates did not face the same challenges and cleavages as those facing today's M I countries.\nwkbn | Two. The Institutional Challenges of Today's Middle-Income Trap\nftfg | The upgrading reforms required to move out of middle-income status are difficult and complex, especially compared to reforms that, while generating real distributional tensions, can be implemented by fiat by small groups of insulated technocrats. Because of their complexities, implementing upgrading reforms requires institutions to coordinate, to monitor and reconcile the interests of multiple actors, and to help provide specialized information. Such institutions operate at multiple levels, ranging from overall sectoral coordinating institutes and public-private consultative councils, to judicial offices for effective contract enforcement and patent protection, to agencies specializing in areas such as innovation financing, testing and standards, research and development promotion, and vocational training. Creating such institutions is difficult because they require both horizontal coordination among state agencies, among firms, and between public and private actors, and vertical coordination of numerous providers, such as highly trained researchers, judges, teachers, curriculum developers, and test engineers, each of whom plays important roles in long implementation chains.\n7xi5 | This section focuses on two such institution-intensive reform areas essential to increasing productivity: education (human capital) and investment in research and development. These are, for good reason, usually at the top of the policy priorities identified by economic studies of the M I trap. The scatterplots of Figures one and two show both the wide gap between H I and M I countries and that large M I countries fall below the levels expected at their income. Most important, these policy areas also illustrate the huge institutional hurdles facing countries seeking to exit M I limbo. Our goal in this section is not to attempt to identify a short list of reforms that\nw8r5 | might solve the M I trap, but rather to show the major institution building necessary to get out of it. For brevity, we concentrate on education and research and development, but the framework applies to a range of other policy areas, including legal and financial systems, which are similarly institution intensive.\nybik | Moreover, the challenges are greater now than they were in the twentieth century, when countries graduated to H I with lower levels of education and research and development. In education, for example, the average years of school in the adult population was eight for countries that graduated to H I in the nineteen sixties and nineteen seventies, and eight point four for countries that graduated in the nineteen eighties and nineteen nineties. The average in our nine large countries in M I limbo was already eight point eight years by two thousand ten, while the average for all advanced countries in two thousand ten had risen to eleven years.\ngii5 | The empirical analysis concentrates on large upper-M I countries of Latin America (Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, Colombia, and Peru), Southeast Asia (Thailand and Malaysia), South Africa, and Turkey. One reason for this is that the median time in M I status for these nine countries is sixty years and counting, well beyond the average noted in the introduction of forty-two years for earlier industrializers. Excluding China, these nine countries account for two-thirds of all the people living in M I countries.\nq5eu | Further, given extensive heterogeneity among the fifty-three countries listed as middle income in two thousand fourteen, we think analyses of the dynamics of more homogeneous subsets of M I countries is likely to yield better insights. Among the subsets, we exclude smaller M I countries (under twenty million inhabitants) that depend more on their larger regional trading partners and have advantages, as discussed below, in overcoming the divisions of M I politics. Another subset, postsocialist transition economies, entered M I with much stronger educational institutions and lower inequality and informality, and the institutional challenges they face are related more to transitions to capitalism. Last, M I countries heavily dependent on oil exports face challenges of overcoming the distinctive perils of the resource curse. Enormous heterogeneity notwithstanding, our quantitative analysis often includes all M I countries, and many of our arguments could travel, in revised form, to other M I countries. Of course, even among our nine large M I countries there are major differences, to which we return in Section V.\nsb1e | EDUCATION\nw2yn | Despite steady progress over recent decades in increasing access and spending, educational achievement in M I countries continues to lag. Conversely, countries where education levels have historically exceeded the norm for their income levels have been some of the fastest growing in East Asia and the ones most likely to escape the M I trap. Several measures give a clear picture of gaps in educational quality and performance: Program for International Student Assessment scores, proportion of the labor force with tertiary education, and number of technical workers in research and development activities. The gaps show both the problem of low human capital and the enormous challenge to overcoming the M I trap.",
