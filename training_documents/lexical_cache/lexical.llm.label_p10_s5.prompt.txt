You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

xnth | Another consideration is that although fixed stress is sometimes located at a word boundary, this is not always so (as in Polish, where stress is on the penul- timate syllable). Given that the process of spoken-word recognition involves con- tinuous exploitation of incoming acoustic information (see Frauenfelder & Floccia, 1998, for a review), fixed stress other than at a word edge will involve additional processing complexity. A third consideration is that fixed stress may affect all words irrespective of word class, or may be sensitive to grammatical factors.
vafm | 274 Anne Cutler
2zmw | This last consideration motivated investigations by Dupoux and Peperkamp (2002; Peperkamp & Dupoux, 2002), who aim ultimately to explain the acquisi- tion of word prosody by infants. Dupoux and Peperkamp suggest that overall listener sensitivity to stress cues in adulthood will depend on the function of stress in their native language; in general, languages without lexically contrastive stress will not require that listeners develop sensitivity to stress information in speech. However, such non-contrastive languages differ in how accessible the rules for prosodic prominence are to an infant. In some languages (e.g., Finnish, French), prominence is unaffected by grammatical factors; infants should be able to learn early that stress plays no useful contrastive role and can be ignored. In other languages (e.g., Hungarian, Polish), prominence rules affect lexical words and grammatical (function) words differently; this pattern should be harder to learn, with the result that some sensitivity to stress contrasts may develop. Initial studies by Dupoux et al. (1997) and Dupoux, Peperkamp, and Sebastián-Gallés (2001) showed that speakers of French have great difficulty processing stress contrasts in nonsense materials, e.g., deciding whether a token bopeLO should be matched with an earlier token of bopeLO or boPElo. The same contrasts are easy for speakers of Spanish, which does distinguish words via stress. Dupoux and Peperkamp then tested Finnish speakers, whose performance indeed resembled that of French speakers, and speakers of Hungarian and Polish, whose perform- ance fell between the French/Finnish and the Spanish levels.
bf9k | 11.2.5 Fixed stress and segmentation
otkr | Dupoux and Peperkamp's (2002) work suggests that fixed-stress languages cannot be treated as a unitary class. With regard to lexical segmentation, the available evidence on fixed-stress languages still falls far short of that on free-stress lan- guages. In Indonesian (with phrase-final accent) listeners do not show evidence of using stress placement for segmentation (van Zanten & van Heuven, 1998). However, some studies on French and on Finnish (fixed initial stress) have pro- vided evidence consistent with use of demarcation cues by listeners. In French, the accent-bearing right boundary of a rhythmic group is always also the right boundary of a word; Dahan (1996) found that listeners detect target syllables located at a rhythmic group boundary more rapidly than the same syllables elsewhere in an utterance. In Finnish, a word-spotting study by Suomi, McQueen, and Cutler (1997) showed that vowel harmony (which is a word-level phenom- enon) can be used by listeners in segmentation; indirect evidence on stress process- ing can be deduced from their control experiment, in which excised embedded words from the word-spotting materials were recognized no less rapidly if taken from a preceding context (e.g., palo from kupalo) than from a following context (e.g., palo from paloku). Although the former type could be considered not to have been uttered with canonical stress, no deleterious effects of this on word recogni- tion were observed. Vroomen, Tuomainen, and De Gelder (1998) replicated the Suomi et al. finding but showed that even stronger than vowel harmony was the effect on segmentation exercised by clearly marked word-initial stress. In a further experiment, Vroomen et al. showed that Finnish listeners were sensitive to vowel harmony and to stress (operationalized as higher FO) in learning the "words" of
ibgs | Lexical Stress 275
colo | an artificial language, while Dutch listeners were sensitive only to the stress cue and French listeners were sensitive to neither cue.
d6r4 | These results are difficult to account for in the light of Dupoux and Peperkamp's (2002) finding that stress contrasts were overlooked by both French and Finnish listeners. However, it should be noted that the type of segmentation task used by Dahan (1996) does not directly tap word processing. Further, Vroomen et al. (1998) do not report how stress was realized in their word-spotting materials, but it is possible that as in their artificial language study, a clear F0 correlate was avail- able. As Finnish has fixed initial stress, the initial syllable is the designated location for the realization of intonational prominence, but in the absence of such higher- level effects, Finnish stressed syllables are in fact not distinct in F0 from unstressed syllables (Suomi, Toivanen, & Ylitalo, 2003). The principal acoustic correlate of Finnish word stress is segmental lengthening within a word's initial two morae, even when the second mora is also the second syllable (Suomi & Ylitalo, 2004). The confound observed by Dogil (1999) in Jassem's (1962) work may thus also apply to Vroomen et al.'s study: listeners may have been able to use information relevant not to the lexical but to the intonational structure of the utterance (see Vaissière, this volume, for evidence on intonation perception).
9mrz | 11.2.6 The contrastive potential of stress
pk06 | The putative contrastive function of stress must be considered in the light of the undeniable rarity of minimal word pairs which differ in stress alone (such as, for example, trusty and trustee in English). Free-stress languages make remarkably little use of the contrastive possibilities which stress in principle offers them. But there are other ways in which stress may be useful in word recognition. Statistical analyses by Altmann and Carter (1989) established that the amount of informa- tion conveyed by phonetic segments in English is highest for vowels in stressed syllables. Further, stressed syllables are acoustically reliable: they are more read- ily identified than unstressed syllables when excised from a context (Lieberman, 1963), and speech distortions are more likely to be detected in stressed than in unstressed syllables (Bond & Garnes, 1980; Browman, 1978; Cole & Jakimik, 1980; Cole, Jakimik, & Cooper, 1978). In gated presentation of spontaneously spoken - but not of read - sentences, stressed syllables are recognized earlier than unstressed syllables (McAllister, 1991). Also in spontaneous speech, word-initial target pho- nemes are detected more rapidly on lexically stressed than unstressed syllables (Mehta & Cutler, 1988). Note that acoustic differences between stressed and unstressed syllables are relatively large in spontaneous speech. With laboratory- read materials, however, such differences do not always arise; Mattys and Samuel (2000) found that phoneme detection was in general faster in words with initial stress, irrespective of whether the target phoneme occurred in the stressed syllable or elsewhere in the word.
7wn9 | Models of spoken-word recognition agree that continuous evaluation of speech input results in simultaneous activation of multiple candidate word forms which at any moment are supported by the input; eventual recognition proceeds on the basis of further input information but also via a process of competition between the activated words (Frauenfelder & Floccia, 1998). Within this presumably universal
wcd0 | 276 Anne Cutler
caos | framework, the input information constraining activation will be necessarily language-specific. Like segmental contrasts, the relevant suprasegmental con- trasts will differ across languages. If listeners do take account of stress, it can certainly help to reduce the number of word candidates. Van Heuven & Hagman's (1988) analyses of the Dutch vocabulary established that words could on aver- age be identified after 80% of their phonemes (counting from word onset) had been considered; when stress information was included, however, a forward search was successful given only 66% of the phonemes. Wingfield, Goodglass, and Lindfield (1997) found that stress was relevant in determining the number of potential English word candidates from which listeners' recognition of gated words could be predicted. Section 11.3 considers empirical evidence for whether stress correlates in fact do constrain spoken word recognition.
qrvy | 11.3 Stress in the Recognition of Spoken Words
pn9j | 11.3.1 Lexical activation
1pmc | The acoustic information in the signal which varies as a function of stress could play an early constraining role in lexical activation in the following way: as speech input activates word candidates, only those candidates which match the structure signaled by the input in stress as well as in segmental structure would become active. Words with non-matching stress or mismatching segments would not come into consideration.
5z6q | Note that this means that stress information could play a substantial role in lexical activation even in languages where the number of word pairs distinguished by suprasegmental stress cues alone is vanishingly small. Word candidates may be activated by partial information as words are spoken; an utterance of bottle may temporarily cause activation of bother, botch, and botany among other words (Allopenna, Magnuson, & Tanenhaus, 1998; Zwitserlood, 1989). A word-initial syllable consisting of a given string of phonetic segments may be differently stressed in different words even though the words do not form a minimal stress pair. Although this is more likely in stress languages without vowel reduction, it also happens in English and similar languages. Thus music begins with stressed mu- while museum begins with unstressed mu -; ad- has primary stress in admiral but secondary stress in admiration. If stress cues distinguish these syllables for the purposes of lexical activation, then mu- is not the same syllable in music and museum, and the utterance of one will not activate, even temporarily, the other.
yeoh | The same opposition can of course occur with non-initial portions of words - compare -day in today or Tuesday, or -cide in decide or suicide - and this difference may play a crucial role in listening situations in which initial portions of a word have for some reason not been heard. But the role of stress information in con- straining lexical activation via distinctions in word-initial sequences is potentially even more significant.
b8hf | Evidence from studies of the effect of segmental mismatch on lexical activation suggests that as incoming phonetic information matches one of two competitors but not the other, the losing competitor suffers inhibition (Vitevitch & Luce, 1998). Listeners exploit distinctive information rapidly to favor a matched competitor,
hntf | Lexical Stress 277
99fo | which is thus enabled to compete more effectively and actually cause significant reduction in activation of its mismatched rival. The effects of a stress mismatch and a segmental mismatch were directly compared by Soto-Faraco, Sebastián- Gallés, and Cutler (2001). In their study, native speakers of Castilian Spanish heard spoken sentences (of a non-constraining type such as He did not know how to write the word ... ) ending with a word fragment which fully matched one of two potential words and differed from the other in just a single phoneme or in stress pattern. For instance, the fragment prinCI- (stressed on the second syllable) matches the first two syllables of the Spanish word prinCIpio (beginning) and differs only in stress from the first two syllables of the Spanish word PRINcipe (prince). Likewise, the fragment sardi- matches sardina (sardine) but mismatches sardana (a type of dance) in a single vowel, and the fragment bofe- fully matches bofeton (smack) but mismatches boletin (bulletin) in a single consonant. At the offset of the word fragment listeners saw a string of letters on a screen and were asked to decide whether this string was a real word. Their responses were significantly faster to a visually presented word after matching fragments (e.g., to SARDINA after sardi-, to PRINCIPIO after prinCI-, etc.) than after control frag- ments (e.g., manti-); responses after fragments which minimally mismatched and favored another word (e.g., to SARDINA after sarda-, to PRINCIPIO after PRINci-, etc.) were, crucially, significantly slower than responses after control fragments. The three types of mismatch information (vocalic, consonantal, stress) each produced the same pattern of inhibition in Soto-Faraco et al.'s experiment.
y5r7 | Donselaar, Koster, and Cutler (2005) replicated the stress comparison from Soto-Faraco et al.'s fragment priming study in Dutch, presenting fragments like octo- which matched one of either OCtopus or okTOber and mismatched the other only in stress placement. They too found that responses preceded by a matching prime were significantly facilitated, while responses preceded by a mismatching prime were slowed, in comparison to responses after the control prime. Again, listeners used the stress information to speed the victory of one of two competitors for lexical recognition. By comparison, a similar study by Cutler and Donselaar (2001) found that fragments like MUzee which mismatched muSEum in stress did not cause facilitation of the matched word, but also did not cause inhibition; no Dutch word begins MUzee so there is no competitor to inhibit the mismatched word. Words such as museum are thus activated only when their initial portions are appropriately stressed. This was shown directly by another of Cutler and Donselaar's (2001) experiments, using the word-spotting task, in which listeners monitor short nonsense strings for the presence of any embedded real word. McQueen, Norris, and Cutler (1994) had shown that this task could reveal com- petition effects; the English word mess was detected more rapidly in the nonsense context neMES (which activates no competitor) than in doMES (which activates doMEStic, competition from which slows the recognition of mess). Cutler and Donselaar replicated this result in Dutch: zee 'sea' was detected more rapidly in luZEE (activating no competitor) than in muZEE (activating museum). In MUzee, however, the detection of zee was not significantly slowed, suggesting that museum had not been activated.
lrry | A single-syllable fragment (e.g., the first syllable of octopus or oktober) produced significant facilitation if it matched, but did not produce inhibition if it mismatched, i.e., was taken from a word with the contrasting stress pattern (Donselaar et al.,
hvhm | 278 Anne Cutler
863b | 2005); the same pattern appeared in a fragment priming study in German by Friedrich (2002). Friedrich, Kotz, and Gunter (2001) presented fragments of varying length, but did not use target pairs contrasting in onset stress such as octopus- oktober, so that (as in Donselaar et al.'s study with museum) no competition and hence no inhibition was involved; however, these authors found that facilitation did not significantly increase with increasing fragment size. The difference in inhibition due to the constraint in the competition process exercised by two syllables versus one is presumably a function of number of remaining potential competitors; after two syllables the competitor set will be smaller. In either case, cues to stress in the realization of word-initial portions are clearly used by listeners.
