        "content": "w5lk | Either realise this, and satisfy your attention-demanding and comfort-seeking appetites separately from your studies; or realise it and accept whatever the Teaching can offer you.\npb48 | In the latter case, you will have to follow a course dictated in its conditions and forming by effectiveness and not sentiment.\nnriw | It is the true discrimination between diversion and genuine aspiration which generally precedes the emergence of the capacity to learn.\nh7kb | Physical presence is not always real presence.\n2mrs | Mechanical performance of actions and reliance on totemistic objects and slogans, which is in fact what many people do and imagine that they are following a teaching, are forms of attachment to what are or amount to objects. Of course, genuine aspiration is hard to maintain, and it is the falling by the wayside of the people ('the birds') in Fariduddin Attar's classic Mantiq al-Tair, the 'Conference of the Birds', which is caused by their craving this attachment.\nf7it | Even the intellect, as he reminds us in that book, cannot help - only what is called by the Sufis Love; and yet this itself is love of something to which one cannot attach as to a person or even to a familiar concept. Many Sufi practices, carried out in accordance with the right directions, aim at defeating this mechanical tendency and awakening the capacity for attachment to the Real.\no9jm | Being physically present, seeking system and a certain kind of familiar regularity in studies, is something which comes from automatistic thinking. To demand it because one has a predilection for it is hardly constructive.\ngz4c | Q: But [someone said] in all forms of study known to me there is regularity and organisation, a system, which is adhered to. Surely it is no wonder that people look for system, and not surprising that if they do not find it, they cease to be interested.\nu30w | A: Let me ask you a question, to help me to get things clearer, then I will answer you. The question is: 'If there is a formula for approaching a study, written down, say, seven hundred years ago, and found in books published continuously since then, and practised by millions of people, would you yourself be negligent if you did not know about it and asked questions about how to find this formula, or would the people involved in this study be responsible, rather than you?' [The questioner answered]: If the answer to the question which I have just asked were available in English at this rime, in a generally circulated book on this subject (since I think I have read all of them) then I would be negligent, and not you or others like you.\nee2o | A: [Continues]. Very well. Now, have you read Professor Arberry's nineteen sixty-one translation of Professor Faruzanfar's nineteen fifty-two edition of Rumi's thirteenth-century Fihi ma Fihi, published in England? [Questioner]: Yes.\np87c | A: [Continues]. Let us now look at that book. On page sixty Rumi likens the stages of a journey by sea to one on land, and also makes clear the differences between the two, does he not? He tell us that, whereas the landmarks are visible - which I will call the familiar system - when going by land, the equivalent stages, if you are travelling by sea, are not visible in the same way, not marked. They are known to the Captain. The ship's captain knows them, but they are not told to landsmen, since they are not able to understand. Can you therefore say that the system is not there, and that it is not being carried out? Certainly not. Do you now see that you are asking for the recipe for making jam by the method for growing wheat?\nreyp | [Questioner]: I do, indeed. I can only say that I am not accustomed to thinking in that way, to approaching things by such a method ... Obviously, I need to take a more flexible view of these written materials.\n9vu6 | The Way to Sufism\nli13 | Q: Could we have any remarks on the present character of receptivity of man to Sufic ideas, as seen from the Sufi viewpoint?\nyb5z | A: Metaphysicians, no less than market researchers, monitor the condition and receptivity of the minds with which they are trying to communicate.\nl7da | The main difference between the activities of, say, the sociologists and those of the spiritual workers is that the results of the latter are not widely published, publicised, employed in academic treatises. They are used in supplying verification material for trainees who would otherwise find it impossible to credit the facts about humanity.\n24j5 | Which facts? Here are instances:\nsyjc | You may have something to teach, and yet be unable to teach it because the people who 'want to learn it' effectively prevent themselves from learning; at the same time protesting that they 'want to learn', or 'cannot understand'. Such people reason unconsciously, that if they protest you will keep your attention upon them. In this way they gain your attention (or hope to do so). In any other way, they might lose it.\nijx9 | Of course, if you try to point this out, you will find that the answer-again preventing progress - will be 'this man is excusing himself, or 'he is mistaken'.\nsosd | It is for this reason that it is traditional to confine one's teachings to a small rather than a large group: those who really are prepared to learn.\nzxxx | If you speak, or write, in the above vein, a certain proportion of the would-be elect will protest that you are insensitive, or even that you are not teaching metaphysics at all. This is because they have been accustomed to a belief that real teaching is something which they will themselves instantly recognise.\ne6pm | Now it is a matter of almost daily verification in real esoteric\nml6c | classes that it is easy to become established as a 'true metaphysician' in the eyes of the self-styled students of higher thought What do you have to do? Nothing more or less than make them feel emotionally aroused. All you have to do is to make sure that you use what they regard as 'spiritual' terminology.\nujdt | But say the above words, or publish them, and you will, in all likelihood, immediately be accused of being superficial, unaware of the 'real values', and so on.\numn7 | It is little wonder that many sensible people will have nothing at all to do with the people known as 'spiritual'.\nt2yx | Few organised communities and doctrinally-aligned movements realise, and it has never been widely known, that they inhabit a ghetto. There is a rigid exclusionism in ideas which too often characterises a 'systematic' approach to higher human development and makes it impossible to help raise man higher. Methods have been devised and operated for thousands of years to circumvent this. These methods are externally so dissimilar from the familiar atmosphere, phraseology, ritual and form of 'metaphysics' that not one self-styled Seeker After Truth in twenty will recognise them.\n70qq | But say this, or write it, or try to transmit it, and you will often be derided, accused of heightening mystery, or of taking 'essential mystery' away - of anything that comes into the mind of a frustrated person.\n2421 | If you try to set the record straight by describing the barriers, pitfalls, misunderstandings and limiting factors, you will widely be considered to be someone who is complaining, at the very least.\nlvcg | These are some of the characteristics of the present-day situation which mean that progress is extremely difficult.\nf9cy | The fault lies partly in the cultural infrastructure. There is a widespread lack of real higher experience, as distinct from imagined experience. There is a serious lack of suitable information about areas of higher study which are not generally known nor reproduced in books. As a consequence of this, any teacher will in the contemporary world find that he is like the university professor ushered into a lecture-hall to speak of nuclear physics, and finds that his students have not yet learned simple equations.",
