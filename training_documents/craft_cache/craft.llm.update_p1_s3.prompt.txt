You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

ylhz | EDITOR'S COMMENTS: THE CRAFT OF WRITING THEORY ARTICLES- VARIETY AND SIMILARITY IN AMR
a3td | Over the years, a host of articles and edito- rial commentaries in this journal and else- where have been written with the aim of help- ing management scholars understand (1) what theory is and (2) how to develop better (i.e., more novel, useful, and interesting) theory (e.g., Bacharach, 1989; Kilduff, 2006; LePine & King, 2010; Suddaby, 2010; Sutton & Staw, 1995; Thompson, 2011; Weick, 1989; Whetten, 1989). However, it is also worth remembering that journals don't publish big ideas; they publish manuscripts where authors have successfully communicated their big ideas in such a way that they can be readily understood and eval- uated by others (Daft, 1995; Kilduff, 2006; King & Lepak, 2011). As the mission statement for this journal notes, "AMR publishes novel, in- sightful, and carefully crafted conceptual work" (emphasis mine). Of course, a necessary part of the crafting is in the conceptualization of good theory, but equally important is struc- turing the paper well.
ex5k | To use an analogy, the organization of a manuscript (i.e., "macrostructure"; Daft, 1995) and the quality of the writing therein are like a window. A manuscript's window is "dirty" when its organization is awkward, unclear, or a poor fit with the concepts being ex- plained, or when the writing is sloppy. The effect is to distract the reader by causing him or her to focus on the window (the poor struc- ture), rather than to look through it to the un- derlying message. In early rounds of the jour- nal review process, editors and reviewers all too often have to advise authors to clean up their paper (e.g., streamline the writing, coor- dinate the text with the figures, add or reword propositions) before they can begin to actually evaluate the merits of any theoretical contri- bution. And that is if the authors are lucky; confusing structure or poor writing may so dominate a manuscript that it diminishes any perceived potential theoretical contribution the paper might have, leading to a first-round rejection.
9d4o | Although in reality the two are often inextri- cably connected (Van Maanen, 1995), in this essay I focus on the window-that is, on the craft of constructing a theory paper-rather than on the process of generating theory per se. And while there is much to be said about grammar, sentence structure, language usage, and specifics of writing technique (what Daft calls "microstructure"), I mostly focus on is- sues of manuscript organization and presen- tation, including the title and abstract, head- ings and sections, the use (or nonuse) of formal propositions, and the use of tables and figures.
cjq2 | In a recent editorial essay King and Lepak recommended that aspiring authors "outline or map out the structure of exemplar articles and then customize the learning gained in this process to come up with new and more effec- tive approaches for communicating funda- mentally good ideas" (2011: 209). Modeling this approach, I use AMR Best Articles from the last ten years (published 2001 through 2010) to il- lustrate both the structural variety and the similarities in articles published in AMR.1
5esx | FIRST IMPRESSIONS: THE TITLE AND ABSTRACT
m5ka | It is a sobering thought, but the only parts of a published paper that most people will ever read are the title and abstract. Whether re- trieved in long lists of search engine results or appearing in table of contents notifications, these either grab the reader's attention imme- diately or never. The title and abstract are also
byu8 | often the only information that potential re- viewers see in the journal's request to review a paper and, of course, are the first things that reviewers, and ultimately readers, will see if and when they do encounter the full manu- script. Although these elements of a paper are the smallest, they do a lot of work. We as authors need to think of them as appetizers.
76b0 | Good authors know how to make the title and abstract "hook" a reader, but they don't all do it in the same way. Among the ten Best Articles, for example, seven exhibit what one of my colleagues refers to, tongue in cheek, as the "colonic" title-that is, a longish title con- sisting of two phrases separated by a colon. Of the remaining three, two articles go to the other extreme, with simple two- or three-word titles ("Systems of Exchange" and "Manage- ment Innovation"). One advantage of the latter is that brevity, especially in academic writing, is novel and therefore attention grabbing. An advantage of the longer style is that the author can use the "precolonic" part of the title either to succinctly state the topic (e.g., "Social Cap- ital: ... ") or to artfully begin to tell the story using some sort of image or metaphor ("Steal- ing Fire: ... "), while still being able to give additional clarifying information after the co- lon to help position the idea in the read- er's mind.
zxz6 | What most of these articles' titles have in common is that they reference the core con- struct or idea of the paper in simple language. Rather than trying to impress with an ostenta- tious title, they aim to draw the reader in. More pragmatically, they aim to draw the right reader in-that is, the audience most likely to understand and appreciate the paper.
xnth | As with the titles, the abstracts of these ar- ticles vary considerably. Some present a brief outline of the article in three to four sentences (e.g., Dane & Pratt, 2007; Makadok & Coff, 2009; Mitchell & James, 2001), whereas others simply state succinctly what the authors create or argue in the article (e.g., Adler & Kwon, 2002; George, Chattopadhyay, Sitkin, & Barden, 2006). One even starts with a hypothetical question and then uses the answer to lead into a description of what the article does (Maine- melis, 2010).
vafm | part, they also steer clear of jargon and are relatively conversational in tone.
2zmw | MACROSTRUCTURE: ORGANIZATION OF MAJOR SECTIONS
bf9k | Among the ten Best Articles, authors differ in how they use the formal structure of the article as a device for advancing the narrative. With the exception of the conclusion or discussion section, which is usually labeled as such, not one of the ten award-winning articles uses solely generic section headings, such as Back- ground, Literature Review, Model and Propo- sitions, and so on. Instead, each employs de- scriptive headings that introduce concepts or mirror the structure and flow of the theoretical model. As an example, "Social Capital: Pros- pects for a New Concept," by Adler and Kwon (2002), has five main headings-"Defining So- cial Capital," "Sources of Social Capital," "Benefits and Risks of Social Capital," "The Contingencies and Value of Social Capital," and "Conclusion"-that roughly map onto the conceptual model depicted in the first figure of their article.
