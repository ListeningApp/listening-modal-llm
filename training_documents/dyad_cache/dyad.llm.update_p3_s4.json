        "content": "dvoe | Mao was even more hesitant to approve Kim's proposal than Stalin. Until the spring of nineteen forty-nine, he and his colleagues had had little interest in Korea, and they only learned about Kim's \"armed unification\" intentions when they met with him in April nineteen forty-nine. During the meeting, they expressed concern that South Korea, under the militant Syngman Rhee, who was also committed to a unified Korea, might attack the north with Japanese backing. Mao promised that were that to happen, he would send some Chinese troops to aid North Korea, and he agreed to return two ethnic Korean divisions that fought under the People's Liberation Army to North Korea. At the same time, he warned Kim against launching any military initiative in the south. In April nineteen fifty, the last ethnic Korean division that had participated in the Chinese Civil War returned to North Korea. From a Chinese perspective, this was done to increase the North Korean defensive rather than offensive capabilities.\n677t | In light of Stalin's demand for a Chinese approval of the planned war, Kim visited Beijing in mid-May. At that time, Mao and his colleagues heard for the first time of the change in Stalin's view concerning the war, and they requested that he acknowledge that it was, indeed, the case. Stalin's telegram granting approval arrived on May fourteenth. The Chinese leadership then reluctantly agreed to Kim's initiative, and in a meeting on May fifteenth, Mao promised Kim that if American forces intervened in the war, the People's Liberation Army would come to the Korean People's Army's assistance. Given this lukewarm Chinese support, however, Kim avoided informing the People's Republic of China about his intention to launch the war until it started. Although Mao was outraged by this behavior, it did not undermine his intention to assist North Korea militarily.\n5hk6 | Concrete North Korean preparations for war had started under a heavy veil of secrecy. The Korean People's Army attack plan was ready on May twenty-ninth. It aimed at the fast occupation of all of South Korea \"in order to prevent the landing of the American imperialists.\" On June eleventh, the Korean People's Army headquarters distributed a top-secret command for a\nviei | large-scale military exercise in the border area. This was the cover for the military deployment that started on June twelfth and took place over the following two weeks. The division commanders received their attack orders on June eighteenth. At the same time, Pyongyang radio announced additional conciliatory moves toward South Korea, including the release of prisoners. The deception also included public calls for a peaceful reunification and false diplomatic initiatives aimed at calming Seoul's apprehensions by demonstrating Pyongyang's goodwill, thus refuting rumors of the Korean People's Army's preparations for invasion.\nrk0j | Altogether, the process that led to the North Korean invasion did not include any major miscalculations. Armed unification ranked certainly at the top of Kim's order of priorities but was far less important for the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the People's Republic of China. Both Stalin and Mao made this clear to Kim, but they seem to have miscalculated the war dynamics that would involve not only strategic considerations but also reputational ones. Here they seem to have made a similar mistake to the one conducted by the American policymakers on the eve of the war.\nc6x9 | B. The American surprise\ng5at | I. The American intelligence assets\nre3j | In the period between the end of World War Two and the breakout of the Korean War, the American intelligence system in the Far East was in a decrepit state. This was the outcome of deep cuts in the defense and intelligence budgets, a high level of bureaucratic competition, and a poor level of coordination among the various operating intelligence organs. Monitoring the Korean Peninsula, moreover, ranked low in the intelligence order of priorities.\n6z45 | Collection in the Far East was mainly made by signals intelligence and human intelligence as well as some open-source intelligence. Although visual aerial reconnaissance, which proved its value during World War Two, was used extensively in the Korean War itself, this means of collection, which could have provided good information about the deployment of the Korean People's Army forces for war, was not used until June nineteen fifty.\n20af | Signals intelligence collection was divided between a number of relatively small army, air force, and naval units. Beginning in nineteen forty-nine, their activity was loosely coordinated by the newly established Armed Forces Security Agency, whose prime target was the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. Until nineteen forty-eight, Armed Forces Security Agency had been \"astonishingly lucky\" in reading Soviet military, police, and industrial traffic. Then, based on information that was passed to the Soviets by an Armed Forces Security Agency linguist named William Weisband who had been recruited by the KGB, the Soviet cipher systems stopped working, leaving communication intelligence, the United States' main source of collection, almost completely in the dark on the road leading to the war.\nhuae | In addition, communication intelligence collection in the Far East suffered from fundamental difficulties, such as a lack of skilled operators because of a high level of personnel turnover and a relaxed working manner that meant that interception facilities operated only five-and-a-half days a week, eight hours a day. The situation was even worse in the Korean case. Despite their being a source of concern, the US Communications Intelligence Board ranked Japan and Korea (with a lesser focus on Korea), number fifteen on its order of \"high importance\" priorities. Accordingly, when war broke out, North Korea was covered by two full-time and one part-time cryptanalyst, one linguist, and two analysts. Armed Forces Security Agency, moreover, had no Korean dictionaries or typewriters and no books about the country.\nrblh | Given its type of regime, North Korea constituted a challenging target for human intelligence. This task had become even more difficult because of the cumbersome organization of the various bodies involved in this mission. Following the withdrawal of US forces in June nineteen forty-nine, American military assistance to the South Korean army was provided by the Korean Military Advisory Group, which also passed information from the Republic of Korea sources to the Pentagon. In addition, the United States maintained three small intelligence missions in Korea: the Korean Liaison Office, established by MacArthur's G-two, General Charles Willoughby after the\ngl5i | American forces left South Korea in nineteen forty-nine and tasked with intelligence collection and analysis; the Air Force Office of Special Investigations; and a Central Intelligence Agency element that was linked to the local police and intelligence services. Their main sources were the South Korean collection agencies. Although South Korean officers claim that the intelligence that they collected about the coming attack was valuable, there is a consensus that G-two in Tokyo regarded it as conflicting and useless.",
