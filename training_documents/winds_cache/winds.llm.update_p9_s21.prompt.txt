You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

However, tide range <5 m that occurred 1 and 2 days prior to the stranding days were both significantly associated with stranding events (P = 0.013, x2 statistic = 6.158, 1 d.f. for both 1 and 2 day lags). This result indicates that strandings were significantly more likely to follow days of small tidal range than those of larger tidal ranges. However, as shown in Fig. 4, not all stranding events occurred on days which followed smaller than average tide ranges.
0b39 | Water temperature increased from 20.5 to 28.5℃ over the two-month period from early August until late October (ESM Fig. 1). The most significant change was during September water temperatures of Cable Beach increasing from 24℃ to 27℃ between 28 August and 29 September. Chlorophyll-a levels of Cable Beach were low (0.4-0.5 mg m 3) from 4 August to 4 September and then increased to 1.3-1.5 mg m-3 as chlorophyll-a levels increased first in Roebuck Bay and south and north to Cable Beach and beyond (ESM Fig. 2). Winds

Winds were again easterly from 4 to 12 September before shifting westerly to south-westerly between 13 September and 6 October. From 7 October, winds were variable but predominantly southerly and south-westerly before turning westerly again from 15 to 22 October. From 23 to 30 October, winds were again variable from the south and west (Fig. 5). Among the 35 days that satellite wind data were available during the 58-day period analysed (24 August to 20 October), 7 of 11 (63.6%) of strandings occurred when winds were blowing onshore (north-west through to southwest). However, the direction of the wind (all four quadrants compared) was not signif- icantly associated with jellyfish strandings on the days they occurred <LATEX>\left( P = 0 . 4 3 2 , \right.</LATEX> <LATEX>x ^ { 2 }</LATEX> statistic <LATEX>= 2 . 7 5 1 ,</LATEX> 3 d.f.). Neither was it significantly associated with wind direction one or 2 days prior to strandings <LATEX>\left( P = 0 . 9 2 1 , \right.</LATEX> <LATEX>= 0 . 4 9 1 ,</LATEX> 3 <LATEX>d . f .</LATEX> and <LATEX>\left( P = 0 . 4 1 3 , \right.</LATEX> <LATEX>\begin{array}{} { \text { x statstic } = 0 } \\ { x ^ { 2 } \text { statistic } = 2 . 8 6 7 } \end{array} ,</LATEX> 3 d.f. respectively) despite 90.9% of strandings occurring when winds were blowing onshore (north-west through to south- west) with a 2-day time lag. It is likely that the small sample size which was affected by the absence of wind data from 23 of the days during the period of observation during which time there were 8 stranding events. During the 58 days, 12 of 19 (63.2%) of strandings occurred when currents flowed onshore. However, current direction (all four quadrants com- pared) was not significantly associated with jellyfish strandings on the days they occurred <LATEX>\left( P = 0 . 8 6 3 , \right.</LATEX> <LATEX>x ^ { 2 }</LATEX> statistic <LATEX>= 0 . 7 4 1 ,</LATEX> 3 d.f.) or one or 2 days prior to strandings <LATEX>\left( P = 0 . 2 9 0 , \right.</LATEX> <LATEX>\chi ^ { 2 }</LATEX> statistic <LATEX>= 3 . 7 4 8 , 3 \quad d . f .</LATEX> and <LATEX>\left( P = 0 . 5 0 1 , \right.</LATEX> <LATEX>x ^ { 2 }</LATEX> statistic <LATEX>= 2 . 3 6 3 , 3 \quad d . f .</LATEX> respectively). Logistic regression analysis reinforced the importance of tide range as a predictor of strandings. The strongest individual predictor was tide range 2 days before strandings <LATEX>\left( P = 0 . 0 0 9 , \right.</LATEX> see Table 1), and the next best was current direction, also with a 2-day lag. Wind direction was a worse predictor than either tide or current. The best logistic regression model which combined the two predictors of tide range (2 day lag) and wind speed (2 day lag) provided only slight improvement in the fit over tide range alone accord- ing to Aikaike's Information Criteria (AIC) (Table 1). The Bayesian Information Criteria (Shwartz's BIC) did not show any improvement in the model fit when tide range and wind speed were combined (Table 1).
1o7p | This difference in model selection is easily explained by the way that Shwartz's BIC penalises attempts to improve model fit simply by an exhaustive exercise of adding more parameters and in analyses with small sample sizes such as ours. For this reason, Shwartz's BIC is favoured by some statisticians (Neath & Cavanaugh, 2012). Nevertheless, the improvement gained by the inclusion of current direction <LATEX>\left( P = 0 . 0 1 8 \right)</LATEX> or wind speed with tide range in the model <LATEX>\left( P = 0 . 0 0 8 \right)</LATEX> was slight, and the difference in wind speed between jellyfish stranding days (with a 2 day lag) and other days was negligible (means of <LATEX>1 1 . 7 k m h ^ { - 1 } ,</LATEX> <LATEX>S D = 3 . 6</LATEX> and 12.8 km <LATEX>\mathrm { h } ^ { - 1 } ,</LATEX> <LATEX>S D = 3 . 2 ,</LATEX> respectively). Both the univariate and multivariate approaches reinforced the importance of tide range as an important predictor of strandings. Neither of the two approaches found wind or current direction as a significant predictor of strandings.
