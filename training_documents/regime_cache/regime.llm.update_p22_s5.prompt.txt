You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

knw2 | (1) First-order differential operators Lextra = GTVr, with G: X > Rd such that div(Gyo) = 0. The latter condition ensures that (3.2) is satisfied since Lextra = - GTV. r;
mxnw | (2) Second-order differential operators of the form Lextra = - 0* dzi or more gen- erally -ot Dijoxi for some (nonnegative) function Dij: X -> R+. In the case Cextra = - Ox Ox;, the operator is self-adjoint, i.e. Cextra = L'extra, so that (3.2) is easily seen to hold. For Lextra = - Og Dijoxi, it holds that Lextra = - Og Dijox;, which also satisfies (3.2).
bdx4 | Third. First-order differential operators with nontrivial zero order parts, such as Lextra equals zero star equals Ox U minus Oxi for yo of x equals e to the power of negative U of x. Through some abuse of notation, we use dr U to denote the multiplication operator by the function dz U. These operators satisfy Lextra equals zero x star, so that three point two holds.
l01c | The class of extra forcings outlined in items one and two can be easily implemented and realized in Monte-Carlo simulations. Implementing forcings of the form described in item three, however, requires some extra work to take care of the multiplication operator, as we now discuss.
yphh | We denote the class of extra forcings described in item (3) as Feynman-Kac forcings, as sampling the dynamics requires the use of the Feynman-Kac formula due to the nontrivial zero order term. Consider the general dynamics (2.1) with generator (2.2), as presented in Section 2.1.1. Suppose that the dynamics has a unique invariant probability measure with density yo(x) = e-U(x). The perturbed dynamics with generator Ln,a = Lo + n ([phys + a Cextra), with Cextra = {TV* for some & E Rd, can be sampled by evolving the SDE
3yor | dXt =(b(Xt) +nF(Xt) -na§) dt + o(Xt) dWt,
f9sc | and weighting trajectories with the Feynman-Kac weight
o5l0 | (3.4) Wt = exp (na ) {"VU (X3) ds).
c1wq | In practice, this is done by evolving multiple replicas of the system with indepen- dent Brownian motions, and using resampling strategies to prevent the weights from degenerating (see for instance [35] and [30, Chapter 6]).
gr2b | From an analytical point of view, items (1) and (2) fit in the framework of Section 2. Item (3), however, does not directly fit in the framework of Section 2. This is due to the fact that the steady-state measure of the dynamics with genera- tor Ln, a = Lo + n([phys + @[extra) is not a probability measure in general. This is
jkky | EXTENDING LINEAR RESPONSE WITH SYNTHETIC FORCINGS
7vxr | the case only if the weights (3.4) are renormalized. At the level of generators, this amounts to shifting the spectrum of Ln,a by An,a, where An,a is the nonzero real principal eigenvalue of the operator Ln,& (see [16, 15] and references therein). The magnitude of An,& can be made precise in terms of a and n for n small, and turns out to be of order O(n2) for n small, as formally derived in Appendix A.
qzyn | Of course, by linearity, one can consider linear combinations of these extra forc- ings. In the next two sections, we give specific examples of each of the three classes of extra forcings discussed here for both overdamped and underdamped Langevin dynamics.
rcl1 | 3.2.2. Overdamped Langevin dynamics. We start by outlining some ex- amples of synthetic forcings for the overdamped Langevin dynamics introduced in Section 2.1.2. We consider successively the distinct classes of extra forcings following the general presentation of Section 3.2.1.
9qpf | Example 3.1 (Divergence-free vector field). We consider a first-order differ- ential operator
y5cx | (3.5) Čextra = GTV,
hexk | where G: X -> Rd is such that
c05v | (3.6) div (G(q)e-BV(q)) = 0.
1ytq | The resulting dynamics with the addition of (3.5) is
tkax | dqt = [-VV(q) +nF(qt) +anG(qt)] dt + V 2 dWt.
6mpz | β
bi1x | Condition (3.6) can be rewritten as div(G) = BGVV. This equality is satisfied when G is both divergence-free and orthogonal to VV, which is the situation considered in [41]. For instance, in any dimension d > 2, with A an arbitrary anti-symmetric matrix, one possible choice for G is
bnve | G = AVV.
7gvc | As in [10], this can be generalized to G = &'(V)AVV, where ¢: R -> R is some smooth, compactly supported function. More generally, any divergence-free vector field in dimension d can be written as G = VU1 X ... x VUa-1, where Ui are scalar functions [2], a form which was used in [41]. Thus, more generally, G satisfies (3.6) if and only if it is of the form
jf19 | (3.7) G = (VU1 X ... X VUa-1) eBV.
6hx6 | For the one-dimensional dynamics, the only divergence-free vector field is G(q) = eBV(q). Of course, drifts such as (3.7) may not be used as such in the dynamics when the position space is unbounded, as it is not clear whether the dynamics is well- posed because of the factor e and when it is, whether it admits a unique invariant probability measure. Moreover, Assumption 4 may not hold.
xcql | Example 3.2 (Modifying the fluctuation-dissipation relation). One possi- ble choice for extra perturbations involving second-order derivatives is
xcxb | (3.8) Čextra = - 8-1VýVa = 8-14q - VVTVq.
ci51 | Ln, a = Co + n (Cphys + a Čextra) = (1 + an) Co + n[phys.
jaj7 | The dynamics associated with Ln,Q reads
uc0w | dqt =[-(1+an)VV(qt) +nF(qt)] dt + 1 2(1+ an) β
494y | dWt.
5whs | This amounts to increasing the magnitude of the terms involved in the fluctuation- dissipation as n increases when Q > 0. Note that, in order for this perturbation to be admissible, we require that 1 + an > 0.
kigc | More generally, one could consider extra forcings of the form -V*D(q)V for some D: X -> Rdxd with values in the space of symmetric matrix, possibly with D constant.
k5st | Example 3.3 (Feynman-Kac forcing). This choice, although it showcases great promise and potential in extending the linear regime, as we will demonstrate in Sections 4.2 and 4.3, is not practical to be simulated by a single long realization of the dynamics as the weights degenerate, rendering the simulation inefficient. Its general form is
d8e8 | (3.9) Čextra = {TV* = >SiOg, i=1 d
gb7b | for some vector & E Rd. The generator Lo + 7(Lphys + QLextra) is the sum of first and second-order differential operators and a weight &TVV. Its stochastic representation corresponds to evolving the SDE
