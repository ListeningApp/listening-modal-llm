You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

pg0s | Inexact Newton-type Methods for Optimisation with Nonnegativity Constraints
aiap | Abstract
55v8 | We consider solving large scale nonconvex opti- misation problems with nonnegativity constraints. Such problems arise frequently in machine learn- ing, such as nonnegative least-squares, nonneg- ative matrix factorisation, as well as problems with sparsity-inducing regularisation. In such set- tings, first-order methods, despite their simplic- ity, can be prohibitively slow on ill-conditioned problems or become trapped near saddle regions, while most second-order alternatives involve non- trivially challenging subproblems. The two- metric projection framework, initially proposed by Bertsekas (1982), alleviates these issues and achieves the best of both worlds by combining projected gradient steps at the boundary of the feasible region with Newton steps in the interior in such a way that feasibility can be maintained by simple projection onto the nonnegative orthant. We develop extensions of the two-metric projec- tion framework, which by inexactly solving the subproblems as well as employing non-positive curvature directions, are suitable for large scale and nonconvex settings. We obtain state-of-the- art convergence rates for various classes of non- convex problems and demonstrate competitive practical performance on a variety of problems.
6sol | 1. Introduction
gtra | We consider high-dimensional problems of the form
bhjq | xERd min f(x), subject to x≥ 0, (1)
67jy | where d >> 1 and f : Rd -> R is twice continuously dif- ferentiable and possibly nonconvex function. Despite the simplicity of its formulation, such problems arise in many
u6kp | applications in science, engineering, and machine learning (ML). Typical examples in ML include nonnegative formula- tions of least-squares and matrix factorisation (Lee & Seung, 1999; 2000; Gillis, 2020). Additionally, problems involv- ing sparsity inducing regularisation such as l1 norm, which are typically non-smooth, can be reformulated into a differ- entiable objective with nonnegativity constraints (Schmidt et al., 2007).
vpph | Many methods have been developed to solve (1). First-order methods (Lan, 2020), such as projected gradient descent, can be very simple to implement and as such are popular in ML. However, they come with well-known deficiencies, including relatively-slow convergence on ill-conditioned problems, sensitivity to hyper-parameter settings such as learning rate, and difficulty in escaping flat regions and sad- dle points. On the other hand, general purpose second-order algorithms, e.g., projected Newton method (Schmidt et al., 2011; Lee et al., 2014) and interior point methods (Nocedal & Wright, 2006), alleviate some of these issues such as susceptibility to ill-conditioning and/or stagnation near flat regions. However, due to not leveraging the simplicity of the constraint, this advantages come at the cost of introducing highly non-trivial and challenging subproblems.
03xu | By exploiting the structure of the constraint in (1), Bertsekas (1982) proposed the two-metric projection framework as a natural and simple adaptation of the classical Newton's method for unconstrained problems. By judicious modifica- tion of the Hessian matrix, this framework can be effectively seen as projecting Newton's step onto the nonnegative or- thant. This allows for the best of both worlds, blending the efficiency of classical Newton's method with the simplicity of projected gradient descent. Indeed, similar to the classi- cal Newton's method, the subproblem amounts to solving a linear system, while like projected gradient-descent, the projection step is straightforward.
54ay | Contribution. In this paper, we design, theoretically anal- yse, and empirically evaluate novel two-metric projection type algorithms (Algorithms 1 and 2) with desirable com- plexity guarantees for solving large scale and nonconvex optimisation problems with nonnegativity constraints (1). Both Algorithms 1 and 2 are Hessian-free in that the sub- problems are solved inexactly using the minimum residual (MINRES) method (Paige & Saunders, 1975) and only re-
aohh | quire Hessian-vector product evaluations. To achieve ap- proximate first-order optimality (see Definition 2.1), we leverage the theoretical properties of MINRES, as recently established in (Liu & Roosta, 2022a), e.g., nonnegative cur- vature detection and monotonicity properties, and we show the following:
pb0r | (I) Under minimal assumptions, Algorithm 1 achieves global iteration complexity that matches those of first-order alternatives (Theorem 3.3).
5j88 | (II) Under stronger assumptions, Algorithm 2 enjoys a global iteration complexity guarantee with an improved rate that matches the state of the art for second-order methods (Theorem 3.8).
nfec | (III) Both variants obtain competitive oracle complexities, i.e., the total number of gradient and Hessian-vector product evaluations (Corollaries D.2 and D.3).
b5nq | (IV) Our approach enjoys fast local convergence guarantees (Theorem 3.13 and Corollary 3.14).
p2om | (V) Our approach exhibit highly competitive empirical per- formance on several machine learning problems (Section 4).
ynxq | To our knowledge, the complexity guarantees outlined in this paper are the first to be established for two-metric pro- jection type algorithms in nonconvex settings.
