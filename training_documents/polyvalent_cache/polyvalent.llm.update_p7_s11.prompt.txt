You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

xh3i | General Bacteria and Phage Protocols and Bio- panning. Bacteria strains were stored in 50% glycerol solution at -80 ℃. Bacteria were sown on LB plates containing 5 µg/ mL of tetracycline and inoculated into fresh LB at least one day before experiments.
syiw | Phages were suspended in PBS solutions and stored at 4 ℃. Titration was performed using the protocol described by Łos et al.59 Briefly, immediately before usage 200 µL of bacteria culture was suspended in warm agar and split onto bottom agar containing x-gal and IPTG. Then, 2.5 µL of subsequent 10-fold dilutions of the phage sample were dripped onto the bacteria lawn. Prepared plates were incubated overnight at 37 °C. Phage titer was calculated by multiplying the number of single dots by the dilution factor and the constant coefficient for volume correction and depicted in plaque-forming units per milliliter (pfu/mL). Amplification and purification of phages were performed according to well-established protocols with slight modifications.35
kg3t | Plate panning was performed regarding the general concept presented by Barbas et al. with some modifications. Polystyrene plates were precoated with TnT and incubated overnight (18-24 h) in 100 µL of 20 µg/mL TnT solution in PBS at 4 ℃. Then, the wells were emptied and filled with 100 <LATEX>\mu \mathrm { I }</LATEX> of 0.1% BSA solution (in PBS) and incubated for 2 h in the fridge. Later, they were washed four times with PBST 0.1% (in the first panning round) and 0.5% in the next two. For the first panning round, 100 <LATEX>\mu \mathrm { L }</LATEX> of 100x diluted Ph.D .- 12 Phage Display Peptide Library was used; however, it was tried immediately before use, showing an accurate phage concen- tration of <LATEX>8 . 4 \times 1 0 ^ { 8 } .</LATEX> After 1 h of incubation on the shaker at room temperature, wells were washed four times using 0.1% (in the first round) or 0.5% (in further rounds) PBST. After washing, 100 µL of elution buffer (0.2 M glycine- HCl, pH 2.2) was added, and after 10 min it was collected. 10 <LATEX>\mu \mathrm { L }</LATEX> was used to titrate the output phase, while 90 µL was directly transferred into the bacteria culture for amplification. Lysates (products of amplification and purification of phages) were titered and used for subsequent pannings or single clone isolation. This isolation was performed via whole-plate titration

o9sc | Peptide Structure Prediction and Interaction Model- ing. Three-dimensional structures of peptides exposed on the N-terminus of pIII protein were generated using PEP- FOLD3-a part of the online Mobyle system generously provided by Institute Pasteur and Paris Diderot Univer- sity.9-41 Peptides were analyzed with 30 N-terminal amino acids of pIII after cleavage of the signal sequence (fragment: (X)12GGGAETVESCLAKPHTENSFTNVWKDDKTL- <LATEX>D R Y ^ { 3 5 , 6 1 }</LATEX> in order to maximize mimicking of the local environment of the peptide. Human cardiac TnT N-terminal fragment 2-50 (SDIEEVVEEYEEEEQEEAAVEEEED- WREDEDEQEEAAEEDAEAEAETEE45) without cleavaged Met was generated in the same manner.
121u | Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay. ELISAs were performed in 96-well polystyrene plates (Thermo Scientific, USA). Wells were precoated with the desired protein 16- 20 h incubation of the protein suspension in PBS <LATEX>t 4 ^ { \circ } C .</LATEX> assays, 1:5000 dilution of HRP-antiM13pVIII monoclonal antibody conjugate was used. Signals were recorded using Synergy HTX Multi-Mode Reader by BioTek.
zh03 | In the initial screening, plates were precoated with troponin T or BSA (negative control) by incubating 100 <LATEX>\mu \mathrm { L }</LATEX> of 1 µg/mL appropriate protein solution. Then plates were blocked with 0.1% BSA for 2 h at 4 ℃ and washed 4 times with 0.1% PBST. Every isolated phage clone solution (phages concentration <LATEX>1 0 ^ { 1 0 }</LATEX> pfu/mL, 100 µL) was incubated with TnT and BSA for 1 h at 350 rpm at room temperature. Then wells were washed 4 times using 0.1% PBST, 100 <LATEX>\mu</LATEX> of HRP-antibody conjugate was added, and plates were incubated as previously. After 1 h, plates were washed as before, and 50 µL of TMB was added. After 5 min, the reaction was stopped by adding 50 µL of 2 M sulfuric acid. Absorbance at 450 nm was read using a Synergy HTX Multi-Mode Reader (BioTek) plate reader.
1mvw | The application of k-ELISA for measuring phage concen- tration was performed by precoating wells using 0.25 <LATEX>\mu g / m I</LATEX> TnT (or BSA in the negative control). The next steps regarding washing were performed in the same way as described above, despite 0.01% myoglobin being applied for blocking phages concentrations (range: <LATEX>0 . 2 \times 1 0 ^ { 9 } ,</LATEX> <LATEX>4 \times 1 0 ^ { 9 } ,</LATEX> <LATEX>6 \times</LATEX> <LATEX>1 0 ^ { 5 } ,</LATEX> <LATEX>\left. 8 \times 1 0 ^ { 9 } \text { pfu/mL } \right)</LATEX> and HRP-conj. Antibody solutions were added in amounts of 50 µL. Myoglobin was chosen as a blocking agent due to its small size (approximately 17 kDa), globular shape, and low price. BSA as a widely used blocking agent was avoided because it was present in all panning rounds, and peptides were suspected of exhibiting affinity to BSA. The signal was recorded by reading absorbance at 370 nm in a kinetic experiment every 70 s for 10 min.
