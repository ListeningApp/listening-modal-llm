You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

06yq | Microdosing with psychedelics to self-medicate for ADHD symptoms in adults: A naturalistic study

8r5j | ABSTRACT
2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

v6sk | After Nine Years and 2,810 Posts, a Dot Earth Farewell
1wj6 | This is the 2,810th and final post in the nine-year inquiry I began here while still a Times news reporter on October 24, 2007.
936l | In my 33rd year writing on global environmental issues, I am moving back to in- depth journalism, which is where I started in the early 1980s as a magazine editor and writer. Starting today, I'll be reporting for ProPublica, the independent public- interest newsroom honored with everything from three Pulitzer Prizes to a recent shout-out by John Oliver.
06yq | I can't think of a better way to describe my beat there than by pasting the reply I offered after a friend asked me over the weekend to come up with a New Year's resolution related to my work climate change:
dpv6 | "In the midst of extraordinary political upheaval in the United States and other inward-turning countries, I resolve to keep my reporting focused on what policies or practices, from local to global scales, can help or hinder humanity's journey toward a sustainable relationship with climate and energy."
8r5j | There's a time for everything, as I said when I first mentioned the move. And, boy, the time seems right. I have moved back into full-time journalism to help crystallize my findings while trying hard to keep testing my assumptions. As I explained last winter in my Issues in Science and Technology essay, I've unlearned almost as many things as I've learned about human-caused climate change in more than a quarter century of reporting on the issue.
2taz | I'll miss Dot Earth (along with the teaching and documentary filming I've done at Pace University since I left The Times staff at the end of 2009). But it is time for focus, depth and synthesis.
o3ya | I created the blog in 2007 (with invaluable help from Jeremy Zilar) to provide some clarity amid debates around the amorphous notion of sustainability. Last April, I wrote a piece for Times Insider tracing Dot Earth's origins and the roots of my passion for online interactive journalism, which really began much earlier - when I was camped with scientists on the sea ice drifting around the North Pole in 2003 and a home-page editor suggested I do a reader forum.
r5il | I've learned a huge amount through this effort, including, yes, from many of the readers who contributed 167,740-odd comments along the way. There's been an insight almost every day amid the flow, which is why I never followed NPR or other news organizations that abandoned comments. That's also one reason I've described myself off and on as a "selfish blogger."
5gui | I'll miss much about The Times after a 21-year association, particularly dozens of colleagues who became friends after so many years of working shoulder to shoulder.
82qc | I deeply appreciate the investment the paper made in sending me to the Arctic three times, as well as providing an outlet for my quirkier reporting on everything from worm vending machines to heavy metal singers.
ls7d | But my move doesn't necessarily mark the end of my contributions there. ProPublica has collaborated with The Times off and on, as in Abrahm Lustgarten's contrbutions to Sunday Review on water issues and a remarkable ProPublica story by Ryan Gabrielson and Topher Sanders on a flawed drug test used by many police departments, which was excerpted in The New York Times Magazine in July.
tzt3 | Thanks for visiting Dot Earth today and I hope you'll sift back for posts on enduring issues and concepts like the "population cluster bombs" that are the real peril from high fertility rates; evidence that humanity's amazing, sometimes- exasperating diversity is perhaps our species' most adaptive trait; and the idea that when numerical goals seem out of reach, there's much that can be accomplished by fostering traits in society that guarantee some progress.
t8vv | Communication is vital to fueling and sustaining progress. I hope you'll let me know what you learned here. I'm turning off comments for this post because there won't be anyone to vet them.
qvnu | But please keep this conversation going with me on Twitter at @revkin and on Facebook here. I'll occasionally post on my Medium.com/@revkin platform and on YouTube when video is called for.
kggw | [Here's a Facebook Live message to my followers on this transition, recorded on my first commute.]
xrd1 | Finally, music will continue to keep me sane. (Follow my band, Breakneck Ridge Revue, which is becoming the Hudson Valley's answer to Prairie Home Companion.)
5746 | In closing, here's a song of mine that relates to making the most of a finite, fast- forward life:
7toz | Postscript | In case you were wondering, Dot Earth remains the property of The Times, having been conceived when I was on staff. I hope the paper finds a use for it in planned reconfiguration of online climate and sustainability coverage.
