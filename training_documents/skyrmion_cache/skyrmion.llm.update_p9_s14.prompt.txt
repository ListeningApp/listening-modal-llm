You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

u8nw | We typically start with random MPS initial states of bond dimensions up to <LATEX>M \leq 1 0 2 4 ,</LATEX> followed by sequential vari- ational optimizations ("sweeping") of two adjacent tensors (two-site DMRG). The two-site DMRG allows us to estimate the truncation error <LATEX>\Delta \rho = \sum _ { i = M + 1 } ^ { \infty } s _ { i } ^ { 2 } ,</LATEX> which we use in Fig. 10 to extrapolate toward results without numerical errors. To ensure that we display converged results only, we carefully monitor local spin expectation values and stop the simulation if changes in the observables become smaller than <LATEX>\delta = 1 0 ^ { - 1 0 } .</LATEX> Since we use DMRG in two spatial dimensions, convergence to a spin spiral state may require many sweeps, on the order of 100-1000. The quality of the approximate ground state with energy <LATEX>E \left( M \right) = \langle \psi \left( M \right) | \widehat { H } | \psi \left( \widetilde { M } \right) \rangle</LATEX> can be estimated by the energy variance
l2v9 | <LATEX>\varepsilon \left( M \right) = \langle \psi \left( M \right) | \left( \widehat { H } - E \left( M \right) \right) ^ { 2 } | \psi \left( M \right) \rangle .</LATEX> (A2)
afbe | By construction, <LATEX>\varepsilon = 0</LATEX> for exact eigenstates of the Hamilto- nian. Since MPS approximates the wave function with a finite bond dimension <LATEX>M ,</LATEX> we have <LATEX>\varepsilon \left( M \right) > 0</LATEX> and <LATEX>\lim _ { M \rightarrow \infty } \varepsilon \left( M \right) =</LATEX> 0 in general. Similarly, <LATEX>\lim _ { M \rightarrow \infty } E \left( M \right) = E _ { 0 }</LATEX> converges to the true eigenstate energy. To estimate the numerical error of our approximate wave functions, we perform linear extrapolations of the energy scaled against the truncation error [28] and the energy variance [43]. The outcomes of this extrapolation are presented in Fig. 10 and Table II. We want to stress that the MPS approximations corresponding to skyrmion and
78r8 | field-polarized states easily reach convergence within a few dozen sweeps and follow the expected linear trend in the approximation errors <LATEX>\Delta \rho</LATEX> and <LATEX>\&</LATEX> [26].
320g | Changes in the local spin expectation values beyond <LATEX>M =</LATEX> 128 are invisible to the naked eye when displayed on the scales used in the main text such that a detailed error extrapolation is not needed. A word of caution is due in the case of helical spin spiral states: as we already explained in the main text, these states are difficult to simulate using MPS due to the large degeneracy of the ground-state manifold. This leads to some issues in reaching convergence (up to 1000 sweeps are needed) which for too small bond dimensions may even cause DMRG to get stuck in local energy minima corresponding to excited eigenstates. In the helical phase and for large lattices, MPS is thus not always reliably converging to approximations of the global ground state but converges under some circum- stances to low-lying excited states with less entanglement.
tp8g | Before we can apply DMRG to the system at hand, the 2D lattice must be mapped to a 1D chain. The map from a 2D lattice to a 1D chain can be performed by a sequential numbering of the lattice nodes with major ordering along an arbitrary axis (zigzag order). We choose the major axis to be <LATEX>a _ { 2 } .</LATEX> This can be achieved by <LATEX>f \left( r \left( n _ { 1 } , n _ { 2 } \right) \right) = n _ { 2 } + \sum _ { n < n _ { 1 } } l \left( n \right)</LATEX> where <LATEX>1 \left( n \right)</LATEX> is an auxiliary function that encodes the lattice open boundary conditions and
gxfd | <LATEX>r \left( n _ { 1 } , n _ { 2 } \right) = \sum _ { i } n _ { i } a _ { i } .</LATEX> As a result, the lattice Hamiltonian <LATEX>\stackrel { t } { \widehat { H } } = \sum _ { \langle r , r ^ { \prime } \rangle } \widehat { H } _ { r , r ^ { \prime } } +</LATEX> <LATEX>\sum _ { r } \widehat { H _ { r } }</LATEX> a chain Hamiltonian <LATEX>\widehat { H } =</LATEX> <LATEX>\begin{array}{} \sum _ { r } \widehat { H _ { r } } & \mathrm { m a p p e d } & \mathrm { I o } \\ \sum _ { \langle r , r ^ { \prime } \rangle } \widehat { H } _ { f \left( r \right) , f \left( r ^ { \prime } \right) } + \sum _ { r } \widehat { H } _ { f \left( r \right) } & \end{array} .</LATEX> To simplify the remaining discussion, we now assume square or rhomboid boundary conditions (see Fig. 12), and <LATEX>1 < n _ { i } < L _ { i } ,</LATEX> such that <LATEX>l \left( n \right) = L _ { 2 } .</LATEX> On-site contributions remain local, nearest-neighbor interactions along the major axis remain short ranged, but the interactions along the <LATEX>a _ { 1 }</LATEX> axis now have an extended range <LATEX>| f \left( r \right) - f \left( r \pm a _ { 1 } \right) | = L _ { 2 } .</LATEX> This results in a growth of the dimension of the Hamiltonian matrix product operator <LATEX>M _ { H } \propto L _ { 2 } .</LATEX> To obtain reasonable computation times for large
s2v1 | skyrmion lattice systems, one must therefore restrict the bond dimension M to significantly smaller values. For the largest quantum skyrmion lattice system we present in Fig. 8, we plot the converged results of M = 128. Note that the choice of our mapping preserves the locality of the interaction in one direction. In an attempt to remove this bias, we checked the resulting MPS quality for a different mapping, starting at the central spin-1/2 site and ordered radially outward (spiral ordering). Using the spiral ordering, we can confirm using the von Neumann entropy that the outer rim of the skyrmion is strongly entangled with its environment, a conclusion we had also reached based on the concurrence.
