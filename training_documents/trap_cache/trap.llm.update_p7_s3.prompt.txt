You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

favz | EDUCATION
7szx | Despite steady progress over recent decades in increasing access and spending, educational achievement in MI countries continues to lag. Conversely, countries where education levels have historically exceeded the norm for their income levels have been some of the fastest growing in East Asia and the ones most likely to escape the MI trap.21 Several measures give a clear picture of gaps in educational quality and perfor- mance: Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) scores, proportion of the labor force with tertiary education, and number of technical workers in R and D activities (see Table 1). The gaps show both the problem of low human capital and the enormous challenge to overcoming the MI trap.22
hx9e | For PISA scores, a forty-point difference is equivalent to about one year of education, which puts fifteen-year-olds in middle-income countries more than two years behind Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries and more than three years behind HI East Asia. The results reflect cumulative learning, so raising scores requires improving education quality across all levels of primary and secondary education. Differences in the stock of higher education are again stark, with MI countries at less than 60 percent of the levels of HI East Asia and OECD countries. Figure 1 provides another representation of the steep institutional challenge facing large MI countries. The slope conveys the strong relationship between education and income, but also shows that educational attainment in large MI countries is below what would be expected for their income levels.
ywn2 | Stocks at highest levels of education-technical personnel in R and D-show the greatest differences (Table 1): MI countries have only about a quarter of the levels of HI Asia and the OECD. These numbers are, of course, correlated with investment in R and D (see below), but the numbers in Table 1 also capture the important point that much invest- ment in R and D goes to paying scientists, engineers, and technicians, so R and D investment cannot be increased overnight. The educational
a63r | system must first produce the personnel that companies, agencies, and institutes can hire.
dqvj | RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
r17u | MI countries invest only a third or less of what HI countries invest in R and D (see Table 2). This is one of the differences most clearly con- nected to the prior drivers of growth-especially low-wage, labor-in- tensive manufacturing, multinational corporation (MNC) dominance of manufacturing (MNCs concentrate R and D at home), and raw materials exports-that helped bring countries out of low income but did not promote investment in R and D. R and D does of course tend to increase with development, but Figure 2 also reveals two crucial aspects of the MI trap. First, most large MI countries invest below the expected amount of R and D for their income levels. And, second, for the fitted curve, MI countries are at a point in development where the curve slopes more sharply upward, which conveys the increasing challenges they face.23
3c47 | The large educational and R and D gaps between HI and MI coun- tries highlight the huge challenge of institution building facing the lat- ter. Increasing, say, investment or exports can be promoted by policies such as tax exemptions that, while rewarding some and hurting others, can be implemented with the stroke of a pen. In contrast, training and employing more technical personnel requires (1) extensive horizontal coordination among private firms, research institutes, and universities to create the new positions and develop specialized curricula, as well as (2) massive vertical coordination among the thousands of teachers and students who will implement the new training and education programs. (Section IV returns to institutional challenges in education.) Both forms of coordination require large investments in a range of institutions that usually includes schools, vocational training institutions, universities, university-business collaborations, and some mix of research consortia or institutes, laws and court systems for intellectual property, agencies to promote R and D, and so forth.
g345 | Improved performance by MI countries in productivity-enhancing reforms and investments is more important today, when the bar for up- grading is higher than in the past. As we have seen, levels of education and R and D were much lower in HI countries in the twentieth century than they are currently. The goalposts have moved. Shifts in the tech-
svhz | nological and managerial challenges facing today's MI countries suggest that successful movement out of the MI trap in the twenty-first century will require industrial policies, institutional designs, and political con- figurations that are different from those adopted by earlier developers.24 Yet one component of past success-the development of broad coali- tions in support of effective institutions-is as necessary as ever.
oaen | III. DISARTICULATION POLITICS: OBSTACLES TO FORMING UPGRADING COALITIONS
5u67 | Making enormous institutional investments requires extraordinary collective action and coalition building. Indeed, Alejandro Foxley and Fernando Sossdorf set it as a top priority: "The most productive thing middle-income countries can do to accelerate their transition to ad- vanced economies is to establish a bipartisan political consensus."25 Yet the evolving political conditions in MI countries have become especially inauspicious for such consensus and coalition building. Our political analysis concentrates on the social cleavages-especially inequality, formal/informal workers, and foreign/domestic business-that impede the emergence of effective upgrading coalitions.26
dvms | We focus on coalitions of social groups for two main reasons.27 First is the centrality of coalitions to successful late industrialization and movement into high income.28 Such coalitions varied along several di- mensions, such as their duration, the number of groups involved, and the role of the state in forging them. They range from the "marriage of iron and rye" (large landowners and heavy industry) in nineteenth- century Germany; to Japan's postwar "corporatism without labor";29 to Northeast Asia's postwar "cohesive capitalist states,"30 also labeled "conservative coalitions"31 or "state corporatism," in which authoritar- ian leaders prioritized rapid industrialization by working "closely with
qrd3 | MIDDLE-INCOME TRAP
rxrg | industrialists"; 32 to the more horizontal, "societal" corporatist arrange- ments, usually involving labor as well as business and the state, in the small states of northern Europe, and Ireland.33 Despite their variation, these arrangements served a common purpose: namely, they facilitated intertemporal bargains needed for investing in those upgrading-related investments that required extensive information, negotiation, monitor- ing, and short-term costs, but whose benefits would emerge only in the medium or long term.
tf43 | Second, recent antidemocratic shifts in South Africa, Thailand, and Turkey notwithstanding, long-term developmental autocracies, such as those in Northeast Asia in the twentieth century, are ever less likely as elections have become routine in our nine cases of large MI coun- tries. In more democratic settings, short political horizons for political incumbents weaken their incentives for long-term investments, thus, sustained political pressure from coalitions that support upgrading be- comes especially important for keeping elected politicians on task. Even in cases where single parties or leaders were in power for more than a decade (as in Argentina, Brazil, Malaysia, South Africa, and Turkey), time horizons were still fairly short term.34 Moreover, these parties were largely populist, redistributive, and/or corrupt; in addition, they did not face strong upgrading coalitions. Malaysia is a partial exception to which we return in Section V.
