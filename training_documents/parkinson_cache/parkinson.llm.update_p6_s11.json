        "content": "o1qp | One of the few preclinical studies characterizing DNAJC6 reveals that auxilin down-regulation leads to progressive dopaminergic neuronal loss and motor disabilities in Drosophila. Furthermore, loss of auxilin exacerbates alpha-synuclein overexpression and paraquat-mediated dopaminergic loss, thus aggravating previously established phenotypes in fly models of PD. Interestingly, the brains (deep\njrik | cerebellar nuclei) of adult homozygous auxilin knockout mice revealed an increased number of CCVs and empty cages at the synapse. Similar defects were noted in primary cortical and hippocampal neurons accompanied by defective SV endocytosis. Also, impairment was not immediately detrimental to the neurons, which may explain the post-developmental onset of PD symptoms and slow disease progression. Evaluating whether similar disruptions occur in nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons and how it mediates pathogenesis will prove crucial in understanding the role of auxilin and the E-L system in PD. An initial step towards this suggests that LRRK2 phosphorylates auxilin, attenuating auxilin's normal function in human iPSC derived dopaminergic neurons. The study further revealed that phosphorylation of auxilin by overexpressing LRRK2 leads to accumulation of oxidized dopamine and alpha-synuclein overexpression, pathological hallmarks of PD. Whether loss-of-function mutations in auxilin independently exert pathology through the same mechanisms is unknown. However, this newfound link between LRRK2 and auxilin points to the crucial and widespread involvement of E-L system in PD pathogenesis.\nxv78 | GAK: GAK is another DNAJC family protein, homologous (approximately fifty percent) to auxilin but expressed throughout the body. In a meta-analysis of PD GWAS across thirteen thousand seven hundred and eight patients and ninety-five thousand two hundred and eighty-two controls, GAK was identified as a risk gene for PD which was confirmed in another recent large-scale study. However, GAK's role in PD is still contentious due to the presence of mutations in TMEM175 in a nearby independent locus, which shares the same promoter as that of GAK. What adds credence is that, like auxilin, GAK functions in clathrin un-coating by recruiting Hsc70 to CCVs. Results show that GAK overexpression can partially compensate for loss of auxilin, which is also noted to upregulate naturally in auxilin knockout mice. Another similarity between auxilin and GAK has been noted in their interaction with LRRK2. Brain-specific loss of GAK and ubiquitous knockout of GAK are both lethal (postnatal and embryonic, respectively). The inability of auxilin to compensate for GAK in these mice suggests another unique role for GAK in neurons, perhaps a significant one in dopaminergic neurons. Further TMEM175 deficiency is noted to cause PD-like alpha-synuclein aggregation, along with impairment of lysosomal and mitochondrial function. Clarity on the role of GAK will prove to be crucial not only in establishing its involvement in PD but also in consolidating CME as the prime target in PD pathogenesis.\nsdks | RME-eight: Receptor mediated endocytosis eight or DNAJC13 is another DNAJC family co-chaperone and principally functions in regulating retromer and clathrin un-coating dynamics on endosomes. RME-eight mutations (p.N855S) in autosomal-dominant PD (PARK21) was noted first in a Dutch-German-Russian family of Mennonite origin, with multiple incidences. Post-mortem brains of PD patients with RME-eight mutations revealed strong immunoreactivity for Lewy bodies in the substantia nigra, along with brain areas implicated in non-motor symptoms of PD. Nigral Lewy bodies were also found to be co-localized with RME-eight. Unlike other DNAJC proteins\ny8fb | Three point two: Synaptojanin-one and endophilin A: Partners in crime?\n521q | implicated in PD, in vitro studies have revealed that the RME-eight mutation confers toxic gain-of-function, leading to endolysosomal cargo trafficking deficits. The RME-eight mutation is also predicted to affect overall endosomal trafficking, even in the soma and postsynaptic compartment, unlike the synapse-specific dysfunction predicted for auxilin. Recently, the link between RME-eight and PD has been muddied by an independent analysis of the same Mennonite family which did not find RME-eight mutations. Instead, all the affected individuals were identified to carry mutations in TMEM230, which also functions in E-L system, perhaps at synapses. Hence, further studies are warranted to confirm the genetic link between RME-eight and PD. Still, evaluating the RME-eight mediated E-L system dysfunction might provide valuable insights in understanding PD.",
