You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

06yq | Microdosing with psychedelics to self-medicate for ADHD symptoms in adults: A naturalistic study

8r5j | ABSTRACT
2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

abow | A: If there is any, it is this: serious people are prepared to start at the beginning and go a step at a time, to 'start the jour- ney of a thousand miles with one single step'; people who are not serious are looking for miracles and stimuli and 'advanced work'.
qx6n | Q: What produces, and what sustains, this unsuitability ?
p2bm | A: Vanity, which is why most systems require humility.
cxyx | Q: If most systems require this, why does it not work?
w0aw | A: Because most systems end up by making imagined humility into a form of vanity, so they end up with vanity just the same.
w41b | You can perceive a person's aspiration if it is genuine, because this creates a change in the emanations from such a person.
vokd | USELESS PRAYER
efir | Omar Khayyam said:
vjhs | They went, and none returned again
rcio | To tell you the telling of that beyond
7qi5 | You won't gain anything through automatic prayer
9f5r | Prayer is worthless without sincerity and true aspiration.
j3tt | This second question, about unsuitability, interests me rather more than the first, about 'Quick, rule-of-thumb methods.' Has the enquirer ever asked himself what he could do with such a method?
zoz0 | Q: But surely prayer, properly carried out, can prepare for proper learning?
3blu | 112
xv2l | A: 'Properly learned' is the operative phrase. People who pray and who do not attend to the necessary change in themselves as its basis, are not the same as those who really do pray. People who pray have to be altered by prayer, and this alteration is partly manifested in their behaviour and temperament.
xt4k | Many Sufi teachers have insisted that disciples observe psycho- logical and social development before even allowing them to pray, or, at least, before acknowledging that they are capable of effec- tive prayer. Khwaja Muinuddin Gharib Nawaz Chishti actually equates prayer with right thought and right action on the ordinary human level:
ti78 | 'Prayer consists,' he said, 'in hearing the complaints of the aggrieved and to assist them; to help the needy and the oppressed; to feed the people and to set free the captives from captivity. All these things, Gharib-Nawaz emphasised, are of great importance .**

n093 | When Criticism can Stop
4khi | Q: When do people stop criticising what others are doing?
7fh2 | A: When Jalaludin Rumi started to recite his couplets of wis- dom, it is reported, people had not had enough time to form any opinion of him.
5isn | Some were interested, some were not. Others, following an in- evitable human pattern, resented him. They said: 'We hope that you do not think that you are a second Aesop or something.'
5vry | WESTERN SAGE
9w33 | According to one sage of the West, criticism has to go through these stages: -
johv | 1. It is impossible
2olp | 2. It is possible, but it is useless
zb7x | 3. It is useful, but I knew about it all the time.
uadf | Criticism can then stop.
wuf4 | THE SICK MAN WHO CURSED
lfk1 | Enduring the criticism of others may be part of doing good to them. You can read in The Boston of Saadi the story of the sick man whom the great Sufi Maaruf of Karkh was helping. He cursed Maaruf, whose wife asked him why he continued to serve one who was so ungrateful.
rwjw | Maaruf answered that this patience was part of the help for the sick: the patient, he had observed, could not find rest until after he had been allowed to vent his wrath.
iazp | I am not myself much interested in the stopping of criticism. How about interesting oneself in improving the quality of critic-
ksn3 | 114
8xbx | ism; so that it can be more useful? Much of it is so bad that even undesirable things criticised are not effectively criticised, especially when the critic shows his spleen or bias instead of be- ing constructive.
aod5 | Sheikh Abdullah Ansari, of Herat, the great Sufi teacher, has rightly said:
ayqs | The evil of another person can be averted:
jnpq | There is no escape from one's own ...
r4w4 | Information and Experience
sswz | Q: Why do you stress the importance of information as well as of experience?
0uoj | A: There is a saying that, according to what a person's men- tality is, even an angel may seem to him to have a devil's face.
0c89 | It is also useful to note that whereas an angel may seem to have a devil's face, and a devil an angel's face, there are other forms of this complaint.
658v | INFORMATIONBEFORE OPINION
4gqa | People tend to form opinions about people, things and ideas, only on the basis of the information and prejudice which they already have. If you show, say, a camera to a child or a primitive man, he might think that it was a monster.
mpgz | What people need is information, more often than they realise. This is the reason why generations of Sufis have laboured to broaden the basis of information and experience available to man. With information and experience, man may make more reliable judgments about people, ideas and things. The less information he has, the less likely he is to be able to understand. To try to teach anyone who is in a condition of insufficient information is futile, never attempted by real teachers, and wasteful of time and energy to both parties.
gf06 | INSTITUTION WITHOUT INSIGHT
75hv | 'Halls and colleges and learned discourses and porch and arch, says Hafiz, 'what advantage are they when the wise heart and seeing eye are absent?' And to make real sense of experience, information must be there as well.

413q | The Teaching is a Matter of Conduct
8wkl | Q: Can people pursue a form of study in Sufism without being trained and constandy stimulated, as they are in all systems which I have examined?
next | A: This famous saying from our tradition repays the closest possible attention: 'The Teaching is a matter of Conduct'.
3dfm | By acting in a certain manner, a person may be able to give the impression that he is enlightened, studious, worthwhile, valuable or many other impressive things. All teachings, in their lower ranges, seek to teach people to adopt acceptable conduct and behaviour.
hjmm | CONDUCT, HERE, DOES NOT MEAN CONFORMISM
s0s6 | Because of this emphasis upon conduct, misunderstandings arise very easily. People come to imagine that if they seem to be con- forming, they are acceptable, or that they are progressing.
cxx7 | The fact is, of course, that conformism is a part of the civilising of people. If they conform to the rules of the culture which sur- rounds them, larger numbers of people can associate together more easily. Strife is generally reduced. Communication between people becomes possible when, for instance, they are not all talking at once.
uzqc | It may be necessary to conform to certain kinds of expected behaviour in order to learn something. But when this conformism becomes the only, or major, characteristic of the people, the teaching has stopped taking effect. Instead of learning, we have practice: practice of conformism.
dqwn | Conformism has two possible evils: (i) that people will mistake it for 'higher' behaviour; (2) that people will believe that all they have to do is to appear to conform, and that as a consequence they will get 'a place in Heaven'.
g58m | We are all familiar with human systems in which either or both
kf9u | of these deteriorations are evident. They are so persistent, indeed, that conformism may be taken as the outward mark of organisa- tion. But not only need this not be so: it may be positively dangerous to the potential function of the group.
tl2g | Then why do we say 'The Teaching is a Matter of Conduct'?
xy74 | KNOWLEDGE AND ACTION ARE RELATED
q0se | First, because when a form of conduct is laid down in the Teach- ing, whether it be doing a task or carrying out a study or exercise, the relationship between mental 'set' and bodily action is specific. It helps the exercise or undertaking to operate correctly.
tz7u | Secondly, because when a person is given something to do as an assigned or expected activity, how he does it, whether he does it at all, the degree of competence or activity without constant exhortation: all these are diagnostic. One can tell, and the indi- vidual himself should be able to tell by self-examination, whether he is progressing or whether he is behaving in an automatic manner. If he finds that he needs constant stimulus of threat or promise, he is not attuning himself in the right manner. If he will conduct himself in a certain manner only providing that he receives a certain amount of attention, he is placing the demand for attention before the study.
jszk | The many different outward forms which the Teaching has assumed through the generations has had two main reasons behind it
egkh | First, that according to the time and culture involved, the Teaching must be projected afresh.
kbpy | Second, and more to our point at this moment, the 'new' forms are adopted partly in order to prevent automatic con- formism.
afdp | In a real teaching situation the individual is tested and can test himself against the degree of activity, leading to personal volition, which he is able to maintain without indoctrination, repetition, constant appeals.
5jom | In order to show that they are not "trained and constantly stimulated', as you call it, and to show that conduct is of inner as well as outer significance, Sufis have adopted the Malamati
fdhb | 118
o1k9 | (Blameworthy) method of behaviour. A Sufi may deliberately court opprobrium, not for masochistic or attention-arousing pur- poses, but in order to show others how readily they will respond to outward signals which may have no meaning at all.
s1uu | Similarly, some people working in the dervish path have been called Beshara (Without Law) because they have chosen down the centuries to practise their training privately, and to avoid public stimuli, to indicate that appearances can mean only super- ficiality.
22hf | TALE OF THE FLY
gici | Saadi reports one quite characteristic example of conduct-teaching, from the life of Hatim al-Asamm: 'The Deaf. Some didacticians, he says, hold that Hatim of Balkh was deaf: do not believe it. One day he saw a fly caught in a web and spoke to it, for the edification of those present, saying that it had been deceived by something attractive and desirable, but had only managed to get itself caught
owaw | But this analogy of the human condition was further given point by the audience when they realised that Hatim's attention had been attracted to the buzzing of the fly, which other people could hardly hear: and yet it was he who was supposed to be deaf.
z6xu | Hatim explained that he was not deaf at all. He pretended that he could not hear because then he would not be expected to listen to praise or opposition intended to influence him. If people thought him deaf, those who surrounded him would say what they really thought about him.
knw2 | An interesting difference between Sufis and others is that, like sociologists and other scientists carrying out tests, Sufis are able to pretend-to deceive, as some will always have it-while the convention is that people should never pretend to be what they are not: in this case, of course, to be deaf. But the Sufi always points out that while he may pretend to a purpose, to point out a fart, the ordinary person will pretend because he wants people to accept and respect him. His pretence, therefore, is far worse and far less productive, except of deception and self- deception.
mxnw | The study-course laid down by the teacher for his student, in Sufism, may have degenerated into conformism and automatism in various imitative communities and supposed 'schools', but they are easy to identify. The guidance which the teacher gives, no matter what form it takes and how it may conflict with other people's assumptions of what it is or should be, is the method of learning from a Sufi.
bdx4 | The teacher's role is to render himself superfluous to the learner, by helping him to escape from the toils of lesser ideas and of the shallow mind. Until that moment comes, like a guide to a path which is invisible to the learner, the teacher is followed with absolute trust.
l01c | The great Sufi Abdul-Qadir of Gilan stresses, in the seven- teenth address of his Futuh al-Ghaib, that this is like the role of the wet-nurse, who has to cease suckling the infant when it is able to eat solid food. When secondary and low-level attachments have vanished, the Seeker goes into a relationship with objective Reality. At this point, continues the Sheikh, there is no further need of the disciple relationship.

3yor | Knowing one's own Sincerity
f9sc | Q: How can a person know whether he is sincere or not?
o5l0 | A: To be a hypocrite is perhaps the worst thing there is. But I can think of something more destructive than that: it is to imagine that one is not false in 'good resolutions'. Neither imagine that you are false, nor lash yourself, for both may be forms of self-indulgence.
c1wq | Have the courage to recognise that, no matter how many people are impressed by the seeming humility and self-reproach of pious people, the real effort is in knowing about oneself, so that one can do something about it. Once you yield to the comparatively easy way of assuming personal guilt, you may become guilty of amus- ing yourself, revelling in your worthlessness.
gr2b | If you do that, people may admire you, they may point you out as a good example, traditional texts may support your thoughts and actions, society may believe that it benefits from your exist- ence - but you could yourself be nowhere.
jkky | The real people of knowledge can be said to exist for the purpose of indicating to really earnest seekers that a man is really self-deceived when he feels that he is being righteous. They do not exist to paper over the cracks by agreeing that a certain train of thought or series of actions or both are invariable indications of genuine belief and practice.
7vxr | One of the great Sufis said: 'A saint is a saint unless he knows that he is one.'
qzyn | The Sufis have throughout the centuries, commanded the respect and understanding of the majority of religious people by insisting that sincerity can never be simply assumed, in oneself or in anyone else. People know the sincerity of themselves and others by observations of acts and study of thoughts, and testing of words against performance.
rcl1 | The superficially religious apply 'tests' for sincerity which en- able ignorance and misunderstanding to continue.
9qpf | 121
y5cx | THE BEDOUIN TEACHER
hexk | Rumi brings us a fine analogy of this, showing how people in judging things from ignorance of the facts, come to false con- clusions.
c05v | In this tale, a bedouin was listening to another man saying prayers. He began by repeating a passage from the Koran, where it is said, in Chapter IX ('Repentance') verses 97 onwards:
1ytq | 'The Arabs of the desert are the worst in unbelief and hy- pocrisy ... '
tkax | Infuriated, the Arab gave him a blow on the head.
6mpz | The man at prayer continued the quotation, coming to the passage:
bi1x | ... But some of the desert Arabs believe in God and in the Last Day ..
bnve | That's better!' said the bedouin, 'now I have taught you how to behave .. . '
7gvc | Here the bedouin stands for the superficial and assumption- prone part of the mind of the literalist religious person, whose faith' seems demonstrably based on conduct, and whose assess- ment of the faith of others is based on his own imagination of what the other person's beliefs mean.
jf19 | Rumi's bedouin-and our questioner about sincerity - could have made this test, had they known of it, to think of the aphorism:
6hx6 | 'If you think that you are not self-deluded, just check whether you think well of yourself or not.'
