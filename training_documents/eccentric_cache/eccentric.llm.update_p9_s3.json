        "content": "tf43 | Links can be subjected to axial loads due to the axial restraining effect of adjacent members and also the loading scheme and/or geometry of a structural system. For instance, in case of a seismic loading, the EBF configuration shown in Figure one b will impose higher axial forces on link segments compared to the negligible link axial forces developed in the configuration shown in Figure one a. A study by Kasai and Popov revealed that the presence of axial force can have deteriorative effects on link behavior. These researchers proposed modified expressions for the plastic moment and shear capacities of links in the presence of axial force. In addition, a modified shear link length limit was defined. The modified capacities are in general related to the axial load ratio, defined by P divided by Py, where P is the available axial force and Py is the nominal axial yield strength. This study revealed that the plastic capacities should be reduced as a function of P divided by Py when this ratio exceeds zero point one five. These recommendations still form the basis of the AISC three forty-one ten provisions for links under axial loads.\nfcco | In nineteen ninety, Ghobarah and Ramadan used nonlinear FE analysis to investigate the effect of axial force on the performance of EBF links. Numerical results demonstrated that the presence of axial force not only reduces the link plastic strength but also its plastic rotation capacity and energy dissipation. A maximum decrease of thirty-seven percent in ymax was reported. It was also noted that the effect of axial force is most pronounced in links with length ratios near one point six.\n8uji | In a study by Mansour et al. in twenty eleven, the behavior of replaceable shear links was investigated inside a frame system. In these tests the cyclic loading was applied to the floor beam from one end, and thus, half of the applied load was transferred axially through the link. The maximum value of P divided by Py was reported to be zero point two six which represented a relatively high axial force level. Mansour et al. observed that the links experienced higher peak shear forces when subjected to tension rather than compression, with a maximum difference of twelve percent. Mansour also demonstrated this issue\ndf3e | numerically in his dissertation and proposed a simple equation for estimating the increase in the shear capacity due to axial tension.\n53eu | In twenty fourteen, Dastmalchi conducted nonlinear time-history analyses on a three-story prototype structure with eccentric braces, similar to the configuration shown in Figure one b. Results revealed that the peak value of P divided by Py recorded for the links exceeded zero point one five by a wide margin under most earthquake records, indicating the high probability of developing large axial forces in shear links with the selected configuration. Dastmalchi also performed nonlinear FE analyses to examine the behavior of shear links under very high levels of axial force (zero point one five less than P divided by Py less than zero point five). The monotonic and cyclic shearing of short links under constant axial compression confirmed its detrimental effect on the shear strength and ductility of short links, especially when the length of the shear link was increased. It was also found that the shear capacity formula given in AISC three forty-one ten underestimates this effect for P divided by Py greater than zero point two, and therefore, a numerically calibrated modification factor was introduced for this formula.\na5u1 | It is worth noting that, as stated in the AISC three forty-one ten commentary, the effect of high axial force on the behavior of long and intermediate links has not been investigated adequately. Therefore, the code requires the use of shear links if high axial force is present in a link.\nry7u | Two point four. Effect of Concrete Slab\n5mda | In nineteen eighty-nine, Ricles and Popov conducted research on the effect of a concrete slab, placed over the steel framing as a floor system, on EBF links. These researchers reported that the initial stiffness and strength of the composite links were higher than those of the steel links, however, the composite action deteriorated in later cycles. The maximum shear forces resisted by the composite links were one to thirteen percent higher than the corresponding steel links. Nevertheless, the general hysteretic behavior of the composite links resembled that of the bare steel links. The slab damage was localized in the vicinity of the link and no damage was observed in the concrete located away from the link segment. The test results also demonstrated that a concrete slab alone cannot provide sufficient lateral bracing for links. Engelhardt and Popov noted in their experimental study that if a diagonal brace is connected to the bottom flange of a link, the presence of a concrete slab can substantially enhance the stability of\ni4li | the link by restraining the top flange. A similar observation was also reported by Tsai et al. during the tests on large EBF sub-assemblages conducted at the National Taiwan University in the early nineteen nineties.\nr8sm | Mansour et al. also investigated the effect of a concrete slab on link behavior. In the details studied, the replaceable link segment had a smaller depth than the floor beam. Therefore, there was no direct interaction between the link and the composite slab. Nevertheless, it was reported that the specimen with the concrete slab sustained a higher shear force, fourteen percent more when compared to the bare steel specimen, without a notable change in the link rotation capacity. Mansour et al. recommended using more shear studs away from the link region in order to guarantee the slab diaphragm action during major earthquakes.\ncuin | Recently, Ciutina et al. tested a single-story EBF setup with very short links with and without a concrete slab. In one case the shear studs were placed along the entire beam length, while in the other case they were suppressed in the link region. Tests by Ciutina et al. confirmed that omitting shear studs only in the link region does not fully eliminate the composite action, since in both of the above cases the shear strength and stiffness were notably higher than those of the steel link. Therefore, it was recommended that the composite action be considered during the EBF design, even if shear studs are only available on the floor beams and not in the link regions. It is worth noting that link regions are protected zones per AISC three forty-one ten in which the use of shear studs is prohibited. In addition to link behavior, the presence of a concrete slab also affects the structural response of EBF systems, which is discussed further in Section five point two.\nn1i7 | Two point five. Effect of Loading History\n0r5m | Popov and his colleagues noticed that the applied loading history during an experimental study has a major effect on the observed plastic rotation capacity of EBF links. A comprehensive study on this effect was, however, conducted recently by Richards and Uang.\nne2o | Okazaki et al. reported unexpected link web fractures for a number of tested short links prior to reaching the code-specified zero point zero eight rad rotation limit. Richards and Uang attributed this issue\nsqxn | mainly to the utilized loading history and stated that the loading protocol used by Okazaki et al. was significantly more severe than the loading sequences used in the nineteen eighties tests on short links. Nonlinear time-history analyses were conducted by Richards and Uang on three prototype EBF structures subjected to twenty large-magnitude-small-distance Los Angeles ground motions. The obtained cumulative rotation demands were used to come up with a new protocol which was adopted by AISC three forty-one zero five for the cyclic testing of link-to-column connections. The proposed protocol has fewer cycles with large rotations compared to the old protocol.",
