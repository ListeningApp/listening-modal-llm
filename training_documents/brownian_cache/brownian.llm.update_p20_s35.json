        "content": "ep8e | The Effective Action I allows one to derive effective equations of motion for the average position, chi of t is equivalent to the average of x of t, and variance, the average of x squared of t, in an analogous manner to the classical equations of motion, by taking variational derivatives. We used the LPA and WFR to compute the elements entering the effective equation of motion, for instance the dynamical effective potential. We verified the accuracy of the equilibrium limit to these equations, further emphasizing the physical significance of certain aspects of the effective potential V sub k equals zero: namely how the minimum of V sub k equals zero corresponds to the equilibrium position and its second derivative evaluated at this point to the variance through equation one hundred twenty-eight. We noted here that while the LPA reproduces these equilibrium quantities, the accuracy of covariance's temporal evolution diminished as temperature was lowered.\n7mv3 | Going beyond equilibrium, we examined how LPA plus WFR handle relaxation towards it for the\nder6 | average position X of t in potentials such as a polynomial, a doublewell comprised of two Lennard-Jones type interactions, or a bare x squared plus gaussian bumps. The latter potential clearly demonstrates that the FRG is capable of capturing the effect of the non-trivial local features of this potential. In fact, the FRG could still offer reasonable approximations even in those cases where the Fokker-Planck numerics failed to converge. We have also shown how the FRG can closely match the relaxation of the variance x squared of t to its equilibrium value: for both the unequal Lennard-Jones type potential and the x squared plus gaussian bumps, the LPA variance has reasonable accuracy and still captures highly non-trivial behavior such as the variance overshooting its equilibrium value before settling to it. This is in a system where numerically solving the Fokker-Planck equation failed to provide good results, at least using standard methods. Again, we find that accuracy decreases with decreasing temperature.\n8xg2 | A clear conclusion that can be drawn from the above investigations is that decreasing the temperature negatively impacts the accuracy of using the LPA plus WFR derivative expansion for the FRG to describe Brownian motion in the potentials we examined. This appears to correlate with the increasing importance at lower temperatures of higher order terms in the spectral expansion; indeed, it is expected that the lowest order terms in the derivative expansion, LPA plus WFR, are best placed to describe evolution dominated by the lowest non-zero eigenvalues of the Fokker-Planck spectral expansion. It would seem that the derivative expansion of the FRG for studying thermal fluctuations has utility in the range from moderate temperatures, roughly when the classical force is comparable to the noise, up to the very high temperature regime where the small local features of the potential become less relevant.\nnjvp | Although our conclusions on the temperature dependent relation between the spectral expansion and the derivative expansion of the FRG are suggestive and reasonable given the premise of the latter, a more precise quantitative comparison would be called for and should be addressed in future work. The insights gained from a more detailed, quantitative understanding of the FRG's range of validity when applied to the dynamical studies of thermally driven systems may lead to interesting and important applications. There are also issues relevant to the technicalities of applying the FRG programme and which may lead to better convergence properties. For example, the recent findings suggest that an appropriately optimized regulator, which also excludes the regime w greater than k from contributing to the flow, can ensure good convergence properties and a sizeable radius of convergence. Comparisons are non-trivial because the supersymmetry of the Brownian motion problem makes the structure of the flow equations different to that of a simple scalar theory. This is an important question to be resolved however and we hope to return to it in future work.\ns8b5 | Future work could also examine if higher order approx-\np450 | imations beyond the WFR offer any advantage, as these might better capture higher order terms in a spectral expansion. One could further investigate an ensemble of initial conditions and try to quantify better the computational time gain the FRG offers. It is worthwhile trying to see if there is a more concrete way to determine a priori which systems will be well described by the FRG before having to compare to numerical simulations or doing a spectral expansion analysis. An interesting application that we did not touch upon here might be thermal barrier escape, which in this formulation seems to be more akin to tunneling in the corresponding euclidean quantum mechanics; it would indeed be interesting to flesh out any analogies, if they exist. Most importantly, further understanding the application of FRG techniques to stochastically driven systems may allow extension to systems with more degrees of freedom, such as field theories and or systems with a large number of particles. Advances in the above directions may lead to progress in theoretically tackling a broad range of physical phenomena with large separation between fundamental timescales of thermal fluctuations and long emergent timescales of macroscopic change, addressing what is now a major barrier for predictive simulations across scientific and engineering disciplines including materials science, drug design, protein folding, and cosmology.\nrsvo | In equilibrium, all equal-time expectation values can be obtained from the generating function\nz4m8 | Z of J equals integral over d x e to the power of negative two V of x divided by r plus J x.\nukf0 | A one\nk38m | in a manner directly analogous to that described in the text but with functional derivatives replaced by ordinary\nnkj9 | derivatives with respect to J. In a spirit identical to the renormalisation group but in the much simpler setting of one just degree of freedom, we can define a modified generating functional.",
