The reasons for the VNS-CC dissonance and added value of CC are unknown but likely involve their different mechanisms of action. Cukiert et al. noted a postsurgical disruption of secondary bilateral synchrony seen on electroencephalographic recording in eighty-five percent of CC patients, with no EEG modification after VNS insertion. CC disrupts the bilateral synchrony of the hemispheres, whereas the exact mechanisms of VNS are not entirely understood. Based on animal models, it has multiple possible mechanisms of actions, among which is a suppression of cortical hypersynchronization by modulating the synaptic network. Other recent data suggest that VNS affects neural networks in three domains: brainstem, limbic system, and cortex. The importance of frequency and amplitude of stimulation on the VNS effect was stated as well. Nevertheless, it should be noted that over time, shorter epilepsy duration and longer VNS therapy time indicted a higher response likelihood, rather than dosing setting. The direct disconnection (achieved with a CC) shows immediate and more effective results. This network disruption not only reduces the general activity associated with drop attacks, but it also reduces other seizures through as yet unknown mechanisms.\nk0bw | This study has several limitations, mainly its retrospective multicenter nature, as well as the lack of a standardized evaluation time point. The lack of a unified time point for outcome evaluation may bias the results. As each center reported data, we could not centrally verify the data, nor verify whether LGS-like cases were included. Detailed neurocognitive assessment was not possible. Disconnection syndrome could not be confirmed in our patients. We did not include EEG data before or following surgery. Thus, the diagnosis of LGS and the effect of surgery on EEG could not be centrally verified. The epilepsy status was based on parental reports during follow-up visits, and the information was incomplete for some patients. The accuracy of seizure detection by parental notification is limited, especially among children, and a possible bias to report better results following surgery cannot be excluded. Reports on seizure outcomes, as well as on the number of ASMs, were not complete. Thus, a bias toward better seizure control cannot be excluded. We did not include dosages of ASM or change to different drugs, possibly affecting seizure outcome. Some of the patients had a VNS battery\naq5a | change after CC, perhaps contributing to better seizure control, mood, and overall quality of life. We did not collect data regarding the need for VNS battery change, or avoidance of replacement when it was needed.\nsc5y | Despite these limitations, these children were treated for several years with various ASMs. Parents were aware of the seizure semiology; thus, although potentially inaccurate, their report of seizure reduction most likely reflects an actual decline.\n0yab | Five CONCLUSIONS\nw95z | CC has a significant added value in controlling seizures in children with LGS who had prior VNS. Callosotomy resulted in better seizure control considering a greater than fifty cutoff for drop attacks and other seizure types. CC was associated with a low complication rate. Complete callosotomy resulted in better seizure control compared to anterior callosotomy considering a greater than fifty cutoff for other seizure types.\n0i1k | ORCID\n```",
