Quantification of ventricular volume change over time using retrospective gating is an important modality that can estimate atrial filling ratios, peak diastolic filling rate, and time to peak filling. Although it is not used routinely in estimating diastolic dysfunction in patients with hypertensive heart disease, cardiac magnetic resonance could be an important part of stratifying patients with an increased risk to develop a more severe form of the disease.\n863b | Overall, having in mind previously mentioned morphological and functional changes of the myocardium, and based on the clinical impact of hypertension on the heart, hypertensive heart disease can be divided into four categories. The first one consists of isolated left ventricular diastolic dysfunction but without LV hypertrophy. These patients should be closely monitored, and their hypertension controlled as well as possible to prevent further complications. The second one consists of diastolic dysfunction but with concentric LV hypertrophy. This category is usually still a subclinical stage of the disease but with an increased risk of cardiovascular complications, predominantly heart failure. The third stage is a clinical heart failure presentation with preserved ejection fraction. The fourth one implies a dilated cardiomyopathy with reduced ejection fraction. These clinical stages impose a conclusion that diastolic dysfunction in patients with hypertensive heart disease is a more common complication than systolic dysfunction. These patients also have more left ventricular hypertrophy, epicardial coronary artery disease, coronary microvascular dysfunction, and myocardial fibrosis compared to healthy individuals. Cardiac magnetic resonance is more than useful in all these stages, especially in the subclinical phase, which is important in the risk stratification and detection of other underlying pathophysiological mechanisms.\nfj24 | Seven. Tissue Characterization in Hypertensive Heart Disease-Clinical Aspects and Evaluation of Myocardial Fibrosis Using LGE, Myocardial Tissue Mapping and Extracellular Volume Fraction Measurement\nuz3c | Expansion of extracellular space in myocardial fibrosis is leading to the accumulation of gadolinium with hyperenhancement on LGE imaging. The presence and degree of focal myocardial fibrosis detected by LGE is an independent and powerful predictor of adverse cardiovascular events in many cardiac conditions. The presence of late gadolinium enhancement in patients with hypertension, especially those with advanced hypertrophy, is usually in a form of patchy non-coronary mid-wall patterns, while patients with co-existing coronary artery disease may have subendocardial LGE changes. LGE effect in hypertensive heart disease has been detected in up to fifty percent of symptomatic patients. Even in the group of asymptomatic patients, nonischemic LGE was independently associated with adverse cardiovascular events and was present in up to eighteen percent of the asymptomatic patients. Patients with hypertension and nonischemic LGE were more likely to be men, have diabetes, be current smokers, and have a worse renal function, with higher blood pressure values and taking several antihypertensive medications. These conditions predispose patients to a higher risk of myocardial fibrosis due to the activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, beta-adrenergic system, and inflammatory and immune pathways. Nonischemic LGE was present more often in patients with greater left ventricular mass, worse multidirectional strain, and elevated circulating markers of myocardial wall stress and myocardial injury, even after the adjustment for the potential confounders. The presence of LGE phenomenon and its association with cardiac remodeling was also observed in patients with nocturnal hypertension, a blood pressure pattern most strongly associated with car-\nd5bi | diovascular morbidity and mortality. Considering the fact that myocardial fibrosis is diffuse and interstitial, a proper evaluation through LGE imaging could be a challenging task sometimes. This is the reason why different cardiac magnetic resonance techniques were developed to properly evaluate the extension of myocardial fibrosis, including T1 mapping and extracellular volume fraction.\nba4l | Diffuse myocardial fibrosis is present in nearly all chronic cardiac conditions. It impairs cardiac function and therefore has a crucial role in the development of heart failure and its outcomes. Estimating the degree of myocardial fibrosis in hypertensive heart disease could be a difficult task having in mind the characteristics of fibrotic changes and the possibilities of different imaging modalities to identify it. Cardiac magnetic resonance, with its superior possibilities in terms of tissue characterization, is a useful tool capable to estimate, not only the presence, but also the extension and severity of fibrosis. A limitation of LGE imaging solely is that it is a qualitative technique, dependent on the difference in signal intensity between normal and fibrotic myocardium. This is why the estimation of diffuse myocardial fibrosis by LGE imaging is inexpedient. The main novel diagnostic modalities used for the evaluation of diffuse myocardial fibrosis are native T1 and post-contrast T1 mapping, and the evaluation of extracellular volume fraction.\nffx8 | The native T1 time can be prolonged due to the expansion of extracellular space caused by myocardial infarction, edema, fibrosis or infiltration, while it can be shortened with the accumulation of fat or iron in the myocardium. One of the main advantages of native T1 time is that it can be measured without the administration of a gadolinium-based contrast agent. Detecting both focal and diffuse myocardial fibrosis is important in predicting chronic heart failure, arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death. Native T1 time can be prolonged even in the absence of visible LGE phenomenon, pointing out the subclinical phase of diffuse myocardial fibrosis and the potential advantages of novel therapeutic modalities that can prevent the chronic, irreversible stage.\ns6su | Extracellular volume fraction is one of the most important tools in estimating myocardial fibrosis. Extracellular volume correlates better than T1 mapping or LGE with histologically determined diffuse myocardial fibrosis. The increased value of extracellular volume is a product of different factors including inflammation, tissue remodeling, atherogenesis, and metabolic disorders. It is shown that extracellular volume has a good correlation with the amount of collagen deposition on myocardial biopsy in various cardiological conditions. The measurement of extracellular volume relies on the values of native T1 and post-contrast T1 time adjusted for blood hematocrit. The pre-contrast T1 value reflects both the intracellular and extracellular compartment, while the post-contrast T1 value primarily reflects the extracellular compartment. The extracellular volume fraction is increased in hypertensive heart disease as hypertension leads to diffuse myocardial fibrosis with the deposition of collagen fibers into the extracellular matrix. It is shown that the presence of both nonischemic LGE and increased extracellular volume is consistently associated with the worst cardiac remodeling pattern, the highest concentration of circulating markers of wall stress and myocardial injury, largest left ventricular mass, increased left atrial volume, and the worst multidirectional strain. Extracellular volume can also be important in the differential diagnosis of infiltrative cardiac diseases, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and hypertensive heart disease.\n```",
