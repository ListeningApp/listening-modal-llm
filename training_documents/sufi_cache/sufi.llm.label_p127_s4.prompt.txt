You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

06yq | Microdosing with psychedelics to self-medicate for ADHD symptoms in adults: A naturalistic study
dpv6 | ARTICLE INFO
8r5j | ABSTRACT
2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

lbm8 | These are the things which the student cannot measure in himself, and which the teacher attends to:
krjy | 'To want before it is due To desire more than is due To want for oneself what belongs to others.'
n7dw | Some people, of course, are so wilful that even if you tell them that you are not going to compromise with fixed biases, they will continue to battle. In such cases the teacher will disappoint their expectations by making himself out to be unsuitable to the student, borrowing from the Malamati techniques. Even then, the de- linquent student may not be able to understand what is going on, and will put all kinds of fanciful interpretations on the matter. Saadi, in the Gulistan, has a tale about this.
9nt1 | TALE OF THE MUEZZIN
fr45 | There was once a Muezzin who called the faithful to prayer with such an awful voice that the mosque trustee, a kindly man, offered him ten dinars to go to another town. Subsequendy he came across the trustee and said, 'You offered me only ten dinars to go to another town, but where I am now they are offering twenty, but I still refuse to leave.'
s2ty | The trustee laughed and said: 'Hold out, and you will find that they will even go as high as fifty.'
3cdb | 130
6hsm | 5 Action and Meaning
om5d | Real and Relative Generosity
0svq | UNGENEROUS MEN
1too | ONE man heard of the plight of another while he was sitting among friends. He immediately felt moved, and handed out a sum of money to be given to the distressed one.
pti9 | Another, who had not heard of any special case, went out when he had some money and looked for someone who was in need. He asked him about his needs, and fulfilled them.
4mtx | Which of these was the really generous man?
rgxy | The answer is - neither
vsq9 | Both were generous within conventional limits. They were doing what they had been taught to do.
d5a1 | These forms of generosity are sufficient only at the very begin- nings of generosity.
qtb8 | Beyond this is the stage for which these other forms are sup- posed to be the preparation.
g395 | Because people rarely rise above the preliminary stages, these shallow forms of generosity are assumed to be the height of generosity.
wfvy | The real generosity is when a man does something generous when nobody knows about it; or when, other people knowing something about it, he refuses to gain any credit for his generosity, from the recipient or anyone else.
7yfb | Real generosity is anonymous to the extent that a man should be prepared even to be considered ungenerous rather than explain it to others.
3mmm | This kind of generosity, in goods, in work and in thought, is deliberately cultivated in the ranks of the Elect, and is practised by those who wish to enter their ranks, with no exceptions at all, and there is no relaxation of this exercise.
742r | Generosity is also marked by doing what one says one will do. Saadi teaches: 'when the generous promise, they per- form'.
9u58 | 133
vv8b | Not to be greedy is, paradoxically, the highest form of looking after one's true interests.
te37 | Greed harms you: generosity helps you.
uk6d | This is why it has been said: 'Greed is the mother of incapacity'.
2b11 | 134
2xg3 | Why do Sufis Excel
i3w4 | Q: What stops people making progress, especially in great writ- ings or producing teaching materials?
ta7u | A: An eminent orientalist has recorded in print his difficulty in understanding how the Sufi classical author Saadi of Shiraz could have written two great Persian classics in three or four years.
qqu2 | This may be a problem to the scholastic: but it describes his mind, not Saadi's.
lpgr | To the Sufi such perplexity marks a situation not dissimilar to that of the ingenuous person who says: 'I can't understand how that man with the thunderstick can bring down such a big metal bird from the sky.'
1b4f | This 'concealed savage' in man is not present, of course, only in the limited type of scholar. He is the savage which prevents everyone from making progress in any field.
fh0y | Correct teaching brings out human excellence.
4g6f | The teaching must, of course, work with the best part of the individual, must be directed to his or her real capacity.
fpm1 | In the first chapter of his Gulistan, the "Rose Garden', Saadi declares:
ycds | How can anyone make a good sword from bad iron?
duzw | From teaching, the useless one will not become useful.
a7jq | The rain, whose nature does not change.
s9lx | Grows flowers in the garden, thorns in the marsh.
4uik | People who have fallacious objectives are like the barren soil. The flowers grow from soil which is composed of the right objectives.
e0rl | The people whom you mention as not making progress are working from an unsuitable basis. 'If you insist on buying poor food, you must be prepared to dislike it at the serving.'
7hew | 135
onvv | Confusion as a Personal Problem
adbb | Q: What can I do about my confusion and worthlessness?
h6cg | A: People who ask that their confusion be removed should take note of these three points first: -
unxh | 1. They should satisfy themselves that I (or others) have offered to remove confusion, etc. Sufis have not. They therefore have to trace the source of the offer, if any, to remove confusions and apply to whoever has made the offer. If the 'offer' has in fact arisen within the mind of the applicant, he should recognise this.
ycmp | 2. They should note that confusion, etc., may often be a protec- tion. You may not like a fog, but if it is shielding you from a man-eating tiger, it is better to have it. In too many cases people should be giving thanks for their confusions, which are shields, rather than trying to remove them before they are able to face what lies behind.
wabe | 3. Plenty of people, and this is of course well recognised today, create and maintain their own confusion, even while imagining that they are trying to escape it.
vpyq | The answer, therefore, to 'what can I do about my confusion?' is, 'Find out what its cause is, and why it is there. Then decide if you want to do anything about it.'
ai73 | Confusion comes of not paying attention to what should be attended to first. The problem of the confused, therefore, is that they should become aware of this, first using their wits to ob- serve themselves, and think less about confusion. Remember the proverb: 'A sign is enough for the alert, but a thousand counsels are not enough for the negligent.'
1lzj | As to feeling worthlessness, there are limits to this as there are to the reverse. Saadi has designed this poem, which I translate from Persian for you, to see that the problem is one of perspec- tive:
boyi | A drop which fell from a rain-cloud
9lwd | Was disturbed by the extent of the sea:
d2vd | 136
ow2p | 'Who am I in the ocean's vastness? If IT is, then indeed I am not I'
q5v1 | While it saw itself with the eye of contempt A shell nurtured it in its bosom.
ty34 | The heavens so fostered things That it became a celebrated, a royal Pearl:
gzzp | Becoming high from being low It knocked on the door of nothingness: Until Being came about.
kh7y | The Persian poetic convention is that a pearl is a transformed raindrop.
7xl2 | Your confusion is because you are not getting what you want; and your sense of worthlessness is something which you feel you have and do not want. One of the Sufis has remarked, on this same double problem:
53tr | 'You must strive to be patient both with what you want and what you do not want: for each of them will try you. Exercise both kinds of patience and deserve the human name.'
3zd1 | FEELING YOUR OWN NOTHINGNESS
3shq | The Sufi saint Attar records the great ancient Bayazid* as saying: 'You must feel your own nothingness *.
r3r5 | To perceive one's own nothingness is valuable. To indulge one- self emotionally by frightening oneself with it is shallow self- amusement - all the more attractive to many people because they can pretend to themselves that it is sincerity or piety. One has to get beyond this childish state.
pgo2 | *In Attar's Tadhkirat d-Awliyya. Bayazid died in 875 of the Christian era.
v6zz | Being a 'Guru'
7zt5 | Q: I find that people tend to depend upon me, and that when I give them attention, or under other circumstances, they 'transfer' onto me; they regard me as a Guru when I try to teach them. I do not want to have people dependent upon me, so I do not want to teach them.
77ir | A: When people start to depend upon you in this unwelcome manner, it is up to you to dismiss them, retaining only those who actually can learn, and who do not use you as a source of de- pendency. I have no idea who told you that there are only two alternatives - to teach and have people dependent, or to 'shut up shop'. I tell you that this is an over-simplification. Shun the people who show these signs, and you will be able to teach use- fully.
wbov | If, of course, you have nothing to teach, it is your job to convince such people of that.
4bll | THE DERVISH'S DISCIPLES
fl9r | A dervish once went to a Sufi and said: 'People adopt me as their teacher, and I want to dissuade them'. The Sufi said: 'All you have to do is to behave as if you were mad, and they will soon desert you.'
c297 | 'But my reputation would be gone!' cried the distraught der- vish.
vo3u | 'Ah, I see,' said the Sufi, 'the question was about teaching, but what lay behind it was self-esteem!'
gxrz | Well, do you want people dependent upon you or not?
hkkk | I wonder whether you realise that Sufis do not call themselves Sufis, because that is arrogance? I was present when a Sufi was asked: 'Why do you not say that you are a Sufi?' He answered: 'That would be self-assertion, and would invite attack.' 'Then,'
zmxa | 138
aq7b | the questioner said, 'why do you not deny it?' He said: 'That could be untrue, and, moreover could deprive worthwhile people of a means of learning.'
d9lc | The questioner is perceiving things through his secondary self. The two anecdotes I give draw attention to the working of this self, which cannot teach or learn.
cciv | 139
b47m | Systems
3va3 | Q: I am convinced that the Sufi materials which I have read and heard about are based upon a knowledge of real truth, far more than anything else which I have come across. Why, however, should the Sufis expect you to follow their methods? Is there no other way? What about other systems? I want to exercise humility.
900o | A: The Sufi advocates a certain way, or one or other of a large number of methods, because these are the methods which gave rise to the results which you so unreservedly applaud. So, in effect, they say: 'You like this result? Very well, this is the method by which it was arrived at. You want some other result? Very well, you must apply to those who are responsible for the other result, and seek their methods.'
4am3 | IN AND OF THE SUFI WAY
ggbb | I remember hearing this question asked of a certain Sufi. His answer was this :-
51t4 | 'If you want to learn Sufism, you must follow the Sufi path. If you want information about why you should follow the Sufi path, you must apply to someone who is not teaching, but who is giving out scholarly opinions about the relative merits of various paths.'
f9z3 | As to humility, we can link it with learning by noting the statement of Kalabadhi in his Taaruf:
jaw0 | 'Humility is the acceptance of the truth about the truth, from the truth.'
7fiw | The question can both be asked and answered by the same person if he will first attend to the matter of the difference be- tween learning of the Sufi Way and learning in the Sufi Way.
3koz | You see this tendency very often, where things which might be
crjb | 140
nk6u | admissible under one set of circumstances are turned into 'peren- nial truths'.
ils9 | Someone was asking me just now, for instance, about the ques- tion of 'selling knowledge'. He felt that people should not make a charge for wisdom, and expected me to condemn those who did SO.
jnec | You see how it works? First the fact that knowledge and wis- dom are the product of processes is ignored, and they are un- consciously redefined almost as commodities. Then only is it possible to talk about 'selling them'. Now, I can sell you in- formation, or sacks of coal, but neither I nor anyone else can sell knowledge.
hxy3 | JESUS AND THE APPLES
3jn8 | I have recently been reading, too, a remark attributed to Jesus in one of those gospels which are, for one reason or another, con- demned by the various churches. Listen to what is said there about selling:
sxz7 | 'Jesus said: "There went forth two men to sell apples. The one chose to sell the peel of the apple for its weight in gold, caring nought for the substance of the apples. The other desired to give the apples away, receiving only a little bread for his journey. But men bought the peel of the apples for its weight in gold, caring nought for him who was fain to give to them, nay even despising him."'
o1qm | Think about this story and see something of the vehicle and the objective, the nature of human thought and behaviour, and the question of human studies and the materials within the structure.
0wlv | 141
d6bc | The Vehicle and the Objective
z27p | Q: What is your attitude on the structure of human studies and the materials within the structure?
7sdk | A: A characteristic disease of human thought is to mistake the vehicle and the objective, or the instrument and the aim.
r5ct | This tendency is seen in all human communities, whether they are what we call 'advanced' or otherwise. It is as strongly present in civilised as in barbaric societies, only its manifestations are different.
t5nr | The rule is that:
xiwq | Something which was functional becomes prized for itself: whether it is an exercise becoming a ritual, or an individual worker becoming idolised, or a tool becoming a totem.
iivy | Whoever encourages this tendency will always find supporters, because this warp is already in the human environment, and its derivatives will seem 'right'.
kn8m | On the other hand, the concept of vehicle and instrument, of not seeing the wood for the trees, and other manifestations of this possible confusion, are so well established that there will always be people who will understand the importance of thinking straight on the container and that which is contained, and on other mani- festations, including the grub-chrysalis-butterfly one.
vqoi | The means and the end are not the same. Studies, courses and processes exist for determining, perceiving and profiting from the knowledge of 'means' and 'end *.
n3q9 | Do you remember Omar Khayyam saying:
8jez | 'Temples and the Kaaba of Mecca are the houses of devotion/ striking the bell is the sound of worship/the girdle and church and rosary and cross/every one is the sign of devotion.'
bhki | The tool becoming a totem is especially marked as a tendency when people want to generalise theories, laws and rules out of situations which require a greater flexibility than just one or two alternatives.
q8rl | 142
gsah | Concern and Campaign
t5nl | Q: If one feels something very strongly, is it not right to pass this on to others, to get them 'concerned', and to form bodies of people who have similar interests?
