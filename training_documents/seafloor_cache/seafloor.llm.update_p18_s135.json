        "content": "r04h | lithology of the footwall is monomict to polymict lapillistone that is crudely bedded with both matrix- and clast-supported horizons. Alteration and late infill by patchy sulfate cement obscures many of the primary volcanic textures, resulting in a high degree of uncertainty regarding facies interpretations. The altered volcaniclastic material extends to maximum drilled depths of twenty-two point three two meters below sea floor; however, the full depth and areal extent of the alteration is unknown, with most of the drilling having been focused along the central row of cinder cones. Alteration minerals in the footwall breccias identified by XRD include dioctahedral smectite, chlorite,\norpr | with minor clinochlore, minor chloritoid, illite, and mixed-layer clays: illite/smectite, muscovite/illite, and chlorite/smectite. These minerals constitute five alteration facies that are distinguished in drill core by different colors: one, montmorillonite/nontronite, with yellow-orange, yellow-gray, and red-brown hues; two, nontronite plus corrensite, with greenish-yellow to greenish-gray hues; three, illite/smectite plus pyrite, with yellowish-gray to olive-gray hues; four, illite/smectite plus chamosite, with bluish-white, olive, olive-gray, and greenish-yellow hues; and five, chamosite plus corrensite, with greenish-yellow to pale olive, with minor brown to reddish-brown hues.\nk36m | MINERALIZATION AND ALTERATION OF THE TINAKULA S M S DEPOSIT",
