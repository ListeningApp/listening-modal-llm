        "content": "ne2o | Two point three. The hindgut\nsqxn | Digestion is completed in several hours and indigestible matter passes into the peritrophic membrane of the midgut. The faecal pellet is contained in this tube, which is grasped by the rectal pads and extruded at intervals in lengths equal to that of the midgut. Infolding of the basal membrane in the hindgut epithelial cells as well as folding of the entire epithelium allow for stretching of the hindgut lining under faecal loading.\n6pmo | The cells lining the short hindgut appear to be specialized for cation transport, but their specific functional role in nutrition has yet to be defined. Since the hindgut is lined with cuticle, it is unlikely to absorb digestive materials. It may be involved in water transport, but again its role must be limited due to the cuticular lining. The rectum is probably also the means by which the external medium is pumped into the midgut but, again, the function of this rectal pumping has not been firmly established.\n195r | Three. Digestive enzymes\nkqmi | The pH of digestive fluids is acidic, about pH five, which favours the activities of the various enzymes involved in digestion. The shrimp stomach, which is covered in a chitin layer, does not secrete acid or enzymes, although its contents often show digestive enzyme activities, some of which may derive from the hepatopancreas and some from food animals.\ng8rd | The midgut contains several enzymes including protease, amylase and lipase which are secreted by the hepatopancreas. The proportions of these enzymes can vary with development. Digestive enzymes are synthesized in the F-cells, fibrillar cells, and accumulate in the B-cells.\nnns9 | Normally, secretion is thought to be by merocrine, by exocytosis, or apocrine, by enclosing in plasma membrane to form vesicles, discharge; however, the stimulation of food intake following a period of starvation may induce holocrine secretion, by rupture of the cell membrane.\n9uwy | The hepatopancreas secretes a wide range of digestive enzymes: proteases, including specific collagenases, lipolytic enzymes, chitinase, cellulase, e.g., endo-beta-one, four-glucanase and beta-one, four-glucosidase, to be able to utilize the cellulose from plant cell walls, laminarinase which hydrolyses laminarin, a polysaccharide of glucose found in brown algae, and amylase which hydrolyses starch. Species with a high dietary intake of protein show high proteinase activities. Species that feed on crustaceans synthesize chitinase. Herbivorous species tend to produce high levels of the various carbohydrases to be able to disrupt cell walls and make use of the cellulose from plant cell walls, laminarin and other non-starch polysaccharides. Omnivorous species have high activities of several of the above enzymes.\nsrly | Three point one. Proteases\ndl6i | Protein is a major component in the feed of crustaceans and consequently proteolytic enzymes play a significant role in food hydrolysis and assimilation.\n89ub | Proteases are involved in digesting long protein chains into short fragments, splitting the peptide bonds that link amino acid residues by catalysing the reaction of hydrolysis. Hydrolysis is a chemical process in which a molecule of a target substance is split into two parts by the addition of a molecule of water. Some proteases can detach the terminal amino acids from the protein chain, exopeptidases, such as aminopeptidases, carboxypeptidase A; the others attack internal peptide bonds of a protein, endopeptidases, such as trypsin, chymotrypsin, pepsin, papain and elastase. Thus, when trypsin hydrolyses a protein, it splits peptides into amino acids which can then be absorbed across the cell membrane.\ndhle | For many years it was thought that the vast majority of ingested proteins in all animals were completely hydrolysed to free amino acids before absorption. However, in mammals and teleost fish this view has been revised, and it is now believed that a significant proportion of amino acids are absorbed in the form of di- and tripeptides via a cotransport system driven by a hydrogen ion gradient. There is some evidence that the hepatopancreas of decapod crustaceans possess similar mechanisms.\n2nib | The vertebrate proteases, pepsin, chymotrypsin and carboxypeptidase, are secreted as inactive zymogens, pepsinogen, trypsinogen, chymotrypsinogen and procarboxypeptidase. This is in order to prevent digestion of intracellular proteins. These inactive precursors are activated by either inorganic ions, such as hydrogen ion activates pepsinogen, specific enzymes, like enterokinase activates trypsinogen, other enzymes, like trypsin activates chymotrypsinogen, or by the active enzyme itself, like pepsin activates pepsinogen; trypsin activates trypsinogen.\nnaev | Invertebrate endopeptidases generally are secreted in an activated form, although their activity is augmented by the presence of sulfhydryl, S-H, bonds in the gut. Various intracellular endopeptidases of both vertebrates and invertebrates, called cathepsins, are produced in the active form. It is likely that extracellular digestive endopeptidases are derived from intracellular cathepsins.\n7h0h | Proteases found in crustacean include trypsin, chymotrypsin, elastase, semi-collagenase, aminopeptidases and carboxypeptidases.\na64c | The chemistry of crustacean proteases has been the subject of a considerable research effort.\ngi7n | Several studies have shown that in crustaceans, especially penaeids, the synthesis of digestive proteases is sensitive to the level of protein in the food.",
