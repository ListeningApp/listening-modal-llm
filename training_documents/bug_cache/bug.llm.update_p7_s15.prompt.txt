You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

53eu | quently, we collected data from individuals in a broad range of jobs in a variety of organizations. This allowed us to rule out the possibility that results might be unique to a particular type of job or organization and would support generalization to a broad range of settings. We considered 74 firms in the Midwest as possible data collection sites and assessed each on four char- acteristics (likelihood of being able to study multiple groups from the same organization, likelihood of being able to study groups in which jobs were interdependent, likelihood that a personal contact would be willing to endorse the study, and our subjective assessment of the probability of successfully collect- ing data in the organization). On the basis of this analysis we contacted 44 firms and 21 (48%) agreed to participate, provid- ing us with access to 95 work groups that met our criteria for inclusion. We excluded temporary groups (i.e., task forces and committees ) and groups with low task interdependence where work was performed primarily by individuals working alone (i.e., bank tellers, research scientists with individual account- ability for projects, and sales personnel with individual incentive programs ). In summary, groups in the study were of an ongoing or permanent nature and composed of at least three employees in interdependent jobs who reported to the same supervisor. The resulting convenience sample consisted of data from 597 employees, their peers, and their supervisors from 95 work groups (median group size = 8) from 21 organizations. The data on voice behavior and respondent demographics were originally collected for cross-validation purposes as part of a larger con- struct validity study (Van Dyne & LePine, 1998). For the current study variables, we obtained complete data on 441 employees and conducted our analyses on these responses.
a5u1 | Data were collected from employees in group meetings held at company facilities during normal working hours. Participants were told that their individual responses would remain confi- dential and that they could withdraw from the study at any time. Respondents completed questionnaires in the presence of a researcher and other group members to assure that all partici- pants were exposed to the same stimuli, had the same back- ground information on the study, and completed their question- naires under the same circumstances. On average, employees were 36 years of age and were employed by their organizations for 7 years. Women made up 54% of the sample and 44% had at least some college education. Respondents were all full time and 65% held manager or professional jobs.
ry7u | To ensure a stringent assessment of our hypotheses, we as- sessed voice 6 months after we obtained data on the predictors. Time 1 data collection included employee and supervisor ques- tionnaires. At Time 2, 4 peers rated each employee's voice behavior. Prior to the data collection meetings, group supervi- sors provided the researchers with names of all group members. We excluded temporary workers and employees who had been group members less than 3 months to ensure that group members had adequate knowledge to assess voice behavior. We prepared peer rating questionnaires in advance, by writing a specific peer's name on the top of each subsection of the peer report instrument. In groups that contained 5 or fewer employees, each group member described all peers. In groups of more than 5, we randomly selected which 4 peers' names were written on each questionnaire. We did this to avoid potential selection bias that might have occurred if respondents chose specific peers.

r8sm | This also provided a balanced design where each individual was described by an equal number of peers. The primary advantage of using peers as raters is that in most interdependent work groups there is daily interaction among peers that allows them to observe a wide range of behaviors under different circum- stances. Peer ratings, therefore, should be more reflective of behavior than self ratings ( which may be subject to self-presen- tation bias) and supervisor ratings (which may reflect atypical impression management behaviors; Eastman, 1994).
cuin | Measures
n1i7 | Voice. We measured voice at Time 2 with Van Dyne and LePine's (1998) 6-item scale, which itself was based on a modi- fication of the Van Dyne, Graham, and Dienesch (1994) Advo- cacy Participation Scale. Item anchors were 1 = strongly dis- agree to <LATEX>7 = \mathrm { s t r o n g } b</LATEX> agree. Items were prefaced by "This particular co-worker" and ended with (1) "develops and makes recommendations concerning issues that affect this work group"; (2) "speaks up and encourages others in this group to get involved in issues that affect the group"; (3) "communi- cates his/her opinions about work issues to others in this group even if his/her opinion is different and others in the group disagree with him/her"; (4) "keeps well informed about issues where his/her opinion might be useful to this work group"; (5) "gets involved in issues that affect the quality of work life here in this group"; and (6) "speaks up in this group with ideas for new projects or changes in procedures." We used the mean of the peer ratings to operationalize voice. Internal consistency and interrater agreement for the scale were high <LATEX>\left( \alpha = . 9 5 \right. ,</LATEX> mean
0r5m | <LATEX>r w g _ { 0 } = . 8 8 ,</LATEX> <LATEX>\left. S D = . 2 0 \right) .</LATEX> Satisfaction with the group. We assessed satisfaction with the group with four items based on Kunin's (1955) Faces Scales. For each item, employees circled the number of the face <LATEX>\left( 1 = b i g \right.</LATEX> frown to <LATEX>\left. 7 = b i g \quad s m i l e \right)</LATEX> that best represented their feelings as a member of the work group. Example items include "Consider this work group. Select the face which best expresses how you feel about this work group here" and "Consider your co-workers. Select the face which best expresses how you feel about your co-workers here." Cronbach's alpha was .86.
ne2o | Global self-esteem. We measured global self-esteem using Brockner's (1988) 17-item scale <LATEX>\left( 1 = n e v e r \right.</LATEX> to <LATEX>7 = a \ln a y s .</LATEX> Participants were asked to think of their overall life experiences and then indicate the extent to which they believed in statements such as "How often do you feel that you have handled yourself well at a social gathering?" and "How often do you have the feeling that you can do everything well?" Cronbach's alpha was .89.
sqxn | Situational measures. Supervisors provided information on group size (number of employees in the group) and style of management <LATEX>\left( 0 = t r a d i t i o n a l , 1 = s e l f \right) .</LATEX> Because the general context of work can effect attitudes and behavior, we controlled for the firm type <LATEX>\left( 0 = m a n u f a c t u r i n g , \right.</LATEX> 1 = nonmanufacturing) and firm size (number of employees in the organization).
