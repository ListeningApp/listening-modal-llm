        "content": "9m8s | WORLD POLITICS\n893y | withstanding, our quantitative analysis often includes all middle-income countries, and many of our arguments could travel, in revised form, to other middle-income countries. Of course, even among our nine large middle-income countries there are major differences, to which we return in Section Five.\nfavz | EDUCATION\n7szx | Despite steady progress over recent decades in increasing access and spending, educational achievement in middle-income countries continues to lag. Conversely, countries where education levels have historically exceeded the norm for their income levels have been some of the fastest growing in East Asia and the ones most likely to escape the middle-income trap. Several measures give a clear picture of gaps in educational quality and performance: Program for International Student Assessment scores, proportion of the labor force with tertiary education, and number of technical workers in research and development activities. The gaps show both the problem of low human capital and the enormous challenge to overcoming the middle-income trap.\nhx9e | For Program for International Student Assessment scores, a forty-point difference is equivalent to about one year of education, which puts fifteen-year-olds in middle-income countries more than two years behind Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development countries and more than three years behind high-income East Asia. The results reflect cumulative learning, so raising scores requires improving education quality across all levels of primary and secondary education. Differences in the stock of higher education are again stark, with middle-income countries at less than sixty percent of the levels of high-income East Asia and Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development countries. Figure One provides another representation of the steep institutional challenge facing large middle-income countries. The slope conveys the strong relationship between education and income, but also shows that educational attainment in large middle-income countries is below what would be expected for their income levels.\nywn2 | Stocks at highest levels of education-technical personnel in research and development-show the greatest differences: Middle-income countries have only about a quarter of the levels of high-income Asia and the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development. These numbers are, of course, correlated with investment in research and development, but the numbers also capture the important point that much investment in research and development goes to paying scientists, engineers, and technicians, so research and development investment cannot be increased overnight. The educational\na63r | system must first produce the personnel that companies, agencies, and institutes can hire.\ndqvj | RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\nr17u | Middle-income countries invest only a third or less of what high-income countries invest in research and development. This is one of the differences most clearly connected to the prior drivers of growth-especially low-wage, labor-intensive manufacturing, multinational corporation dominance of manufacturing (multinational corporations concentrate research and development at home), and raw materials exports-that helped bring countries out of low income but did not promote investment in research and development. Research and development does of course tend to increase with development, but Figure Two also reveals two crucial aspects of the middle-income trap. First, most large middle-income countries invest below the expected amount of research and development for their income levels. And, second, for the fitted curve, middle-income countries are at a point in development where the curve slopes more sharply upward, which conveys the increasing challenges they face.\n3c47 | The large educational and research and development gaps between high-income and middle-income countries highlight the huge challenge of institution building facing the latter. Increasing, say, investment or exports can be promoted by policies such as tax exemptions that, while rewarding some and hurting others, can be implemented with the stroke of a pen. In contrast, training and employing more technical personnel requires (one) extensive horizontal coordination among private firms, research institutes, and universities to create the new positions and develop specialized curricula, as well as (two) massive vertical coordination among the thousands of teachers and students who will implement the new training and education programs. Section Four returns to institutional challenges in education. Both forms of coordination require large investments in a range of institutions that usually includes schools, vocational training institutions, universities, university-business collaborations, and some mix of research consortia or institutes, laws and court systems for intellectual property, agencies to promote research and development, and so forth.\ng345 | Improved performance by middle-income countries in productivity-enhancing reforms and investments is more important today, when the bar for upgrading is higher than in the past. As we have seen, levels of education and research and development were much lower in high-income countries in the twentieth century than they are currently. The goalposts have moved. Shifts in the tech-\nsvhz | nological and managerial challenges facing today's middle-income countries suggest that successful movement out of the middle-income trap in the twenty-first century will require industrial policies, institutional designs, and political configurations that are different from those adopted by earlier developers. Yet one component of past success-the development of broad coalitions in support of effective institutions-is as necessary as ever.\noaen | Three. DISARTICULATION POLITICS: OBSTACLES TO FORMING UPGRADING COALITIONS\n5u67 | Making enormous institutional investments requires extraordinary collective action and coalition building. Indeed, Alejandro Foxley and Fernando Sossdorf set it as a top priority: \"The most productive thing middle-income countries can do to accelerate their transition to advanced economies is to establish a bipartisan political consensus.\" Yet the evolving political conditions in middle-income countries have become especially inauspicious for such consensus and coalition building. Our political analysis concentrates on the social cleavages-especially inequality, formal/informal workers, and foreign/domestic business-that impede the emergence of effective upgrading coalitions.\ndvms | We focus on coalitions of social groups for two main reasons. First is the centrality of coalitions to successful late industrialization and movement into high income. Such coalitions varied along several dimensions, such as their duration, the number of groups involved, and the role of the state in forging them. They range from the \"marriage of iron and rye\" (large landowners and heavy industry) in nineteenth-century Germany; to Japan's postwar \"corporatism without labor\"; to Northeast Asia's postwar \"cohesive capitalist states,\" also labeled \"conservative coalitions\" or \"state corporatism,\" in which authoritarian leaders prioritized rapid industrialization by working \"closely with\nqrd3 | MIDDLE-INCOME TRAP\nrxrg | industrialists\"; to the more horizontal, \"societal\" corporatist arrangements, usually involving labor as well as business and the state, in the small states of northern Europe, and Ireland. Despite their variation, these arrangements served a common purpose: namely, they facilitated intertemporal bargains needed for investing in those upgrading-related investments that required extensive information, negotiation, monitoring, and short-term costs, but whose benefits would emerge only in the medium or long term.\ntf43 | Second, recent antidemocratic shifts in South Africa, Thailand, and Turkey notwithstanding, long-term developmental autocracies, such as those in Northeast Asia in the twentieth century, are ever less likely as elections have become routine in our nine cases of large middle-income countries. In more democratic settings, short political horizons for political incumbents weaken their incentives for long-term investments, thus, sustained political pressure from coalitions that support upgrading becomes especially important for keeping elected politicians on task. Even in cases where single parties or leaders were in power for more than a decade (as in Argentina, Brazil, Malaysia, South Africa, and Turkey), time horizons were still fairly short term. Moreover, these parties were largely populist, redistributive, and/or corrupt; in addition, they did not face strong upgrading coalitions. Malaysia is a partial exception to which we return in Section Five.",
