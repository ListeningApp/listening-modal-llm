        "content": "6d4s | Context consists of the wider environmental context, \"the broad set of stimuli-exogenous to the focal organization-that shape the management discourse,\" and the organizational context, \"the administrative and social mechanisms that management can manipulate to shape the behaviors of actors in the organization.\" Birkinshaw et al. argue that \"these two aspects of context potentially influence all activities associated with management innovation\" but never provide further detail of what these contexts might actually consist of. In other words, how context influences management innovating largely remains a mystery in the management innovation literature.\nmqah | Still, other work has provided insights into aspects of environmental and organizational context. In the environmental context, the nature of a country's institutions (such as its laws, corporate governance systems, and national culture) plays an important role in shaping what kinds of management innovations emerge and when. But technology is also known to be an important factor since it offers new opportunities, as does the presence of competitive pressure, which may force a firm to innovate. In terms of the organizational context, important factors to consider for the successful implementation of management practices are a firm's leadership (especially from the top), fit with the existing structure, and resources (including the right kind of organizational culture).\nxxr8 | How does the environmental and organizational contexts affect management innovating in an emerging market multinational characterized by VUCA? An answer to this question raises the intriguing possibility that the sources of competitive advantage of Chinese and other emerging market multinationals may lie not just in cost advantages, or even the ability to come up with innovative products, but also in innovative management practices.\nrl4j | Our research on Rendanheyi suggests that both the organizational context and the environmental context contributed greatly to management innovating at Haier. Three key factors emerge for each type. In the organizational context, we found that structure, leadership, and resources were all clearly connected to the management innovation process. In the environmental context, we observed the influences of competitive, technological, and institutional aspects of the environment. Eventually, leadership turned out to be the most important of these factors. Figure one captures the overall model.\nvz32 | Our research on Haier is based on personal interviews with senior executives (including the Haier Group chairman) and owner-CEOs of xiaowei (micro-enterprises) involved in the design and implementation of Rendanheyi, as well as external consultants and experts who advised senior executives on the company's\nncb0 | Management Innovation Made in China: Haier's Rendanheyi\n8mp0 | restructuring. We traveled to the Haier Group headquarters in Qingdao where we conducted most of the interviews. We also conducted a tour of the company's Qingdao site and attended a symposium dedicated to Rendanheyi in Beijing. Finally, we consulted internal and external documents to supplement these observations.\nxjyk | Rendanheyi: Creating Responsive Online-Based Entrepreneurial Units\nmt0f | The Making of the Haier Group\nawab | Like other leading Chinese manufacturing firms, Haier has become an effective competitor of western firms over the last decade and a half. But Chinese firms are not known for inventing radical modern management practices. In particular, Chinese management practices are said to maximize efficiency and fast commercialization, and innovative firms from China are said to \"excel at cost reduction, accelerated product development and networked production.\" This suggests the Chinese management focus may well support product development and production activities but is unlikely to support creativity and management innovation. So how was Rendanheyi developed, and why did it make sense for Haier to invent it?\nixcc | The Haier Group began as a nearly bankrupt refrigerator company called Qingdao General Refrigerator based in Qingdao, a city in China's coastal Shandong province. In nineteen eighty-four, a young municipal official Zhang Ruimin was appointed as plant director. He had a zeal for improvement from the start, and that same year, he introduced technology and equipment from the German company Liebherr to produce refrigerators. In nineteen ninety, the company started exports to Europe as a contract\n8p6h | manufacturer for multinational brands. Zhang said, \"We started exporting to developed markets first because if your products are good enough for consumers in Europe and in the United States, you will have better products in developing markets.\" In nineteen ninety-two, the company was re-named the Haier Group, and, in nineteen ninety-three, Zhang was named CEO.\npmgl | Zhang began to focus Haier's attention around key beliefs that have sustained its management innovating ever since: continuous external environmental change requires continuous internal change; customer service, not existing products, is key to maintaining Haier's forward motion; price competition is ultimately destructive; Haier needs to offer more, not less, to China's increasingly sophisticated customers; the secret of what Haier can offer the customer lies in the knowledge of Haier's employees; all too often, an existing organization structure constrains, rather than liberates, employee talent; and only by making the \"employment agreement\" equitable to all who are affected by it (customers, organization, and employees) can a powerful incentive engine be constructed to drive continuous change. Haier's story is one of consistent change.\n90no | By the nineteen nineties, Haier acquired many other Chinese companies. The product range expanded beyond refrigerators to include home appliances such as washing machines, televisions, air conditioners, and telecommunications equipment. The company improved its products by acquiring foreign technology through joint ventures and strategic alliances with companies such as Mitsubishi of Japan and Merloni of Italy. Zhang said, \"First we observe and digest. Then we imitate. In the end, we understand it well enough to design it independently.\" By nineteen ninety-eight, the Haier Group had a market share of more than thirty percent in refrigerators, washing machines, and air conditioners in the Chinese market.\njt0y | However, the Chinese home appliances market was saturated, and the Chinese government encouraged Chinese enterprises to expand internationally. Furthermore, Haier faced greater domestic competition, as foreign companies began to expand aggressively in the Chinese market. Therefore, the Haier Group began setting up operations overseas, including in the United States in nineteen ninety-nine, Italy in two thousand one, and Germany in two thousand one. It emulated the strategies of successful Japanese and Korean firms such as Sony, Samsung, and LG in terms of taking its own brand to foreign markets and in terms of establishing production as well as R and D in western countries. By the mid two thousands, Haier was an established, successful global brand.\nqb7o | The Making of Rendanheyi\noae5 | Not satisfied with past achievements, Haier's senior management had the ambition to become the global industry leader and to create a truly innovative global company that competes on the basis of new product innovations. In two thousand five, Yang Mianmian, group president at the time, said, \"We are number three in the world for white goods, we want to be number one.\" Around that time, Zhang first used the word \"Rendanheyi,\" which was aimed at achieving (in Zhang's words) \"zero distance to the customer,\" whereby the entire corporate structure is\ns0fl | Management Innovation Made in China: Haier's Rendanheyi\n43ia | Note: ZZJYT equals zi zhu jing ying ti, translated as \"independent operating unit\"; SBU equals strategic business unit; KPI equals key performance indicator.\n3g2y | dedicated to serving customers, giving them personalized products and services, by creating independent entrepreneurial units that operate as small quasi-independent firms (within the boundaries of the company) and have market relationships among themselves.",
