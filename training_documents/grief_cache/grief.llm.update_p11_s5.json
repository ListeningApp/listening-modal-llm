These are people who adapt well to the loss and are not in need of either counseling or therapy. I think this focus is overdue.\ndqvj | In Arizona, Irwin Sandler, Sharlene Wolchik, and Tim Ayers have added to our thinking on resilience. Like me, they prefer the term adaptation to recovery. Those mourners who make a good or effective adaptation to the loss have made a resilient adaptation. Sandler's group has identified both risk and protective factors in their study of parentally bereaved children and their families that lead to a good (resilient) or a less good adaptation to the loss. By focusing on positive as well as negative outcomes, a resilient approach goes beyond the narrower focus of pathological outcomes. It is interesting that the risk and protective factors found in Arizona families are similar to those Silverman and I found in the Boston study. Multiple factors at both the individual and social environmental levels are at work here, so Sandler's group calls their theory a contextual framework on adaptation. Individuals are seen as nested within families, which are in turn nesting within communities and cultures. This fairly new research and thinking on resilience in bereavement holds promise for our understanding of grief and loss. More on this can be found in Chapter Three.\nr17u | Grief Counseling and Grief Therapy\n3c47 | TRAUMA AND GRIEF\ng345 | Like depression and grief, trauma and grief share many of the same behavioral features. A number of articles discuss how they are similar and how they are different. There are some, like Rando, Horowitz, and Figley, who would subsume all grief under trauma, but I find this a stretch. I prefer the model offered by Stroebe, Schut, and Finkenauer, which makes the following three distinctions. The first is trauma without bereavement. Here the person experiences a traumatic event that gives rise to trauma symptoms leading to a diagnosis of PTSD or acute stress disorder, mostly depending on the time frame. Other symptoms of depression and anxiety may lead to a comorbid diagnosis. In this first distinction, the traumatic event has not led to any deaths and the person is dealing with one or more of the classic trauma symptoms (intrusion, avoidance, hyperarousal) without bereavement. Bereavement without trauma is the second distinction. Here the person has experienced the death of a loved one without experiencing trauma symptoms associated with the event. If there are complications after the loss, one of the complicated mourning categories would apply to this complication. The third category could be called traumatic bereavement. Here the person experiences a death and there is something about the death itself (often violent deaths) or something about the person's experience of the death (often related to an insecure attachment or conflicted relationship with the deceased) that gives rise to symptoms associated with trauma.\nsvhz | Two questions emerge in any discussion of traumatic bereavement. First, which is the most important in defining traumatic bereavement-the circumstances of the death or the reaction of the mourner? Second, in the treatment of traumatic bereavement, which symptoms should be addressed first-the trauma symptoms or the grief symptoms? Traumatic stress interferes with grief over loss; grief interferes with trauma mastery. Many believe that the trauma symptoms must be dealt with first before the grief can be addressed.\noaen | There have always been people who have been exposed to violent deaths, but the number of violent events seems to have increased during the past fifteen years. The recent rash of mass shootings and multiple terrorist activities around the world, including September eleven, two thousand one, illustrate the pervasiveness of violence in our society. Such violent events will continue to expose more people to both trauma and bereavement. We need more research on grief and trauma, including research on which interventions are most effective. We also need to educate the media that interventions done in the days following a school shooting are not grief counseling but rather crisis\n5u67 | Introduction\ndvms | intervention, and there are major differences between the two in goals and techniques. More on this can be found in Chapter Three.\nqrd3 | SOME CONCLUDING THOUGHTS\nrxrg | Let me conclude this introduction with something that causes me concern: the failure of both clinicians and researchers to recognize the uniqueness of the grief experience. Even though the mourning tasks apply to all death losses, how a person approaches and adapts to these tasks can be quite varied. A one-size-fits-all approach to grief counseling or grief therapy is very limiting.\ntf43 | When I was a graduate student at Harvard, Professor Gordon Allport had a strong impact on my thinking. Allport would tell students, \"Each man is like all other men; each man is like some other men; and each man is like no other man.\" Allport was affirming his longtime professional interest in individual differences-an interest that led to his collaboration with Robert White on the longitudinal case studies of men called Lives in Progress. These studies affirm both the similarity and uniqueness of each person.\nfcco | If we were to translate Allport's dictum into the field of bereavement, we would say, \"Each person's grief is like all other people's grief; each person's grief is like some other person's grief; and each person's grief is like no other person's grief.\" Over the last thirty-five years, we have tended to lose sight of the uniqueness of the grief experience in our clinical and research undertakings. I always liked Alan Wolfelt's idea of companioning the bereaved individual. In this approach, the counselor comes alongside the mourner and they share their personal experiences in a way that can be helpful for both. I worry that in our rush to formulate a DSM diagnosis for complicated (traumatic, prolonged) grief, we may focus too much on \"Each person's grief is like some other person's grief\" and lose sight of the uniqueness of grief, the fact that each person's grief is like no other person's grief. I have affirmed in each edition of this book that every person's experience of grief is unique to him or her, and people's experiences shouldn't be saddled with the term abnormal grief. I much prefer the term complicated mourning, which affirms some kind of difficulty in the mourning process that brings the person to the attention of the mental health worker.\n8uji | Affirmation of the uniqueness of grief is not a new emphasis in the field of bereavement. Colin Parkes said, \"From the start, Bowlby and I recognized that there was a great deal of individual variation in\ndf3e | Grief Counseling and Grief Therapy\n53eu | the response to bereavement and that not everybody went through these phases in the same way or at the same speed\"\na5u1 | An interesting affirmation of the uniqueness and subjective quality of grief comes from an fMRI study of grief by Gundel, O'Connor, Littrell, Fort, and Lane. After investigating the grief experience in the brains of eight women, they concluded that grief is mediated by a distributed neural network that subserves a number of neural processes affecting various parts of the brain and its functions, including affect processing, mentalizing, memory retrieval, visual imagery, and autonomic regulation. This neural network may account for the unique, subjective quality of grief, and this finding provides new leads in our quest to understand the health consequences of grief and the neurobiology of attachment.\nry7u | I believe that the mediators of mourning outlined in detail in Chapter Three hold the key to understanding individual differences in the mourning experience-the adaptation to loss from death.\n```",
