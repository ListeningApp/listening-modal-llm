        "content": "gvwz | So far, I have taken pains not only to differentiate several dimensions of effectiveness but also to show that there is no basis for assuming that the different dimensions will co-vary in any simple or easily predictable manner. Yet this does not preclude the occurrence of interaction effects among the various dimensions in the sense that developments in some areas have discernible impacts on developments in others. Perhaps the most important of these interaction effects for scholars and practitioners interested in international environmental regimes are those involving causal links between effectiveness as problem solving on the one hand and effectiveness as goal attainment and process effectiveness on the other. For the most part, actors in international society are motivated to form regimes as a response to the emergence of more or less acute problems such as the progressive depletion of commercially valuable fish stocks, the realization that species playing central roles in important ecosystems may go extinct, or the anticipated consequences of a serious thinning of the protective layer of stratospheric ozone. In endeavoring to solve these problems, however, actors ordinarily specify goals (for example, a thirty percent reduction in sulfur dioxide emissions or a phase-out of the production of CFCs) and then devise sets of rules and policy\nsk5m | Effectiveness\nqws8 | instruments intended to bring behavior into line with the attainment of these goals. No doubt, such responses can and sometimes do serve to solve the problems that provoke them. But there is no guarantee that this will be the case. A thirty percent reduction in sulfur dioxide emissions may accompany or even cause a rise in emissions of other substances that are equally disruptive to the natural environment. Irreparable damage to the ozone layer may occur before the consumption of CFCs ceases. Though the emphasis that students of effectiveness place on implementation and compliance is perfectly understandable, therefore, the results should not be treated as a substitute for undertaking the more challenging task of investigating such matters as the causal links between process effectiveness and effectiveness as problem solving.\n877u | Whatever their effectiveness in the realm of intended consequences, international regimes-like all other governance systems- also produce side effects, results that their creators neither intend nor foresee at the time of their establishment. Sometimes side effects take the form of unforeseen distributive consequences as in the case of windfall profits accruing to those who receive tradable pollution rights or permits in an initial distribution or to those in possession of stocks of tradable goods following a decision to phase out future production. In other cases, side effects involve the operation of an institutional arrangement itself as in the case of the unforeseen capture of a regulatory system by those it is intended to regulate. Given the recent rise in levels of interdependence in international society, it is to be expected that side effects will become more ubiquitous in connection with the operation of international regimes and that these effects will often initiate chain reactions of considerable magnitude. As in other realms, there is an understandable tendency to focus on negative side effects in thinking about the unintended consequences flowing from the establishment and operation of international regimes. Yet these side effects clearly constitute a subset of the broader category of externalities, which suggests that we should be open to the prospect of positive as well as negative side effects. Both those responsible for designing international regimes and those seeking to provide overall assessments of their performance will surely want to be alert to the prospect of significant side effects. In individual cases, the impact of the relevant side effects may equal or even exceed the magnitude of the intended effects attributable to the operation of\nrzhj | international regimes, a fact that should give pause to regime enthusiasts who advocate the creation of new institutions as a solution to every problem.\nbfax | DETERMINANTS OF EFFECTIVENESS\nf2y8 | No doubt, our conceptions of effectiveness will continue to evolve as we conduct studies of the workings of specific international environmental regimes. But it is appropriate, at this stage, to turn to the other side of the equation, initiating an inquiry into the factors that operate as determinants of the effectiveness of governance systems in international society. The principal issue here centers on the tension between parsimony and explanatory power. Single-factor accounts are appealing both because they lend themselves to articulation in the form of necessary or sufficient conditions and because they hold the promise of reducing seemingly complex realities to a set of relatively simple and comprehensible propositions. In the social sciences, however, such accounts seldom fare well when they are tested against evidence derived from empirical observations. As a result, analysts typically find themselves fashioning explanatory accounts that include two or more independent variables and seeking to specify the relationships obtaining between or among these variables. There is no reason to expect studies of the determinants of institutional effectiveness to prove exceptional. Even so, differentiation of the types or categories of independent variables will provide a helpful backdrop for the growing body of case studies carried out by scholars working in this field.\no7qm | One approach to this issue that will appeal to practitioners turns on the distinction between decision variables and structural variables. Decision variables are factors subject to conscious control or manipulation on the part of those responsible for designing and managing international regimes. The institutional arrangements embedded in governance systems (for example, their membership, decision-making procedures, and compliance mechanisms) belong to this category. Structural variables are features of the larger physical, biological, or\nd52l | Effectiveness\nqlbb | social environment (for example, the distribution of power in international society) that are not subject to conscious control within any policy-relevant time frame. The study of decision variables holds an obvious attraction for those interested in the effectiveness of international regimes because it is easy to see ways to apply the findings of such research both to the management of existing institutions and to the design of new governance systems. Yet a note of caution is in order here. International governance systems are, for the most part, complex social institutions whose operation is not well understood. Nothing is more common than the establishment of regimes that prove ineffective in practice because they are based on premises that are either wrong or not applicable to the situation at hand. By the same token, studies of structural determinants of effectiveness are by no means irrelevant from the point of view of those charged with establishing or managing international regimes. Practitioners who understand the key structural factors will surely have an advantage when creating regimes that are well-adapted to the environment in which they are expected to operate.\nnhsg | For analytic purposes, however, there is much to be said for a related distinction that separates endogenous variables, exogenous variables, and what I call linkage variables. Those who focus on endogenous variables seek to account for variations in the effectiveness of international governance systems by examining the character of the institutional arrangements themselves. The category of exogenous variables, by contrast, encompasses an array of physical, biological, and social conditions that make up the environment in which an international regime operates. Linkage variables have to do with the fit between the institutional character of a governance system and the environment in which it is expected to function.\nhy0l | Endogenous Variables\n4jmz | There is, to begin with, a debate concerning the extent to which international regimes require the services of organizations (in the sense of material entities possessing offices, personnel, equipment, budgets, and legal personality) to function effectively. Those who approach the issue from the perspective of business administration or\nb7cq | public administration, whose primary concern is the performance of organizations, exhibit a tendency to shift the focus of analysis from the effectiveness of international regimes to the effectiveness of international organizations. This is, in my view, a mistake. With all due respect for the roles organizations play, there is great variation among international governance systems in the extent to which their operation requires the services of some administrative apparatus, and there is no obvious correlation between the presence of organizations and the effectiveness of regimes. As numerous observers have pointed out, moreover, both material and intangible costs are associated with the operation of organizations, which suggests the value of a close examination of the factors that determine when and what sort of organizations are required to make international regimes effective.",
