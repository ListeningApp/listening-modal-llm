You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

18y0 | NNMF Problem A common choice for (13) is a standard Euclidean distance function
779a | WH) = 1 | - v 2 F ,
v8xg | (64)
fmso | where | . || F is the Frobenius matrix norm. In this case, (13) is nonconvex in both W and H, when considered simultaneously, but convex so long as one of the variables is held fixed. This motivates the standard approach to solving (13) based on alternating updates to W and H (Gillis, 2014) where one variable is fixed while optimise over the other (e.g., alternating nonnegative least squares).
ndxn | By contrast, to test our algorithm, we specifically consider solving (13) as a nonconvex problem in W and H simultaneously3. For our first experiment (Figure 4), we consider a text data application. When comparing text documents, we aim to have a similarity measure that is independent of document length. Indeed, we consider documents similar if they have similar word frequency ratios. This notion of similarity is naturally captured by measuring alignment between vectors, which motivates the use of a loss function based on cosine similarity as
sb9k | D(Y,WH) == > i=1 1 - cos (0(yi, (WH);)),
z2gn | (65)
mgx1 | where 0(yi, (WH);) is the angle between the ith predicted and true document. This loss function only considers the alignment between documents. Indeed, we can write
x0do | cos (0(yi, (WH)¿)) = (Yi, (WH)¿)
r8qt | However, using this representation it is clear that, due to the nonnegativity of Y and WH, (65) ranges between 0 and 1. It is also clear that (65) is equivalent to a Euclidean distance with normalisation
sga6 | | (WH)¿ || (WH)¿ 2
7af5 | i=1 Yi |Y ill
uds2 | In our second example (Figure 5), we consider (13) with a standard Euclidean distance function (64) and a nonconvex regularisation term R1. Specifically, we consider a version of the smooth clipped absolute deviation regularisation (SCAD) first proposed in Fan & Li (2001). SCAD uses a quadratic function to smoothly interpolate between a regular {1 penalty and a constant penalty
jp0o | |x| < 1,
akty | SCADA,a(x) =
olz9 | a-1 , 1 5 |x| < a>, |x | > al .
5rex | The SCAD penalty reduces the downward bias on large parameters typical of the {1 penalty while still allowing for sparsification of small parameters. We consider a twice smooth clipped absolute deviation, which we call TSCAD. TSCAD replaces the quadratic interpolant with a quartic, Qx,a (x), which allows for a twice continuously differentiable penalty
hiwi | |x| < >, 1 5 |x| < a>, - (a+1)\2 2 ,
zsp2 | TSCADA, a (x) = {Qx, a (x),
qzw0 | |x| > al .
6hya | The regularisation term is simply given by
h0lh | RX (W, H) = i,j TSCADA, a (Wij) +> i,j TSCADA,a (Hij).

kelb | Due to the inherent nonconvexity of the NNMF problem, initialisation is key to obtaining good results. We utilised a simple half normal initialisation. Indeed, because the data matrix for each NNMF example (Figures 4 and 5) satisfies <LATEX>0 \leq \mathrm { Y } \leq 1 ,</LATEX> we produced the initialisation by drawing <LATEX>\left( \mathrm { W } _ { 0 } ^ { \prime } \right) _ { i j } \sim \mathcal{N} \left( 0 , 1 \right)</LATEX> and <LATEX>\left( \mathrm { H } _ { 0 } ^ { \prime } \right) _ { i j } \sim \mathcal{N} \left( 0 , 1 \right)</LATEX> and normalising in the following manner
xtdb | <LATEX>\mathrm { W } _ { 0 } \leftarrow \frac { | \mathrm { W } _ { 0 } ^ { \prime } | } { \sqrt { \max \left( | \mathrm { W } _ { 0 } ^ { \prime } | | \mathrm { H } _ { 0 } ^ { \prime } | \right) } } , \quad \mathrm { H } _ { 0 } \leftarrow \frac { | \mathrm { H } _ { 0 } ^ { \prime } | } { \sqrt { \max \left( | \mathrm { W } _ { 0 } ^ { \prime } | | \mathrm { H } _ { 0 } ^ { \prime } | \right) } } ,</LATEX> where <LATEX>| \cdot |</LATEX> is taken elementwise. This initialisation was found to result in nontrivial solutions (i.e., visually reasonable low rank representations H) to (13).
