For this study, we generated cytosine DNA methylation profiles from three hundred forty-eight mammalian species using a methylation array platform that targets highly conserved cytosines.\nhjzj | RATIONALE: Nature has evolved mammalian species of greatly differing life spans. To resolve the relationship of DNAm with maximum\nj79f | life span and phylogeny, we performed a large-scale cross-species unsupervised analysis. Comparative studies in many species enables the identification of epigenetic correlates of maximum life span and other traits.\n6tbv | RESULTS: We first tested whether DNAm levels in highly conserved cytosines captured phylogenetic relationships among species. We constructed phyloepigenetic trees that paralleled the traditional phylogeny. To avoid potential confounding by different tissue types, we generated tissue-specific phyloepigenetic trees. The\nxb13 | high phyloepigenetic-phylogenetic congru is due to differences in methylation levels is not confounded by sequence conservation.\ncxqi | We then interrogated the extent to which DNA methylation associates with specific biological traits. We used an unsupervised weighted correlation network analysis to identify clusters of highly correlated CpGs. WGCNA identified fifty-five distinct comethylation modules, of which thirty were significantly associated with traits including maximum life span, adult weight, age, sex, human mortality risk, or perturbations that modulate murine life span.\nqfmx | Both the epigenome-wide association analysis and eigengene-based analysis identified methylation signatures of maximum life span, and most of these were independent of aging, presumably set at birth, and could be stable predictors of life span at any point in life. Several CpGs that are more highly methylated in long-lived species are located near HOXL subclass homeoboxes and other genes that play a role in morphogenesis and development. Some of these life span-related CpGs are located next to genes that are also implicated in our analysis of upstream regulators. CpGs with methylation levels that are inversely related to life span are enriched in transcriptional start site and promoter flanking associated chromatin states. Genes located in chromatin state TSS1 are constitutively active and enriched for nucleic acid metabolic processes. This suggests that long-living species evolved mechanisms that maintain low methylation levels in these chromatin states that would favor higher expression levels of genes essential for an organism's survival.\nrut3 | The upstream regulator analysis of the EWAS of life span identified the pluripotency transcription factors OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG. Other factors, such as POLII, CTCF, RAD21, showed the strongest enrichment for negatively life span-related CpGs.\nm3cp | CONCLUSION: The phyloepigenetic trees indicate that divergence of DNA methylation profiles closely parallels that of genetics through evolution. Our results demonstrate that DNA methylation is subjected to evolutionary pressures and selection. The publicly available data from our Mammalian Methylation Consortium are a rich source of information for different fields such as evolutionary biology, developmental biology, and aging.\nmq4s | RESEARCH\n95el | RESEARCH ARTICLE\na0a5 | EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY DNA methylation networks underlying mammalian traits\ngocl | Using DNA methylation profiles from three hundred forty-eight mammalian species, we constructed phyloepigenetic trees that bear marked similarities to traditional phylogenetic ones. Using unsupervised clustering across all samples, we identified fifty-five distinct cytosine modules, of which thirty are related to traits such as maximum life span, adult weight, age, sex, and human mortality risk. Maximum life span is associated with methylation levels in HOXL subclass homeobox genes and developmental processes and is potentially regulated by pluripotency transcription factors. The methylation state of some modules responds to perturbations such as caloric restriction, ablation of growth hormone receptors, consumption of high-fat diets, and expression of Yamanaka factors. This study reveals an intertwined evolution of the genome and epigenome that mediates the biological characteristics and traits of different mammalian species.\nob1z | Comparative epigenomics is a burgeoning field that integrates epigenetic signatures with phylogenetic relationships to decipher gene-to-trait functions. Prior research has investigated the cap-\nm4cb | acity of DNA methylation patterns in regulatory sequences to reflect evolutionary relationships among species. A recent study compared methylation data across multiple animal species at orthologous gene promoters\nm61y | using a sequencing-based assay that did not specifically target conserved CpGs. Previous investigations faced limitations regarding the measurement platform, particularly the low sequencing depth at conserved CpGs and the sample size per species.\nu2ob | Our study overcomes these constraints in several ways. First, we used a measurement platform ensuring high effective sequencing depth at conserved CpGs, allowing for a more precise analysis of DNAm patterns in highly conserved DNA regions. Second, we increased the sample size per species, aiming for many samples per species. We profiled three hundred forty-eight species from twenty-five of the twenty-six mammalian taxonomic orders. This comprehensive dataset enables examination of phylogenetic relationships, comethylation relationships between cytosines, and their associations with maximum life span and other species characteristics.\n2gnm | We profiled fifteen thousand four hundred fifty-six samples using a methylation array platform that provides effective sequencing depth at highly conserved CpGs across mammalian species. This dataset is the product of the multinational Mammalian Methylation Consortium. In previous studies, we applied supervised machine learning methods to generate DNAm-based predictors of age called epigenetic clocks for numerous species.\nemgw | Here, we performed a large-scale cross-species unsupervised analysis of the entire dataset to reveal the relationship of DNAm with mammalian phylogeny. We show that we could construct phyloepigenetic trees that parallel traditional phylogenetic ones. We then proceed to interrogate the extent to which DNAm underpins specific biological traits by using unsupervised weighted correlation network analysis to minimize the influence of bias on our observations. This approach identifies modules of comethylated CpGs comethylation that are associated with species characteristics, including taxonomy, tissue type, sex, life span, and aging.\nxaqt | Results Evolution and DNAm",
