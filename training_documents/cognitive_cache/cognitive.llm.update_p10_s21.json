        "content": "5bjs | In one of the top AIC models, Pentagon is split into Pentagon initial and Pentagon repeat, instead of Pentagon area and Pentagon side. This suggests that the distinction between the first use of a Pentagon skill in a problem and later uses of that skill in the same problem may be more significant than the distinction between the area and the side. Usually repeated use of a skill in the same problem is easier than the original use. For instance, once a student makes the initial relatively difficult determination that the Pentagon formula is relevant to a problem and recalls it, he need only use it again and perform easier arithmetic in repeated opportunities in that same problem.\nuodj | Five point four Combining the Results from Experiment One, Two, Three\nk16v | By combining the results from the three experiments, we can address question three -- How can we use LFA to improve the tutor and the curriculum by identifying over-taught or under-taught rules, and adjusting their contribution to curriculum length without compromising student performance?\nb2lm | Parallelogram-side has a high intercept (two point zero six) and a low slope (negative point zero one). Its initial success probability is point nine four and the average number of practices per student is fourteen point nine. Much practice spent on an easy skill is not a good use of student time. Reducing the amount of practice for this skill should save student time without compromising their performance. Trapezoid-height has a low intercept (negative one point fifty-five), and a positive slope (point twenty-seven). Its initial success probability is point two nine and the average number of practices per student is four point two. The final success probability is point six nine, far away from the level of mastery. More practice on this skill is needed for students to reach mastery.\nti7f | The advantage of LFA goes even further. An original rule may have two split rules, each of which need decidedly different amounts of practice, because they have different initial difficulty and learning rates. However, students who have appeared to master the original rule in the curriculum before even reading the second split rule might not get enough practice on the second split rule. Compose-by-multiplication is such a case, as seen in table nine.\noksu | With final probability point nine two students seem to have mastered Compose-by-multiplication. However, the decomposition of the skill shows a different picture. C M area does well with final probability point nine six. But C M segment has final probability only point six zero and an average amount of practice less than two. The knowledge-tracing algorithm in the tutor may let the student go after he reaches the mastery on Compose-by-addition in the original model. But with the model found by LFA, the knowledge-tracing algorithm will be able to catch the weakness of students in acquiring C M segment.\nwtow | Six Conclusions and Future Work\no22k | Learning Factors Analysis is a way to combine statistics, human expertise and combinatorial search to evaluate and improve a cognitive model. The system we have developed is implemented in Java and is able to evaluate a model in seconds and conduct a search evaluating hundreds of models in four to five hours. The statistics for each model are meaningful, and the new improved models have better statistical scores and are interpretable. We are planning to use the method for datasets from other tutors to discover its potential for model and tutor improvement.\nnwfz | Learning Factors Analysis - A General Method for Cognitive Model Evaluation",
