        "content": "2ttg | Ohsaki and Nakajima investigated the optimization of stiffeners in I-shaped EBF links. These researchers used the heuristic Tabu Search algorithm for optimizing the locations and thicknesses of link stiffeners.\nhis3 | Stiffener requirements for built-up box links were studied by Berman and Bruneau. The use of end stiffeners for built-up box links was recommended similar to I-shaped links. However, results reported by Berman and Bruneau revealed that intermediate stiffeners are only required for shear links in which the web depth-to-thickness ratio is greater than or equal to zero point six four times the square root of the elastic modulus divided by the yield strength. For shear links with lower web depth-to-thickness ratios, flange buckling is the controlling failure mode, for which the presence of intermediate stiffeners is not effective. Berman and Bruneau also demonstrated that intermediate stiffeners are not beneficial in intermediate and long links where compressive local buckling of both webs and flanges controls the link performance. The required intermediate stiffener spacing for shear links with web depth-to-thickness ratio greater than or equal to zero point six four times the square root of the elastic modulus divided by the yield strength has been determined by Berman and Bruneau using a methodology similar to that used by Kasai and Popov for I-shaped links.\nm50z | In the numerical and experimental investigations of Berman and Bruneau, external stiffeners welded to webs and flanges were considered. However, as stated above, these stiffeners are not effective in controlling flange buckling. Thus, stiffeners welded to the outsides of the link webs or located inside the box section and welded to the insides of the webs can be considered in practical applications.\nme84 | During the twenty eleven earthquakes in Christchurch, New Zealand, the first documented field fractures of EBF short links were recorded at the Christchurch hospital garage. In some of the fractured links, unlike the correct detailing, the end stiffeners were not aligned with the brace flanges. This misalignment was speculated to be a probable reason for the observed fractures in the link flange and connection panel. Kanvinde et al. performed in-depth numerical analyses to investigate the issue. Numerical results revealed that the misalignment had an influential effect in triggering the fractures; however, other factors, such as the imposed ground acceleration which was several times higher than the expected design value, also played a major role. The use of field-welded stiffeners and gusset plates for brace connections was suggested by Kanvinde et al. for better fit-up. Another recent study by Imani and Bruneau further confirmed that the severe stress concentration in the vicinity of the misalignment can initiate fracture and reduce the link rotation capacity significantly. The numerical results also demonstrated that correcting the misalignment by using a different brace section or, more conveniently, by relocating the end stiffeners can mitigate the problem.\no56m | Three point three. Lateral Bracing\nslz6 | Lateral torsional buckling can have deteriorative effects on the cyclic performance of links. The lateral bracing requirements are intended to restrain the link against out-of-plane displacement and twist to ensure stable inelastic response. Although lateral bracing was provided in earlier tests, the importance of proper link lateral bracing was fully understood during the tests of Manheim on three-story prototypes in nineteen eighty-two, where lateral torsional buckling occurred in some test specimens. As a result, lateral bracing of link ends was suggested by Manheim with moment connections between the lateral braces and the link ends to increase the torsional stiffness of the link. In nineteen eighty-nine, Hjelmstad and\n90k5 | Lee conducted a study to investigate the lateral buckling of beams in EBFs. Based on the experimental results of five tests on propped cantilever beams with different lateral bracing schemes at the link ends and a numerical parametric study, Hjelmstad and Lee concluded that providing full rotational restraints at the link ends is essential. Furthermore, it was noted by these researchers that the forces imposed on the lateral braces were much higher than the traditionally used design load of two percent of the flange yield force. During the experimental study of Engelhardt and Popov on long links, strength degradation due to lateral torsional buckling of the link or the beam outside the link was reported for some specimens. These observations further emphasized the importance of providing strong and stiff lateral bracing at link ends. Similar to Hjelmstad and Lee, Engelhardt and Popov also mentioned that the demand on link lateral braces is several times higher than the minimum load of one point five percent of the flange yield force, considered in the nineteen eighties design codes. A minimum load of six percent of the flange yield force was suggested by these researchers for the design of lateral braces of short and long links. Furthermore, it was recommended that the lateral braces should frame into the link ends from only one side in order to prevent imposing excessive in-plane restraint to the link.\n9m8s | Based on the above research, the use of lateral braces at the link ends was required by the early EBF codes. Similarly, AISC three forty-one dash ten requires lateral bracing of both top and bottom flanges of I-shaped links at the link ends. The concrete slab may only provide restraint to the top flange and thus, explicit bracing of link ends is generally necessary.\n893y | The main advantage of built-up box links compared to I-shaped links is their significant resistance to lateral torsional buckling. Berman and Bruneau demonstrated that lateral bracing at link ends is not necessary for typical built-up box links. This can be fruitful in cases where providing lateral bracing for links is not possible or not desired. For instance, lateral bracing of links adjacent to elevator cores or links used in bridge piers is generally cumbersome. Consequently, built-up box links are also referred to as self-stabilizing links.\nfavz | Three point four. Connections\n7szx | In EBF systems, brace-to-beam and link-to-column connections attracted particular research attention due to the high level of demands on these joints. Gusset plate buckling at the brace-to-beam connection was observed in the full-scale tests of Roeder et al. and Foutch. Engelhardt and Popov proposed and tested modified gusseted and directly welded brace-to-beam connections. Satisfactory results were reported for all of the proposed connection details; however, the directly welded connections were found to be more advantageous in controlling lateral torsional buckling of the beam segment outside the link. Considering that the braces are expected to remain essentially elastic during severe loadings, most of the ductility requirements which are required for braces of special concentrically braced frames are not mandatory for EBF braces and their connections, based on the AISC Seismic Provisions.\nhx9e | Tests by Hjelmstad and Popov, and Malley and Popov in the nineteen eighties suggested that fully welded link-to-column connections can exhibit satisfactory behavior during severe loading scenarios. In these tests short links with different combinations of complete joint penetration groove welds and fillet welds for the flanges and the web were considered. In contrast, details with welded flanges and bolted web connections tested by Malley and Popov showed significant bolt slippage which led to premature flange fractures.",
