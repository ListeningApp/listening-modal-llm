Single-nucleotide variants in enhancers or promoters may affect gene transcription by altering transcription factor binding sites. Differential transcription factor binding in heterozygous genomic loci provides a natural source of information on such regulatory variants. We present a novel approach to call the allele-specific transcription factor binding events at single-nucleotide variants in ChIP-Seq data, taking into account the joint contribution of aneuploidy and local copy number variation, that is estimated directly from variant calls. We have conducted a meta-analysis of more than seven thousand ChIP-Seq experiments and assembled the database of allele-specific binding events listing more than half a million entries at nearly two hundred seventy thousand single-nucleotide polymorphisms for several hundred human transcription factors and cell types. These polymorphisms are enriched for associations with phenotypes of medical relevance and often overlap eQTLs, making candidates for causality by linking variants with molecular mechanisms. Specifically, there is a special class of switching sites, where different transcription factors preferably bind alternative alleles, thus revealing allele-specific rewiring of molecular circuitry.\nezla | ARTICLE\nrsbu | Sequence variants located in noncoding genome regions attract an increasing researchers' attention due to the frequent association with various traits, including predisposition to diseases. Single-nucleotide variants in gene regulatory regions may affect gene expression by altering binding sites of transcription factors in gene promoters and enhancers and, consequently, efficiency of transcription.\nmagd | On the one hand, parallel reporter assays allow massive assessment of variants in terms of gene expression alteration but do not reveal particular transcription factors involved. On the other hand, there are multiple ways to assess if a single-nucleotide substitution changes transcription factor-binding affinity, from detailed measurements of the transcription factor affinity landscape in vitro to conventional experiments on individual sequence\ntb74 | variants and computational modeling. However, it is not trivial to utilize these data for annotating single-nucleotide variant effects at the genome-wide scale in a cell type-specific manner.\n8l69 | The functional effect of single-nucleotide substitutions can be studied in heterozygous chromosome loci, where transcription factors differentially bind to sites in homologous chromosomes with alternative single-nucleotide variant alleles. Reliable evidence comes from modern in vivo methods based on chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing. ChIP-Seq provides a deep read coverage of transcription factor-binding regions, and non-perfect alignments of reads often carry single-nucleotide mismatches arising from heterozygous sites. Statistical biases between the numbers of mapped reads containing alternative single-nucleotide variant alleles reveal the so-called allele-specific binding events.\n1jyv | Chromatin accessibility often serves as a proxy for the regulatory activity of a genomic region. Massive assessment of allele-specific chromatin accessibility in more than one hundred cell types reported more than sixty thousand of significantly imbalanced sites. Yet, so far, only ten to twenty thousand allele-specific bindings were reported per study (Supplementary Table 1), and the potentially vast landscape of allele-specific transcription factor binding remains mostly unexplored.\nolce | Reliable identification of allele-specific bindings (the allele-specific binding calling) requires high read coverage at potential sites, which results either from deep sequencing of individual ChIP-Seq libraries or from data aggregation across multiple experiments. Reprocessed ChIP-Seq data for hundreds of transcription factors and cell types are available in databases such as GTRD and ReMap, opening a way to an integrative meta-analysis, which could yield raw statistical power to detect cell type- and transcription factor-specific allele-specific bindings.\nerx1 | Straightforward meta-analysis of the allele-specific bindings has two major limitations. First, many ChIP-Seq data sets are obtained in aneuploid cell lines, and copy-number variants are common even for normal diploid cells. Both the chromosome multiplication and local copy-number variants affect the expected read coverage of the respective genomic regions and bring about imbalanced read counts at single-nucleotide variants, possibly generating false-positive allele-specific binding calls. There exist strategies to reduce this bias (Supplementary Table 2), in particular, the known copy-number variant regions can be filtered out or predicted from a computational analysis of the corresponding genomic DNA (which is often used as the ChIP-Seq control sample) and incorporated in statistical criteria when evaluating the potential allele-specific binding calls. However, in many published experiments, the input DNA data control was omitted in favor of other controls, such as preimmune immunoglobulin G, or had a limited sequencing depth making it useless for copy-number variant predictions. Furthermore, currently, there are no systematic data on global (chromosome duplications) and local (copy-number variants) structural variations across all cell types with public ChIP-Seq data on transcription factors. Even when the external data on structural variation are available for particular cells, it is not guaranteed that the same estimates would\nb3bt | be valid for ChIP-Seq data obtained elsewhere, since long-cultivated immortalized cell lines might keep accumulating unreported differences in genome dosage across chromosomes.\n0w8m | The second major problem in allele-specific binding calling is the so-called reference read mapping bias. Standard read alignment tools generally map more reads to the alleles present in the reference genome assembly, as such mapping has lower or no mismatch penalties. To account for the reference read mapping bias, an ideal scenario involves mapping to individually reconstructed genomes or computational simulations that provide estimates of mapping probabilities to alternative alleles separately for each single-nucleotide variant (see Supplementary Table 2 for an overview). Yet, these solutions are not applicable to premade read alignments (which are usually obtained with a simple reference genome) and hardly applicable to understudied cell types or particular samples that do not provide enough data to reconstruct an individual genome.\nvcu3 | In this work, we present a novel framework for allele-specific binding calling from existing read alignments or premade variant calls, accounting for the allelic dosage of aneuploidy and copy-number variants, and read mapping bias. With this framework, we have performed a comprehensive meta-analysis to identify allele-specific bindings in the human ChIP-Seq data from the GTRD database. The database of Allelic Dosage-corrected Allele-Specific human Transcription factor binding sites (ADASTRA) provides allele-specific binding events across six hundred seventy-four human transcription factors (including epigenetic factors) and three hundred thirty-seven cell types. We demonstrate that the single-nucleotide polymorphisms with allele-specific bindings often overlap expression quantitative trait loci and exhibit associations with various normal and pathologic traits. A comparison of data for multiple transcription factors highlights the cases where different transcription factors preferentially bind to different alleles, i.e., when a single-nucleotide substitution can change an entry point of the involved regulatory pathway. Finally, we discuss selected cases where the allele-specific binding at single-nucleotide polymorphisms reveals molecular mechanisms of associations between single-nucleotide polymorphisms and important medical phenotypes.\nhjzj | Results",
