You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

89ub | Glutamate receptors, which bind glutamate as their ligand, have primarily been studied for their roles in the central nervous system but are becoming increasingly implicated in cancer57,58. A pan-cancer analysis of somatic mutation patterns revealed a number of significantly mutated GPCRs, including GRM842. In another case, a GPCR-targeted mutation analysis of melanomas revealed that GPR98 (mentioned above) and GRM3, a metabotropic glutamate receptor, were the most frequently mutated genes59. Expression of patient-derived GRM3 mutants in melanoma cell lines significantly increased anchorage-independent cell proliferation, as well as cell migration in vitro and in vivo metastatic rate59 (Figure 1). Similarly, ectopic expression of GRM1 and GRM5 have been found to induce spontaneous formation of melanoma in transgenic mouse models suggesting a role for GRMs in driving melanoma initiation60-62. Glutamate and other amino acid- binding GPCRs, such as the taste receptors TAS1R1, and TAS1R3, can also act as nutrient sensors that survey the tumor microenvironment and extracellular milieu to assess nutrient availability. Under times of nutrient stress or deprivation, these GPCRs can regulate the activation of autophagic programs that enable cancer cells to persist63,64.
dhle | One of the most prominent GPCRs implicated in neoplastic growth is the Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) receptor (TSHR). TSHR is coupled primarily to Gas and to a lesser extent Gaq, and is a key regulator of thyroid cell function, growth and hormone metabolism65. Mutations in TSHR have been found to lead to numerous thyroid diseases, including hyper- and hypo- thyroidism and hyperfunctioning thyroid adenomas66. Strikingly, activating mutations in TSHR are the predominant cause of solitary toxic thyroid adenomas, accounting for roughly 60-80% of all cases, and are found in roughly 30% of thyroid adenomas among other cancers67,68. Aligned with this, activating mutations in GNAS and TSHR are commonly found in differentiated thyroid carcinomas67,69,70 (Figure 1).
2nib | TSHR and other hormone GPCRs, such as G-protein coupled estrogen receptor (GPER1, also known as GPR30), luteinizing hormone receptor (LHR), follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR), gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor (GNRHR), and their cognate hormone ligands, are known to play multiple roles in modulating the tumor microenvironment and promoting tumor proliferation particularly for cancers with hormonal involvement such as thyroid, breast, ovarian, and prostate cancers. Indeed, prostate cancer induced by injection of testosterone was one of the earliest indications that hormone dynamics could control the initiation of cancer71.
naev | Estrogen for example, is a hormone involved in many aspects of normal physiology and has been well-studied in the context of breast and ovarian cancers. Concomitant to the transcriptional
7h0h | actions of classical estrogen receptors (ERs), GPER has been shown to mediate both transcriptional and rapid signal transduction events upon estrogen binding, activating the EGFR/MAPK pathways and resulting in the activation of c-fos regulated transcriptional networks in multiple tissue types72,73. Interestingly, GPER has been shown to cooperate with ERa to promote mitogenic effects in a cell-context dependent manner, highlighting the multifaceted nature of estrogen signalling in cancer74. Evista (raloxifene), which is FDA approved for the prevention of breast cancer in post-menopausal women, targets ERs, while also modulating GPER activity. Other hormone-binding GPCRs have been successfully targeted in oncology, including the gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor (GnRH). Degarelix, a well-tolerated GnRH antagonist, has been used for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer by rapidly suppressing levels of gonadotropins, testosterone, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in patients75. The profound efficacy of degarelix as a first-line monotherapy for the management of prostate cancer is a remarkable testament to the druggability of GPCRs and their use in oncotherapy.
a64c | Another seven-transmembrane receptor frequently mutated in cancer is Smoothened (SMO), which drives activation of the transcription factor GLI76,77. SMO is negatively regulated by the twelve-transmembrane receptor patched (PTCH); however, this inhibition is relieved upon binding of PTCH to hedgehog family members, including sonic hedgehog (SHH)76. Mutations that result in the activation of the PTCH-SMO-SHH signalling axis have been found to drive sporadic basal cell carcinomas (BCCs)78,79 (Figure 1). As of yet, the potential role of heterotrimeric G proteins in the signalling capacity of SMO have not been fully clarified77. Studies have found that in some cell contexts, Gai and Ga12 are involved in activation of the pathway; however, the dependency of SMO on G protein coupling for its roles in cancer initiation and progression is not well understood and requires further investigation80-82.
gi7n | The Frizzled family of seven-transmembrane receptors (FZDs) are also heavily involved in cancer, as transducers of the Wnt signalling cascade83. Wnt signalling can drive the activation of several transcriptional networks, primarily ß-catenin and has been described to play a role in numerous cancer types, with emphasis in colorectal cancer83,84. Indeed, the Frizzled family of GPCRs is collectively mutated in >15% of colon adenocarcinomas in TCGA (Figure 1, Table S2). FZD6 in particular is significantly mutated in colon adenocarcinoma (MutSig2CV q-value = 0.05) (Table S3). There is mounting evidence supporting the G protein coupling of Frizzleds as a critical component of the Wnt signalling pathway85-87. For example, inhibition of Goo and Gaq has been found to disrupt Wnt-mediated stabilization of ß-catenin and teratocarcinoma stem-cell
