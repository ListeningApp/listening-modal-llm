Are you going to tell him he's not going to be able to buy his pregnant wife and newborn food? Are you going to pay his mortgage for him?\" I was seething.\n7cdl | \"Sir-\" he began again, with unphased apathy, just trying to deliver the news.\n8mej | \"It's not yours to take.\" My aggression was quickly turning into desperation. \"Shit, just send me half so I can pay my employees,\" I pleaded \"It's Christmas Eve for fuck's sake.\"\nmlec | \"Sir, we're going to be holding onto the entirety of your funds for the next six months per your agreement . . . \" The voice faded into the distance.\nllys | Fuck.\nrmu5 | I hung up and checked my accounts. Twenty-three thousand, thirty-six dollars.\n3o98 | I owed my salesman a twenty-two thousand dollar commission check for one hundred twenty thousand dollars in sales I never got. Without wanting to give myself the opportunity to think about it, I wired it to him.\nzd6z | Balance, one thousand thirty-six dollars. Fuck\nk1a2 | Good evening December twenty, twenty sixteen\nnlu6 | I screenshotted this image of my bank account because I knew I would tell this story some day.\nsiqn | The sunlight blinded me as we emerged from the matinee. Families shuffled in and out through the revolving doors, making their happy memories. I was in a daze. Leila led me to the car, her hand wrapped firmly around mine.\n2ae7 | \"What's wrong? What happened?\" she asked.\nu9wd | \"The money isn't coming.\"\n6i0o | \"What do you mean?\" she asked. \"It's delayed?\"\n54u3 | I exhaled in defeat. \"They are keeping it all.\"\n1x9z | \"Can they do that !? \"\n4235 | \"Apparently,\" I said stoically, trying to maintain my composure in front of her parents.\n8xlb | \"What are you gonna do about the commissions?\"\nj21f | \"I already paid him. Everything.\" I said it without looking at her.\njftb | Leila's concern turned to dread.\ngj9e | We sat in silence the whole way home. I stared out the window. She held my hand in hers. It was more comforting than I anticipated. We'll get through this.\n12a1 | Thirty days earlier . . .\nucuv | I had decided to go all in on this new business I called \"Gym Launch.\" Here was the idea: I would fly around the country to gyms and fill them up to full capacity using this new methodology that hinged on an offer I had perfected when I owned my chain of gyms.\n2tn9 | Leading up to this moment, I had sold five of my six gyms. The funds from selling them, my life's work, I had put into an account I had with a new partner. This money was supposed to be the seed money for our new company.\n0g39 | I was finally going to realize some level of success.\n3qn6 | My alarm went off. I groggily swung my arm over blindly clawing at the bedside table. I switched off the alarm, while Leila managed to sleep through the commotion.\n65yq | I laid there silently, pulling up the bank accounts - a daily ritual. The balance said three hundred dollars.\np4rq | Wait. That couldn't be right. There was forty-six thousand dollars in here yesterday.\n33o8 | My adrenaline surged. Looking closer I saw negative forty-five thousand, seven hundred dollars payment successful. I was frantic.\nfopo | The money from selling all of my gyms was gone. I checked where the money went. To my \"partner.\" He had taken all the money out.\nb12h | Fuck.\nvk7m | The last four years of my life had vanished that fast. I officially had nothing, and even less to show for it. No gyms. No equipment. No employees. Nothing.\n39f8 | I felt dead inside.\nupcg | Adding insult to injury, in that same thirty-day period, my mother was in critical condition because of a near fatal accident (and was still under twenty-four-hour supervision), and I had totaled my car in a head-on collision at sixty miles per hour and earned a D U I as my consolation prize.\nqzb9 | This was the cherry on top. My one saving grace during this time was selling a new \"challenge offer\" at a gym and collecting all the cash up front as my \"fee\" for turning their business around.\nacan | So I did the only thing I knew. I sold. My salesman had done one hundred twenty thousand dollars in a single month, and I owed him a twenty-two thousand dollar commission check.\nj623 | The problem was the one hundred twenty thousand dollars never came.\nd7ly | \"We need to talk,\" I said as Leila and I went into the other room. I worked up the courage to speak but stared at the floor, embarrassed.\nplf9 | \"I've got nothing,\" I said to her. \"I'm a sinking ship, and you don't have to stay with me.\"\nvk11 | She grabbed my chin and pulled my face towards hers so she could look into my eyes: \"I would sleep with you under a bridge if it came to that.\" I would have cried tears of joy, but I was so emotionally exhausted my response appeared apathetic.\njj0l | I wouldn't stay with me.\nqdqt | \"Are we still gonna do these launches starting tomorrow?\" She asked. \"All my friends quit their jobs to do this.\" She was being matter of fact, but it still stung. I felt defeated. \"Listen, this could go horribly wrong, \"\n6h7m | \"I trust you. We'll figure it out.\"\nb6vb | I had two things left at that point: a grand slam offer and an old business credit card with a one hundred thousand dollar limit from when I had my gyms.\nc5h2 | On the day after Christmas (two days after the gut-wrenching call with the payment processor) we were scheduled to launch six new gyms . . . at the same time. Between airfare, hotels, rental cars, gas, and ad spend (all multiplied by six), I was going to be spending three thousand three hundred dollars per day of money I didn't have. My last dollar had gone to paying my salesman. I still remember my hand shaking as the advertisements went live: off to on.\neccu | Just like that, I was going into debt at a rate of four hundred twelve dollars per working hour. Just like that, three thousand three hundred dollars per day began getting deducted from my account.\nrtpq | Negative three thousand three hundred dollars . . . I now officially have nothing\npo9y | Negative three thousand three hundred dollars . . . I now have officially less than nothing\nw5lk | Negative three thousand three hundred dollars . . . I have ten thousand dollars less than nothing\npb48 | Negative three thousand three hundred dollars . . . This one decision is going to ruin my future forever.\nnriw | But things started shaping up. Here's what happened that month (January twenty seventeen), as documented by my old processing records I dug up. You can see the month along the left column and the revenue collected that month along the right.\nh7kb | Refunds\n2mrs | We made one hundred thousand one hundred seventeen dollars! It was just enough to cover the three thousand three hundred dollars per day that had been coming off the credit card. It was actually working. I could hardly believe it. I threw the hail mary, and the universe caught it. I went from looking up bankruptcy lawyers to figuring out what to do with three million dollars in profits, accrued within the first twelve months. It felt surreal. And in hindsight, it still kind of does.\nf7it | By the end of the year we were doing one million five hundred thousand dollars per month. Twelve months from then, four million four hundred thousand dollars per month. Per. Month. Twenty-four months after that, we crossed one hundred twenty million dollars in sales, donated two million dollars to help fund equal opportunity in low-income areas. We met and befriended Arnold Schwarzenegger (lifelong hero) and were asked to be board members of his charity After School All Stars.\no9jm | CLASSIC",
