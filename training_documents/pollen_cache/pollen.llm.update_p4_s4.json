Normally this will be aided by the animal being a good physical fit in terms of size and shape, so that in alighting on the flower surface, or when inserting its tongue or beak of appropriate length, some specific part of its body touches the anther. Additionally pollen pickup and carriage will be aided if the animal has appropriate surface structures; pollen adheres well to feathers, fur, and hairy or scaly surfaces in insects but does not get transported well on shiny or waxy surfaces (and may even be damaged by certain surface secretions). Hence a small shiny beetle taking some nectar by crawling into the lower surface of a large tubular corolla where the anthers are in the corolla roof may well be a regular visitor to that flower but is unlikely to be an effective mover of its pollen; in effect, it is acting as a \"cheat\" as far as the flower is concerned and may be termed an illegitimate visitor.\ncb7r | Behavioral Factors\n68xu | Different animals land on and forage at flowers in very different fashions. There are many aspects of behavior that will affect whether a given animal is going to be a good pollinator. Pollinators will seldom have a complete perception of all the aspects of plant presentation mentioned above, but they will respond to at least some of them in ways that are useful to the plant:\nhd35 | One. Their choices of places and times to visit, and exactly which flowers to visit, will be critical. Visits occurring before dehiscence (the splitting of the anthers to reveal the pollen) or after pollen depletion are normally of no value to the flower in fulfilling its male role, and visits before or after the stigma is receptive to incoming pollen are of no value to the flower in its female role.\n2zpk | Two. Their handling of the flowers affect their pollen pickup and deposition characteristics; ideally they should receive pollen at a specific site on their bodies, and one that is also a good site for subsequent deposition of that pollen onto a stigma.\nepu7 | Three. Their handling time per flower affects how many flowers are visited in a given time.\n7od1 | Four. Their speed and directionality of movement between plants affect pollen dispersal.\n0bqy | Five. They should not be too efficient at grooming off the pollen, or indeed at eating it.\nb780 | Six. Their flower constancy, that is, the likelihood that they will move to another flower of the same species, is perhaps most critical. If they innately or by learning prefer a particular flower phenotype, their high constancy will usually ensure that they move neatly and sequentially among conspecific flowers, not wasting pollen by depositing it in the wrong species. Constancy to a flower (considered in detail in chapter eleven) gives economies to the visitor also; it may minimize travel distances, handling times, and learning effort and maximize pollen packing.\nccmb | Behavioral factors such as these are often the key to being a good pollinator and of course are affected by the animals' abilities to learn as they become more experienced as foragers. The ability to form a search image or to respond consistently to other cues, associating particular signals with the presence of food, hones their foraging ability and can cement their relationships with particular flowers. Hence later chapters of this book, in considering particular groups of animals that visit flowers, include careful consideration of their sensory and learning capacities.\nma93 | Physiological Factors\nc6hh | Animals have differing physiological strategies and constraints, and these too can affect their energetic needs and thence their flower-visiting patterns, as will be discussed in chapter ten. Most animals (including nearly all invertebrates, and therefore many of the insect flower visitors) lack elaborate internal physiological regulatory systems, and their thermal balance and water balance are strongly influenced by environmental conditions. They cannot function if they are too hot or too cold or are short of water, and must forage in times and places that provide suitable microclimates, using the sun's radiation to warm up by basking, or shady places to cool down again, and seeking (usually) sites that are relatively humid. However, birds and bats are physiologically more sophisticated and can regu-\ny7ea | late their body temperature and water balance more precisely; they generate heat internally through their own metabolism (endothermy) and regulate their own body fluids with efficient skin exchanges, respiratory controls, and excretory organs. They can in principle forage at almost any time and in any habitat, though they may still conserve their own energy by picking more equable sites.\nnav4 | The distinction does not lie exactly between the vulnerable invertebrates and the highly regulated birds and mammals, however. It is now clear that a rather small proportion of insects can also show endothermy, at least some of the time when they need to warm up in the absence of solar inputs (chapter ten); this applies especially to most bees, a few hoverflies, some large moths, and some beetles, occurring more sporadically in other groups. It is perhaps no coincidence that endothermic abilities in insects are most common in the flower-visiting groups, which have access to ready fuel supplies in the form of nectar but which may also need to compete for that nectar in the cool of early mornings or at dusk.\ngem8 | Given the list of factors that can turn a visitor into a good pollinator, two obvious points should emerge:\ne8nr | One. A great many of the animals that go to flowers for a short drink of nectar may be rather poor at pollinating that flower. Those with a poor physical fit, those that cheat, and those with little or no flower constancy are likely to be especially ineffective.\nk78w | Two. Of all the visitors, bees are likely to be especially good as pollinators. They rely solely on flowers for food, both as adults and as larvae, and so must visit more flowers than any other animals. Their sizes, hairy surfaces, and variably long tongues, their excellent learning abilities, communication systems and floral constancy, and their endothermic capacities all equip them to visit flowers efficiently (from their own perspective) and effectively (from the plant's point of view). Although they are sometimes described as pollen wasters (because they, or rather their offspring back at the nest, eat so much of the pollen that they pick up), they are by far the most important pollinators in most ecosystems, and they do achieve high pollen export from visited flowers; plants have adapted over evolutionary time to make\ng9du | best use of them by providing more than enough pollen to cater for their needs and ensure that sufficient pollen still commonly reaches other flowers.\nf682 | Five. Costs, Benefits, and Conflicts in Animal Pollination\nli1k | Plants with hermaphrodite flowers benefit greatly because a single animal visit can allow both pickup of pollen and its deposition on a stigma, fulfilling both the male and female functions of that flower at the same time. Animals benefit greatly by finding easily acquired foods, both sugary (nectar) and often also proteinaceous (pollen). Pollination by animals may therefore be a mutualism, of benefit to both participants, but it is not altruistic; for the animals, pollination of the flowers they forage at is almost always just an irrelevant by-product. In fact the plant and animal have a conflict of interest, often with adaptation and counteradaptation going on from both sides through evolutionary time to try and get a bigger share of the benefits. So the situations that we see now are the end products of the long and sometimes quite duplicitous associations of flowers with animals.\n```",
