You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

nv42 | In summary, there is growing body of evidence showing that creatine supplementation, particularly when combined with exercise, provides musculoskel- etal and performance benefits in older adults.
xags | Is creatine only useful for resistance / power type activities?
jc47 | Although creatine supplementation has been theorized to primarily benefit athletes involved in high-intensity intermittent resistance/power type activities, there is a growing body of evidence suggesting that creatine sup- plementation may also provide beneficial effects for other activities. For example, creatine supplementation with carbohydrate [123] or carbohydrate and protein [124] has been reported to promote greater muscle glycogen storage than carbohydrate supplementation alone. Since glycogen replenishment is important for promoting recovery and preventing overtraining during intensified training periods [2, 125], creatine supplemen- tation may help athletes who deplete large amounts of glycogen during training and/or performance (i.e., sport- ing events) to maintain optimal glycogen levels. Second, there is evidence that creatine supplementation may re- duce muscle damage and/or enhance recovery from in- tense exercise. For example, Cooke and colleagues [126]
ko3c | Antonio et al. Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition
xek3 | reported that creatine supplementation during recovery from exercise-induced muscle damage promoted less muscle enzyme efflux and better maintenance of isokin- etic muscle performance. Moreover, there is evidence that individuals supplementing their diet with creatine experienced less muscle damage, inflammation, and muscle soreness in response to running 30-km [127] as well as during 4-weeks of intensified training [70]. Con- sequently, creatine supplementation may help athletes recover from intense exercise and/or tolerate intensified periods of training to a greater degree. Third, there is evidence that athletes who supplement with creatine during training experience fewer musculoskeletal injur- ies, accelerated recovery time from injury [78, 128] and less muscle atrophy after immobilization [129, 130]. Whether this is due to a greater resistance to injury and/ or ability to recover from injury remains unclear. Fourth, creatine supplementation (with or without glycerol) has been reported to help athletes hyper-hydrate and thereby enhance tolerance to exercise in the heat [28, 37, 131- 145]. Therefore, creatine supplementation may reduce the risk of heat related-illness when athletes train and/or compete in hot and humid environments [72, 146]. Fi- nally, there is evidence from animal models that creatine supplementation is neuroprotective [147-149] and can reduce the severity of spinal cord injury [150, 151], cere- bral ischemia [152-155], and concussion/traumatic brain injury [2, 7, 12, 22, 32, 33, 156]. This evidence was so compelling that the International Society of Sports Nu- trition recommended that athletes engaged in sports that have a potential for concussion and/or spinal cord injury take creatine for its neuroprotective effects [2]. Thus, there are a number of reasons beyond the ergogenic benefit that all types of athletes may benefit.
bbpr | In summary, there is a variety of athletic events, not just resistance/power activities, which may benefit from creatine supplementation.
5zyf | Is creatine only effective for males?
9own | Creatine kinetics may vary between healthy males and fe- males [157]. Females may have higher intramuscular cre- atine concentrations [158] possibly due to lower skeletal muscle mass [159]. Potentially, the higher resting intra- muscular creatine concentration in females (based on the upper limit of intramuscular creatine storage) may help explain some research showing diminished responsiveness and/or performance effects on females [160, 161].
bqfb | As a result of hormone-driven changes in endogenous creatine synthesis, creatine transport, and creatine kinase (CK) kinetics, creatine bioavailability throughout various stages of female reproduction is altered, highlighting the potential positive implications for creatine supplementa- tion in females [29]. The implications of hormone-related

5vqw | changes in creatine kinetics has been largely overlooked in performance-based studies [29]. Specifically, creatine sup- plementation may be of particular importance during menses, pregnancy, post-partum, perimenopause and postmenopause. Creatine kinase, as well as enzymes asso- ciated with creatine synthesis, are influenced by estrogen and progesterone [1]. Creatine kinase levels are signifi- cantly elevated during menstruation [162], with CK levels decreasing throughout the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, and with age. The lowest range of CK values have been reported during early pregnancy (20 weeks or less), equating to about half the concentration found at peak levels (teenage girls) [162, 163].
meyw | Maternal creatine supplementation during pregnancy in pre-clinical animal studies have demonstrated a pro- tective effect against fetal death and organ damage asso- ciated with intrapartum hypoxia [164, 165]. Reduced creatine levels in late pregnancy have also been associ- ated with low fetal growth [165]. There is additional data that metabolic demand from the placenta during gesta- tion further lowers the creatine pool of the mother [166], which may be associated with low birth weight and pre-term birth. Creatine supplementation during pregnancy has been shown to enhance neuronal cell up- take of creatine and support mitochondrial integrity in animal offspring, thereby reducing brain injury induced by intrapartum asphyxia [167, 168]. Although there are no human studies evaluating the effects of creatine sup- plementation during pregnancy, creatine could provide a safe, low-cost nutritional interventional for reducing intra- and post-partum complications associated with cellular energy depletion [169]. This may be more im- portant if the female is vegetarian, or unable to consume meat due to nausea or taste preferences (i.e. meat con- tains about 0.7 g of creatine/6 oz serving [54];).
2e62 | Females have been reported to have lower levels of creatine in the brain (frontal lobe) [170]. Increasing cre- atine concentrations in the brain as a result of supple- mentation, particularly in females, may support the reported benefits of reducing symptoms of depression [171, 172] and ameliorating the effects of traumatic brain injury [12, 22]. Depression is about 2 times higher among females throughout the reproductive years [173] and accelerates around pubertal hormonal changes [174]. Altered brain bioenergetics and mitochondrial dysfunction have been linked with depression, particu- larly as it relates to CK, ATP, and inorganic phosphate (Pi). Creatine supplementation has been shown to sig- nificantly augment cerebral PCr and Pi [175], particularly in females. The increase in cerebral PCr from 10 g of creatine supplementation was reported to be inversely related to symptoms of depression in adolescent females resistant to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [171] It appears that creatine supplementation may be

s2g2 | effective for supporting creatine kinetics, mood, and pregnancy/fetal outcomes.
q1q2 | There is a small body of research that has investigated the effects of creatine supplementation in younger fe- males. For example, Vandenberghe et al. [176] showed that creatine supplementation (20 g/day for 4 days followed by 5 g/day thereafter) during 10 weeks of resist- ance training significantly increased intramuscular con- centrations, muscle mass and strength compared to placebo in females (19-22 yrs). In elite female soccer players <LATEX>\left( 2 2 \pm 5 \mathrm { y r s } \right) ,</LATEX> creatine supplementation (20 g/day for 6 days) improved sprint and agility performance compared to placebo [177]. Hamilton et al. [178] showed that creatine supplementation (25 g for 7 days) aug- mented upper-body exercise capacity in strength-trained females (21-33 yrs) compared to placebo (19-29 yrs). Furthermore, in college-aged females (20 yrs), creatine supplementation (0.5 <LATEX>\mathrm { g / k } \xi</LATEX> of fat-free mass for 5 days) improved knee extension muscle performance compared to placebo [179]. In contrast, not all data show improved performance in females [89, 160, 161]. Additionally, Smith-Ryan et al. [180] reported no significant effects of creatine loading on neuromuscular properties of fatigue in young adult females. It is important to evaluate the benefit to risk ratio; as noted elsewhere in this docu- ment, there are minimal risks associated with creatine supplementation, particularly when it is evaluated against the potential benefits in females.
cb7r | Accumulating research over the past decade in post- menopausal females demonstrates that creatine supple- mentation during a resistance training program can improve muscle mass, upper- and lower-body strength, and tasks of functionality (30-s chair stand, lying prone- to-stand test, arm curl test) (for detailed review see Candow et al. [9]). Creatine supplementation appears to be a viable option for post-menopausal females to im- prove muscle quality and performance. In addition to its beneficial effects on aging muscle, creatine supplementa- tion may also have favorable effects on bone in postmen- opausal females, if combined with resistance training. For example, postmenopausal females who supple- mented daily with 0.1 g/kg/day of creatine during 52- weeks of supervised whole-body resistance training experienced an attenuation in the rate of bone mineral loss at the femoral neck (hip), compared to females on placebo during training [122]. Furthermore, 5 g/day of creatine supplementation during 12 weeks of resistance training in postmenopausal females resulted in a signifi- cant increase in muscle mass and upper- and lower- body strength, compared to placebo [181]. However, even without the stimulus of resistance training, there is some evidence that creatine supplementation can still be beneficial. For example, in aging females <LATEX>\left( n = 1 0 ; \right.</LATEX> 67 ± 6 yrs), acute creatine supplementation (0.3 g/kg/day

2zpk | for 7 days) significantly improved lower-extremity physical performance (sit-to-stand test) [110], and fat- free mass and upper- and lower-body strength com- pared to placebo [86].
epu7 | In summary, there is accumulating evidence that creatine supplementation has the potential to be a multifactorial therapeutic intervention across the lifespan in females, with little to no side effects.
7od1 | Are other forms of creatine similar or superior to monohydrate and is creatine stable in solutions/ beverages?
0bqy | Creatine monohydrate powder has been the most exten- sively studied and commonly used form of creatine in dietary supplements since the early 1990s [2, 125]. Cre- atine monohydrate was used in early studies to assess bioavailability, determine proper dosages, and assess the impact of oral ingestion of creatine on blood creatine and intramuscular creatine stores [35, 60, 182]. These studies indicated that orally ingested creatine monohy- drate (e.g., 3-5 g/day) increases blood concentrations of creatine for 3-4 hours after ingestion thereby facilitating the uptake of creatine into tissue through diffusion and creatine transporters [1, 183, 184]. Additionally, it is well established that ~99% of orally ingested creatine mono- hydrate is either taken up by tissue or excreted in the urine as creatine through normal digestion [60, 185, 186]. Short-term loading with creatine monohydrate (e.g., consuming 5 g, 4 times daily for 5-7 days) has been reported to increase intramuscular creatine stores by 20-40% and exercise performance capacity by 5-10% [2, 125]. Creatine monohydrate supplementation during training (e.g., 5-25 g/day for 4-12 weeks) has been re- ported to promoted gains in muscle mass, strength, and exercise capacity [2, 125]. Despite the known efficacy, safety, and low cost of creatine monohydrate; a number of different forms of creatine have been marketed as more effective with fewer anecdotally reported adverse effects [187]. These marketing efforts have fueled specu- lation that creatine monohydrate is not the most effect- ive or safest form of creatine to consume. This notion is clearly refuted by understanding the well-known physio- chemical properties of creatine monohydrate, as well as current creatine supplementation literature.
b780 | A number of different forms of creatine (e.g., creatine salts, creatine complexed with other nutrients, creatine dipeptides, etc.) have been marketed as more effective sources of creatine than creatine monohydrate [187]. However, there are no peer-reviewed published papers showing that the ingestion of equal amounts of creatine salts [188-191] or other forms of creatine like efferves- cent creatine [128], creatine ethyl ester [43, 192, 193],
ccmb | Antonio et al. Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition
ma93 | buffered creatine [41], creatine nitrate [194, 195], creatine dipeptides, or the micro amounts of creatine contained in creatine serum [196] and beverages (e.g., 25-50 mg) in- creases creatine storage in muscle to a greater degree than creatine monohydrate [187]. In fact, most studies show that ingestion of these other forms have less physiological impact than creatine monohydrate on intramuscular cre- atine stores and/or performance and that any performance differences were more related to other nutrients that cre- atine is bound to or co-ingested with in supplement for- mulations. This makes sense given that these other forms contain less creatine per gram than creatine monohydrate and that 99% of ingested creatine monohydrate is absorbed into the blood, then taken up into muscle, or ex- creted in urine [187].
