Aside from lacking a broadly agreed-upon definition for SES, much of this gap relates to the methodological pluralism that characterizes the field. Methodological pluralism creates challenges for synthesis and data comparison, in part because it is more difficult to know what methods can and should be used in research. Lack of methodological transparency hampers attempts to generalize across case studies and frameworks, and can prove particularly challenging for postgraduate students and other early-career researchers. Understanding and interrogating methods used in the SES field is also important because of the nature of the systems being investigated. There is increasing agreement that SES can be conceptualized as complex adaptive systems, which place demands on the approaches and methods that SES researchers employ, and necessitates an understanding and interrogation of the methods used in the field.\ntb74 | We thus expand on recent reviews of the development of the SES field, focusing specifically on the methods used in empirical, place-based SES research. We define methods as codified ways of producing knowledge of a focus of interest, a specific information-generating practice. By having a clearer idea of the range of methods that SES researchers are using when engaging in real-world problem-solving or solution-based research, we can improve our characterization of SES research as a field of inquiry, and also help guide researchers new to the field in identifying and selecting appropriate research methods.\n8l69 | We used a systematic review approach to conduct a broad analysis of the different terms being used to study coupled social and ecological systems and characterize these studies according to their type, distinguishing place-based studies from studies that outline \"frameworks\" and \"reviews.\" Focusing on a subset of place-based research, we then identified the journals, institutions, and countries in which SES have been studied, and how these have changed over time. Having broadly contextualized SES research, we identified a large set of methods used in place-based research,\n1jyv | and explored the topics or problems they have most commonly sought to investigate. We summarized the methods into categories, providing a typology that can serve as a guide to the range of methods used in SES research.\nolce | Our positioning in this paper centers around the conceptualizations of SES as complex adaptive systems. In this realm, recent progress has been made in moving toward a cohesive, theoretically derived definition of SES research. They offer a typology of six underlying organizing principles of complex adaptive systems that characterize the various features and properties of such systems. This typology can be used to recognize and assess the demands that complex adaptive systems make on the methods that SES researchers employ. A final goal of this paper was thus to relate the list of method categories to these underlying principles of complex adaptive systems through an exploratory assessment of how well different method categories account for core features of complex adaptive systems.\nerx1 | METHODS\nb3bt | Systematic reviews are synthesis-based approaches that have in common the aim to build new knowledge from a rigorous analysis of existing research findings. Regardless of their aim, systematic reviews follow a strict protocol to maximize transparency and repeatability while minimizing bias. The systematic review process can be summarized as: formulating a question, generating a protocol, systematic selection, critical appraisal of results, data extraction, data synthesis, and reporting and dissemination.\n0w8m | Defining a search strategy and predocument selection\nvcu3 | After situating our study in the conceptual framework outlined in the introduction and defining our study questions, we conducted a first exploratory search in Google Scholar and Scopus databases. We used the search terms \"social-ecological,\" \"coupled human,\" \"SES,\" \"CHANS,\" \"coupled human-environment,\" and \"social relations to nature.\" We found that the acronyms \"CHANS\" and \"SES\" produced a lot of noise in our results, and subsequently dropped these from our search. During this exploratory phase, we discovered several additional terms that identified studies dealing with human-nature interactions, and included them in subsequent searches. The final terms used in our systematic review were: \"social-ecological,\" \"socio-ecological,\" \"human environment,\" \"human-environment,\" \"affective ecology,\" \"social-environmental,\" \"socio-environmental,\" \"human-nature relation,\" \"coupled human,\" \"human-earth relation,\" \"environment relation,\" \"human-environment,\" \"man-environment relation,\" \"eco-social,\" and \"nature-society relation.\"\nhjzj | Document selection\nj79f | Document selection was based on a key word search in Scopus, limited to the title, abstract, and key words. We chose Scopus because of its extensive and interdisciplinary coverage and high recognition as a standardized database for conducting meta-analyses. Our first search, using the final key words above to search all journals in the Scopus database over all\n6tbv | years, yielded over twenty thousand documents. This included results from the mental health, engineering, and information technology literature, which were not relevant to our study. We thus removed results with the key words \"adolescent,\" \"male\" and \"female,\"\nxb13 | \"middle aged,\" \"aged,\" and \"child\" because these were associated with social-ecological critical theory in psychology, which is different from the SES focus of this article. We also restricted the search to the subject areas of environmental science, social\ncxqi | science, agricultural and biological science, Earth and planetary science, economics, econometrics and finance, energy, \"multidisciplinary,\" and decision sciences. We excluded environmental education because the overlaps with the health and psychological literature produced a lot of nonrelevant studies. Further, we restricted our search to journals, books, and book series, and to publications in English, and items published or in press. Our final search, conducted on twenty-second July two thousand fifteen, yielded a result of five thousand two hundred twenty-two documents. In addition to the abstracts and (index and author) key words, we downloaded the year published, journals published in, number of citations, and the institutions and geographical locations of authors.\nqfmx | First screening and coding\nrut3 | The next step was to screen abstracts for inclusion or exclusion in the study. We characterized papers as follows:\nm3cp | · Review: a review of papers about SES, theoretical concepts, and/or frameworks;\nmq4s | · Framework: papers that explicitly proposed a framework for understanding SES;\n95el | · Framework and place-based: papers that proposed a framework, and also used this framework to analyze a place- based system;\n```",
