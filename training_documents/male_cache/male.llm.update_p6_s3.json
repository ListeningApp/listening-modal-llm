        "content": "twwy | i) An Overview of the Major Organs and Tracts in the Male Genitourinary System (Figure one): The genitourinary system of both males and females includes two kidneys, each with a ureter leading from the kidney to the urinary bladder, and one urethra. In both genders, the reproductive organs are closely aligned and included in this body system. In males, the reproductive organs and tract include two testes, two epididymites, two ductus deferens, one prostate gland, and two seminal vesicles, as well as the two ampullas and ejaculatory ducts leading from the ductus deferens to the prostate gland, and a single urethra through which both urine and semen flow. The urethra leads from the urinary bladder through the prostate gland through the penis to end at the urethral meatus or opening. The bulbourethral gland or Cowper's gland sits at the base of the prostate. The penile structures include the corpora cavernosa, corpora spongiosum, the penile shaft, glans penis, and the prepuce or foreskin.\nfyp8 | ii) Each of These Organs and Tracts Will Be Described in More Detail Below\nz994 | Two) THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE MALE REPRODUCTIVE TRACT: SEX DETERMINATION AND SEX DIFFERENTIATION: There are two processes that occur during the development of the gonads and the reproductive tract, its organs, and external genitalia. These processes are termed sex determination followed by sex differentiation.\nvvqn | a) Sex determination: During early embryogenesis for the first six weeks, there are no observable sexual differences between X X and X Y fetuses apart from their chromosomes. A urogenital ridge (the precursor of the adrenals, urinary, and genital systems) forms on the ventral side of the mesonephros and appears as a paired thickening of intermediate mesoderm, which will ultimately be composed of somatic and germ cells. For the genital ridge to form, there must be sufficient expression of two proteins, Wilms Tumor One (W T One) and S F One, an orphan nuclear receptor. S F One is a dosage-sensitive gene, and loss of a copy can induce sex reversal in X Y individuals. The primordial germ cells, cells derived from the proximal epiblast, migrate through the primitive streak into the extra-embryonic region at the base of the yolk sack by the fourth week of gestation. This migration is driven by the kit ligand signaling system (K I T L, also known as stem cell factor, steel factor, or mast cell growth factor) expressed in the gonadal ridge and hindgut along the pathway of migration.\np6xg | b) Testis Determination: In the nineteen forties a fascinating series of experiments by Dr. Alfred Jost showed that the presence of a testis during development drives the development of the internal and external genitalia along the male pathway. In the absence of any gonad, the internal reproductive tract and external genitalia develop along the female pathway.\nbppc | Four point six\nilnw | i) Male Sexual Determination: The Importance of the sex-determining region on the Y chromosome (S R Y), but sex determination is more complex than just one gene: S R Y is the testis-determining factor because it upregulates S O X nine gene expression and the transcription factor S O X nine is now considered by many to be the master testis determining factor. Thus, S R Y, which tilts the balance between testis and ovarian directing gene expression, is necessary but not sufficient for testis determination, and both the timing of expression and the level of expression are critical factors. S O X nine either succeeds in determining Sertoli cell differentiation or is silenced by other genes that enact ovarian differentiation—it is a true battle of the sexes! It is important to be aware that there are a number of genes that must be expressed during early fetal gonadal sexual differentiation to effectively elicit the development of a functional testis or ovary (Figure two). For the purposes of this course, the take-home message is that both S R Y and S O X nine actions are required for testis differentiation.\nf3rc | One) Sertoli cell differentiation requires the actions of not only S R Y, but also fibroblast growth factor nine (F G F nine), and cord formation is dependent on the basal lamina deposition between the Sertoli and peritubular myoid cells. These cords will form the seminiferous tubules.\nd7bx | Two) Leydig cell differentiation: the origin of the fetal Leydig cells is not clearly understood, but they are present at around eight weeks of gestation and begin to produce testosterone, which is needed for the maintenance of the wolffian ducts and masculinization of the external genitalia. At this time the Leydig cell is stimulated by placental H C G (first and second trimesters) and later by fetal pituitary L H. The Leydig cells also secrete insulin-like growth factor three (I N S L three) that is responsible for the first, transabdominal phase, of testicular descent.\ngx97 | Three) Germ cell differentiation: By the end of the fifth week of gestation, the germ cells have arrived at the genital ridge and proliferate. These germ cells are encompassed by the cells forming the seminiferous cords and differentiate into spermatogonial precursors but do not enter\nppkp | Four point seven\n8br6 | the meiotic pathway, unlike the events occurring in the fetal ovary during development. In the absence of germ cell migration to the genital ridge or lack of survival, the testis will continue to develop, unlike the fetal ovary which requires germ cell migration through meiosis (if this does not occur the follicular cells degenerate and streak gonads develop) (Figure three).\nde3k | One) The wolffian ducts are derived from the intermediate mesoderm and ultimately give rise to the kidney and the proximal male genital tract. As a result, when kidney development is abnormal it is likely that there are other malformations of the urinary and/or reproductive systems.\n2kb3 | Two) The müllerian ducts are derived from the coelomic epithelium and will later form to develop the Fallopian tubes, the ducts in the pelvic region fuse to give rise to the uterovaginal canal. In the female, the wolffian duct begins to regress at about two months of gestation.\nlqcx | Three) Regression of müllerian ducts and differentiation of the wolffian duct into the male accessory organs is a key element of male differentiation of the internal reproductive tract organs: The initial indication of male differentiation of the genital tract occurs in about fifty-five to sixty-day-old embryos. The müllerian duct first undergoes epithelial to Bipotential Gonad mesenchymal transformation and a wave of Genads apoptosis spreads along the müllerian duct. The connections between the mesonephric Müllerian Duct tubules and gonadal primordium are Male Hormones: Wolffian M I S Duct No Male established by week six of gestation and give Testosterone Hormones I N S L three rise to the rete testis. The wolffian duct survives and the upper part gives rise to the epididymis and, below that, the vas deferens.
