Many of America's best-known public companies began as VC-backed firms: Amazon.com, Apple, FedEx, Intel, Microsoft, and Starbucks, to name a few. Not\ndrm2 | CARROTS AND STICKS\n5yir | surprisingly, venture capital is considered to be an important contributor to economic growth in the United States and elsewhere.\n9jam | The steps in the venture capital cycle are by now familiar. A venture capital firm creates and raises capital for a limited-life fund. The VCs select portfolio companies for inclusion in the fund, investing in these companies through multiple rounds of financing. Along the way, the VCs advise and monitor the portfolio companies, sometimes replacing the companies' founders. Before the end of the fund's life, VCs \"exit\" from their investments in the portfolio companies and return capital to the fund's investors. The fund's investors can then recycle the returned capital into another venture capital fund.\n87dk | Venture exits usually take one of three forms: one, an initial public offering of the portfolio company's shares followed by the sale of the VC's shares into the public market; two, a \"trade sale\" of the company to another firm; or three, the dissolution and liquidation of the company. Of these three types of exits, initial public offerings have received the most scrutiny. This attention is\np084 | CARROTS AND STICKS\nfkh1 | not surprising. Initial public offering exits tend to involve the largest and most visible VC-backed firms. And, perhaps just as important, the initial public offering process triggers public-disclosure requirements under the securities laws, making data on initial public offering exits easily accessible to researchers.\nx2kw | But trade sales are actually much more common than initial public offerings and, in the aggregate, are likely to be almost as financially important to VCs. Indeed, in certain industries-like medical devices-and during certain periods-like the last decade, when the initial public offering market was tepid-trade sales are likely to be more important to VCs than initial public offerings. Unlike initial public offerings, however, trade sales do not trigger the securities laws' intense public-disclosure requirements; they instead take place in the shadows. Thus, although trade sales are important to the venture capital cycle, researchers know relatively little about them.\n3em5 | The purpose of this Article is to shine light on how VCs arrange to sell startups in trade sales. In particular, we seek to investigate how VCs induce the \"entrepreneurial team\"-the founder, other executives, and common shareholders-to go along with a trade sale that they might have an incentive to resist.\nizwm | We begin by describing the standard cash-flow and control rights that VCs receive when investing in startups. Turning first to cash-flow rights, we explain that VCs almost always invest through convertible preferred stock. In a trade-sale exit, VCs choose between retaining their preferred shares (and capturing most or all of the proceeds through their liquidation preferences) or\nj91z | CARROTS AND STICKS\nkd6e | converting the preferred shares into common shares. In an initial public offering, VCs (as a practical matter) must convert to common stock. Turning next to control rights, we explain that VCs seek board seats and shareholder-voting rights, in part to make it easier for them to exit and realize their cash-flow rights.\nf707 | We then explain why founders, executives, and common shareholders are more likely to oppose a trade-sale exit than an initial public offering exit. In an initial public offering, the founder (if still the CEO) can continue running the firm and will face less direct oversight as shareholdings become more diffuse. Other executives of an initial public offering firm can typically keep their jobs, also with less shareholder oversight than before. And the original common shareholders of the initial public offering firm generally do well; VCs would not push for an initial public offering exit unless the common shares-to which the VCs must convert in an initial public offering-have considerable value.\nmiy9 | By contrast, in a trade sale, the founder (if still the CEO) and other executives may lose their jobs or find themselves subject to more direct oversight as shareholdings become concentrated in the hands of a single shareholder (the acquirer). In other words, they become \"mere\" employees. And because VCs in trade sales often exit as preferred shareholders with liquidation preferences that must be paid in full before common shareholders receive any payout, common shareholders may receive little (if any) payout. At the same time, the sale eliminates any \"option value\" (upside potential) of the common stock held by the founder, other executives, and employees. For all these reasons, VCs pushing for a trade sale may face resistance from the entrepreneurial team, particularly when common shareholders receive very little.\nqq79 | Two points are worth emphasizing here. First, an entrepreneurial team resisting a trade sale may not necessarily believe that the startup has a reasonable chance of going public if it remains independent. Rather, team members may resist a trade sale today because they believe that, if the startup remains independent, there is a good chance that it can exit in the future via a more attractive trade sale-one that provides significantly better employment opportunities for the entrepreneurial team and more value for the common shareholders.\n3hol | CARROTS AND STICKS\nisaq | Second, there may be situations where the entrepreneurial team favors a trade sale opposed by the VCs. For example, the entrepreneurial team might wish to accept an offer that is personally lucrative but which provides only a modest return to the VCs. Thus, we do not claim that the entrepreneurial team will always oppose a trade sale. Rather, our claim is that there are likely many scenarios where VCs will favor a trade sale that the entrepreneurial team opposes.\no83p | After describing the entrepreneurial team's potential incentive to resist a trade sale, we then discuss the various strategies the team might use to impede the sale. The executives and common shareholders can impede a trade sale through their influence over the board, which must approve the transaction. The common shareholders can try to block the sale by exercising their voting rights or by threatening litigation. Finally, the executives can refuse to cooperate in the sale process or, if the acquisition requires their continued participation in the enterprise, refuse to commit to such participation.\nb1oj | Next, we identify the various bribes (carrots) and coercive tools (sticks) that VCs can use to induce a reluctant entrepreneurial team to support, or at least not impede, a trade sale. For the founder and other executives, the VCs can offer bonuses for a successful sale (carrots). The VCs can also threaten termination or blacklisting if the executives do not cooperate (sticks).\n0ggz | For common shareholders, VCs can offer to share part of the VCs' cash-flow rights with the common shareholders through a \"carve-out to common\" (carrot). They can also use vote buying or other transactions that dilute common shareholders' voting rights to undermine common shareholders' ability to block a transaction via their voting rights (sticks).\nb8at | To investigate the use of carrots and sticks in trade sales, we use a hand-collected database of fifty VC-backed Silicon Valley firms sold to acquirers in two thousand three and two thousand four. The firms are primarily in the biotech, telecommunications, software, and internet sectors. The average sale price is fifty-five million dollars, but there is considerable variance in outcomes. A number of sales are essentially liquidations, while other sales are for well over one hundred million dollars; one firm sold for over five hundred million dollars. For each firm, we collect data on the carrots and sticks used in connection with the sale.\ne3v6 | CARROTS AND STICKS",
