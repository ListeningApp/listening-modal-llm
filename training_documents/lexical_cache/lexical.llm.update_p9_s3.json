        "content": "4jmz | The culminative function of stress may be contrasted with the so-called demarcative function, a term applying to stress which falls always at a particular position within the word. Again, one syllable within a polysyllabic word is the location of this fixed stress. The term demarcative refers to the potential for fixed-position stress to function as a marker of word boundaries. Note, however, that fixed placement of stress of course implies that stress is not contrastive, i.e., cannot distinguish one word from another.\nb7cq | These properties are potentially important in perception. If stress can distinguish between words, listeners may use cues to stress in identifying spoken words; but if stress cannot help in this way, there is no reason for listeners to use it in word recognition. Similarly, if stress can signal word boundaries, listeners may use stress cues for segmenting continuous speech into words; but if stress were to have no systematic relation to position within the word, it could not be of use in segmentation.\n0b39 | Eleven point two point three Free stress and segmentation\nqecd | Most research on the role of stress in the segmentation of speech has in fact been conducted in free-stress languages: notably in English and Dutch. Although both these languages are classified as having free stress, the place where stress will fall is not arbitrary, but is determined by considerations of syllable weight; morphological factors then conspire to place the designated stress-bearing syllable more often than not, as Figure Eleven point two showed, in word-initial position. In typical conversational speech in English, the tendency to word-initial stress is even stronger than in the lexicon. Listeners' behavior shows effects of this regularity; nonwords with initial stress can be repeated more rapidly, and attract higher word-likeness ratings, than nonwords with final stress. The distributional asymmetry, combined with listener sensitivity to the pattern, opens the way for stress to be useful in segmentation in these languages, too.\n1o7p | Indeed, a substantial body of evidence from both English and Dutch indicates that listeners do treat stressed syllables as probable word onsets. Missegmentations of speech are more likely to involve stressed syllables being erroneously taken for word-initial and unstressed syllables being erroneously taken for word-internal than the reverse pattern, both in English and Dutch\ncp13 | Lexical Stress two hundred seventy-three\nbgre | Thus a must to avoid heard as a muscular boy is a natural error - the stressed last syllable is taken as a new word, while the unstressed two syllables preceding it are taken as internal to another word. Similarly, English listeners find word-spotting - detecting a real word in a spoken nonsense sequence - difficult if the word is spread over two strong syllables but easier if it is spread over a strong followed by a weak, unstressed syllable. The difficulty in the former case is explained as resulting from division of the sequence at the onset of the second strong syllable on the strategy that any such syllable is likely to be a new word; consequently, detection of risk in \"riskib\" requires that its component phonemes be reassembled, while no such delay affects detection of risk in \"riskab.\" These findings suggest that listeners use distributional consistencies of stress placement to segment speech even in languages in which stress is not strictly demarcative. So far, however, similar studies of segmentation in fixed-stress languages are not available.\n57lp | Eleven point two point four Fixed stress discriminability\nukth | In fact, there are reasons for caution with the superficially appealing notion of a demarcative role for stress cues in listening. One relevant consideration is that the acoustic realization of stress in fixed-stress languages is \"weak\" in comparison to stress in free-stress languages. Early measurements of Hungarian (fixed initial stress) by Fonagy found the unstressed final syllables of bisyllabic words to be both longer and louder than the stressed initial syllables. Janota reported that F-zero did not serve as a perceptual cue to stress in synthesized nonwords for Czech listeners (fixed initial stress); Rigault found in both Czech and French (fixed accent on final syllable of rhythmic groups) an absence of systematicity in stress realization. For Polish (fixed penultimate stress), Jassem found no effective acoustic correlate of stress other than in F-zero. Dogil observed that Jassem's study was confounded with intonational variation, and conducted measurements of the same Polish words in different intonational frames; he found no consistent acoustic correlates of stress at all, and also no consistent reflections of putative rhythmic stresses in this language. Dogil proposed that in Polish, word stress has no other expression than as the abstract feature marking positions with which intonational movement may be associated. In contrast to lexical-stress languages, then, fixed-stress languages may not distinguish stressed from unstressed syllables at all in the absence of intonational realization of the abstract difference.\nkpvt | Another consideration is that although fixed stress is sometimes located at a word boundary, this is not always so (as in Polish, where stress is on the penultimate syllable). Given that the process of spoken-word recognition involves continuous exploitation of incoming acoustic information, fixed stress other than at a word edge will involve additional processing complexity. A third consideration is that fixed stress may affect all words irrespective of word class, or may be sensitive to grammatical factors.\njie2 | two hundred seventy-four Anne Cutler",
