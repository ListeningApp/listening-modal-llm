        "content": "hkft | The contemporary approach to analysis and forecasting problems is based on Bayes' rule. This rule was first formulated by the English mathematician and Presbyterian minister Thomas Bayes, seventeen hundred and one to seventeen hundred and sixty-one. It yields estimates that are asymptotically correct and does not require an appeal to the law of large numbers, which would make little sense in the climate context. To simplify the following presentation, we assume that all state variables and data are finite-dimensional vectorsâ€”a reasonable assumption for data but a substantial simplification for state variables.",
