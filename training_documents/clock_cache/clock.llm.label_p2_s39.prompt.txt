You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

h2l3 | Authentic samples of the products obtained by the MMO-catalyzed oxidation of substrates 1 and 2 were prepared in the following manner. trans-(2-Phenylcyclopropyl)methanol (1a) and its dideuterated analogue were obtained from the synthesis of 1, and alcohol 2a was available in the preparation of 2, as indicated above. Monodeuterated la was pre- pared by LiAID4 reduction of trans-(2-phenylcyclopropyl)methanal which, in turn, was obtained from the acid by sequential treatment with H3BSMe2 and pyridinium chlorochromate.35 1-Phenylbut-3-en-1-ol (1b) and 1,1-diphenylbut-3-en-1-ol (2b) were prepared by reactions of allyl- magnesium chloride with benzaldehyde and benzophenone, respectively.
dfzb | An authentic sample of trans-2-(p-hydroxyphenyl)methylcyclopropane (1c) was prepared by the following sequence. Reaction34 of p-vinylanisole with ethyl diazoacetate gave a mixture of ethyl cis- and trans-2-(p- methoxyphenyl)cyclopropanecarboxylates, which was separated by col- umn chromatography and crystallization. The trans isomer, identified

The resulting trans-2-(p-methoxyphenyl)methylcyclopropane was demethylated36 with NaSEt in DMF to give the desired product, which was purified by preparative GC on a Carbowax 20M column. Authentic samples of the possible aromatic hydroxylated products from 2 were not prepared; no components consistent with these products were observed by GC mass spectral analysis of the oxidation mixtures.

h27a | Enzymatic Reactions. Reactions with MMO from <LATEX>M .</LATEX> capsulatus (Bath) were carried out at 45 ℃ with the reconstituted enzyme system in the following manner. Solutions were prepared that contained 1.2 mg (10 uM) of hydroxylase, 0.2 mg (24 uM) of coupling protein, and 0.4 mg (20 uM) of reductase, all in 25 mM MOPS [MOPS = 3-(N- morpholino)propanesulfonic acid], pH 7.0, in a final volume of 0.5 mL. A 0.5-uL portion of substrate was then added by means of a microsyringe to achieve a maximum concentration of ~8 mM, most of the substrates not being completely soluble prior to conversion to products. The reaction mixture was placed in a 10-mL glass vial and sealed with a Suba-Seal septum. After addition of a 25-uL portion of a 0.1 M stock solution of ethanol-free NADH to initiate the hydroxylation reaction, the vial was placed in a shaker-incubator maintained at 45 °C. Control reactions were performed in an identical manner except that no NADH was added. Reactions were allowed to proceed for 15 min, a time sufficient to afford at least 30 mol of product/mol of enzyme in those cases where authentic standards were available.
pdjh | Studies with the hydroxylase from M. trichosporium OB3b and sub- strate 1 were carried out at 30 ℃ in one of two ways. Coupling protein and reductase from <LATEX>M .</LATEX> capsulatus (Bath) were incubated with the hy- droxylase in the presence of NADH. The protein and NADH concen- trations were the same as described in the preceding paragraph. Alter- natively, reactions were performed by using 10 mM hydrogen peroxide and M. trichosporium OB3b hydroxylase only, a known shunt for this enzyme.16 Substrate was added to the reaction mixture, which was then incubated as described above. Again, at least 30 turnovers were com- pleted before the reaction was terminated.
xmgs | Instrumentation. Products from enzyme oxidations were analyzed with a Hewlett-Packard (HP) Model 5890 gas chromatograph either equipped with an FID detector or interfaced to an HP Model 5971A mass spec- <LATEX>t r o m e t e r \left( E I , 7 0 \quad e V \right) .</LATEX> For GC and GC/MS analysis, either a cross- a cross-linked methyl silicon (HP) capillary column was employed, depending on which column gave better resolution of the reaction components. The column dimensions were <LATEX>1 0 m \times 0 . 5 m m \times</LATEX> 1.0 um for GC analysis and <LATEX>2 5 m \times 0 . 2</LATEX> mm x 0.33 um for GC/MS analysis. Slightly different instrumental conditions were used to analyze the different reactions, as indicated in Table SI (supplementary material).
bd9h | Product Identification and Quantitation. Products were isolated by thorough extraction of the reaction mixture with diethyl ether or ethyl acetate. The septum of the reaction vial was removed, 5 mL of extracting solvent was added, and the septum was immediately replaced. The mixture was incubated for at least 10 min, the organic layer was then removed, and the entire procedure was repeated twice. The organic layers were combined, dried over anhydrous K2CO3, and then concen- trated by slow evaporation under Ar to a volume of ~ 100 AL. After the addition of an appropriate internal standard (vide infra), a 0.2-0.5-AL sample of concentrated extract was injected into the gas chromatograph. The retention times and mass spectra of the products were compared to those of authentic standards.
m047 | Components of the hydroxylation reaction mixture for 1-3 were quantitated by constructing standard curves in the following manner. Solutions containing known concentrations of a given component and a constant amount of an internal standard dissolved in ethyl acetate or diethyl ether were injected into the GC. The ratio of the peak area corresponding to the component with that of the standard was then plotted against the concentration of added component in the sample. A linear plot was obtained and subsequently used as a calibration curve to determine the concentration of the component in extracts obtained from reactions with the enzyme. Plots were constructed in this manner for alcohols la-3a, rearranged alcohols 1b-3b and 3c, 2-(p-hydroxy- phenyl) methylcyclopropane (1c), and substrates 1-3. Since no 1b was detected in reactions of MMO from M. capsulatus (Bath) with 1 (vide

vpgq | infra), mass balance determinations were made to ensure that the amount of unreacted substrate and products corresponded to the amount of substrate added to the reaction. In addition, reactions containing 0.8 mM 1b as well as the usual quantity (8 mM) of 1 were carried out to deter- mine if the latter would survive the hydroxylation conditions and/or compete with 1 for the enzyme. Mock experiments were carried out without addition of NADH, and the substrate was recovered following the usual extraction and concentration procedures.
ousl | Isotope Effect Studies. Reactions with MMO from <LATEX>M .</LATEX> capsulatus (Bath) were investigated with 1 and its mono-, di-, and trideuterated derivatives at the methyl position. An intramolecular isotope effect was investigated through studies of the mono- and dideuterated derivatives. The product alcohol la from reactions with each substrate was analyzed by GC/MS. The isotope effect was then calculated by comparison of the intensities, after statistical corrections, at <LATEX>m / z \quad 1 4 8</LATEX> and 149 for al- cohols arising from the monodeuterated substrate and at <LATEX>m / z \quad 1 4 9 \quad a n d</LATEX> 150 for alcohols derived from the dideuterated substrate.
m4ju | Intermolecular isotope effects were evaluated by comparison of the rate of formation of la in MMO-catalyzed reactions with the undeu- terated and the trideuterated derivatives. The experiment was performed in two ways, as a competitive reaction and as separate reactions with each substrate. Competition experiments were performed with equal amounts (0.5 uL) of both derivatives present in the reaction vial. The mass spectral intensity at <LATEX>m / z \quad 1 4 8 ,</LATEX> representing reaction of the undeuterated substrate, was divided by the intensity at <LATEX>m / z \quad 1 5 0 ,</LATEX> representing reaction with the trideuterated substrate, and the ratio was taken as the inter- molecular isotope effect. In separate reactions with the two derivatives, 2-(p-hydroxyphenyl)methylcyclopropane (1c), a product of the enzymatic reaction (vide infra), was used as an internal standard for the purpose of quantitation. The amount of la relative to 1c was calculated for each derivative. The ratio of alcohol to phenol for the undeuterated derivative was divided by the same ratio for the trideuterated derivative to provide the intermolecular isotope effect.

ki8m | Table I reports the results of the catalytic hydroxylation of substrates 1-4 by MMO from <LATEX>M .</LATEX> capsulatus (Bath). For sub- strates 1-4, the ratio of experimentally observed alcohols, cor- responding to hydroxylation without and with rearrangement, is indicated. In addition, the table includes the known rearrangement rates of the appropriate radical intermediates. Chromatographic retention times are provided in Table II, and typical GC traces for components of the reaction mixtures are shown in Figure 1.
km8w | The hydroxylation of 1 yielded two products as revealed by both GC and GC/MS analysis. They were identified as alcohol la and 2-(p-hydroxyphenyl)methylcyclopropane (1c)38 by comparison of their retention times and mass spectra with those of authentic standards. Quantitation of the peaks revealed that the two products are formed in approximately equal concentrations and at equal rates over a 20-min reaction period (Figure S1, sup- plementary material). To ensure that all added material was accounted for in the analysis, mass balance studies were carried out. The amount of material recovered in control reactions run in the absence of reductant corresponded to <LATEX>8 4 . 4 \div 0 . 6 \%</LATEX> of the substrate initially added, the remainder apparently being lost

pxbq | through the various extraction manipulations. When NADH was present to initiate and sustain enzyme turnover, 85.0 ± 0.5% of the material added was recovered, 5.0 ± 0.2% of which was la, and 5.1 ± 0.1%, 1c. No rearranged alcohol 1b was detected. The possibility that 1b formed but was unstable under the hydroxy- lation conditions was investigated through analysis of a reaction containing 8 mM 1 and 0.8 mM 1b. In the presence of NADH, 78.6 ± 1.3% of 1b was recovered, compared to 78.2 ± 1.0% in control reactions without NADH. This result indicates that 1b is unaffected during the hydroxylation reaction. The yields of la and 1c remained unchanged.
jfsr | Hydroxylation studies of the mono- and dideuterated derivatives of substrate 1 gave values for KH/kp of 5.15 ± 0.38 and 5.03 ± 0.42, respectively, for the intramolecular isotope effect. The intermolecular isotope effect was determined by comparing results for 1 with those for its trideuterated derivative. A value of 1.18 ± 0.15 was obtained for reactions that were performed separately, whereas competitive reactions performed with both derivatives present in the reaction mixture yielded a value of 0.89 ± 0.10 (see Experimental Section). In the competition study, the ratio of phenols (1c-do:1c-d3) was 1.1.
u15r | GC analysis of hydroxylation reactions with 2 revealed only a single product, which was identified by comparison to an au- thentic standard as the alcohol 2a. No peaks that might arise from rearranged alcohol 2b or aromatic hydroxylation products were detected. A plot showing the rate of product formation is given in Figure S2.

3g9w | Analysis of the extracts from reactions with trans-1,2-di- methylcyclopropane (3) revealed only one product, the concen- tration of which increased linearly with time over a 10-min period (Figure S1). It was identified as the unrearranged alcohol, trans-(2-methylcyclopropyl)methanol (3a), through comparison of its GC retention time with that of an authentic standard. No 4-penten-2-ol (3b) or 2-methylbut-3-en-1-ol (3c) was detected.
