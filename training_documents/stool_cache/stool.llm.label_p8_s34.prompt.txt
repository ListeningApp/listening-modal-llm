You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

wak1 | Some aspects were deliberately simplified or omitted in the modelling. First, we did not model HIV because paediatric HIV rates in Ethiopia and Indonesia are rela- tively low at 0.09% and 0.03%,32 respectively. This may underestimate the benefit from the intervention due to underestimated TB mortality, especially if stool-based

k16v | (1.8%-3.3%)). This may underestimate the intervention costs since the higher fractions of cases bacteriologically confirmed via Xpert MTB/Rif mean that more MDR TB will be diagnosed and require more costly second-line treatment. Third, we did not consider the private sector,

ti7f | which in Indonesia is substantial, and less likely to closely follow guidelines. Our intervention is conceived as being implemented in the public sector, but patients seeking care across both sectors may mean we overestimate the savings to the (public) health system from reduced referrals. Fourth, for pragmatic reasons, country-specific primary cost analyses were not performed and additional one-off programmatic costs for widely introducing Xpert stool testing, such as costs for training and supervision, were not included in our analyses. Both countries are moving to fully replacing SSM by Xpert testing as the primary diagnostic for TB in all patient groups. This may increase logistical issues in both countries which need to be dealt with, such as cartridge shelf life (which is shorter for the Ultra than the G4 cartridge) and module mainte- nance. Lastly, we modelled the impact of making a stool Xpert-based diagnosis available at the PHC level. The analysis also assumes that all PHC facilities have access to a GeneXpert machine, either on-site or through an effec- tive sample transportation system. Thus, until full access to Xpert testing is available, the coverage of the interven- tion will be limited.
oksu | Furthermore, due to the lack of data from randomised controlled trials and operational studies, we were reliant on early experience to determine acceptability and feasi- bility of stool-based sampling and diagnostics. Hence, difficulties in implementation that dilute effects or increase costs may be overlooked. However, the recent recommendation to use stool as a primary sample for diagnosing childhood TB3 has generated interest in Xpert stool testing at national TB programmes. Although we used an illustrative high acceptability rate for stool, this is supported by early experience from the two countries and recently published evidence.1133 Apart from the SOS stool method, two other centrifuge-free stool processing methods are being developed,9 10 which are included in a head-to-head comparison study to compare their performance in diagnosing childhood TB against sputum or gastric aspirate culture. This project has a health economic component, estimating cost-effectiveness of the best performing method. Results of this project are expected at the end of 2021. The TB Speed decentralisa- tion operational research study will report results from use of Xpert on nasopharyngeal aspirate and stool samples at PHC level in early 2022. A small study comparing the SOS stool method to the stool processing kit involved in the head-to-head comparison study10 concluded that taking into account the sample processing time, consum- able requirements and error rates, the SOS stool method would be the method that would be best scalable in low- income and middle-income countries.34
wtow | Additional evidence from studies and implementa- tion is needed to inform the optimal use of new sample and diagnostic approaches for paediatric TB within real health systems. Studies to quantify referral patterns, the pathways and outcomes of individual patients, and the costs of real-world implementation would be particularly valuable. Further analyses could include context-specific

nvfy | operational research to help design referral systems that best use Xpert machines and minimise cartridge expiry, as well as budget impact analyses to help national programmes plan roll-out and seek funding. Clinical diagnosis remains an important tool for children with TB; helping clinicians diagnose TB in children without bacteriological results or with negative results should be part of intervention design and the role of clinical diag- nosis in current and novel diagnostic pathways a topic for further research. The importance of clinical TB diagnosis for children limits the potential impact of bacteriological diagnostics.
mror | Conclusion
zlxc | In this modelling analysis, we projected that introduc- tion of routine stool-based Xpert diagnostics at primary healthcare and hospital level would increase the propor- tion of bacteriologically confirmed TB in children, while reducing child mortality and life-years lost in both Ethi- opia and Indonesia. Our analysis suggests that this inter- vention would be cost-effective in both countries.
