You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

sc5y | The next year, he met Devin Nunes.
0yab | I N PATEL's children's book The Plot Against the King, Duke Devin bursts into the home of Kash, the wizard. The duke is distressed because ever since Choosing Day, a "shifty knight" (otherwise known as Democratic Representative Adam Schiff) has been proclaiming that King Donald cheated his way past Hillary Queenton to the throne. He begs Kash, known throughout the Land of the Free as the "Distinguished Discoverer," to enlist in "the Quest for the Truth about the Plot against the King," and after some consideration, Kash agrees.
w95z | Patel tends to emphasize his reluctance when he recounts going to work for the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence in April 2017, whether he is a teal-caped wizard in the telling or just another 30-something civil servant looking for the next thing. He has said that when he first met with Nunes, the committee's Republican chair, about a staff opening on the committee's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, he thought the job sounded boring; what Patel had really wanted, since Trump's election, was to work in the White House. But Nunes won him over, Patel writes in Government Gangsters, by promising to recommend him for a spot on Trump's National Security Council once the probe concluded.
0i1k | Patel would devote the next several months to examining the FBI's rationale for wiretapping the former Trump-campaign adviser Carter Page, and to uncovering the origins of the infamous Steele dossier. In interviews, staffers and committee members recalled Patel as personable, hardworking, and not noticeably partisan. "He was instrumental in helping us understand what the FBI would have had in their possession," Mike Conaway, a Republican member of the committee at the time, said. A former Democratic committee staffer told me that Patel at first impressed even some in the minority as "exceedingly nice."
dqlg | Some of the Republicans on the committee grew frustrated, however, by Patel's emerging tendency to go rogue. One of the more surprising examples of this came just a few months into his tenure, when Patel and a colleague turned up unannounced at the London office of Christopher Steele's lawyer, where Patel left his business card. ("We did everything by the book," Patel later wrote of the incident.) One Republican staffer, initially taken by Patel's charisma, came to view him as a "spotlight ranger."
p6pq | In January 2018, as the committee's majority neared the completion of a report on its findings, Nunes and his staff, including Patel, met with then-Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein at the Justice Department. By all accounts, the conversation grew contentious as Nunes pressed Rosenstein to furnish more documents to the committee. According to a statement later issued by the Justice Department, Nunes warned that he would act to hold Rosenstein in contempt of Congress, and Rosenstein issued a warning of his own: Should Nunes pursue that route, Rosenstein was prepared to subpoena the committee's communications to defend himself.
zse6 | Patel interpreted Rosenstein's warning as a "direct and personal threat against" him- one of the nation's top officials retaliating against a House staffer out of fear of the "corruption I was about to expose." As Patel tells it in his book, he immediately contacted senior staff to House Speaker Paul Ryan to share news of the attack on one of their own employees, and Ryan's office "flatly refused to have my back." A former Ryan aide described the exchange to me this way: "Kash seemed to think there was some magic wand the speaker had to stop people from saying things Kash didn't like."
p2n3 | Suddenly everything seemed to make sense to Patel. Different setting, different time, but same deep state, same story: Here, in new form, was the Justice Department refusing to defend him against "the unstable judge in Houston," he writes; here was Washington's dogmatic lack of interest in "defending what's right" made coldly manifest.
ohh7 | The majority's four-page report, of which Patel was a primary author, was ultimately found to have credibly identified errors and omissions in the FBI and DOJ's applications to surveil Carter Page, though an inspector general did not corroborate the memo's suggestion that the surveillance was politically motivated. When it was released, the so-called Nunes memo was framed by much of the media as politically charged fiction, and Patel was identified for his role in writing it. On February 2, 2018, The New York Times published an article headlined "Kashyap Patel, Main Author of Secret Memo, Is No Stranger to Quarrels."
vbni | The article cited Patel's run-in with the Houston judge as a key example of his history of "quarrels," offering a pared-down version of events that seemed to render Patel the irresponsible offender of a sober-minded judge. The incident, in other words, had been elevated to a defining place in the public narrative of Patel's career-just as he'd always seemed to fear. "He felt extraordinarily mistreated," another former Republican member of the House Intelligence Committee told me.
dgcw | Somewhere along the way, the plot against the king had turned into a plot against the wizard himself.
gvwz | As Patel came to feature in more and more stories about the Russia investigation, he seemed to embrace the view that any criticism of him or his work-valid or not-was evidence of a coordinated smear campaign. "All their attacks only convinced me that we were on to something big," Patel writes in his book.
sk5m | A few months later, by his own admission, he decided to leak intelligence-committee emails regarding Rosenstein's "chilling" and "sustained personal attack" against him to Fox News. Shortly after an article ran, according to Patel, Ryan approached him on the House floor and asked him to stop shopping stories to the press.
qws8 | "Absolutely," Patel claims to have replied. "I would have no problem doing that the moment he, as the Speaker of the House, started having the backs of people falsely attacked for their work on behalf of the House." (A spokesperson for Ryan told me that neither Ryan nor his staff has "any recollection of this occurring.")
877u | They'd given him no choice, Patel reasoned. Somewhere along the way, the plot against the king had turned into a plot against the wizard himself.
rzhj | B Y THE WINTER of 2018, Republicans had lost the House, and Schiff was set to take over the intelligence committee. Patel later wrote that Nunes, as promised, urged Trump to hire his protégé onto the National Security Council. According to Patel, when Trump realized just whom Nunes was referring to -the man who "had saved his presidency by revealing the unprecedented political hit job designed to take him down"-he ordered his chief of staff to onboard Patel at once.
bfax | Former administration officials told me that, from his first days as a staffer on the National Security Council, in February 2019, Patel was fixated on trying to get face time with Trump. He had a script, and it wasn't long before many of his colleagues could recite it themselves: "Mr. President, the deep state is out to get you," as the longtime Trump adviser paraphrased it, "and I'm going to save you from it." Five months into his tenure, Patel was made the senior director of the NSC's counterterrorism directorate.
f2y8 | Much has been written about Patel's year on the National Security Council, including the early suspicions among his colleagues that he was funneling information about Ukraine directly to Trump, outside official channels. In the former president's first impeachment inquiry, the NSC official Fiona Hill testified about learning from another colleague that Trump apparently viewed Patel as the council's director on
