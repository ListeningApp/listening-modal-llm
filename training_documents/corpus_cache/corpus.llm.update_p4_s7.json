Follow-up and seizure outcome\nwak1 | Follow-up after the primary corpus callosotomy was two to one hundred ninety-one months (median equals forty-two point four, IQR equals sixteen to eighty-five). The number of anti-seizure medications at the last follow-up after the primary corpus callosotomy procedure was similar to that prior to corpus callosotomy (three point three plus minus one point three after versus three point three point one point two before corpus callosotomy). Seizure outcomes are presented in Table two. Overall, eighty-three percent had at least a fifty percent reduction in drop attacks, and a sixty percent\nwtfz | Note: Percentages are given of reported cases only.\nqy1i | reduction in other seizures. Comparing the outcomes between anterior callosotomy and complete callosotomy (including a one or two stage complete callosotomy), extent of disconnection did not significantly affect drop attack control (considering a fifty percent and an eighty percent cutoff, and using the chi-squared test). For \"other seizure types,\" a complete callosotomy was significantly associated with a better outcome when compared to anterior callosotomy using the fifty percent cutoff (P equals point zero one three) but not using the eighty percent cutoff.\n1k9e | Outcomes of drop attack control following corpus callosotomy were compared to vagus nerve stimulation outcomes according to degree of seizure reduction categories: less than fifty percent, between fifty percent and eighty percent, and greater than eighty percent. To verify that sufficient time had elapsed since placing vagus nerve stimulation, we focused on patients with one to two-year follow-up after vagus nerve stimulation (prior to corpus callosotomy, N equals twenty-seven), and patients with greater than two years follow-up after vagus nerve stimulation (prior to corpus callosotomy, N equals sixty). Using the Fisher exact test, the degree of drop attack reduction following corpus callosotomy was not significantly correlated to the degree of reduction after vagus nerve stimulation (P equals point six seven six for one to two years, and P equals point two six six for greater than two years following the vagus nerve stimulation before corpus callosotomy).\n5bjs | In addition to the ten cases undergoing completion of the posterior corpus callosotomy, ten patients underwent additional surgeries: frontal lobectomy (N equals one), responsive neurostimulation system concurrently with the completion of corpus callosotomy (N equals one), and deep brain stimulation to the centromedian nucleus of the thalamus (N equals eight, three of which had a responsive neurostimulation system to the centromedian nucleus).\nuodj | Four. DISCUSSION\nk16v | We report here that in children with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome who fail to achieve seizure control after vagus nerve stimulation, corpus callosotomy has an added value, significantly improving seizure control. This is true for drop (tonic and atonic) seizures and other seizure phenotypes. Corpus callosotomy-related morbidity was low, and complete corpus callosotomy was associated with higher seizure reduction rates than partial corpus callosotomy.\nb2lm | Prior studies have reported the greater value of corpus callosotomy over vagus nerve stimulation as a primary treatment for children with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome,\nti7f | especially for atonic seizures. However, other studies have found similar effectiveness for both treatments. Additionally, vagus nerve stimulation seems more cost-effective one year after surgery and is associated with fewer complications. However, this study did not evaluate long-term cost-effectiveness (considering the need for vagus nerve stimulation battery replacement), which may prove corpus callosotomy is more cost-effective. When both options (corpus callosotomy and vagus nerve stimulation) are available, many families will opt for vagus nerve stimulation first. Reasons include avoidance of brain surgery, especially because the treatment is palliative and not curative. This is based mainly on the fear of callosotomy-associated risks, including vascular injury, supplementary motor area syndrome, akinetic mutism, disconnection syndrome, and other risks (infection, hydrocephalus, wound-related, and others).\noksu | Data are limited regarding secondary treatments (corpus callosotomy following vagus nerve stimulation or vagus nerve stimulation following corpus callosotomy). Hong et al. reported that half of the patients who underwent corpus callosotomy following vagus nerve stimulation reported greater than fifty percent seizure reduction, with seven of nine patients experiencing total elimination of drop seizures. Guillamon et al. reported a small case series of three patients treated with corpus callosotomy following vagus nerve stimulation in severe drug-resistant epilepsy. They reported up to ninety-eight percent decrease in total seizure frequency following corpus callosotomy. In another small series of seven cases, Arya et al. reported all patients were free of drop attacks, with a thirty-four point seven percent decrease in total daily seizure frequency at a mean follow-up of two point six years. The results of the current series concur with these publications, with approximately eighty percent having greater than fifty percent reduction in drop attacks, and sixty percent having greater than fifty percent reduction in other seizure types.\nwtow | Katagiri et al. evaluated ten children who underwent vagus nerve stimulation following failed corpus callosotomy, the reverse of our approach. Six of ten (sixty percent) patients had greater than or equal to fifty percent seizure reduction for all residual seizure types after vagus nerve stimulation, and seventy-seven point eight percent showed total resolution of drop seizures.\no22k | Corpus callosotomy may be performed via various approaches, including interhemispheric, endoscopic-assisted (also done via the interhemispheric route), and laser interstitial thermal therapy. Laser interstitial thermal therapy approach is minimally invasive, associated with shorter hospitalization and fewer complications, and has similar outcomes to the open approaches. However, laser interstitial thermal therapy is not widely available, and may not be suitable for all corpus callosal anatomy. Open corpus callosotomy, on the other hand, is a widely performed surgery. The microsurgical technique is common to other commonly performed procedures, and is associated with low morbidity if done by experienced surgeons.\nnwfz | There is a long-lasting debate regarding the optimal extent of callosotomy between anterior, complete, and posterior callosotomy. The basis for this debate is the potential for disconnection syndrome. However, most children with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome have profound intellectual disability at baseline, and the balance between seizure control (with\nnvfy | its positive impact on the quality of life) and the risk of potential disconnection syndrome often favor the goal of seizure control.\nmror | This study aim was not to compare corpus callosotomy to vagus nerve stimulation as a primary treatment, but to show that vagus nerve stimulation failure does not predict the failure of corpus callosotomy, and that corpus callosotomy as the secondary treatment can have a significant benefit.\n```",
