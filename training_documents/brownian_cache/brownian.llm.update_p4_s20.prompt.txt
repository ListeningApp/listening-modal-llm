You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

jkgk | <LATEX>\det \mathrm { M } = \int \mathcal{D} c \mathcal{D} \bar { c } \exp \left[ \int \mathrm { d } t \bar { c } \left( \partial _ { t } + V _ { , x x } \right) c \right]</LATEX> (20)
8nom | The determination of <LATEX>\det \mathrm { M }</LATEX> then requires appropriate boundary conditions for <LATEX>\bar { c }</LATEX> and c, which are
vsjd | <LATEX>c \left( t _ { \mathrm { i n } } \right) = 0 , \quad \bar { c } \left( t _ { \mathrm { f } } \right) = 0 .</LATEX> (21)
tucm | Other choices are possible but lead to determinant values that are different from, corresponding to non-causal boundary conditions for the stochastic problem. The boundary condition is implied by the discretised form of the path integral. Its appropriateness is verified by direct computation in Appendix C. The discretised path integral can also be consulted to infer that we must further impose
prly | <LATEX>\widetilde { x } \left( t _ { \mathrm { f } } \right) = 0 .</LATEX> (22)
2epy | Although introducing <LATEX>c</LATEX> and <LATEX>\bar { c }</LATEX> is not strictly necessary, it pays to keep the determinant expressed in this form since, as we see below, it allows us to conveniently ex- press hidden symmetries of the resulting action. Insert- ing equations (16) & (20) into (15) we obtain:
v55t | (23)
53fa | <LATEX>\mathcal{P} \left( x _ { f } | x _ { i } \right) = \int \mathcal{D} \eta \mathcal{D} x \mathcal{D} \widetilde { x } \mathcal{D} c \mathcal{D} \bar { c }</LATEX> <LATEX>\exp \left[ \int \mathrm { d } t \left\{ - \frac { \eta ^ { 2 } } { 2 \Upsilon } + i \widetilde { x } \left( \dot { x } + V _ { , x } - \eta \right) \right. \right.</LATEX> <LATEX>\left. \left. + \bar { c } \left( \partial _ { t } + V _ { , x x } \right) c \right\} \right]</LATEX> We can now trivially perform the gaussian integral over <LATEX>\eta</LATEX> to obtain the path integral in terms of the Brownian Motion (BM) action
nnb3 | <LATEX>\mathcal{S} _ { B M } \left( x , \widetilde { x } , \bar { c } , c \right) :</LATEX> <LATEX>\mathcal{P} \left( x _ { f } | x _ { i } \right) = \int \mathcal{D} x \mathcal{D} \widetilde { x } \mathcal{D} c \mathcal{D} \bar { c } \exp \left[ - \mathcal{S} _ { B M } \left( x , \widetilde { x } , \bar { c } , c \right) \right]</LATEX> <LATEX>\mathcal{S} _ { B M } \left( x , \widetilde { x } , \bar { c } , c \right) = \int d t \left[ \frac { \Upsilon } { 2 } \widetilde { x } ^ { 2 } - i \widetilde { x } \left( \dot { x } + V _ { , x } \right) \right.</LATEX> (24)

o7zd | Computing this path integral, which henceforth shall be called the Brownian Path Integral (BPI), without resort- ing to some approximation is in general impossible an- alytically. Instead, we will be using numerical solutions to the fRG flow equations to compute it in the <LATEX>\mathrm { L P A } +</LATEX> WFR approximations.
thxo | Redefining our fields as :
b67w | x(t) = Vr 6(t) V(x) = TW(y)
hoze | õ = Vr 1 (φ-F) čc = ipp
hd71 | (26)
eix9 | SBM[y, F, p,p] = [W(Pf) - W(Pi)] + SsusY (27) where
h4p4 | SsusY [p, È, p, p] = |dt 62 + F2 + iFW,6(6) - ip(Ot + W,44(y))p (28)
asp2 | Action (28) describes the dynamics of Euclidean, or imaginary time, Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics where p & p are the fermionic fields and y & F are the bosonic fields [16]. The same action also describes Brownian motion and the BM action is equivalent to the SUSY QM one up to a factor depending on the initial and final positions xi & xf; these terms can be simply taken outside the path integral as an exponential prefactor.
8d1n | Variation of Ssusy with respect to F yields its "equa- tion of motion" F = - iW, which when substituted back into Ssusy yields the "on mass-shell" action
559s | SOM (, P, P] = | dt 2 62 + {W., 2 - ip(0t + W,pp)p
rhb6 | (29)
dpdb | We will keep working with the auxiliary field F and (28) as it allows for the symmetry transformations to take on a simpler form, linear in all fields.
lek9 | It is illuminating to express the above action in terms of the original dimensional variables and perform the in- tegration over p and p, leading to the alternative form of the term stemming from the determinant:
i22c | SOM [x] = dt 2Dm små2 + 2mV,2 - DmEV,ET L (30)
ofle | Note that 2Dm has the dimensions of action and there- fore plays in the thermal problem a role analogous to h in quantum mechanics - see also section II B in this respect. Unlike h of course, it can be varied by chang- ing the temperature, therefore controlling the strength of fluctuations.
ezbr | B. The Fokker-Planck equation and the spectral expansion
tpiw | Before moving on to the fRG we outline the more stan- dard procedure as to how the on-mass shell action (30) can be obtained from the Fokker-Planck equation which resembles a Euclidean Schrödinger equation. We will see later - in section VIID - that the spectral expansion method outlined here confirms the validity of the fRG approach at moderate to high temperatures.
dgkq | Instead of working with the Langevin equation directly once can deal with the probability distribution of posi- tion:
hxjr | P(x,t) = (8(x-In)) (31)
2yv3 | where In is the solution to (4) for a given noise function n (i.e. a specific particle trajectory). It can be shown that this evolves according to the following PDE:
opoe | @P(x,t) Ot =Oz(P(x, t)dzV) + 20x2P(x,t)
