You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

06yq | Microdosing with psychedelics to self-medicate for ADHD symptoms in adults: A naturalistic study

2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

htre | A corollary to this principle is that clients may change through time in their desires for the therapeutic relation- ship. The following are some examples. A client who at first desires a more hierarchical and therapist-structured relationship following a traumatic event resulting in im- pairment may wish for a more collaborative relationship later during the course of therapy. A long-term client seen first as a child may wish to achieve more distance as he or she comes into adolescence. A client who previously insisted on a highly collaborative relationship may, fol- lowing an exacerbation of an impairment or symptom or during a crisis, need an empathic and supportive relation- ship. Such changes in a client's desires for the therapeutic relationship may reflect such factors as responses to stress, personal growth, or natural development. They must be respected and accommodated by the therapist.
da3c | Principle 8: Activity Focusing Must Be Balanced With Interpersonal Focusing
890q | One way to determine what a client needs from the ther- apy relationship is by evaluating his or her preference for interpersonal interaction during therapy. Not all clients benefit from the same level of emotional intensity or closeness in the therapeutic relationship. For this rea- son, interpersonal self-discipline is required on the part of the therapist to ensure that activity focusing must be well balanced with interpersonal focusing in occupational therapy.
jomo | Activity focusing refers to strategies of responding to interpersonal events that emphasize "doing" issues regarding "feeling" or "relating" issues. Interpersonal focusing refers to strategies that emphasize the latter more so than doing issues. The difference can be illus- trated through the following examples. Let us say a client becomes upset, frustrated, or fearful when trying a new activity. Activity focusing would involve modifying the activity or the environment or encouraging a client to try another activity. By contrast, interpersonal focusing would involve addressing the client's emotional reaction to what the therapist is saying or doing. In this instance, it might mean interrupting the activity to discuss the client's emotional reaction to therapy, or it may involve strategic questioning that reveals the client's inner feel- ings about the activity or to the overall therapy approach (Fig. 3.12).

hb4s | This balance between activity focusing and interper- sonal focusing varies from client to client depending on the client's progress in therapy, expectations from ther- apy, construal of the relationship, and reactions to the therapist. To accomplish this balance, a large measure of interpersonal reasoning and self-discipline is required. In- terpersonal reasoning and self-discipline allow the thera- pist to keep the client's unique needs in focus to interpret the appropriate balance clearly. If a therapist achieves this balance, he or she does not rely too much on using activi- ties to avoid direct discussion of interpersonal issues or, by contrast, does not overemphasize discussion of interper- sonal issues when it is not comfortable for that particular client or appropriate for the situation.
cqq2 | Principle 9: Application of the Model Must Be Informed by Core Values and Ethics
1ews | Occupational therapy core values (American Occupa- tional Therapy Association [AOTA], 2015) and ethics (AOTA, 2005) must inform application of the IRM in practice. As each component of the model is covered in subsequent chapters of this book, examples of how occu- pational therapy core values and ethics inform application

r04h | of the model are provided. In addition, Chapter 14 over- views the occupational therapy core values and ethics, highlights the importance of the use of self in applying ethical principles, and specifies the numerous associations between ethical principles and the model. Examples of ethical dilemmas from clinical practice and possibilities for resolution are provided.
orpr | Principle 10: Cultural Sensitivity Is Central to Practice
k36m | Therapeutic use of self must be informed by human di- versity. In client-therapist relationships, human diversity is defined by differences in sex, age, race, ethnicity, so- cioeconomic status, religious views, sexual orientation, disability status, and a wide range of other social and cultural dimensions. Developing cultural sensitivity is fundamental to effective use of self in occupational ther- apy. For this reason, cultural sensitivity is considered a central skill that must be developed and incorporated into every therapist's interpersonal knowledge base. Chapter 9 summarizes existing knowledge about cul- tural sensitivity in the field of occupational therapy and provides additional recommendations for professional development in this area.
