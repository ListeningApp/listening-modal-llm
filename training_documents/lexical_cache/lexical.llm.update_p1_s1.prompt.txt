You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

awab | 11 Lexical Stress
ixcc | Stress is accentuation of syllables within words, or of words within sentences. This chapter deals with the first of these phenomena: lexical, or word stress. In lexical-stress languages, the syllables of any polysyllabic word are not created equal. Some syllables may serve as the locus of accentual prominence; others may not. Perceptually, this results in a distinction in salience between the syl- lables within a word. Thus syllable has initial stress: SYLlable. Syllabic is stressed on the second syllable: sylLABic (upper case denotes a stressed syllable).
8p6h | Although the term stress is properly an abstraction, speech perception deals with physical realities, and so, as Section 11.1 describes, research on stress per- ception has largely been concerned with the acoustic characteristics of stressed versus unstressed syllables, and how listeners exploit the acoustic information to make decisions about where stress occurs. Differences across languages in the realization and function of stress have important perceptual consequences; this issue is considered in Section 11.2. Only in some languages is stress a potential contributor to spoken-word recognition; the empirical evidence on this question is surveyed in Section 11.3.
pmgl | 11.1 Acoustic Realization and Perceptual Apprehension of Stress
90no | 11.1.1 The scope of this survey
jt0y | Like speech perception research in general, research on the perception of stress came of age when it became possible not only to measure the acoustic properties of speech signals, but to manipulate them. This was in the middle of the twentieth century.
qb7o | The research described in this section concerns word stress in free-stress lan- guages, although the manifestation of stress in free- versus fixed-stress languages has not always been kept apart in the literature (Section 11.2, below, will address this distinction). Also it has not always been the case that word stress has been kept apart from phrase and sentence stress, especially in earlier literature; however,
oae5 | prominence within the utterance more properly belongs in the domain of intona- tion research (see Vaissière, this volume).
s0fl | In words, stressed syllables very often differ from unstressed syllables in nature - phonological systems assign stress to heavier syllables but not to lighter syllables, for instance. But stressed syllables also differ from unstressed syllables in their acoustic realization. Figure 11.1 shows spectrograms of the utterance say the word pervert again, spoken by a male speaker of American English. In the top spectrogram the verb reading (perVERT) is shown, in the bottom spectrogram the noun reading (PERvert); although the syllables have the same segmental structure in each reading, the acoustic realization is clearly different.
43ia | Speech perception research paid great attention to acoustic realization. The measurements and manipulations concerned the suprasegmental parameters of speech: that is, those dimensions within which any speech signal must be realized (Lehiste, 1970), but which in principle can vary independently while the segmental identity of a syllable remains constant. In practice this involved three acoustic dimensions: the durational patterning of the utterance, the fundamental frequency (F0) of the voice, and the signal amplitude. Perceptually these corres- pond to utterance timing, pitch, and loudness.
3g2y | 11.1.2 Multiply determined stress judgments
gc7v | Fry (1955, 1958) conducted a systematic study of word stress in English minimal noun/verb pairs such as OBject - obJECT. Fry measured the duration and peak amplitude of each vowel, and found almost non-overlapping distributions for the stressed versus unstressed versions of comparable syllables, with the stressed syllables being longer and with higher amplitude than the unstressed. He then synthesized versions of the same words, varying these two parameters inde- pendently in 5 steps each, and varying FO in 16 steps. Listeners' judgments of which syllable bore stress in the resulting synthetic words showed more effect of the durational manipulation than of the amplitude manipulation; change in F0 had an all-or-none effect, such that a syllable with a noticeably higher peak F0, or a clear F0 movement, was always judged to be stressed. The function of stressed syllables in stress languages is to serve as possible locations for accentual promin- ence within utterance intonation contours, and this result suggests that listeners are highly sensitive to where intonational prominence is realized; wherever this occurs, the location is judged to be a stressed syllable. Fry (1958) thus cautiously concluded that this F0 effect may be strongest for stress perception, with the effect of duration also being significant, but that of amplitude negligible. However, he also pointed out that vowel quality needed to be investigated, and he undertook this task in a subsequent study (Fry, 1965), in which shifts of the vowel formant ratios (e.g., for object, stepwise from [D] to [a] in the first syllable or from [e] to [I] in the second) were compared to durational and amplitude manipulations. The suprasegmental factors here proved more closely related to stress judgments than this type of vowel change.
wqfv | If subjective impressions suggested that stressed syllables were louder than unstressed, this impression was quickly disconfirmed even by some of the earliest studies. Mol and Uhlenbeck (1956) reversed the amplitude relationship of stressed
j30a | versus unstressed syllables while leaving other parameters unchanged, and found that the reversal did not affect perceived stress; Bolinger (1958) added amplitude to pitch accents realized in synthesized sentences, and found that listeners' naturalness judgments if anything favored accents with less added amplitude. Ladefoged, Draper, and Whitteridge, introducing their pioneering 1958 electro- myographic study of speech muscle activity, reported that "it is generally agreed" that stress has no single acoustic correlate (p. 9).
7bdk | This was also the conclusion of studies by Lehiste and Peterson (1959), and Lieberman (1960). Lehiste and Peterson (on whose work Figure 11.1 is based) further drew attention to the non-independence of the acoustic parameters measured in stress studies and segmental factors - consonants and, especially, vowels can differ in intrinsic duration, amplitude, and pitch. Lieberman's study aimed to derive an algorithm for determining which of two syllables is stressed. Measurements of the three acoustic parameters in over 700 tokens of bisyllables (25 minimal pairs, produced in context by 16 speakers) showed that greater duration, higher average F0 and amplitude measures (higher peak, higher inte- gral of amplitude across the syllable, and greater amplitude ratio of one syllable to the other in a word) were all strongly correlated with stress. Where one measure was not in the predicted direction, there was almost always a trade-off because other correlates of stress were present (in no fewer than 97% of cases). Lieberman concluded that no single acoustic cue to stress is necessarily important, but that all cues may be evaluated together.
fim0 | 11.1.3 In search of a unitary underlying factor
ojro | Should there be, no matter how complex the realization, some unitary underlying factor distinguishing stressed from unstressed syllables? The concept of articulatory effort figures in this role in many early studies (e.g. Fonagy, 1958, 1966; Ladefoged et al., 1958; Lehiste & Peterson, 1959; Van Katwijk, 1974). The latter two papers propose an explicitly perceptual account: "perception of linguistic stress is based upon judgements of the physiological effort involved in producing vowels" (Lehiste & Peterson, 1959, p. 428); "the perceptual effect [is] a pitch contour which could have been produced with an increment of subglottal pressure" (Van Katwijk, 1974, p. 66).
