You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).

Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021.

Disturbed flow induced the expression of genes in the E8 cluster of endothelial cells that were also found to be highly expressed in VSMCs (Acta2 and Tagln), fibroblasts (Dcn1) and immune cells (Cd74, H2-Eb1, H2-Aa and H2-Ab1), indicating potential EndMT and acquisition of immune cell-like features by endothelial cells under the disturbed flow condition. Comparison of the differentially expressed genes between the stable flow-exposed E2 and disturbed flow-exposed E8 clusters by Panther gene ontology analysis showed that disturbed flow induces many well-known biological processes associated with pro-atherogenic pathways, including inflammation, EndMT, apoptosis, angiogenesis and endothelial permeability15. A pseu- dotime trajectory analysis and additional differential gene expression and chromatin accessibility analyses confirmed that E8 cells express higher levels of marker genes for EndMT (Acta2, Cnn1, Snail and Tagln) and EndIT (C1qa, C1qb, C5ar1 and Tnf) than E2 cells. The evidence for EndMT and EndIT was further validated by immunofluorescence

In addition, chronic exposure of human aor- tic endothelial cells to disturbed flow in vitro induced the expression of EndMT markers (SNAl1 and TAGLN) and EndIT markers (C1QC and C5AR1)15, demonstrating that disturbed flow can induce endothelial cell reprogramming in cultured aortic endothelial cells in the absence of any other cell type, such as immune cells. These results demonstrate that disturbed flow induces the transition of endothelial cells to pro- atherogenic phenotypes, characterized by inflammation, EndMT and EndIT (that is, FIRE)15 (Fig. 4).
4jmz | EndMT has a crucial role in endothelial cell dysfunction and atherosclerosis, whereas the role of EndIT has not been defined. Endothelial cells undergoing EndMT exhibit traits of mesenchymal cells, such as fibroblasts and VSMCs, while losing typical endothe- lial cell characteristics, including the elongated cell morphology and cell-cell junctional integrity60,153,154. Mechanistically, the flow- sensitive transforming growth factor-ß1 (TGFß1) is a well-known regu- lator of the expression of EndMT-related genes155,156. Furthermore, endothelial cells without primary cilia have been shown to prime flow-induced EndMT via the TGFB-ALK5-SMAD2/SMAD3 axis157. By contrast, AMP-activated protein kinase is activated by stable flow and suppresses inflammation via nitric oxide-mediated inhibition of NF-KB signalling158-160. Cells undergoing EndMT have an impor- tant role in atherogenesis by contributing to neointimal thickening, vascular remodelling, and plaque progression and stability153,161 A meta-analysis using 28 microarray datasets obtained from endothe- lial cells exposed to various stimuli (including shear stress, different coronaviruses, hyperlipidaemia and lipopolysaccharide) supports the EndIT concept162. Nevertheless, the EndIT concept requires further validation by endothelial cell lineage-tracing studies163. Although the pathophysiological importance of EndIT in atherogenesis remains to be tested, the role of disturbed flow-induced endothelial inflammation in atherogenesis is clearly defined.
b7cq | Therapeutic implications in atherosclerosis
0b39 | As discussed in the Introduction, the CANTOS trial12 demonstrated that targeting a non-lipid pathway, such as an inflammatory pathway, could be an effective anti-atherogenic therapy. We propose that flow- sensitive genes, proteins and pathways in endothelial cells that regulate FIRE, such as endothelial inflammation, EndMT and EndIT, could be promising novel anti-atherogenic targets. In support of this notion, our transcriptomics study conducted in the mouse PCL model of atherosclerosis showed that both statins and blood flow regulate the expression of hundreds of genes, and the transcriptional profile changes are remarkably distinct from each other164. This result suggests that flow-dependent and cholesterol pathways have different roles in atherosclerosis, highlighting the rationale for targeting flow-sensitive molecules (genes, proteins and signalling molecules) as a complemen- tary therapeutic approach. Two therapeutic strategies are conceivable: stimulating or increasing stable-flow-induced atheroprotective mol- ecules, or inhibiting disturbed flow-induced pro-atherogenic molecules with the use of small molecules, recombinant proteins or gene therapies delivered in a systemic or targeted manner.
qecd | Several stable-flow-induced molecules are promising anti- atherosclerotic targets. KLF2 and KLF4 account for >50% of all stable- flow-induced gene transcription and the encoded proteins affect nearly all facets of atheroprotective responses in endothelial cells165. Given their dominant importance, numerous strategies to stimulate KLF2 and KLF4 expression have been proposed. Statins are a well-known inducer of KLF2 expression in cultured endothelial cells123. However, whether statins also induce KLF2 and KLF4 expression in vivo under flow-conditions has been disputed given the potent effect of flow on the expression of these genes110,164. Betulinic acid has also been shown to induce KLF2 expression, as well as expression of its target gene NOS3 (which encodes eNOS), via the upstream ERK5-MEF2C pathway166. PIEZO1 agonists (Yoda1, Jedi1 or Jedi2) or antagonists (salvianolic acid B) have been shown to modify KLF2 and KLF4 expression167-169. However,
1o7p | Review article
cp13 | given the dual atheroprotective and pro-atherogenic roles of PIEZO1, drugs targeting this receptor would require safety and specificity stud- ies in order to be used as atherosclerosis therapies. The use of recombi- nant KLK10 or targeted overexpression of KLK10 as an anti-atherogenic therapy is discussed above.
bgre | Inhibition of disturbed-flow-induced molecules is a promising anti- atherosclerosis strategy. Pharmacological inhibition of disturbed-flow- induced HIF1x using the small-molecule inhibitor PX-478 was shown to reduce atherosclerosis in mice129. Inhibition of disturbed-flow-induced miRNAs, including the antagomiRs of miR-92a, miR-205 or miR-712, effectively reduced atherosclerosis development in mice 150,170-172. The agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine inhibits the disturbed-flow-induced DNMT activity and prevented atherosclerosis in a mouse model136. Numerous flow-sensitive genes, proteins and pathways, including NF-KB, YAP, TAZ and BMP4, as well as specific inhibitors, drugs and RNA therapeutics, are suitable for further investigation, but research on therapeutic strategies targeting disturbed-flow-induced atherogenesis is scarce. Developing approaches to overcome this limitation is a major research area to be developed.
