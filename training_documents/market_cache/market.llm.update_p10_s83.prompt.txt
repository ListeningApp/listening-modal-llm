You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

8p6h | What can be said about the overall trend depicted in the figure? First, it seems to us that, once adjusted for inflation, land prices in the long term are relatively 'flat' through- out-as indicated by the log curve, which shows no perceptible upward slope. The two- year moving average (which tends to 'smooth' any one particularly high or low year in the date), also shows this same mod-
pmgl | est 'cyclical' movement, with a clear sense of prices declining in the late 1970s, rising again in the late 1980s/early 1990s to a high(-ish) point mid-decade, before declin- ing again thereafter. Secondly, there ap- pear to have been two notable 'spikes' in higher land prices, in 1990 and again in 1994. Thirdly, lot prices appear to have declined significantly in real times since 1995/96.
90no | It should be remembered that most colonia residents bought into these settlements dur- ing the 1980s (even if they did not occupy immediately) and that they did so at a time when no services were provided or promised and before major state-wide concerns began to be raised about the existence and nature of colonias. Concern and government interven- tion really only kicked-in as a result of the 1989 and 1991 sessions of the state legisla- ture, and then again in 1995 which came to represent a major defining moment in legisla- tive intervention (Ward, 1999). While this latter session led to the creation of the CRG Receivership intervention, the programme did not truly begin until 1997 and quickened
jt0y | from 1999 through to 2002, when most titles began to be systematically cleared.
qb7o | Although we are confident that these trends are an accurate portrayal of land price fluctuations since the late 1970s, explaining them is less straightforward. We propose three tentative conclusions: first, that overall land prices have remained consistently low because, up until 1995 at least, unimproved lots were always sold without any firm ex- pectation that services would be provided or that local governments would subsequently intervene one way or another to improve housing conditions. Secondly, it seems likely that the emerging publicity about colonias from 1989 onwards and the beginnings of the State's commitment to intervene in order to prevent their further proliferation, combined with the stated intention to explore financing means that would provide services to colo- nias, probably provoked a rise in the asking price from the developers and led to a more systematic (i.e. less discretionary) setting of sale prices to interested potential buyers.7 As Table 1 clearly shows, this was the high point of lot sales.
oae5 | Our third proposition arising from the data is that, although the actual number of lot sales began to decline in 1994, and did so sharply in 1995, the 1994/95 'spike' was also motivated by a growing awareness among potential buyers (and developers) that the supply of lots was about to decline or be severely limited altogether. It was widely known that the Texas State government was preparing to intervene in a major way, pro- viding water and wastewater regularisation to colonias; but that the government was also about to get serious and curtail for good any further unserviced platted or unplatted devel- opment by developers. Correctly or not, many would-be colonia owners probably saw this as their last chance to break into colonia ownership, but now with the added expect- ancy that services would come on-line shortly thereafter. Of course, developers had even better information than did the average buyer and for them by 1994 the storm clouds were firmly on the horizon with the threat that some developers were about to be prose- cuted and might have their land develop- ments sequestrated. It was becoming apparent that major legislation would be con- sidered in 1995 (to come into effect in Sep- tember that year) that would tie developers' hands from further lot sales (without ap- proved platting and servicing) and restrict their ability to sell lots under the Contract for Deed arrangement. (This is precisely what happened through House Bill 1001 and Sen- ate Bill 336 in that year.) Therefore, prior to enactment, developers may well have been tempted to offload their remaining lots and get out before they were prevented entirely from engaging in further lot sales.
s0fl | However, the decline in prices that we observe post-1995 requires some explanation since, if there was a general expectation that services would come on-line and that colo- nias would become legitimate and enter the formal land market, then one would expect prices to rise-not fall. By itself, the fact that there was a sharp actual decline in sales is not surprising since after 1995 developer sales were largely prohibited. Therefore it must be assumed that most sales in the 1996-
43ia | 99 period were resales (traspasos) by earlier residents/buyers.8 The lower prices during the later 1990s may, therefore, reflect one or more of the following factors: an oversupply relative to demand after the spate of last-min- ute sales in 1993/94 (described above); the moratorium on lot sales, and uncertainty about what was going to happen in Starr County colonias generally, and specifically in the CRG-intervened Rio Grande City colonias; and, the switch from a relatively consistent price-setting system on the part of one or two very experienced developers, to a more individualised price-setting by individ- uals who were less experienced in negotiat- ing land sales than their developer counterparts. Specifically, 'absentee' lot owners living nearby (see Ward et al., 2000) and residents who had purchased more than one lot in the colonia, may have been in- clined to sell their vacant lot holdings for fear that they would be dispossessed-if and when the CRG or government formally inter- vened. Whatever the reason, our data suggest a sharp decline in land prices during the period 1996-2002.
3g2y | Our interpretation is that this decline was due to the post-1995 uncertainties in the land market, rather than the anticipated impact of CRG intervention. Given the lack of data for 2000-02 when our survey ended, we cannot say how CRG involvement and the titling programme from 1997 onwards actually af- fected the operations of the land market in terms of land prices. However, we can note that the expectancy that clear title would be provided, of itself, did not appear to trigger a rise in lot values. But it may simply be too soon to tell. At the very least we do now have good baseline data against which to measure land price changes from 2000 on- wards.
gc7v | Figure 2 shows the mean real price per square foot. The data indicate that there is some variation over time between settle- ments in average prices. Las Lomas is the oldest colonia and shows generally lower prices (compared with the other selected sub- divisions) during the 1980s (when prices were low), with a moderate increase in the
wqfv | 1990s and a drop at the end of the period. Mike's colonia has consistently higher land prices than most settlements throughout, but also shows an increase in the mid 1990s, while Share 52 colonia has the most dramatic 'spike' of all in the mid 1990s. This alerted us to the possibility that the upward peak noted earlier in Figure 1 for the mid 1990s may have derived from the Share 52 data entering the data-set at that time, but further analysis in the colonia revealed that this represented only 5 cases for 1994 and 1995, and that excluding Share 52 data from the overall trend did not change the curve significantly.
