You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

cb7r | De-extinction
68xu | What should be done after extinctions have already occurred? Besides more conventional species conservation practices, there is a broader discussion on the ethics of developing and using biotech- nologies for conservation purposes and beyond (Ehrenfeld, 2006; Basl and Sandler, 2013; Kaebnick and Murray, 2013; Oksanen and Siipi, 2014; Preston, 2018). Setting these larger concerns aside, more technology-focused conservation approaches - if justifiable in cer- tain cases - should be seen as complementary rather than alterna- tives to conventional conservation practices (Sandler, 2021b). Accordingly, the subject of debate concerns whether there are certain cases where such technological means are appropriate and desirable at all.
hd35 | For example, a topic that has recently been gaining attention is the evaluation of the possibility of engineering species (via gene drives, cloning, etc.) either with the purpose of avoiding their extinction, such as by genetically adapting them to new climatic conditions or by increasing the genetic diversity of a population (see discussions by Palmer, 2016; Rohwer, 2018; Sandler, 2019; Preston, 2021; Sandler, 2021b; Welchman, 2021), or as means to eradicate invasive species (Thresher, 2022).
2zpk | Related to proposals in favour (or critiques) of altering species to avoid (or cause) their extinction, a second body of work focuses on how and whether methods such as back-breeding, cross-species cloning and genetic engineering can be employed to appropriately address extinctions once they have occurred. Thus, the possibility of de-extinction by bringing a species 'back' from extinction has captured the imagination of many environmental philosophers (amongst many others, see Cohen, 2014; Oksanen and Siipi, 2014; Turner, 2014; Diehm, 2015; Minteer, 2015; Campbell and Whittle, 2017; Kasperbauer, 2017; Oksanen and Vuorisalo, 2017; Sandler, 2017; Browning, 2018; Preston, 2018; Katz, 2022; Sandler et al., 2022; for an alternative narrative, see also Odenbaugh's, 2023 recent review of the ethics of de-extinction).
epu7 | This topic has become the centre of a lively debate in the ethics of extinction, which is noteworthy in so far as de-extinction is only a minor subject within the broader field of conservation ethics and debates (see also section "Extinction studies"). Of concern are, for example, different moral values and goods that might be supported or hindered by de-extinction projects (e.g. Cohen, 2014; Haught, 2017; Smith, 2017; Welchman, 2017; Rohwer and Marris, 2018), which also include anthropocentric reasons in favour of the de-extinction of certain species, such as their potential value for ecosystem functioning, their economic value or their scientific value.
7od1 | Non-anthropocentric attempts to provide a qualified justifica- tion for this approach include providing a list of criteria for its employment (e.g. Kasperbauer, 2017) or by trying to make the idea useful for other normative purposes such as whether de-extinction might be a way of enacting a reparative duty towards nonhuman species or individual animals after extinctions have occurred. While thinking about de-extinction in terms of reparation or restitution might be intuitively appealing and constitute an argument occa- sionally engaged by conservation professionals, concerns about de-extinction as a form of reparation or retribution are shared by many authors (such as Oksanen and Siipi, 2014; Diehm, 2015; Lean, 2020; Welchman, 2021; yet for an argument in favour of a prima facie obligation to re-create species, see Jebari, 2016), while more might be said in favour of de-extinction as ecological restoration (Turner, 2014). Overall, while some authors argue that de-extinction can be ethically permissible in certain circumstances (Sandler, 2019), the debate on the desirability of de-extinction has been rather sceptical. Three common (not exhaustive) critiques of de-extinction fall into the following three categories.
0bqy | Firstly, it has been frequently pointed out that the resulting species is not the same species as the previously extinct species, but only constitutes a copy (which concerns the species' 'identity', Blockstein, 2017; Siipi and Finkelman, 2017; Lean, 2020). Actual 'resurrection' is not considered to be possible - or only possible by drawing on a very specific species concept (Oksanen and Siipi, 2014) and related metaphysical commitments to resolve the 'res- urrection paradox' (Delord, 2014) - which leaves any de-extinction proposal wanting (Diehm, 2017) and reintroduces the abovemen- tioned considerations about the ontology of species (Beever, 2017).7 However, other writers argue that de-extinction technologies should not be understood as aiming to re-create extinct species in the first place (Lean, 2020), which weakens this critique aimed at de-extinction while also reducing its intuitive appeal.
b780 | Secondly, concerns about animal welfare have been raised (Gamborg, 2014; Oksanen and Siipi, 2014; Kasperbauer, 2017; Turner, 2017; Browning, 2018; Browning and Veit, 2022), which regards, for example, the welfare of the animals used for laboratory testing, of the animals that are (re)introduced into ecosystems and of the animals already living in the target ecosystems. Distinct from but related to such worries are also concerns regarding the eco- logical risks of (re)introducing species into ecosystems and, thus, what this means for ecosystems beyond the de-extinct species in question (Oksanen and Siipi, 2014; on the more general relation- ship between biodiversity conservation and resurrecting species, see Oksanen, 2014).
ccmb | Thirdly, we can find a range of worries raised against de-extinction on a more abstract level of analysis concerning the human-nature relationship (Kohl, 2017; Katz, 2022). That is
ma93 | linked, in turn, to worries about naturalness (Gamborg, 2014) in terms of artificiality and authenticity (Katz, 2022; discussed in Campbell, 2022; Lean, 2022; Preston, 2022; Reydon, 2022; Turner, 2022, but for an argument against this concern, see Campbell and Whittle, 2017) as well as concerns about instrumentalist 'techno- optimist' conservation strategies more generally as exemplified by de-extinction (Diehm, 2015).
c6hh | Extinction studies
y7ea | In the previous sections, we have mainly focused on what is commonly termed an analytical moral philosophical approach to the ethics of extinction. Yet, several other philosophical perspec- tives on extinction and contributions from outside of the fields of moral philosophy and the philosophy of biology also provide insights that are pertinent for thinking about the ethics of extinction that complement and enrich some of the discussions considered throughout this article. For example, there is a vibrant sub-debate in the conservation literature according to which ethical concepts and values should be supplemented or replaced by aesthetic concepts and values (e.g. Passmore, 1974; Sober, 1986/1995; Hargrove, 1989; Thompson, 1995; Tribot et al., 2018). Thus, one could claim that a species extinction is analogous to the loss of a great work of art.
nav4 | A particularly notable further area of debate is the philosophical contributions in the interdisciplinary overlap with the environmen- tal humanities and social sciences (e.g. Barad, 2007; Haraway, 2008; Sodikoff, 2012; Tsing, 2015; Guasco, 2021) in a broad research area called 'extinction studies' (e.g. Chrulew et al., 2017). Before con- cluding, we will highlight some elements of this perspective to find areas of convergence and divergence between these different intel- lectual traditions working on the ethics of extinction.
gem8 | Scholars working within the extinction studies framework tend to emphasise an understanding of extinctions as a biocultural phenomenon (van Dooren et al., 2017; van Dooren, 2018) that cuts across reality, inviting a vision of existence that recognises the deep interwoven nature of multispecies communities, experiences and collaborations. In line with this understanding, some writers have conceptualised extinctions as the loss of ways of life, underlining the fact that extinctions represent the demise of distinct forms of mating, nurturing, intergenerational learning, educating, interact- ing and so on (Rose, 2011; Crist, 2013; van Dooren, 2014; Despret, 2017; Hatley, 2017).
e8nr | Influenced by the work of philosophers such as Edmund Hus- serl, Maurice Merleau-Ponty and others, this perspective empha- sises a phenomenological approximation to extinction, opposing a mere behavioural approach to the nonhuman world and, instead, stressing the importance of attentiveness and lived experience in our interactions with the natural world (Lestel et al., 2014). A key point of this approximation is to underline the experiences of those affected by extinction rather than focusing on the abstract dis- appearance of species. This speaks to the idea that the very experi- ence of living on a biologically impoverished earth is understood as a source of deep concern (Crist, 2019). This methodological emphasis, in turn, motivates the interest of extinction studies in individual stories of extinction (e.g. van Dooren, 2014) investigated through the tools of so-called field philosophy (Buchanan et al., 2018) and other alternative methods (e.g. Masco, 2017).
k78w | Another important aspect of this perspective on analysing extinctions is the idea that the consideration of processes and occurrences of extinction cannot be separated from a critique of various forms of colonialism, imperialism and capitalism that
g9du | Anna Wienhues et al.
f682 | inform our extinction-related practices and concepts (Dawson, 2016; Salazar Parreñas, 2018). To illustrate, returning to themes introduced in section "Defining extinction", while extinction stud- ies do not attribute a single, all-encompassing meaning to extinc- tion (De Vos, 2007), this phenomenon is regarded as the result, amongst other things, of complications derived from concepts used hegemonically, including the terms 'species', 'biodiversity', 'extinc- tions' and 'scientific knowledge', amongst other notions. It is argued that these concepts represent a conventional classification of the natural world that is tinted by colonialist and anthropocentric biases that universalise Western scientific perspectives, thus priv- ilege some organisational hierarchies over others and naturalise distinct power relations within dominant biodiversity conservation paradigms (Theriault et al., 2020). These terms employed with the purpose of organising reality 'exclude myriad forms of life and relations and draw sharp boundaries between "living" and "dead" that confound the basic principles of so many living cosmologies' (Mitchell, 2016b).
li1k | When thinking about responses to extinction - for example as an 'ethos of responsiveness towards the phenomenon of mass extinction' (Michell, 2016a, 39) - also in extinction studies, there is a general scepticism towards de-extinction projects as shared by the approaches introduced above (see section "De-extinction"). If extinctions are understood not as the demise of the last individual of a population, but as the disappearance of a way of life, de-extinction projects are doomed to fail, because they do not seem capable of capturing the deeply relational nature of life (Friese, 2013; Jørgensen, 2013). This is interestingly complementary to some of the views discussed in the previous sections that, when examining the wrongness of extinctions and the problems of technological solutions such as de-extinction, emphasise the relevance of eco- logical and cultural relationships as the basis for what has value. Confronted with the failure of preventing extinctions and the magnitude of the biocultural losses produced by the disappearance of these ways of life, some extinction studies scholars emphasise the importance of mourning and remembrance as a proper response to extinction (van Dooren and Rose, 2017; de Massol de Rebetz, 2020). Rather than undoing loss, the moral significance of reflecting - remembering, mourning, grieving and imagining - the disappear- ances of deeply interwoven ways of life is underlined, giving rise to a moral psychology aspect to extinction.
pbea | Conclusion
ccpt | This overview of the ethics of species extinctions has not attempted to spell out or critically discuss all topics or argumentative positions in detail. More humbly, our aim has been to provide an initial glimpse into some of the themes relevant for thinking about extinc- tion that are being discussed in the literature of environmental ethics. For that purpose, we have given special attention to the possible philosophical grounds for Michael Soulé's assertion that the untimely 'extinction of populations and species is bad', which does not answer what should be done to prevent extinctions.
0fpw | While there is no simple or straightforward answer to the question of why anthropogenic extinctions are 'bad' or morally wrong, there is clearly largely agreement on the issue that anthropo- genic extinctions are in most cases wrong, except for the contro- versially discussed cases of planned species extinctions in support of human (and nonhuman) health, such as with respect to vector- borne diseases. In such cases, anthropogenic extinctions might even be morally required. Besides such special cases, there is a broad

cop0 | plurality of arguments and perspectives underlying and supporting the need to pursue expansive biological conservation policies. Which conservation strategies and practices should be pursued (and which should not), in turn, remains an additional matter of debate, the subject of the ethics of conservation that supplements the ethics of extinction.
lhkq | Lastly, there are two remarkable aspects to the literature surveyed. Firstly, most arguments pertaining to the wrongness or badness of species extinctions are not primarily concerned with 'species' as such. Rather, the matter of moral concern, such as the locus or source of value, is often located somewhere else: in the nonhuman individuals involved, in people's relationship to particular species or landscapes, in biodiversity including vari- ability within species and between ecosystems and so on, which reflects that there is more of moral relevance to the ethics of extinction than merely the numerical loss of species and their respective intrinsic or instrumental value. Views on the moral wrongness of anthropogenic extinctions result also, amongst other things, from underlying premises of what constitutes an appropriate human-nature relationship, which is why the current anthropogenic mass extinction event is of significant moral con- cern.
