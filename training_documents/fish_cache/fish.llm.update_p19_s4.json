        "content": "lvae | The survey relies on thirty-eight kilohertz as the primary acoustic frequency to estimate Pacific hake biomass, although additional frequencies as available on the U.S. and Canadian survey vessels are also used to help distinguish hake from other acoustic targets. Acoustic backscatter attributed to Pacific hake is scaled to biomass or abundance using a length-based model of target strength, the log-transformed acoustic backscatter expected from a single fish or unit biomass. In nineteen ninety-five, this model was changed from a weight-based target strength of negative thirty-five decibels per kilogram to a target strength-length relation of target strength equals twenty log L minus sixty-eight, where L is fork length in centimetres. Variability in Pacific hake target strength has continued to be an active area of research; data from the most recent field measurements were generally consistent with mean and variation indicated in Traynor nineteen ninety-six.\no9sc | Sources of uncertainty in the acoustic surveys of Pacific hake abundance involve climate-ocean effects on distribution and availability of fish to the survey, the ability to acoustically differentiate Pacific hake from other acoustic targets and the uncertainty in Pacific hake target strength. For example, the current stock assessment models use the acoustic-based survey biomass indices from nineteen ninety-five to present only, excluding the earlier surveys that had reduced spatial coverage and used a different target strength model. A second example of the uncertainty in acoustic surveys occurred during the two thousand nine acoustic survey with the northward expansion of Humboldt squid into the California Current Large Marine Ecosystem. Several factors make it difficult to acoustically distinguish Humboldt squid and Pacific hake: the target strength and frequency response of Humboldt squid are similar to those of Pacific hake. There was overlap in the depth and geographic ranges of both species in two thousand nine, and squid predation may cause an avoidance response leading to altered aggregation behaviour in hake. Because the proportions of backscatter attributable to hake and Humboldt squid were based on limited information, the estimated uncertainty of the acoustic survey biomass estimate was higher in two thousand nine than in other survey years. Further irruptions of Humboldt squid have not been observed during hake acoustic surveys since two thousand nine.\n121u | Hakes\nzh03 | Nine point six Assessment and management strategy evaluation\n1mvw | Age-structured models have been used to model the population dynamics of the coastal stock of Pacific hake since the early nineteen eighties. Cohort analyses were replaced by statistical catch-at-age models by the early nineteen nineties. These latter models provide a time series of estimates of total biomass, biomass-at-age, spawning biomass and age-zero recruits. The current assessment model relies on catch, survey indices, weight-at-age and age composition data. The two thousand thirteen assessment estimated a mean unfished female spawning biomass of a little more than two million tonnes, with a female spawning biomass at the beginning of two thousand thirteen of one point five million tonnes, or seventy-two percent of unfished equilibrium female spawning biomass. Assessments have consistently found that the population dynamics of Pacific hake are characterised by infrequent large year classes, including from the years nineteen eighty, nineteen eighty-four and nineteen ninety-nine, and potentially two thousand eight and two thousand ten. These large year classes have sustained the population, through long periods with moderate to low recruitments.\n6d4s | Prior to nineteen ninety-seven, separate Canadian and U.S. assessments for Pacific hake were submitted to each nation's assessment review process, which resulted in differing yield options being forwarded to each country's managers for this shared trans-boundary fish stock. Multiple interpretations of Pacific hake status made it difficult to coordinate an overall management policy. From nineteen ninety-seven through two thousand ten, the Stock Assessment and Review process for the PFMC in the United States evaluated assessment models and the PFMC council process, including NOAA Fisheries, has generated management advice that has been largely utilised by both nations. In two thousand three, the United States and Canada signed the Treaty, which specifies science and management processes. The terms of the treaty were not fully implemented until two thousand twelve, but stock assessments and management activities have conformed to the treaty for many years. Under the Treaty, Pacific hake stock assessments are prepared by the JTC composed of both U.S. and Canadian scientists and reviewed by the SRG, with members of both groups appointed by both Parties to the agreement. In two thousand twelve, after formal appointments were made to Treaty-specific committees, the stock was assessed and managed under the full auspices of the treaty for the first time. Between two thousand three and two thousand eleven, the Parties honoured the intent of the Treaty during its implementation, which included joint stock assessment reviews and allocations to each country based on the Treaty allocation structure.\nmqah | The two thousand thirteen assessment was a fully Bayesian assessment conducted using the Stock Synthesis modelling platform, with the base-case model incorporating prior information on two key parameters, natural mortality, and steepness of the stock-recruit relationship, and integrating over estimation and parameter uncertainty to provide results that could be probabilistically interpreted. The base case model showed large variations in Pacific hake biomass over the past four decades, largely related to variation in recruitment, with an apparent strong year\nxxr8 | Biology, fisheries, assessment and management of Pacific hake\nrl4j | class in two thousand ten driving an increase in biomass at the end of the time series. From a range of alternate models investigated by the JTC, a subset of sensitivity analyses was also reported in order to provide a broad qualitative comparison of structural uncertainty with the base case.\nvz32 | The two thousand thirteen assessment estimated that the stock was, in fact, not overfished in the early two thousands, reaching a low of thirty-two point three percent of unfished biomass in two thousand, but in contrast did meet the overfished definition in two thousand nine at twenty point four percent of unfished biomass. As the official declaration of overfished status in the United States applies only to a current estimate, and as Pacific hake are now managed under an international treaty that does not include an 'overfished' definition, the retrospective two thousand nine estimate in the two thousand twelve assessment does not impact current management.\nncb0 | A retrospective comparison of Pacific hake assessment models from nineteen ninety-one through two thousand thirteen shows considerable variability in the estimates of Pacific hake",
