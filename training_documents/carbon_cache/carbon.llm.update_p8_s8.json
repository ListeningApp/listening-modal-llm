        "content": "bqfb | With respect to the production-based emissions, the following approaches were proposed: determination of environmental policies, which could also reveal and explain the leakage phenomenon, and the channels by the means of which the income inequality affects carbon dioxide emissions: the scale, composition, technique and globalization effects. Therefore, the income inequality determined changes in working time could be attributed to the scale effect, when income inequality contributes to the increase in working hours and analogically to economic growth and carbon dioxide pollution. The composition effect, conditioned by the growth of income inequality, is related to the industrial decline, which in turn reduces pollution in rich countries. In terms of the technique effect, the high level of inequality negatively affects the spread of innovations, consequently harming the environmental technologies' development. Taking into account the globalization effect, inequality also influences trade and foreign direct investment transfers; besides, inequality can contribute to the decrease or growth of carbon dioxide emissions. It depends on whether the trade and foreign direct investment enhance or reduce the environmental impact.\nwwdt | The following two approaches, namely (i) inequality determined changes in working time (which is related to \"Veblen effect\") and (ii) individual economic behaviours of households (or individual consumption level), which combine the marginal propensity to emit theory and \"Veblen effect\", contribute to the explanation of the influence of income inequality on consumption-based emissions. Furthermore, the working time increase does not only contribute to economic growth, but to the consumption increase as well, simultaneously influencing the increase of carbon dioxide emissions. This approach is related to \"Veblen effect\" when in an unequal society, people from different social classes are more inclined to compare themselves with individuals from a superior social class and mimic their consumption level. With regard to the individual consumption level, it should be noted that the consumption demand is a key factor influencing the marginal propensity to emit. The main condition for the changes in income inequality to affect the consumption-based carbon dioxide emissions depends on the marginal propensity to emit ratio of the poor and the wealthy, and changes in social norms. Furthermore, inequality can contribute to the growth of middle social groups' willingness to achieve the superior social group's consumption level (\"Veblen effect\") and, correspondingly, carbon dioxide emissions.\nmn1r | Therefore, this paper provides new (revised) approaches explaining the impact of inequality level on separate production-based and consumption-based carbon dioxide emissions. Big hopes are held that in the nearest future, our theoretical considerations regarding these theories will be confirmed or corrected by other experts in the field. This study can also provide new insights for the policy makers concerned to seek the reduction of income inequality and pollution related to climate change.",
