        "content": "8p6h | Two hundred. Last but not the least, the current work opens a brand new topic in probing the cognitive abilities of LLMs: if the working memory capacity of LLMs are fundamentally limited, then why? How their architecture is related to the capacity limit? One possible explanation would be the self-attention mechanism used in the Transformer architecture. The self-attention mechanism computes a weighted sum of input elements, where each element's weight is determined by its relevance to other\npmgl | elements in the sequence. While this approach allows the model to focus on relevant information, it may also lead to a diffusion of information across multiple input elements, making it challenging to maintain and access specific pieces of information as N increases in N-back tasks.",
