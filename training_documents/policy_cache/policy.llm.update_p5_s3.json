        "content": "uodj | Michael Lipsky's classic study of 'street-level bureaucracy' nineteen eighty focused on frontline work public organizations and was pioneering in this respect. Lipsky drew the attention to the policy-making power of frontline workers, as he pictured street-level bureaucrats 'the people who make decisions about other people'. Street-level workers can be seen as active actors in policy implementation and a reform resource. While street-level bureaucrats, such as social workers, teachers, or nurses, are hierarchically on the \"lowest\" organisational level they still have the possibility to create their own ethical codes and apply rules based on their own understanding (to a certain extent) due to discretion that they use in their everyday work practices. This gives, for instance, an explanation for the results of policy implementation in which street-level bureaucrats may have a strong effect on the content of changes in the organisational context, but also beyond that.\nk16v | As Carson et al. note, frontline discretion is a complex phenomenon entailing also interorganisational rules and policies and governance frameworks. Rice offers a valuable illustration of the systemic nature of SLBs work, as she combines a street-level perspective with micro-institutionalism. Her comparative research contribution identifies different layers that influence the implementation process of activation policies: the professional identity of the caseworker; caseworker's ideas of the worthiness of clients; organisational characteristics; and wider political, economic, cultural and social developments and institutions that frame and/or restrict the actions that are relevant, appropriate or permitted in certain types of situations. Moreover, Isett et al. underline the importance of frontline acceptance to systemic changes: SLBs perceptions of system changes affect attitudes towards the work environment, even if the new system is more effective and efficient. This, according to the authors, may lead to systems failure if not handled well.\nb2lm | Whereas many SLBs can be seen also as professionals, the theoretical and analytical angles differ in the following way: Evans notes that SLBs are seen to\nti7f | implement policy goals whereas professionals formulate their own goals. According to previous research, social workers can be categorized as both, but as Trappenburg et al. suggest, social workers are more SLBs than professionals, as they implement policies to meet the needs of their clients, bending the rules and applying policies to fit their street-level practices, albeit the notion that professional codes and rules are the basis of their discretion.\noksu | New technologies are seen in this study as an instrumental context for examining SLBs policy implementation. Therefore, we do not focus on the question, what kinds of negative or positive consequences new technologies have for STBs work. In short, there are conflicting views on such consequences: some researchers assume that technology has an especially negative effect on street-level bureaucrats and often the negative consequences are connected with the decreasing level of discretion. For instance, Ellis notes that new technologies help managers monitor SLBs more easily and make it more difficult to bend rules in frontline implementation. Then again, there are also views according to which SLBs can use ICT as action resources. Overall, new technologies are a broad umbrella term, and it is the context and special conditions in the usage of the technology that define the impacts for SLB's work. In this study we focus on the process of implementation by asking, how do street-level bureaucrats implement a new technology in social services?\nwtow | Context and methods\no22k | Our study focuses on the implementation of a social and health care client and patient information system commissioned by the Hospital District of Helsinki and the municipalities of the Helsinki Metropolitan Area, Finland in two thousand sixteen. The implementation of the new information system took place during the years twenty eighteen to twenty twenty-two. This client and patient information system is software developed by the Epic Systems Corporation. One crucial promise of the new IS was to enhance the integration of social and healthcare services by creating, first in the world, an electronic client and patient record and system combining social care and healthcare data into \"a single, unified record\".\nnwfz | Other Nordic countries Denmark and Norway have also commissioned Epic Systems Corporation's healthcare software and thus have their own Epic implementations. The Danish implementation was contracted late two thousand thirteen and the implementation took place in hospitals of two regions between years twenty sixteen to twenty seventeen. Norway's Epic implementation, Hellseplatformen, first took place twenty twenty-two in the city of Trondheim in Central Norway. However, a strong resistance towards the information system has sparked among the Norwegian healthcare actors. Unlike in Denmark and Norway, the Finnish implementation of Epic was not restricted to hospitals, rather, both the primary healthcare and, importantly, social care were included. As part of the Helsinki-Uusimaa region, the city of Vantaa was the first organization worldwide to implement Apotti to social services in two thousand nineteen.\nmror | The data was collected through narrative interviews, and these interviews with the professionals working at the city of Vantaa's social services were conducted in November and December twenty twenty-one, approximately one and a half years after the implementation of the new IS. We utilized a purposive sampling to select informants who had experienced the implementation of the client information system. The informants were all professionals working at the City of Vantaa's social services, and they were thus expected to be able to hold sufficient knowledge about the phenomena under study. The data was collected through narrative interviews, and altogether ten informants were interviewed. One interview lasted approximately sixty minutes. All the interviews were fully transcribed afterwards, and the transcribed data consists of ninety-four pages of text.\nzlxc | Narrative interviews, in which the informants make sense of their experiences about the implementation of the client information system, are particularly useful as they allow the researchers the opportunity to explore beyond the implementation process as such. In addition, the hidden aspects, emotions and thoughts underlying the felt meanings and lived experiences that ordinary discourse sometimes fails to engage with can be addressed. The aim of the narrative interviews is to give voice, time and possibilities for the informants to express and reflect on their experiences about the studied phenomenon, connecting the past, present and future at the point of telling. In practice, researcher asked open-ended questions so that the informants could reflect on and make sense of the experiences they have had and the expectations they hold to provide examples of situations where experiences took place and how they acted, felt and thought about what has happened.\nk0bw | The phenomenon-driven, interpretive analysis was aimed at gaining understanding about how the professionals justified their actions, decisions and choices\naq5a | in their everyday work about the usage and implementation of the new information system. Therefore, a five-step coding scheme was utilized to systematically describe the meaning of the qualitative data:\nsc5y | One. In the first data-driven step of the analysis process, the relevant and meaningful passages from the transcribed data are marked to capture the meaning of the told experiences.",
