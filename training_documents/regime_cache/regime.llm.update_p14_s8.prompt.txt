You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

o6gf | <LATEX>L _ { 0 } ^ { 2 } \left( \psi _ { 0 } \right) = \Pi _ { 0 } L ^ { 2 } \left( \psi _ { 0 } \right) = \left\{ \varphi \in L ^ { 2 } \left( \psi _ { 0 } \right) | \int _ { \mathcal{X} } \varphi \psi _ { 0 } = 0 \right\} .</LATEX> The identity (2.35) holds for underdamped and overdamped Langevin under certain conditions discussed in [29, Section 2]. In view of this identity, as well as (2.20), (2.26) and (2.24), and the definition (2.10) of the conjugated response <LATEX>S ,</LATEX> we can write
0hs6 | <LATEX>\rho _ { 1 } = \lim _ { \eta \rightarrow 0 } \frac { \mathbb{E} _ { \eta } \left( R \right) } { \eta } = \int _ { \mathcal{X} } R \mathfrak{f} _ { 1 } \psi _ { 0 } = - \int _ { \mathcal{X} } \left( \mathcal{L} _ { 0 } ^ { - 1 } R \right) \left( \widetilde { \mathcal{L} } _ { \mathrm { p h y s } } ^ { * } 1 \right) \psi _ { 0 }</LATEX> <LATEX>= \int _ { 0 } ^ { + \infty } \mathbb{E} _ { 0 } \left( R \left( X _ { t } \right) S \left( X _ { 0 } \right) \right) d t ,</LATEX> (2.36)
m05x | where the expectation <LATEX>\mathbb{E} _ { 0 }</LATEX> is over all initial conditions <LATEX>X _ { 0 }</LATEX> distributed according to the invariant measure <LATEX>\psi _ { 0 } ,</LATEX> and over all realizations of the reference dynamics (2.1) at hand. For Langevin dynamics (2.18), the conjugate response function reads
ds29 | (2.37)
qcmr | <LATEX>S \left( q , p \right) = \beta F \left( q \right) ^ { T } M ^ { - 1 } p .</LATEX> Similarly, for overdamped Langevin dynamics (2.13), it reads
7c6p | <LATEX>S \left( q \right) = \beta F \left( q \right) ^ { T } \nabla V \left( q \right) .</LATEX> In both cases <LATEX>S \in L _ { 0 } ^ { 2 } \left( \psi _ { 0 } \right) .</LATEX> We emphasize that, as already discussed in Section 2.1, the expression for <LATEX>S</LATEX> comes from the generator <LATEX>\widetilde { \mathcal{L} } _ { \mathrm { p h y s } }</LATEX> of the perturbation, and not the observable
d1ee | <LATEX>R .</LATEX> The Green-Kubo formula shows that a nonequilibrium property (the transport coefficient <LATEX>\rho _ { 1 }</LATEX> in this case) can be computed using simulations at equilibrium, i.e. for
itx4 | <LATEX>\eta = 0 .</LATEX> Standard numerical techniques. Transport coefficients are often estimated in one of two ways:
vwrs | (1) Equilibrium techniques based on the Green-Kubo formula (2.36). To numer- ically estimate the quantity (2.36), one needs to discretize the continuous dynamics in time, using a fixed timestep <LATEX>\Delta t > 0 .</LATEX> This leads to the presence of some timestep bias of order <LATEX>\mathrm { O } \left( \Delta t ^ { \theta } \right) ,</LATEX> where <LATEX>\theta</LATEX> depends on the numerical method at hand [28, 29]. Additionally, the time integral must be truncated
xjkw | EXTENDING LINEAR RESPONSE WITH SYNTHETIC FORCINGS
wght | to some finite integration time T. This leads to some truncature bias, which is small due to the exponential convergence of etCo.
3lgb | Last but not least, the expectation is computed using empirical averages over K realizations. This naturally suggests the following estimator for p1:
ttwt | PK,T = K ≥| R(X) (X) dt. k=1 K
x5l2 | Although there are clear advantages to using equilibrium techniques (for in- stance, correlation functions for different conjugate responses can be com- puted simultaneously), there is also one major challenge in using (2.36). The integral is a correlation term, which is a small quantity for large t, plagued by a large statistical error [7]. The statistical error is therefore the main source of error, as the variance is expected to scale linearly with the integration time T. More precisely, it is shown in [38, Section 5] that the statistical error of PK,T is of order T/ K.
ilrs | Overall, a tradeoff has to be considered for the choice of T as the bias is smaller for larger T while the variance increases with T.
0a03 | (2) Nonequilibrium steady-state techniques. This method works by first approxi- mating the limit in (2.20) by the finite difference En (R)/n, with n sufficiently small to limit the bias; and next estimating the expectation with time aver- ages as
auae | (2.38) În,t = |R(X) ds,
5b6y | for response functions with average 0 with respect to yo. When computing such steady-state averages over long trajectories, the asymptotic variance of the trajectory average computed using the discretized dynamics coincides at dominant order in n with the asymptotic variance of the trajectory average computed using the corresponding continuous dynamics (see Proposition 2.4 below).
1y10 | One source of error is the systematic error due to three different biases. As discussed in Proposition 2.4, the finiteness of the integration time leads to some bias of order 1/(nt), which is typically smaller than the statistical error. Additionally, the fact that we consider n / 0 leads to some bias of order n, as a consequence of Lemma 2.2. Lastly, the time discretization of the continuous dynamics also leads to some time step bias; see [28].
6mnx | As discussed in Proposition 2.4 below, the statistical error is dictated by a central limit theorem, so the variance of the estimator On,t scales as 1/(n2t). The simulation time required to estimate P1 with a sufficient statistical ac- curacy therefore scales as t ~ n-2, leading to very long integration times t. Such long simulation times are often prohibitive in practical cases of interest. These results, and the tradeoffs to be considered, are discussed in more detail in Section 2.3.
tynp | 2.2.3. Application to mobility. The aim of this section is to illustrate the various previous results in the paradigmatic case of mobility. We consider the case where F E Rª is a constant force, and the state-space is X = Td. We define the mobility for both overdamped Langevin and Langevin dynamics, and discuss how it is related to the self-diffusion by Einstein's relation.
