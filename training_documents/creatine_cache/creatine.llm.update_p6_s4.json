These neurological benefits may have potential applications for young athletes participating in collision sports, which pose underlying risks of concussions or sub-concussive impacts. Further, several of these clinical trials implemented strict clinical surveillance measures, including continual monitoring of laboratory markers of kidney health, inflammation, and liver function; none of which were negatively impacted by the respective creatine supplementation interventions. These findings support the hypothesis of creatine supplementation likely being safe for children and adolescents. However, perhaps the strongest supporting evidence for the safety of creatine is the recent classification of creatine as generally recognized as safe by the United States Food and Drug Administration in late twenty twenty. Ultimately, this classification indicates that the currently available scientific data pertaining to the safety of creatine, is sufficient and has been agreed upon by a consensus of qualified experts, thereby determining creatine to be safe under the conditions of its intended use. Even though infants and young children are excluded from GRAS, this would still apply to older children and adolescent populations.\n7w7j | The majority of dietary supplement survey data indicates that a relatively high percentage of youth and adolescent athletes are currently or have previously supplemented with creatine. For example, Kayton et al. found that in a sample of two hundred seventy high school boys and girls, twenty-one percent of boys and three percent of girls reported supplementing with creatine. Furthermore, in a sample of elite Olympic level sample of young German athletes (fourteen to eighteen years), twelve percent of those surveyed reported supplementing with creatine. Therefore, these trends warrant additional research to determine with greater certainty whether creatine supplementation, both acute and longer-term, is safe for children and adolescents.\n51vd | In summary, based on the limited evidence, creatine supplementation appears safe and potentially beneficial for children and adolescents.\nbaj1 | Does creatine increase fat mass?\n```",
