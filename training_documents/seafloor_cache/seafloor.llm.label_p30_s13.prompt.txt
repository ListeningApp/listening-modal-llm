You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

mov9 | and -69%% in the single sample of rectorite. There is a gen- eral increase in <LATEX>\delta \mathrm { D } _ { \mathrm { V S M O W } }</LATEX> with depth, consistent with the downhole increase in calculated temperature. Importantly, no accepted hydrogen isotope fractionation factors exist for 2:1 phyllosilicate minerals in order to calculate initial <LATEX>\delta \mathrm { D } _ { \mathrm { w a t e } }</LATEX> values. Gilg and Sheppard (1996) proposed approximating the fractionation factors of Al-rich and Fe- and Mg-free smectites using kaolinite factors; however, the smectites in this study are Fe-rich nontronite. Initial <LATEX>\delta \mathrm { D } _ { \mathrm { w a t e r } }</LATEX> values in equilibrium with chamosite, using a chlorite-water fractionation factor of <LATEX>\alpha = 0 . 9 5 4</LATEX> from Marumo et al. (1980), are -18.7 to -9.8%o (Table 6). However, hydrogen isotope fractionation in chlorite is strongly dependent on mineral chemistry (e.g., Marumo et al., 1980; Savin and Lee, 1988), thus adding uncertainty to the initial <LATEX>\delta \mathrm { D } _ { \mathrm { w a t e r } }</LATEX> values.
ks7m | High <LATEX>\delta ^ { 1 8 } \mathrm { O } _ { \mathrm { w a t e r } }</LATEX> values have been reported for Kuroko-type hydrothermal fluids (up to 10.8%%; Ohmoto, 1983, 1996). The shifts in <LATEX>\delta ^ { 1 8 } \mathrm { O } _ { \mathrm { w a t e r } }</LATEX> to lower values at higher temperatures (e.g., minimum of 0.8%% in equilibrium with rectorite dur- ing chalcopyrite deposition) are typical of the stringer zones
w1w1 | of ancient VMS deposits (e.g., Cathles, 1993). The 18O-rich fluids at Tinakula may be derived from isotopic exchange with 18O-rich rocks, boiling, or direct contributions from magmatic fluids. At high temperatures, water-rock interactions can shift <LATEX>\delta ^ { 1 8 } \mathrm { O } _ { \mathrm { w a t e r } }</LATEX> but not <LATEX>\widehat { \delta } \mathrm { D } _ { \mathrm { w a t e r } }</LATEX> (Huston, 1999). We interpret the combination of higher <LATEX>\delta ^ { 1 8 } \mathrm { O } _ { \mathrm { w a t e r } }</LATEX> and lower <LATEX>\delta \mathrm { D } _ { \mathrm { w a t e r } }</LATEX> at Tinakula as a result of subseafloor boiling, which is likely because of the shallow water depths there and the fluid inclusion trapping temperatures, which are close to the boiling curve (Fig. 22). The lack of low-pH mineral assemblages and the seawater- dominated S isotope signature (see below) suggest that there was no magmatic contribution to the hydrothermal fluids or only a limited one.
h8gv | Sulfur isotopes
kwkp | The 834S values of chalcopyrite range from -0.8 to 2.0%% and are, on average, slightly lower in the Cu-rich chimneys than in the Zn-rich chimneys (Fig. 23A). Pyrite has 834S values of -0.4 to 3.1%% (Fig. 23B), and sphalerite has <LATEX>\delta ^ { 3 4 } \mathrm { S }</LATEX> of 0.3 to 3.4%% (Fig. 23C), both minerals having higher values in <LATEX>\mathrm { Z n }</LATEX> rich chimneys. Fe-poor (light-colored) sphalerite has slightly higher 834S values than Fe-rich (dark-colored) sphalerite from the same sample. However, there is no systematic spatial variation in 834S of the sulfides along the main NS-trending fissure at Tinakula, suggesting that the sulfur source was uni- form. Barite from chimney samples yielded <LATEX>\delta ^ { 3 4 } \mathrm { S }</LATEX> of 19.3 to 22.5%% (Fig. 23D). Anhydrite from the altered volcaniclastic rocks has <LATEX>\delta ^ { \bar { 3 } 4 } \mathrm { S }</LATEX> of 20.6 to 22.2%%, whereas gypsum has 834S of 21.3 to 21.8%% (Fig. 23D), all close to that of seawater sulfate <LATEX>\left( \delta ^ { 3 4 } \mathrm { S } = 2 1 . 2 4 \% o \right.</LATEX> Tostevin et al., 2014), with a slight decrease with depth (App. Table A5).
yj0m | The isotopic composition of the sulfate minerals records predominantly seawater sulfate in pore spaces of the volcani- clastic rocks. Sulfide values are generally close to mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB) values but lower than those of typi- cal arc lavas (e.g., Alt et al., 1993; Labidi et al., 2012, 2014). This pattern may result from degassing of magmatic volatiles, which can produce H2S with low 834S values from the dis- proportionation of SO2 (Gamo et al., 1997; Kusakabe et al., 2000). However, there is no evidence at Tinakula of signifi- cant volatile contributions that elsewhere produce advanced argillic alteration and very light sulfide sulfur with negative 834S values and no evidence of bacterial sulfate reduction that would also produce negative <LATEX>\delta ^ { 3 4 } \mathrm { S }</LATEX> values (cf. Hannington et al., 2005).
ewfp | Timing of alteration and mineralization
oczy | Results of 226Ra/Ba dating of hydrothermal barite are shown in Table 7 and Figure 24. The calculated ages indicate that hydrothermal venting has been ongoing for at least 5,600 ± 240 years. Approximately 60% of the data yield ages between 792 and 2,369 years. Although there is no obvious spatial variation in the ages (App. Fig. A28), the two oldest samples (>4,000 yr, MA13-011 and MA13-030) were collected from drill core, whereas younger samples were collected primar- ily from chimneys. Drilling at site D intersected two discrete oxidized intervals that are interpreted as paleoseafloor hori- zons. The upper paleoseafloor horizon displays lateral conti- nuity over ~20 m east-west and ~25 m north-south, but the lower horizon was not recovered in drill hole TKAD030 (App.

Fields for seawater and magmatic water (Sheppard, 1986; Taylor, 1992) and global meteoric water line (Craig, 1961) are also shown. Data from Tinakula closely follow adiabatic boiling path from Huston (1999), associated with increasing 818O values and slightly decreasing OD values with progressive boiling.

The ages of the talus sam- ples confirm that the paleoseafloor horizon on which the talus was deposited is at least 1,000 years old and gives a minimum age for the volcaniclastic cover sequence, which is variably altered and mineralized throughout the Tinakula deposit. Because of the low solubility (Blount, 1977) and high pres- ervation potential of barite, even the oldest barite chimneys are well preserved. One fully intact (inactive) chimney has a calculated age of 3,450 ± 229 years (Table 7). Currently, the
