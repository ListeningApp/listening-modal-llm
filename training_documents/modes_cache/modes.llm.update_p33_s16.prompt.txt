You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

23jk | a. Provide the client with hope, positive feedback, and generally show a positive attitude or emotions (e.g., point out the client's strengths, highlighting all of his good progress thus far; remind him that as his functioning improves, he will begin to build increasing confidence about returning home and eventually get- ting back to work).
oa63 | b. Assume a clear leadership role by providing the client with information, struc- ture, guidance, or constructive feedback (e.g., educate the client about the course of rehabilitation, emphasizing that he will not be discharged from the hospital to outpatient and work rehabilitation until he feels confident about his abilities and is assessed by the treatment team to be ready and safe for such).
e3lv | c. Ask questions or engage in a discussion that leads the client to think about alternative ways of approaching the situation (e.g., ask the client about the source of his concerns-if it was something someone said or something else that happened since the accident that is causing him to be concerned about his independence).
rqv6 | d. Give the client total and complete control over the situation (e.g., ask the client what he thinks he will need to be able to do before he returns home, and assist him in converting his thoughts into short- and long-term goals for therapy).
oa48 | 6. You are working with a 50-year-old retired cook who is a mother and a grandmother. She experienced a traumatic brain injury approximately 3 years ago, and for the past year she has been attending a day center in her community that serves individuals with brain injuries. The client typically loves participating in and sometimes leading a range of activities, including a cooking group that she sometimes leads because of her expertise in this area. Recently, she has not been participating in most of the activities and has had to be encouraged to come into the dining room during mealtimes. Today, she refuses to eat or participate in the cooking group. She states that she believes that the kitchen is not clean enough for eating and cooking. You know that the kitchen is particularly clean. Please rank-order each response according to the following scale:
3fp1 | a. Assume a clear leadership role by providing the client with information, struc- ture, guidance, or constructive feedback (e.g., explain that the kitchen is cleaned after each use and was just cleaned this morning; offer to clean it with her again).
557x | b. Ask questions or engage in a discussion that leads the client to think about al- ternative ways of approaching the situation (e.g., ask the client if there is some- thing in particular that is giving her the idea that the kitchen is not clean; invite her to show you where the kitchen is not clean).
ep8e | c. Witness, listen to, and show full acceptance of the client's thoughts, feelings, or behavior (e.g., tell the client that you want to understand more about her concerns about the kitchen and ask her to explain more about why she does not want to eat or participate in the cooking group).
7mv3 | d. Provide the client with hope or positive feedback and generally show a positive attitude or emotions (e.g., remind the client of how much she usually enjoys the cooking group, and tell her that you, in particular, enjoy eating the food during times when she leads the group).

You can see that he is becoming increasingly upset about the situation. The harvest is approaching, and if he misses it, his business will lose a significant amount of money. He is particularly worried about whether he will be able to drive the tractor for as long as the harvest requires. His son and daughter, who would normally be available to help him, are both out of town. He cannot take the type of pain medications that would provide him with rapid relief because of the side effects they have caused, and the gout medication that he takes is effective only if taken during a period of several days. Please rank-order each response according to the following scale:
8xg2 | a. Provide the client with hope or positive feedback and generally show a positive attitude or emotions (e.g., based on your knowledge of the usual length of his gout flare-ups, remind the client that the attack is very likely to end soon, as it has every other time; encourage him not to lose hope that he will bring the har- vest in on time).
njvp | b. Ask questions or engage in a discussion that leads the client to think about alternative ways of approaching the situation (e.g., ask the client questions to help him compare different alternatives and plans for how to manage the needs of his business during the flare-up).
s8b5 | c. Normalize the client's experience or connect him with social or physical re- sources that will enable him to have equal access and opportunities (e.g., work with the client to reach out to an advocacy-based organization whose mission is to help farmers in crisis).
p450 | d. Assume a clear leadership role by providing the client with information, struc- ture, guidance, or constructive feedback (e.g., review all of the pain management strategies that you and the client have tried, including modifying his diet and sleep hygiene; remind the client of adaptations that may be used and show him alternative ways to manage the pain during the flare-up).

Normalize the parent's experience or connect the parent with social or physical resources that will enable her to have equal access and opportunities (e.g., let the child's mother know that she is not alone and that many parents are uncom- fortable with this approach; provide her with contact information for a parent empowerment group that critically evaluates this method and many other dif- ferent methods for addressing behavioral problems).
35a8 | d. Give the parent total and complete control over the situation (e.g., inform the child's mother that she is in control of what happens during her son's therapy; ask her if she can think of a way to modify the approach so that she feels more comfortable with it, or if there is another strategy she wants to try instead of this one).
