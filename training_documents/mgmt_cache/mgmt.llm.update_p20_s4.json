The challenges Haier faces in the implementation of Rendanheyi are, to some extent, archetypical of breakthrough innovations. It is well documented that key stakeholders are often cautious and even unwilling to adopt or participate in breakthrough innovations for a myriad of reasons. More fundamentally, as we have seen, there are cultural and legal impediments that limit Rendanheyi's applicability in other institutional contexts. Rendanheyi may not work as well, or not at all, in other countries. In fact, the implementation of Rendanheyi has been very limited in Haier's foreign affiliates. Haier executives still hope to eventually transfer Rendanheyi to Haier's global affiliates, but the takeover of GE's white goods division may render this objective even more difficult.\n8l69 | Within those affiliates where Rendanheyi has been fully introduced, Haier also needs to consider some critical issues going forward, including how organization-wide process innovations can be implemented by semiautonomous xiaowei, given that user-facing xiaowei are obsessed with product innovations with relatively quick payoffs and are less concerned with the longer term collective interests of the Haier Group. As the Haier Group is progressively diluting its ownership stakes in the xiaowei, Haier must also consider how successful xiaowei can be prevented from fully disengaging themselves from the Haier Group organization. One possible future for Haier would be to transform into a \"flotilla\" model away from the \"ocean liner,\" as Zhang has already indicated that \"we may be entering the era of losing control\" in the quest to serve customers better.\n1jyv | Future research will need to further investigate to what extent Rendanheyi and other context-specific management innovations from emerging countries are transferable across national borders and organizational boundaries. There is much evidence that the transfer of organizational innovations across institutional contexts often fails. The failed or incomplete transfer of management innovations from Japan to the West and the mixed success of novel, hierarchy-free organizational forms such as holacracy should serve as a warning to managers. As we have seen, China's institutional context is particularly conducive to Rendanheyi. There is no written manual for introducing Rendanheyi, and, in fact, the ambiguity and vagueness of the precise contents of Rendanheyi are typical of most Chinese management models, as Chinese organizations tend to develop broad and imprecise strategies that are short on details and vague on the specific steps to implement them. Furthermore, Rendanheyi took a long time to develop into \nolce | what it is today, and compared with key historical management innovations, only the making of Toyota's lean production platform has taken as long. Haier's long experimentation with Rendanheyi may have been an important reason why the practice was successfully implemented within the company, since the practice was molded by the specific experiences of the company, and Haier employees gradually got used to assuming greater management responsibilities. Therefore, the Rendanheyi case suggests that organizations must be cautious before cutting and pasting radically innovative processes and mechanisms to obtain the same goals. Nonetheless, some elements of Rendanheyi could well be emulated by companies around the world, and this case will surely inspire managers and academics working with management innovation.\nerx1 | Author Biographies\nb3bt | Notes\n0w8m | Management Innovation Made in China: Haier's Rendanheyi\nvcu3 | \nhjzj | Management Innovation Made in China: Haier's Rendanheyi\nj79f | \n```",
