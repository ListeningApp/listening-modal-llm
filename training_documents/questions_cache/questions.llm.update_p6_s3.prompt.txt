You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

ewfp | "Questions can be like a lever you use to pry open the stuck lid on a paint can. . . . If we have a short lever, we can only just crack open the lid on the can. But if we have a longer lever, or a more dynamic question, we can open that can up much wider and really stir things up. . . . If the right question is applied, and it digs deep enough, then we can stir up all the creative solutions."
oczy | While you may not immediately know the characteristics of a powerful question, it's actually quite easy to recognize one. For instance, if you were an Olympic judge scoring the power of questions on a scale from one to ten (with ten being the highest), how would you rate the following queries?
2ttg | 1. What time is it?
his3 | 2. Did you take a shower?
m50z | 3. What possibilities exist that we haven't thought of yet?
me84 | 4. What does it mean to be ethical?
o56m | We have tested questions such as these in several different cultures. In the process, we've discovered that, despite cultural differences, people quite consis- tently rate questions one and two as being less power- ful, and questions three and four as being more power- ful. Clearly, powerful questions are ones that transcend many boundaries.
slz6 | Not long ago, we hosted a conversation with a group of international colleagues about what makes
90k5 | a compelling question. Here are some of their reflections:
9m8s | Finn Voldtofte (Denmark): The question has to catch people where they are, to meet them where there is the most energy and relevance for them, and then use that energy to go deeper. Action will flow naturally from that energy.
893y | Felipe Herzenborn (Mexico): The question also needs to be simple and clear and penetrating. It's like a laser beam. A good question invites and chal- lenges you to reflect at a deeper level-to find the knowledge or wisdom that's already there beneath the surface.
favz | Verna Allee (U.S.): To me, the most energizing questions are those that involve people's values, hopes, and ideals-questions that relate to something that's larger than them, where they can connect and con- tribute. People don't have a lot of energy around questions that are only about removing pain.
7szx | David Isaacs (U.S.): Even though it's useful to acknowledge pain, I think it's also important to shift the ques- tion away from a problem focus or fix-it focus to a possibility focus. There's always a subtle feeling of dis- empowerment in a problem, a feeling that all the doors are shut. "We've got a problem ... oh no! Not another problem!"There's a weariness and stuckness about it. Simply asking, "What's the possibility we see in this situation?" can make a big difference.
hx9e | Toke Moller (Denmark): Here's an example of that approach. I was working with a local school to frame a possibility-oriented question. We asked teachers, students, parents, and administrators, "What could a good school also be?" This way of posing the question helped people to see their school in a different light. It resulted in some amaz- ing new ideas. I'm quite sure they would not have been as innovative if the question had focused only on fixing problems.
ywn2 | Carlos Mota (Mexico): It's a real art to find as well as to shape the right question for your situation. Once a friend told me about a time she was being inter- viewed. The interviewer said, "We're just going to ask you one question: What's the question we
a63r | should be asking?" Sometimes the most important thing to do is to help the people themselves shape the questions in the most powerful way, since they know their own situation the best of anyone.
dqvj | Thus, a powerful question:
r17u | · generates curiosity in the listener
3c47 | • stimulates reflective conversation
g345 | · is thought-provoking
svhz | · surfaces underlying assumptions
oaen | · invites creativity and new possibilities
5u67 | · generates energy and forward movement
dvms | · channels attention and focuses inquiry
qrd3 | · stays with participants
rxrg | · touches a deep meaning
tf43 | · evokes more questions
fcco | A powerful question also has the capacity to "trav- el well"-to spread beyond the place where it began into larger networks of conversation throughout an organization or a community. Questions that travel well are often the key to large-scale change. As we'll explore below, how such queries are crafted can make a differ- ence in their capacity to move a system toward innova- tive futures.
8uji | The Architecture of Powerful Questions
df3e | As shown at the start of this volume, powerful ques- tions can dramatically improve the quality of insight, innovation, and action in our organizations, in our communities, and in our lives. Therefore, understand- ing the basic architecture of formulating powerful questions is a key skill in today's knowledge economy. There are three dimensions to powerful questions: construction, scope, and assumptions. Each con- tributes to the quality of learning and knowledge cre- ation that emerges as we engage with others in a gen- erative inquiry.
53eu | THE FIRST DIMENSION: The Construction of a Question
a5u1 | The linguistic construction of a question can make a critical difference in either opening our minds or nar-
ry7u | rowing the possibilities we can consider. Is it a yes/no question? Is it an either/or question? Does it begin with an interrogative, such as Who, What, or How?
5mda | WHO WHAT
i4li | WHEN WHERE WHICH
r8sm | WHY HOW?
cuin | Just for fun, try placing these words in a pyramid of lower to higher power. Don't think too much; use your intuition.
n1i7 | When asked, most people rank these words from more powerful to less powerful as follows:
0r5m | By using the words toward the top of the pyra- mid, we can make many of our questions more robust. For example, consider the following sequence:
ne2o | · Are you satisfied with our working relationship?
sqxn | · When have you been most satisfied with our working relationship?
6pmo | . What is it about our working relationship that you find most satisfying?
195r | . Why might it be that that our working relationship has had its ups and downs?
kqmi | As you move from the simple "yes/no" question at the beginning toward the "why" question at the end, you'll notice that the queries tend to stimulate more reflective thinking and a deeper level of conversation.
g8rd | That's what we mean by a powerful question-one that provokes thoughtful exploration and evokes cre- ative thinking.
nns9 | However, a note of caution: Unless a "why" ques- tion is carefully crafted, it can easily evoke a defensive response, as people try to justify their answer rather than proceed in a spirit of inquiry. For instance, the questions, "Why can't you ever tell me exactly what you are thinking?" or "Why did you do it that way?" can cause someone to defend a given position or rationalize some past decision, rather than open new possibilities. In contrast, when a "why" question stems from genuine curiosity, such as "I wonder why that happened?" then the inquiry has the potential to cre- ate useful insights.
