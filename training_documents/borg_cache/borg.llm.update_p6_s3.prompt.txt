You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

0fpw | Perhaps the most obvious objection to the claim that LLMs deserve the attribution of rich predicates like meaning and representing is that such systems lack the kind of connections to the external world which seem necessary to ground semantic content. As Piantadosi and Hill 2022 note, there is a "prominent view ... that models trained only on text cannot acquire realistic meanings because they lack reference, or connection to objects in the real world" (see, e.g, Bender and Koller 2020. Lake & Murphy 2023: 411, although they argue against externalist semantics, agree that nothing in the vector assigned to a word in an LLM would allow a user to label an object or describe a scene). The assumption here is that words get their meaning from their connection to things outside the sphere of language, so that, e.g. "dog" means what it does because it refers to dogs or picks out the property of doghood (Fodor xxxx). While sentences and utterances are meaningful because they make claims about the world, so that their meaning can be analysed in terms of their conditions of truth (Davidson, Partee). As David Lewis famously put it (1970: 18), it seems that: "semantics with no treatment of truth conditions is not semantics". Yet, if all a system has available to it is intra-linguistic information, we might suspect that truth won't enter the picture, since the system is out of touch with the external states of affairs where (according to most theories) truth gets its footing.4
dqn8 | The worry that externally determined properties like truth don't get any traction within LLMs is reinforced by the well-known issue of LLM fabrication, or "hallucination": [sparks 82]
cop0 | [A] key limitation of LLMs [is] their tendency to generate errors without warning, including mathematical, programming, attribution, and higher-level conceptual errors. Such errors are often referred to as hallucinations per their tendency to appear as reasonable or aligned with truthful inferences. Hallucinations, such as erroneous references, content, and statements, may be intertwined with correct information, and presented in a persuasive and confident manner, making their identification difficult without close inspection and effortful fact-checking.5
lhkq | The existence of such fabrications undermines the idea that users can rest epistemic weight on LLM outputs, since falsehoods emerge unbidden from exactly the same background processes as give rise to statements of fact. As ChatGPT's developers, OpenAI, note (pointed out by Titus 2024: ?? ), fixing this problem is far from straightforward:
82ju | ChatGPT sometimes writes plausible-sounding but incorrect or nonsensical answers. Fixing this issue is challenging, as: (1) during RL training, there is currently no source of truth; (2) training the model to be more cautious causes it to decline questions that it can answer correctly; and (3) supervised training misleads the model because the ideal answer depends on what the model knows, rather than what the human demonstrator knows.
y2qo | The Sceptic's argument is thus that a system needs robust externalist connections prior to any attribution of rich semantic predicates (like representation and meaning) and that since LLMs lack such connections they cannot be treated as semantic engines.
1piq | In response, however, I think there are (at least) three kinds of response a Believer might make:
7fqw | 1. reject the claim that externalist connections are needed (or at least maintain that referential properties are only part of the story).
rhaz | 2. accept the claim that externalist connections are needed but argue that future iterations of LLMs will have the required connections.
wak1 | 3. accept the claim that externalist connections are needed, but argue that, as things stand, LLMs already realise appropriate word-world relations through their connection to humans.
wtfz | I'll take these responses in order but focus on (3), since I think it provides the most promising response to the Sceptic.
qy1i | 2.1 Distributional, Inferential, and Conceptual Role Semantics
1k9e | A first move would be to reject the call for an externalist semantics in favour of some form of internalist approach. According to internalist semantic theories, words and sentences are made meaningful not through their connection to external objects and situations, but through their position in a linguistic or conceptual network.6 On this model, reference and truth emerge only later, at the point where already meaningful expressions are used to talk about the world. The properties internalists appeal to include distributional properties, entailment relations and
5bjs | position within a conceptual network. The first idea - that the distributional properties of expressions (i.e. the statistical patterns of word occurrences) suffice for meaning - has a long history in philosophy and linguistics, with the linguist John Rupert Frith, writing in the 1950's, capturing the approach in the slogan: "You shall know a word by the company it keeps". That is to say, 'distributional semantics' holds that the meaning of a word is fixed by the pattern of words it commonly co-occurs with, so that, e.g., "dog" means what it does because it commonly appears with words like "barks", "bites", "bones", etc, but less often (or not at all) with words like "justice", "flies", "not", etc. Distributional semantics is clearly a pre-cursor of the approach to natural language processing adopted by LLMs (and by corpus linguistics in general), thus an advocate of Distributional semantics is likely to simply deny the claim (made in §1) that LLMs do not directly target semantic properties. If meaning is given by distributional properties and LLMs model distribution, then LLMs just are modelling semantic content. One response to the Sceptic, then, would be to embrace Distributional semantics.
uodj | LLMs may also qualify as modelling semantic content on alternative internalist approaches. For instance, Inferential Role semantics holds that meaning is grounded in the entailment relations that exist between sentences: to master "cow" is (to be disposed) to infer from "x is a cow" to "x is an animal", "x has four legs", "x gives milk", etc (Boghossian 1994). As noted in [Sparks, p?], it seems that LLMs are highly adept at capturing these kinds of inferential relations. Or again, Conceptual Role semantics couches the required internalist properties at the level of thought, focusing on the relationships between concepts which presumably underpin acceptable inferences at the level of language (Harman 1987). Given LLMs success with inferential and conceptual network tasks, it could be argued that information about these relations is already tacitly contained within the system. Piantadosi and Hill 2022 seem to embrace this kind of view. They suggest that "relationships between concepts are the essential, defining, aspects of meaning" and they go on to argue that:
k16v | The key question for LLMs is whether training to predict text could actually support discovery of conceptual roles. To us the question is empirical, and we believe has been answered in a promising, partial affirmative by studies showing success on tasks that require knowledge of relationships between concepts. Text provides such clues to conceptual role because human conceptual roles generated the text.7
b2lm | Deciding whether LLMs count as semantic engines given either an Inferential or a Conceptual Role approach requires taking a stance on what it is for information to be
