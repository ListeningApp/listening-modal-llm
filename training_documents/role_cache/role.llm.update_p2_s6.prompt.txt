You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

gocl | Pure GS estimates additive effects and neglects non-additive allelic effects and non-allelic epistasis (Muranty et al., 2015). For outcrossing species, these non-additive effects were, however, important for the improvement of various traits. A hierarchical epistasis of MdSAUR37/MdPP2CH/MdALMTII was identified to control fruit malate content (Jia et al., 2018). To link MAS and GS, an additive Bayesian QTL analyses model was developed for apple fruit firmness, the GS accuracy (0.57-0.94) was higher than that of genomic best linear unbiased prediction (G-BLUP) model (0.72-0.77) (Bink et al., 2014). These data drew attention to QTL- based GS, which is sometimes called genomics-assisted prediction (GAP) (Peace et al., 2019). Compared with map-based QTL mapping and GWAS, bulked segregant analysis via sequencing (BSA-seq) is considered as a cost-efficient QTL detection approach and has been effectively used in apple (Shen et al., 2019).
ob1z | The objective of the present study was to develop GAP models for flesh firmness and crispness retainability. Towards this, QTLs were identified from three apple F1 hybrid populations using BSA-seq approach. To convert significant QTL-based markers to diagnostic markers, candidate genes were predicted from QTL intervals, assisted by using RNA-seq and parental re-sequencing. Then, the allelic variations in candidate genes were validated to confirm the function of the variations. The results can facilitate

u2ob | Segregation and correlation of flesh firmness or crispness at harvest and post-harvest
2gnm | Both the initial flesh firmness and the crispness of apples at harvest segregated extensively with a Gaussian distribution within the three populations, implying a minor-effect polygenic control of these two traits (Figure S1). The broad-sense heritability <LATEX>\left( H ^ { 2 } \right)</LATEX> was 75.24-83.06% and 86.91-94.43% for the initial flesh firmness and crispness, respectively (Table S1). Similarly, the <LATEX>H ^ { 2 }</LATEX> was 75.04-83.85% and 75.87-83.64% for retainability of flesh firmness and crispness, respectively (Table S1). However, the frequency distributions of retainability of flesh firmness and crispness were not Gaussian (Figure S2). The majority of hybrids lost flesh firmness and crispness within one or two months. The frequency of hybrids with long flesh firmness (≥7 kg/cm2) and crispness (≥0.7 kg/cm2) retainability was higher in the population of 'Zisai Pearl' x 'Red Fuji' than the other two (Figure S2).
emgw | The Pearson's correlation coefficient was highest between flesh crispness and firmness retainability (0.8024; n = 2,651; <LATEX>\left. P < 0 . 0 0 1 \right) ,</LATEX> followed by that between initial flesh firmness and crispness (0.5892; <LATEX>n = 2 , 5 0 7 ;</LATEX> <LATEX>\left. P < 0 . 0 0 1 \right)</LATEX> (Figure 1a). The cor- relations between the initial flesh firmness or crispness at harvest and the corresponding flesh firmness or crispness retainability after cold storage were relatively low (0.3392- 0.4692) (Figure 1a). The hybrids with long flesh firmness retainability did not generally have the same or longer flesh crispness retainability (Figure 1b). Among the 217 hybrids with 6-7 months long flesh firmness retainability, 140 (64.5%) had the same or longer flesh crispness retainability (Figure 1b). However, among the 157 hybrids with six months or longer flesh crispness retainability, 140 (89.2%) showed 6-7 months flesh firmness retainability (Figure 1b). These data indicated that long retainability of flesh firmness was likely a prerequisite for flesh crispness retainability.
xaqt | Pattern of flesh firmness and crispness at harvest and post-harvest
5rcb | Regarding the changes in flesh firmness and crispness during cold storage, three extremity dynamics were distinctly observed. Type I: acceptable flesh firmness (7.0 kg/cm2) or crispness (0.7 kg/cm2) lost already at harvest. Type II: acceptable flesh firmness or crispness maintained until the sixth month after a rapid softening during the first month of cold storage. Type III: acceptable flesh firmness or crispness maintained after the sixth months of cold storage with constantly slow softening rate (Figure 1c,d). Ethylene production in type I hybrids was higher than that in types II and III during cold storage, whereas type III hybrids produced lowest level of ethylene (Figure 1e,f). These suggested that low ethylene emission was associated with flesh firmness and crispness retainability.
524j | QTL identification using BSA-seq
xd3m | By the three segregant bulks from the three phenotype types of flesh firmness retainability (Figure S3a), 10, 5 and 17 significant QTLs for flesh firmness retainability were identified from bulk pairs of type III vs. type I, type III vs. type II, and type II vs. type I, respectively. These QTLs were located on chromosomes 3, 11, 12, 15, 16 and 17 (Figure S4a,b,c; Table S2). Of these QTLs, F-F03.2
