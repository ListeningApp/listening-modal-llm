        "content": "cop0 | In this paper, we show that the power-law cosmology essentially depends on the parameters Q and H sub C. We intend to find the observational constraints on the power-law cosmology parameters using the recent observational data from H of Z and supernova observations. We also intend to test the power-law cosmology with primordial nucleosynthesis. The paper is organized as follows: The basic equations of power-law cosmology are introduced in Section Two. Section Three deals with the constraints on the parameters Q and H sub zero from the latest H of Z data while Section Four is devoted to find the constraints using Union Two compilation of five hundred fifty-seven S N e I a data points. In Section Five, we perform the joint test using H of Z and S N e I a data. Section Six deals with the constraints on power-law cosmology from primordial nucleosynthesis while Section Seven is devoted to study the statefinders in power-law cosmology. In the last Section, we summarize the main results of the paper.\nlhkq | Two BASIC EQUATIONS IN POWER-LAW COSMOLOGY\n82ju | We study a general class of power-law cosmology described by the dimensionless scale factor\ny2qo | a of t equals a sub zero of t over t sub zero raised to the alpha power, (one)\n1piq | where t sub zero is present age of the universe, a sub zero is the value of a today and alpha is a dimensionless positive parameter. Hereafter, the subscript zero denotes the present-day value of the parameter under consideration.\n7fqw | The deceleration parameter Q, which characterizes accelerating left parenthesis Q is less than zero right parenthesis or decelerating left parenthesis Q is greater than zero right parenthesis nature of the Universe, reads as\nrhaz | Q equals negative a double dot a over a dot squared equals one over alpha minus one. (two)\nwak1 | Q is greater than negative one. The cosmic scale factor in terms of the deceleration parameter may be written as\nwtfz | Constraints on power-law cosmology\nqy1i | a of t equals a sub zero of t over t sub zero raised to the one over one plus Q power. (three)\n1k9e | We observe that Q is greater than negative one is the condition for expanding Universe in the power-law cosmological model.\n5bjs | the Hubble parameter, H of t equals a dot over a equals one over one plus Q times one over t, while the present expansion rate of the Universe is given by The scale factor a and the redshift Z are connected through the relation a equals a sub zero of one plus z raised to the negative one. Therefore, the Hubble parameter in terms of the redshift may be expressed as\nuodj | The expansion history of the Universe is described by\nk16v | (four)\nb2lm | H sub zero equals one over one plus Q t sub zero one\nti7f | This shows that the expansion history of the Universe in power-law cosmology depends on the parameters H sub zero and\noksu | It may be noted that the above model is well motivated in the literature as mentioned in the previous section. However the focus has been on one parameter namely alpha or Q. But here we find the observational constraints on both parameters H sub zero and Q by subjecting the power-law cosmological model to the latest data from H of Z and S N e I a observations. We also constrain H sub zero and Q using primordial nucleosynthesis scenario.\nwtow | Three CONSTRAINTS FROM OBSERVATIONAL H of Z DATA\no22k | Simon, Verde, and Jimenez determined nine H of Z data points in the range zero less than or equal to Z less than or equal to one point eight by using the differential ages of passively evolving galaxies determined from the Gemini Deep Deep Survey and archival data. Recently, H of Z data at eleven different redshifts based on the differential ages of red-envelope galaxies were reported by Stern et al. while three more H of Z data points were obtained by Gaztanaga, Cabre, and Hui. The newly H of Z data points have been used to constrain parameters of various cosmological models. Here, we use thirteen observational H of Z data points given in Table One of the paper by Chen and Ratra and the one at Z equals zero estimated in the work by Riess et al. For this sake, we define the chi squared as",
