You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

5lm9 | The moderator opens up the space for the initial proposition in lines 1-2 by asking whether they are attracted to 'this kind of stuff. Whatever 'this kind of stuff' is, it is interpreted to be extreme, as seen in the way Dirk and Bob immediately counter it with emphatic denials (lines 4-5) and Dirk's display of non-understanding (line 7). This draws up the initial, though potentially overstated proposition that they are not at all interested in 'this kind of stuff. What is peculiar, though, is that Bob's and Dirk's denials are crafted with overly exaggerated emphatic stress and with a bit of cheeky smiling at one another, as if they are parodying the act of making a denial by protesting too much. Even Dirk's question to the moderator (line 7) is given with an inquisitive smile face, underscoring the not-being-said aspect of the conversation. This suggests that conceding something positive or of interest about promiscuous girls is something to be oriented to delicately and indirectly. For instance, in line 13, as Dirk attempts yet again to display disinterest, he hedges ('because uh ::: well ::: '), and ends up smiling at <LATEX>B o b \quad a s \quad h e</LATEX> falters to finish his turn. It is as if his soft and hedged account is a way of playing dumb <LATEX>\delta _ { b }</LATEX> crafting a weak denial that is itself designed to concede that there is perhaps something attractive or interesting in a promiscuous girl.
wp2c | Interestingly, the reasons the boys give for their disinterest have to do with her lack of attractiveness (lines 10, 17-18) and their lack of desperation (line 15). This leaves the possibility that if she were good looking enough and/or if they were more desperate, then they might be interested. As such, their denial of interest is not based in principle, but rather in particular features of the situation. Again, this underscores the concessionary element to their original denial. This is solidified more explicitly in lines 19-21 as Bob momentarily demurs with their denials and concedes that there is, after all, something attractive about this promiscuous girl ('she's got big boobs'). By equivocating back and forth with an 'off-the-record' kind of concessionary hedging and qualification, the boys are able to orient to dual concerns. The concessive repair allows them to interactively negotiate a position of not looking obviously duped into, desperate, or naïve about what might be at stake, while at the same time implying that given the right situation (the girl being attractive or them being more desperate), they would be potentially attracted to a girl whom they have characterized as promiscuous. The careful deployment of concessive repairs allows both positions to remain open; they allow them to appear sexually interested, but also knowing, in control, and thus mature in the way they display heterosexual interest.
us5v | Differentiation through caricature
rs2m | In the following excerpt, the boys differentiate themselves from guys who are only interested in girls for their looks. Showing how one does not possess certain features can be a way of differentiating oneself or resisting membership of the social categories indexed by those features (see Widdicombe & Wooffitt, 1995). One way to do this is by 'styling the other' (Rampton, 1999) through actively caricaturing their voices (see Georgakopoulou, 2002). When heard casually, the reported dialogue or 'caricature' can
uz9y | appear to position the 'other' as extreme, absurd, or problematic in some way. But the caricature need not always establish complete differentiation. Depending on its design, it may work selectively to problematize some features of the 'other', while indirectly leaving other features intact. Consider the following excerpt.
