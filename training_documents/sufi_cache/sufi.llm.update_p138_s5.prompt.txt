You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

j7hr | The rule is that:
1kxa | Something which was functional becomes prized for itself: whether it is an exercise becoming a ritual, or an individual worker becoming idolised, or a tool becoming a totem.
4414 | Whoever encourages this tendency will always find supporters, because this warp is already in the human environment, and its derivatives will seem 'right'.
36zd | On the other hand, the concept of vehicle and instrument, of not seeing the wood for the trees, and other manifestations of this possible confusion, are so well established that there will always be people who will understand the importance of thinking straight on the container and that which is contained, and on other mani- festations, including the grub-chrysalis-butterfly one.
6gx9 | The means and the end are not the same. Studies, courses and processes exist for determining, perceiving and profiting from the knowledge of 'means' and 'end *.
og9u | Do you remember Omar Khayyam saying:
hhus | 'Temples and the Kaaba of Mecca are the houses of devotion/ striking the bell is the sound of worship/the girdle and church and rosary and cross/every one is the sign of devotion.'
al6d | The tool becoming a totem is especially marked as a tendency when people want to generalise theories, laws and rules out of situations which require a greater flexibility than just one or two alternatives.
2yco | Concern and Campaign
q6tt | Q: If one feels something very strongly, is it not right to pass this on to others, to get them 'concerned', and to form bodies of people who have similar interests?
o5gz | A: Any of these things might be right, or might be wrong, entirely depending upon what the subject in question is, and who the people involved are. I would have thought this inherent in the question. You only have to look about you to see the confusion and unhappiness caused by people indulging themselves by rush- ing about worrying other people and making them worriers-and hence inefficient - when concern and propaganda are no substi- tutes for knowledge and action. However, one of the great ad- vantages of the fact that this 'wet-hen' behaviour is so widespread is that it provides almost daily illustrations of its ugliness and often destructive role, enabling us to avoid it when it is function- ing in that way.
83or | Interestingly enough, it has not always been felt that agitation and recruitment are the answers to problems, or even that one does not benefit from sustaining problems, rather than always sharing them.
w7fc | We can also meditate on the words of the Anwar-i-Suhaili - 'The Lights of Canopus' - where it is said:
7bfs | The nightingale which cannot bear the thorn
721i | It is best that it should never speak of the rose.
xefe | Above all, I think that there is a need to know whether one is right, as well as a compulsion to believe that one is right and to convince others of this. The former attitude is just as im- portant, but the latter perhaps is the one more familiar to most people.
rq12 | 'Concerned' people may be right, but they may only be satisfy- ing personal desires. To train other people to share these desires may be admissible: but only, I think, when they are recognised as
cqq5 | desires, and not represented as necessities. In the latter case, if they are in fact not truths, both deception and self-deception are taking place. Can this be good?
fg5t | THE MAN OF STRAW
xwe0 | Saadi tells in The Boston of 'A wise youth from a decent land, who joined a community of people in Darband.' He was a person of 'excellence, intelligence and discernment' and the people re- ceived him well.
i4qn | One day the chief of the pious said to him: 'Go, scatter the rubbish from the mosque!'
6zpr | The youth went outside and disappeared. When he was seen the next day, he was accused of lack of respect for service, and selfishness, for not doing the sweeping:
74l5 | 'Do you not know, O selfish infant, that men succeed through service?'
ez3l | Now these people had assumed that he saw what they saw- the dust in the mosque. But he was not a superficialist like them:
0vf4 | 'He began to weep, burning with sincerity: "I saw no dust or soil within that building .. I set off, so that the mosque should be clear of straw".'
ms9q | This man regarded himself as the pollutant of the mosque, while the others only thought of the campaign of cleaning and the concern for the superficial: even when there was no dust in the mosque, they still wanted it swept.
jcs3 | Saadi continues:
dp53 | This only is the Way of the Dervish:
luyz | To humble his person.
1mc9 | For eminence, choose humility!
leyg | For to that roof, there is no ladder but this.
gcno | The last line contains a play on words, and can also read, in the Persian: 'To that heaven there is no advance than this' ...
wd0q | Alas, people have not changed much since Saadi. Here is a sentence from a letter written to me by a famous man who is renowned for his spiritual virtues: 'I used to be proud and vain. Since I started to study Eastern teachings I am so humble you would hardly believe it.'
sxvq | Use, Misuse and Disuse of forms of Study
1n8p | Q: How can you explain the many forms in which people have attempted to teach? Since people believe in these forms, believe that they are true renditions of fact, they are enabled to reach truth through them. But is it that some are true and some are not, as the exponents of the organisations claim? If certain forms through which studies are carried out are true, are all the others false?
kx45 | A: I must have answered this question - or, rather, the ques- tions in this cluster - several hundred times, both in speech and in writing, including what I have written and quoted in books.
cp08 | The fact that such questions continue to be asked constitutes a quite remarkable demonstration of what questioners are like: some at least will ask questions even though they have been answered in accessible form dozens of times.
7av0 | But this may mean that the questions need to be answered again and again, until the answers penetrate.
wwcy | The answers, once again, are: -
0j1n | 1. Truth has no form;
riwd | 2. The means through which people may perceive Truth have forms;
umiu | 3. All forms are limited. Some of the limitations are time, place, culture, language;
tirz | 4. Different forms are not necessarily antagonistic, for the above reasons;
4cap | 5. Forms have changed through the centuries in obedience to the external world to which all forms belong;
l6m4 | 6. When people believe that the form is more important than the Truth, they will not find truth, but will stay with form;
86kg | 7. Forms are vehicles and instruments, and vehicles and instru- ments cannot be called good or bad without context;
dm6t | 8. Forms outlive their usefulness, increase or diminish in use- fulness;
j0bl | 9. These statements are abundantly to be found in the writings of Sufi teachers. They were written down in order to be read and remembered. They are seldom so energetically stated or so strongly maintained elsewhere, which may account for the fact that they have not been sufficiently heeded by people who have not given Sufi materials the study they deserve.
6j1w | The outward forms of things of the world, about which Sufis so often speak, include the forms of teaching, which must be under- stood in their inward meaning, as well as exercising an instru- mental function.
u2vl | Nasir-i-Khusru has truly said:
me1b | Your diver [for treasure] has only given you salty clay Because he has seen from you only envy.
hjw7 | Seek the meaning from the Outward like a man: Don't be like an ass, content with noise.
