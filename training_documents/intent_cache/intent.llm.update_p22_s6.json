        "content": "0lfu | Collectively, the actions you take toward self-preparation and self-management in the face of interpersonally difficult clients helps ensure that the ways in which you choose to interact with these clients will be optimally therapeutic. This decreases the likelihood that you will unwittingly act out your own negative feelings toward a difficult client. For example, a therapist once shared that she felt less guilty about precipitously changing an appointment with a client in order to meet an out-of-town friend for lunch because the client tended to behave in demanding ways and had recently questioned her approach. Changing an appointment with a client for a nonurgent matter is not a disciplined way of managing one's feelings toward a client. Moreover, changing the appointment with an already-difficult client may lead to increased tension in the relationship. Another example is the extent to which one may make special efforts on behalf of a client. It is generally easier to make these extra efforts for clients whom one likes and sees as investing a great deal in the therapy. However, depriving the difficult client or the client who is not invested in therapy of one's extra effort is not justified ethically.\ncnjl | In addition, Exercise three point one in the Activities section of this chapter provides a blank copy of this table so that you can furnish your own examples of difficult interpersonal situations, note your own reactions, and judge for yourself what would be a disciplined versus an undisciplined response.\nrtdl | Another important aspect of interpersonal self-discipline is that therapists avoid viewing the relationship as a potential source of self-esteem or as a barometer by which to measure their own interpersonal competence. Regardless of whether a relationship is successful or unsuccessful, the extent to which a therapist can truly control what occurs during a clinical interaction is limited. Therapists must keep their successes and failures in perspective and work to manage their needs to feel connected with, approved of, or celebrated by clients. Investing too much of one's own interests in having a relationship with a client can result in deep feelings of disappointment when a positive connection does not occur. Importantly, more intuitive clients may detect subtle hints toward the therapist's need for connection or approval and may withdraw further because they feel pressured or emotionally suffocated. When clients do not meet a therapist's expectations, some may detect underlying feelings of disappointment or frustration in the therapist. Through time, not keeping therapeutic relationships in perspective can also lead to emotional exhaustion or burnout in therapists.\nnorp | A final aspect of interpersonal self-discipline in the therapy process involves perspective and responsibility-taking. According to the IRM, it is the therapist's responsibility to manage the more challenging aspects of the relationship and continually strive to fortify the relationship with the client. This aspect of interpersonal self-discipline is particularly relevant to working with more frustrating clients who are interpersonally sensitive, difficult, or otherwise vulnerable. Even if a client misperceives a therapist's good intentions, attempts to break professional boundaries, or becomes upset with the therapist for no apparent reason, it is the therapist's responsibility to respond to the client in a way that is ethical and maximally therapeutic given the client's interpersonal characteristics and the circumstances of therapy. \nchx3 | Table three point four Examples of Disciplined Versus Undisciplined Responses to Interpersonally Difficult Clients\nsfcf | Principle three: It Is Necessary to Keep Head Before Heart\nnuxs | Responding to clients from the heart-that is, intuitively, spontaneously, and emotionally-should be considered an indulgence and a privilege earned by therapists rather than an entitlement. Responding from the heart must be accompanied by sufficient development of critical self-awareness and interpersonal self-discipline. With sufficient experience and practice, therapists become aware of the various types of positive therapeutic communication of which they are capable. By the same token, therapists become familiar with the many potential ways in which their communication (or lack of communication) has the potential to become nontherapeutic, psychologically risky, ambiguous, or (at worst) emotionally harmful to clients. With sufficient practice, a disciplined and systematic process of therapeutic responding becomes automatic and intuitive. Through time, therapists feel as if they are responding to their clients spontaneously\numx0 | communications is accompanied by a sophisticated process of interpersonal reasoning.\no306 | According to this principle, it is incorrect to assume that so long as your heart is in the right place you naturally react and behave appropriately in therapy. Instead, it is important to know that each of us has certain tendencies that do not always play out positively for a client simply because we care, have compassion, or can appreciate the client's life story. To be sure, these are all important attitudes for a therapist to sustain, but they are not a replacement for thoughtful self-knowledge and self-discipline.\nqm1b | Principle four: Mindful Empathy Is Required to Know Your Client\nn9ms | As reviewed in Chapter one, the centrality and importance of empathy to the client-therapist relationship is supported by several occupational therapy scholars and practitioners. A therapist's capacity for empathy is a prerequisite for a functional client-therapist relationship. However, the IRM differs from prior discussions of empathy in the\nicdp | occupational therapy literature in that it treats empathy as a mindful process rather than a predominantly affective one. The concept of mindful empathy was developed based on Heinz Kohut's nineteen eighty four underlying theory of self-psychology.\nwtse | Mindful empathy is an objective mode of observation in which the therapist comes to feel and understand a client's underlying emotions, needs, and motives while at the same time maintaining an objective viewpoint. Kohut labeled the empathic process of accessing a client's internal world \"vicarious introspection,\" and he consistently emphasized the importance of evaluating each client's experiences and behaviors from the client's unique perspective. The idea of mindful empathy, which was influenced by some\nbm7g | the meanings that he or she attaches to his or her experiences in therapy.\njr68 | According to the IRM, mindful empathy is fundamental to interpersonal reasoning. It guides both the therapist's response to interpersonal events and the therapist's efforts to sustain the therapeutic relationship. For instance, mindful empathy is necessary to interpret accurately a client's reactions to a given interpersonal event. Achieving an understanding of the client's cognitive interpretation and emotional and behavioral reactions to the event must be accomplished through empathically based listening and questioning. Although the client's interpersonal characteristics are likely to play a role in his or her interpretation and reactions to the event, assumptions about a client's reaction and needs should not be made until the client's reactions have been verified through\naxix | reflective listening and an explicit conversation about the event that has occurred. Assumptions should not be based entirely on prior knowledge of the client's interpersonal characteristics. Mindful empathy is an advanced skill in the therapist's interpersonal knowledge base. More information about this skill and examples of how therapists have employed mindful empathy in practice is presented in subsequent chapters of this book.\n05y4 | Principle five: Grow Your Interpersonal Knowledge Base\n2fb0 | Interpersonal communication is as complex as the limits of human understanding. From client to client, communication is as variegated and unique as are the differences between and within individuals, families, social networks, communities, neighborhoods, nations, cultures, geographies, climates, and governments. For these reasons, therapists benefit from knowing as much about human behavior as possible, particularly as it pertains to more commonly occurring events in the client-therapist relationship.",
