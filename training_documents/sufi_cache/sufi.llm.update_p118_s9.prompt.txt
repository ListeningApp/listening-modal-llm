You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

zeew | The superficially religious apply 'tests' for sincerity which en- able ignorance and misunderstanding to continue.
rwxl | THE BEDOUIN TEACHER
sb5f | Rumi brings us a fine analogy of this, showing how people in judging things from ignorance of the facts, come to false con- clusions.
gea4 | In this tale, a bedouin was listening to another man saying prayers. He began by repeating a passage from the Koran, where it is said, in Chapter IX ('Repentance') verses 97 onwards:
1jlx | 'The Arabs of the desert are the worst in unbelief and hy- pocrisy ... '
zf33 | Infuriated, the Arab gave him a blow on the head.
ybbd | The man at prayer continued the quotation, coming to the passage:
zwjo | ... But some of the desert Arabs believe in God and in the Last Day ..
hjzx | That's better!' said the bedouin, 'now I have taught you how to behave .. . '
ff68 | Here the bedouin stands for the superficial and assumption- prone part of the mind of the literalist religious person, whose faith' seems demonstrably based on conduct, and whose assess- ment of the faith of others is based on his own imagination of what the other person's beliefs mean.
lcmg | Rumi's bedouin-and our questioner about sincerity - could have made this test, had they known of it, to think of the aphorism:
lq9c | 'If you think that you are not self-deluded, just check whether you think well of yourself or not.'
bir8 | The Would-Be and Should-be people
i2k7 | THERE can be all the difference in the world between the would-be followers of the Tradition and the should-be followers.
suwg | Each of them may have the necessary capacity.
vikl | The should-be ones could very well never have heard of meta- physics. They could even hate the idea of esotericism. Nowadays there are still very many people who have no ideas about-nor interest in - religion, mysticism, 'things of the mind': though they are fewer every day.
mtia | The would-be ones are those who have been attracted at some time or other to a scrap of genuine inner activity. They may have met some person, engaged in some such activity, read some litera- ture. They are would-bes because they believe that because they have heard about something, might even have tried to practise it, for that reason they have a right to it.
ecym | In general, close contact with the would-be shows that his interest is comparatively shallow. He is guilty, as the psychologist would claim, of desiring a system which fits in with preconcep- tions, seeking no more than to achieve any kind of personal equilibrium.
smx6 | He may have the capacity. Most frequently he does not have the necessary attitude. He will tend, of course, to believe that he has got the right attitude. He will accuse others of not having it
1hnf | Both types need education in Sufi evolutionary philosophy, initially by means of familiarisation with its viewpoints and some of its materials. This is difficult because few general- purpose expositions of this material exist contrary to the popularised belief that 'it must be in books': or, 'I won't bother with books, but I will get it from someone in the flesh.' But this is why there are, and always have been, Sufi schools. This is one reason why the schools take, to the crude ob- server, mystifyingly diverse outward forms.
7nua | As the Akhlaq-i-Muhsini says:
y2rt | The bird which knows not of sweet water Has his beak in salt water all the year.
f5lz | IS YOUR BEAK IN SALT WATER?
cdcu | This salt water, in the mind of the Sufi, is what is otherwise called 'The World'. The ordinary person imagines that that which he more instandy perceives, like material objects and obvious (to him) thoughts, must logically be what is more real. But the Sufi says that so-called concrete things are not experienced but inferred.
8zkf | You infer fire from smoke, and smoke may appear to be real, but its underlying reality is the fire. When this habit of assuming that instandy perceptible things are more important than more subde ones goes, the latter become perceptible. Sufi study is de- voted to this task.
kcxe | It is for this reason that the great Sheikh Abdul-Karim Jili says:
ve8e | Truth, reality [al-Haqq] is felt, perceived:
yyym | The world is inferred [ma'qulun].
xgow | As long as one regards what are in fact secondary things (including one's secondary, conditioned self) as primary, the subtler but more real primary element - Reality and the Essence of the individual - will not be perceived.
31z2 | A MEETING WITH THREE DERVISHES
czp3 | I met three dervishes in the Middle East, and asked them whether they had ever encountered any Seekers from the West. 'Frequendy* they told me. I asked them if they ever taught these people anything. 'This is what happens' one them said. 'They come to us and say "Teach us", and we start to try, sitting before them or leaving them there and retreating to communicate by direct per- ception.' I wondered what happened next. 'Always the same thing. After two or three days they set off again, complaining that we are not doing what we said we would do.'
kqfo | Satisfactions and Purpose of Ritual
7hgo | Q: We see people all over the world deriving satisfactions from ritual. How can we get beyond ritual?
0g5b | A: Initiation and celebratory rituals carried out by religions, societies and other groupings can have various-very different - origins, purposes and functions.
qdgv | We might liken all these purposes, origins and functions to, say the various processes which are known to and carried out in any given science. In chemistry, distillation is not the same as fermen- tation; the use of alkalis is not the same as the use of acids. There is both industrial and research chemistry.
7bvf | In the case of the science of man, there are similar distinctions.
q4ev | WHEN RITUALISM STARTS
4vmp | When the knowledge of these distinctions disappears, ritualism takes over, or else the limited use of such processes. When the use and possibility is limited, the effect is slight: it may even be harmful. As Saadi says: 'Though the fire-worshipper may tend his flame for a hundred years, if he falls into it, he will be killed.'
vk6x | Take prayer. When prayers are carried out among people with a certain preparation, and when due regard is taken for such things as correct attunement, there will be one effect of prayer. If people are encouraged to pray without these or other elements, their prayer may become a psychotherapeutic tool: immensely valuable, but nonetheless at a lower level than its optimum function.
i27n | EMOTION MISTAKEN FOR HIGHER FEELINGS
psyx | In such a case, emotional feelings are mistaken for spiritual ones. The only objection to such an activity is that a person or com- munity triggered to associating prayer with emotion will be al-
gdhe | most incapable of developing further, because the conditioning invariably elicited by the sight, sound or participation in prayer will be an emotional one.
rf7l | Communities and individuals reared in the emotional and con- ditioned use of rituals and other procedures have to undergo a reorientation before they can perceive a higher content in such observances.
xvsx | This is difficult, because such people generally seek a deepening of their familiar experience, not an improvement upon it.
cs88 | Saadi says, in his Boston: 'Do not expect, my child, a reward from Omar, when you are working in the house of Zaid.'
kgsq | DEFINITION OF A SUFI
xe2x | To learn, people must give up a great deal, and this includes ritual as something from which they imagine they might learn. It is to emphasise this that Abu-Yaqub al-Susi, quoted in Kalabadhi's Taaruf, states that the Sufi is 'One who does not care when some- thing is taken from him, but who does not cease to seek for what he has not.'
