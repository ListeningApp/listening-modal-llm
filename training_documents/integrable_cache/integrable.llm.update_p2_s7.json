        "content": "yeoh | On the basis of standard kinetic arguments, J sub N is expected to be a function of a single compound variable, the effective length xi equals L over ell expressed in units of the mean free path ell of the quasi particles,\nb8hf | J sub N of L comma epsilon equals j sub N of L over ell. (Three)\nhntf | For xi much greater than one, we expect j sub N of xi proportional to one over xi, meaning that the flux is the result of a standard diffusive process, while j sub N of zero is a finite value, meaning that the process is ballistic for system sizes smaller than the mean free path left parenthesis xi much less than one right parenthesis. j sub N of xi dependence is captured by the simple effective formula\n99fo | j sub N of xi equals fraction j sub zero over r plus xi. (Four)\ny5r7 | where r is a constant accounting for the boundary resistance and j sub zero is a suitable additional constant.\nlrry | The vicinity to the integrable limit manifests itself as a divergence of the mean free path, which we account for by assuming ell approximately equals epsilon to the power of negative theta, where theta greater than zero is a system-dependent\nhvhm | exponent. As long as J sub A of L comma epsilon does not display any singularity for epsilon approaching zero, we can neglect its dependence on epsilon for epsilon much less than one. Therefore, for large L, Eq. (Two) can be rewritten as\n863b | J of L comma epsilon approximately equals fraction c sub N over L epsilon to the power of theta plus fraction c sub A over L to the power of one minus eta. (Five)\nfj24 | where C sub N and c sub A are two suitable parameters. Accordingly, the anomalous contribution prevails only above the crossover length ell sub c approximately equals epsilon to the power of negative theta over eta. For L less than or equal to ell sub c, heat conduction is dominated by the j sub N. In particular, within the range left bracket ell equals epsilon to the power of negative theta, ell sub c right bracket an apparent normal conductivity is expected, which is nothing but a finite size effect.\nuz3c | Now, we start the numerical analysis, focusing on models of the class (One). More specifically, we shall consider the chain with inter-\nd5bi | U sub T of y equals left parenthesis e to the power of negative y plus y minus one right parenthesis. The HPG dynamics consists of successive tween neighboring particles according to the kinematic rules\nba4l | u sub i prime equals fraction m sub i minus m sub i plus one over m sub i plus m sub i plus one u sub i plus fraction two m sub i plus one over m sub i plus m sub i plus one u sub i plus one quad comma u sub i plus one prime equals fraction two m sub i over m sub i plus m sub i plus one u sub i minus fraction m sub i minus m sub i plus one over m sub i plus m sub i plus one u sub i plus one comma (Six)\nffx8 | where u sub n equals dot q sub n and the primed variables denote the values after the collision. Simulations are very efficient since they only require keeping track of the collisions.\ns6su | For equal masses left parenthesis m sub n equals m right parenthesis, both models are completely integrable: in the HPG, the constants of motion are the initial velocities, while in the Toda model the conserved actions are given functions of positions and momenta. Both models can be seen as gases of quasi-particles: velocitons for HPG and solitons for Toda. Transport is ballistic: kappa of L is proportional to L and the energy-current correlation function does not decay to zero at large times. Note that, according to the classification of the reference, the two models are noninteracting and interacting, respectively.",
