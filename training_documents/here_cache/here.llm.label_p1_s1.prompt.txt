You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

1pjs | ONE WHERE IS HERE?
o2kr | I t is hard to know what to do about a world beset by struggles of ethnic na- tionalism, hardening of racial lines, and staggering divides between wealth and poverty. For my part as a teacher, I have to wonder at what we are to teach the young about such a world. How do we help them understand why differences of color and culture, gender and nationality continue to have such profound consequences? It won't do to fall back on the old lessons, to tell stu- dents that such differences are simply a fact of life, to tell them that the sus- picion and distrust with which these differences are often regarded are the product of sheer ignorance. They are unlikely to be reassured that only for want of an education much like the one they are receiving, the world suffers such discord and division. They might, however, appreciate how this faith in education would help teachers through their own day.
v6sk | Perhaps it is time to turn the tables on education in trying to make sense of this divided world. After all, our schooling has not been so much the great redeemer of prejudices as the tireless chronicler of what divides us. Education is no small player in giving meaning to these differences. We are schooled in differences great and small, in borderlines and boundaries, in historical strug- gles and exotic practices, all of which extend the meaning of difference. We are taught to discriminate in both the most innocent and fateful ways so that we can appreciate the differences between civilized and primitive, West and East, first and third worlds. We become adept at identifying the distinguish- ing features of this country, that culture, those people. We are educated in what we take to be the true nature of difference. Yet if education can turn a studied distance between people into a fact of nature, education can also help
1wj6 | us appreciate how that distance has been constructed to the disadvantage of so many people. What has been learned can be learned again, and the time is right for such a project.
936l | On June 30, 1997, the already wasted British Empire could be said to have gasped its last. Making a good show of closing one of history's great acts. Great Britain ceremoniously returned Hong Kong, the last of its major colo- nial outposts, to China. The territories were restored to China after I58 years of occupation, having been ceded to Britain following the infamous Opium War that revealed, among the many guises of British imperialism, the em- pire's role as drug pusher. Of course, the events of that final day in June were largely symbolic, as the sun had set on the British Empire long before the British government offices turned out the lights for the final time. Most of the attention was spent on what China would do with this cosmopolitan, in- ternational city. The whole thing might have been mistaken as a celebration of imperialism's accomplishment. Britain's foreign secretary during those final years, Douglas Hurd, boasted, "What we gave back at midnight on June 30 was one of the miracles of achievement in the modern world. Achievements, I hasten to add, not primarily by the British but by the people of Hong Kong" (1997).
06yq | Although minor British colonies remain to this day, from Bermuda to the Falkland Islands, the empire was not to survive the century it began at the height of its powers, when it spanned roughly a quarter of the globe in population and land mass. Britain was the largest of a series of European em- pires that in the last five centuries managed to annex the Western Hemi- sphere, foster a global slave trade, divide the African continent, and create a revolution in the arts and sciences. What so recently came to an end on Hong Kong Island in the South China Sea, in the colony that hung on the lip of the great divide between East and West, is something we will have to live with well into the next millennium. The empire is no more, in fact. Long live the Empire.
dpv6 | In more than one sense, the educational project of postcolonialism in the West is only beginning. Although the process of decolonization began in earnest after the Second World War with the repeated successes of the inde- pendence movements, the West has barely begun to see beyond the divisions generated by the same sensibilities that drove imperial expansion over the face of the globe. This book on education at empire's end examines one powerful source of those divisions. It is about imperialism's influence on the educated view of the world that the West cultivated during the era of empire. We need to learn again how five centuries of studying, classifying, and ordering hu- manity within an imperial context gave rise to peculiar and powerful ideas of
8r5j | race, culture, and nation that were, in effect, conceptual instruments that the
2taz | West used both to divide up and to educate the world. This can help us un- derstand why the rather inept explorer and missionary David Livingstone in- sisted on having a magic lantern among the scientific instruments, clothing, and other supplies hauled by his twenty-seven porters: it wasn't enough for him to attempt to fill in the European map of Africa; he had also, as one bi- ographer puts it, "to blind his African audiences with science and Christian- ity" (T. Holmes, 1993, p. 75).
o3ya | Given the enormity of imperialism's educational project and its relatively recent demise, it seems only reasonable to expect that this project would live on, for many of us, as an unconscious aspect of our education. After all, the great colonial empires came to a reluctant end only during the years when I and the rest of the postwar generation were being schooled. It may take gen- erations to realize all that lies buried in this body of knowledge as a way of knowing the world. In attempting to make a small contribution to that proc- ess, this book has postcolonial, or, perhaps more precisely, postimperial pre- tensions, even as it maintains a decidedly Eurocentric focus on the West's educational project for the world. But then, such a contribution seems to me to be the responsibility of one who has been so thoroughly shaped by this legacy and whose work as a teacher has been to be part of its shaping of others.
r5il | I have to say that this concern with imperialism's educational project has also fostered in me an appreciation for imperialism's learned achievement. There can be little question of the scientific value of James Cook's expeditions to the Pacific and Darwin's voyage on the Beagle for fields as diverse as ento- mology and astronomy. This is not, however, all that their endeavors have to teach us. And I now realize that for every Cook and Darwin, there were thou- sands of other earnest and adventurous souls gathering pieces of what was seen as the great jigsaw puzzle of nature. What comes, we now have to ask, of having one's comprehension of the world so directly tied to one's conquest of it? Much of the knowledge achieved through conquest and colonization was understood to legitimate the political and cultural domination of imperial- ism. The resulting perspective on the world formed an educational legacy that we have now to reconsider. We cannot readily sort through and discard the
5gui | WHERE IS HERE?
82qc | colonially tainted understandings we carry, without devoting attention to how our view of the world has been shaped by imperialism's educational proi ects, which included fostering a science and geography of race; renaming a good part of the world in homage to its adventurers' homesick sense of place- and imposing languages and literatures on the colonized in an effort to teach them why they were subservient to a born-to-rule civilization.
ls7d | Given the wonderful spectacles of learning, from arboretums to zoos that were established under imperialism's patronage, it is not hard to argue that the whole venture had about it something of a great public education project intent on bringing the world together under the roof of European learning. I think it is fair to say that what Edward Said wrote of the field of study known as orientalism is no less true of imperialism as a whole: "It is ... a distribution of geopolitical awareness into aesthetic, scholarly, economic. sociological, historical, and philological texts" (1978, p. 12). The educational itinerary of the extended and profoundly successful field trip of imperialism is "rendered in Said's own exuberant cataloging of orientalism's scholarly project;
tzt3 | 1 to dignify all knowledge collected during the colonial occupation with the title "contribution to modern learning" when the natives had nei- ther been consulted nor treated as anything except as pretexts for a text whose usefulness was not to the natives; to feel oneself as a European in command, almost at will, of Oriental history, time, and geography; to institute new areas of specialization; to establish new disciplines; to di- vide, deploy, schematize, tabulate, index, and record everything in sight (and out of sight); to make out of every observable detail a generaliza- tion and out of every generalization an immutable law about the Ori- ental nature, temperament, mentality, custom, or type; and above all to transmute living reality into the stuff of texts, to possess (or think one possesses) actuality mainly because nothing in the Orient seems to resist one's powers. (p. 86)
t8vv | This book seeks, then, to extend Said's inspiring critique of orientalism to what I am framing as the educational legacy of imperialism, a legacy that has shaped many of our ideas about education, a legacy that continues to play a small but significant part in what the young learn of the world.
qvnu | The problem today is not that schools are insensitive or unresponsive to the legacy of imperialism as it takes the form, for example, of a scientifically underwritten racism. I will examine how the textbooks used in biology, his- tory, and English classes, which once could be expected to depict stereotypi- cal racial types and national identities, now display a new multicultural sen- sitivity that teaches students about race as a form of culture in social studies, whereas the topic of race has been largely dropped from their biology classes. V
kggw | In English classes, students read works that movingly depict personal strug- gles against discrimination, without gaining any sense of how English litera- ture was used to teach people their distance from the center of civilization. The textbooks of my own school days made it apparent that the academic disciplines were in the front lines when it came to fixing the distinctions be- tween the natives and the Europeans; they made it clear that the educational project was about extending the gift of civilization. By ignoring how the arts and sciences have contributed to the significance of race, culture, and gender, the school leaves students to wonder how in the world these differences took on the considerable significance they still hold. This book speaks to the edu- cated about their education in the ways of the world, and it does so on behalf of the yet-to-be-educated.
xrd1 | I do not imagine that such critical scrutiny will dry up the wells of racism or end the neocolonial forms of exploitation that remain imperialism's after- math. But whatever its impact, I think that the young are owed an explana- tion of how such divisions have come to mean so much and of how the schooling of only a generation ago, during the final days of the colonial em- pires, was still teaching us to divide the world in very troubling ways. One may argue that dragging up this past can only spoil the chances that the young will start with a clean slate. Yet educators would seem obliged to con- sider their sources, to consider how the forces of good and evil have worked their way through education. I think we have to consider how this, too, forms part of the past that we have inherited, part of what has prevailed in our finest educational institutions. Schools have offered students little help in fathom- ing why this sense of difference in race, culture, and nation is so closely woven into the fabric of society. As a result, students have been relatively unaware of such government measures as the racial restriction of access to voting, immi- gration, and public services until not so long ago.2 They need to see that such divisions have long been part of the fabric and structure of the state, includ- ing the schools, and they need to appreciate that challenging the structuring of those differences requires equally public acts of refusing their original and intended meanings.
5746 | How these sometimes subtle imperial themes of difference and identity
7toz | continue to play themselves out in the lives of the young can be heard in th words of a group of students with whom I worked in a Vancouver high school on a study of electronic communications.3 Kathy Chin, for example, w preparing an introductory E-mail message for a student in Australia when stopped to talk to her about the process, only to find her opening lines catch. ing me off guard as they raised for me the issues of identity and location. "First let me tell you about myself. My parents came here from Hong Kong (I'm Chinese) about twenty years ago and I was born here in Vancouver. I have never lived anywhere else but I have traveled a lot."
j346 | The point Kathy made about who she was struck me as both banal and extraordinary. This was who she was, yet what she said spoke to a history that was still present for all of us. To identify oneself as having been born in Canada while remaining parenthetically Chinese echoes a colonial history that determined whose home Canada was to be, even as imperialism engaged the Chinese of the diaspora in the business of empire; it speaks to the barri- ers that imperialism constructed between East and West out of a compound of race, ethnicity, and nationality, as well as gender in the West's feminized conception of the Oriental as other. This may be too much to make Kathy's comments bear, but she was not alone in this self-identification; others among her classmates recognized themselves as indelibly Chinese in Canada:
v8uq | As to my appearance I'm chinese and very short 5'2", or 5'3" actually. Obviously I have long black hair parted down the middle and brown eyes. (Anne Lee)
x972 | I have black eyes and hair. As you can tell from my last name you should know that I am Chinese. ... I was born in Taiwan and moved to Costa Rica when I was in grade two. Later when I was in grade four I moved to Canada. (Sarah Huang)
cwrw | . You probably wouldn't know that [I] am Chinese. I have one of the strangest names in the world, but at least if someone asked, "Where's Sterling?" nobody would say, "Sterling who?" (Sterling Tan)
4i0e | What lessons should the school be teaching, I wondered, about the his- torical depth and intricacy of the great divide that these students continue to live out? How might it help them understand the histories carried in these innocent acts of self-identification? It was not that the question of identity
h2l3 | was missing from the school curriculum. Students have long had lessons on who is and who is not a member of this imagined community known as Canada.4 These lessons do their share to make each student, in effect, "a pré- cis of all the past," as Antonio Gramsci framed it: "For each individual is the synthesis not only of existing relations, but the history of these relations" (1971, P. 353). A strong source of light that the schools can throw on "the his- tory of these relations," I argue, is found in reviewing imperialism's educa- tional project.
