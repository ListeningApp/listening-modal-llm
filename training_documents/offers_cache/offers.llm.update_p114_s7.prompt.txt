You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

49ye | ... a low inflammation food company to give me discounts for their products ($50 savings)
850s | ... discounts for braces and orthotics ($150 savings)
yusd | ... a local health club down the street to give me a personal training session for free and a free month of membership to their pool ($100 Value)
noq3 | ... discounts on pharmaceutical drugs from the local pharmacist ($100/mo in savings)
kdhu | ... repeat the above for multiple service providers (so perhaps I get ten chiropractors to all give me a free adjustment, now I have ten free adjustments in my bundle.
o8es | ... Etc
2k63 | Now if my offer was $400, then the value of these free bonuses ALONE is worth more than the $400.
p1p2 | As if that weren't already awesome enough, if you really want to be a jedi, negotiate a group discount and a commission to yourself. This is exactly what we did with our supplement company. Our gym owner clients who use our sister supplement company Prestige Labs sponsored athletes get a 30% discount on our products, on top of that, the sponsored athlete gets paid 40% of all sales netted after the applied discount.
muok | So it's a win-win for everyone. Their clients get it for 30% less than our main site. They get paid for giving away exclusive discounts. And we get customers in exchange for the commission paid. Everyone wins.
qozi | If you are following along, each of these bonuses can become revenue streams for you indirectly by getting clients to say YES more easily, and directly because you can negotiate that each of these businesses can pay you for the people you send their way.
801o | So let's also say we negotiated the following "affiliate commissions" for making the introduction to these businesses.
6u6r | ... the chiro gives you $100 per person who comes into their office
8jhi | ... the food company gives you free food (yum!)
n2bw | ... orthotics company gives you $100 per person referred
lrko | ... health club gives you a free membership OR $50 per person who signs up
pe0m | ... pharmacy gives you $100 per person
d3h0 | Now let's look at how much money we made ... our $400 offer now has the possibility of making us an extra $350 ... pure
vb88 | profit! That's the beauty of these relationships. The other businesses will pay you and you don't have to do anything but refer customers to them that you have already spent the money to acquire.
0dzg | And if you really want to get crazy, come up with a grand slam offer with these partner businesses by using the same concepts in the book so that each of the bonuses themselves becomes even more valuable than a simple commoditized service.
qrj3 | Free Gift #8: BONUS ... on ... BONUSES
erv1 | There are a million and one ways to use bonuses in your offers. You can get people to act faster. You can price anchor and product anchor (little known). You can get more people to say yes than you otherwise would. If you want to a live deep dive with me on this, go to Acquisition.com/training/offers and select "Bonus Creation" to watch a short video tutorial. I also have a Free Bonus Checklist I use when creating offers. Swipe it for your own business on the house!
4u8c | Summary
m3ho | We want to employ bonuses because they expand the price to value discrepancy and get people to purchase who otherwise wouldn't. They massively increase the prospects' perception of the value of our offer. So here's what to do:
pse1 | 1. Create checklists, tools, swipe files, scripts, templates, and anything else that would take lots of time and effort to create on one's own, but is easy to use once created. Anything that you can invest in one time that clearly cost time or money to create, but can be given away endless time is a perfect fit for a bonus.
9wyj | 2. Beyond that, make a habit to record every workshop, every webinar, every event, every interview and use them as additional bonuses (as needed to crush a perceived obstacle).
hmko | 3. Proactively negotiate group discounts and a referral commission with adjacent businesses that solve needs your customer will have as a result of beginning this process with you. What's the next natural thing they might want? Go to those businesses, get a deal for them they could never get for themselves (because you are negotiating with the purchasing power of all your customers at once, very powerful).
tsxi | Author Note: The longer you are in business the more of these bonus assets you will have at your disposal. All of these things are valuable. Put them in a vault and keep them in your back pocket to sprinkle into an offer to get the deal closed. Information products work very well here because they have high perceived value, low cost, and zero operational effort besides giving an additional login. Tickets to virtual experiences or events work too. Same goes for a higher level of service that has a fixed cost like giving someone VIP service for a month (which also doubles as a way of upselling them into that level of service to keep them on it . . . more on that in Book II.)
fidk | What should be a bonus vs part of the core offer if I am the one fulfilling it?
ju2k | Short answer: Wow Factor - in other words - something you wouldn't want someone to miss. Many times you have so much "stuff" you will be providing your customers (good thing) that valuable nuggets can get lost in the mix. You want to take the most distinct ones that can almost stand on their own and pull those out to highlight them. This is especially true for things that are short in length but high in quality or value. Checklists or infographics can condense a lot of information into a small space. Someone might not feel justified paying lots of money for a product launch map (for example) but as a bonus would be perceived as very valuable.
wldo | Next Up ...
ct9a | We have our core offer. We are presenting it in a way to increase scarcity and urgency to increase the likelihood they want it even more. We stacked the bonuses of our offer to make the price to value discrepancy out of this world and break our prospects' minds. Next on our magical journey will be addressing the big elephant in the room ... risk. We will completely obliterate it using a combination of guarantees so they have no reason not to buy.
rh8p | ENHANCING THE OFFER: GUARANTEES
vopc | "You're gonna like the way you look ... I guarantee it."
k4qz | MEN'S WAREHOUSE AD THAT RAN FOREVER.
k3w9 | GUARANTEES WORTH THER WEIGHT IN GOLD
lijr | T he single greatest objection for any product or service being sold is ... drum roll ... risk. Risk that it doesn't do what it's supposed to do for them. Therefore, reversing risk is an immediate way to make any offer more attractive. You will want to spend a disproportionate amount of time figuring out how you want to reverse it. That being said, how much more attractive can a guarantee make an offer?
43dz | Jason Fladlien, who I referenced earlier, once stated that he had seen the conversion on an offer <LATEX>2 - 4 x</LATEX> simply by changing the quality of the guarantee. It's that important.
fyrt | From an overarching perspective there are four types of guarantees:
2nsv | 1. Unconditional
uqlj | 2. Conditional
013l | 3. Anti-Guarantee
4flw | 4. Implied Guarantees.
pzyx | You must always hit your guarantee hard, even if you don't have one. Say it boldly and give the reason why.
qc4k | But won't people take advantage of a crazy guarantee?
btsb | Sometimes, but not usually. That being said, you must understand the math. If you close 130 percent as many people, and your refund percentage doubles from 5 percent to 10 percent, you've still made 1.23x the money, or 23 percent more, and that all goes to the bottom line.
