        "content": "qy1i | Three. ECOTHERAPY\n1k9e | In addition to carbon awareness in traditional health care, patients may seek unconventional ecotherapy. Ecotherapy is not necessarily sustainable, but it has environmental resonance. Ecotherapy may encompass \"prescriptions for nature\" such as walks in a forest, going outside more, attending a nature retreat, or participating in other forms of open-air recreation. While the medicalization of nature is problematic, as it may lead to instrumentalization, many patients find\n5bjs | medical legitimacy through the word \"therapy\" and retain use of the term. To be sure, patients may still utilize traditional medicine and may not be concerned with reducing their impact on the environment. In fact, if ecotherapy is used as a conjunctive to traditional medicine it can require more total resources. This inconsistency is part and parcel of health care; even as some patients try to be healthier in one area of life, such as not smoking, they may flout health care wisdom in other areas, like physical activity.\nuodj | B. Physicians\nk16v | The notion of activism - particularly in the environmental movement - often invokes the image of protests, people holding signs, chaining themselves to a tree, or acts of civil disobedience that may result in arrest. While using the label \"activist\" in ecology may be viewed by some as synonymous with a liberal agenda, white privilege, or even a eugenic Malthusianism, physician activism in environmental initiatives is frequently indicative of a dedication to the health of all, not just the elite few. Physicians for Social Responsibility have been active for over fifty years. As the group developed, an \"Environment and Health Committee\" was added as an area of focus. Topics under this banner include environmental concerns such as fracking, climate and health, and clean energy. PSR are motivated by activism on \"issues that represent the gravest dangers to human health.\" Doctor activists also urge the nation to act on climate change and draft position papers on climate change and health.\nb2lm | Physicians are concerned with the amount of waste they emit in the course of their work; with the structural design of their health care facilities; and with the toxicity of their work environment. The University of Nebraska Medical Center began a Green Health Center project almost two decades ago with the objective to \"engage in educational and research programs that support this aim (of sustainability) and to begin the process of redesigning our own institution toward sustainability.\" Other medical centers, particularly those affiliated with universities, have followed by developing their own pathways to greener health care facilities. Green health centers across the country are supported by physician leadership and maintained by policies and practices within hospitals.\nti7f | Three. GREEN TEAMS\noksu | Green Teams are a smaller group of health care professionals who may or may not be situated within a\nwtow | Green Health Center. At the Massachusetts General Hospital for Children at Harvard Medical School, a Green Team of medical professionals were organized \"to develop high impact strategies towards the creation of a zero-carbon emissions model in the pediatric intensive care unit.\" The Green Team collected waste and itemized the excess. By identifying areas for waste reduction - such as returning unused equipment to a storage space - they were able to reduce their waste while providing excellent patient care.\no22k | Four. GREEN PRESCRIPTIONS\nnwfz | Some physicians attempt to green their prescribing practices through a mixture of preventative health care advice and low-carbon treatments. It is widely documented that plant-based diets have numerous health benefits and are less resource intensive than meat based diets. In recognition of this, some physicians are recommending plant based diets as a medical standard for global carbon reduction and better health outcomes. Maximilian Andreas Storz declares, \"plant-based diets are a powerful tool - not using and advocating for them is not only unethical, but harms patients and the planet alike.\" Vegetarian and vegan diets have become more prevalent in society and thus more accessible. Green prescriptions combine the legitimacy of physician-directed advice with environmental ethics.\nnvfy | Five. EDUCATION\nmror | Physicians provide education to peers through Grand Rounds, on-the-job training, and in continuing education. Medical educators argue that \"health care providers require training on the connections between the climate, ecosystems, sustainability, and health and their responsibility and capacity in changing the status quo,\" which is largely wasteful. In an effort to support this education, Dr. Rebecca Philipsborn at the Emory School of Medicine has developed a virtual four-week Climate Change and Health curriculum, which includes topics and syllabi to be implemented in other medical schools. It should also be noted that the UK also has a significant amount of curriculum development around sustainable health care.\nzlxc | Other educational resources include articles on functionally green initiatives, which may employ concepts such as \"Choosing wisely,\" not using \"Too Much Medicine,\" avoiding \"do not do\" practices, optimizing \"high value care,\" or minimizing its opposite - \"low value care.\" Publications written in different countries are accessed by those in the United States, thus reflecting the culturally relevant reach of green physician education.\nk0bw | Three. Rationale for Participation in Green Initiatives\naq5a | Highlighting the green initiatives that patients and physicians participate in and probing their motivations for such participation permits strategic development of areas of consensus in sustainable health care, which can lead to green health care reform. This section speculates on broad trends in participation in green health care initiatives. Patients appear to participate in green initiatives based on a valuing of nature and the desire to reduce health care issues. Doctor participation in green health care initiatives stems from an investment in health promotion and discomfort with wasteful hospital practices.\nsc5y | A. Patients\n0yab | Sustainability is important to patients. Patient involvement in sustainable health care - as with other pro-environmental actions - may be driven by a concern for nature having intrinsic worth, or the assessment that nature has instrumental worth. In the former, nature should be preserved for the good it has in itself. This is similar to a \"deep ecology\" perspective, where animals and plants are independently valuable. In the latter, individuals want to enjoy nature, use natural resources, or have these opportunities available for future human generations. Both the non-anthropocentric and anthropocentric perspectives guard against overuse of health care resources in order to create a better environment.\nw95z | Two. REDUCE HEALTH ISSUES\n0i1k | \"Climate change anxiety\" has emerged as a new mental health issue affecting those who worry pathologically about the deteriorating planet. Patient participation in green initiatives may be an attempt to manage climate change anxiety, or it can be part of therapy for dealing with anxiety. Climate change anxiety may be regarded as an American luxury, whereas psychological issues arising from climate change health hazards - such as post-traumatic stress from climate events and fear of experiencing future climate change health hazards - require global attention. However, the entire spectrum of health care issues related to environmental destruction warrant attention. By reducing resource use in health care, patients may be able to minimize health issues associated with climate change.\ndqlg | B. Physicians\np6pq | One. HEALTH PROMOTION\nzse6 | It could easily be argued that a doctor's primary motivation for practicing medicine is the health and\np2n3 | wellbeing of patients. Since climate change is a recognized health threat, some professionals see it as their obligation to practice sustainability measures in order to reduce the effects of climate change. Patient health could be subsumed into the broader obligations toward public health, the commitment to the healing profession, and professionalism. Physicians who participate in green initiatives may do so as a matter of personal integrity and professional responsibility.\nohh7 | Effective health care reform will require compliance across the board.",
