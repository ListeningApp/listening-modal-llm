Moving beyond the workplace and productivity, computing takes on numerous varied roles: leisure, socializing, gaming and sport, sensing and expressing emotion, cultural production and meaning making, etc. As computing moved \"off the desktop\" into smartphones, mp3 players, cars, tablets, etc., it moved into myriad other facets of our lives. These developments constitute HCI in yet another way:\nncb0 | One. A human is a person engaging in (a set of) sociocultural practices embedded within numerous broader contexts, including cultural, historical, political, organizational, etc.\n8mp0 | Two. A computer is a technological system that may consist of a single device, a constellation of devices, an infrastructure, or a more complex assemblage that arises from and is embedded within a particular set of contexts.\nxjyk | Three. An interaction is the experience of leveraging a technological system in the course of an individually, socially, or culturally meaningful practice.\nmt0f | Ultimately, the model is of a human using technology to engage in socioculturally situated practices.\nawab | Thus, the third wave user becomes a person using technology to engage in socioculturally situated practices (commerce, leisure, artistic performance, sport, etc.). Work along these lines includes situations involving one user and\nixcc | Interactive Design Methodologies\n8p6h | one device (e.g., me and my smartphone), multiple users at one device (e.g., large shared displays), one user with multiple devices (e.g., how I manage data across my smartphone, tablet, laptop, and server), and multiple users with multiple devices (e.g., almost any kind of ubicomp system). In each of these configurations, the user remains paramount. This focus can be seen, for instance, in the emphasis on user experience, or in BÃ¸dker's interest in \"the work that the human user does to make multiple objects and mediators work together.\"\npmgl | How the Ideology of the User Empowers and Constrains\n90no | The comparison of the three waves of HCI in the previous section shows important differences and striking commonalities. Despite shifts in the disciplinary traditions invoked, in the methods applied, and in the technologies of interest, we see continued ideological focus on the user. While the scope expands-to include organizational context in second wave and sociocultural context in third wave- the analytic focus remains the user. Technology wants users, and HCI wants to see people as users.\njt0y | The ideology of the user does not refer to an imperialist urge to encourage all persons everywhere to adopt a given technology (although this is a dominant trend in HCI). Rather, it is the requirement that, if we want to talk about a person meaningfully within HCI, we need to be able to talk about them as a user.\nqb7o | An Example\noae5 | For instance, consider photo-sharing on social media. Third wave work would certainly acknowledge the cultural embeddedness of this activity. A given design may allow a photographer to capture and/or express elements of the experience in which the photos were taken. And what of the person who appears in the photo? S/he can comment on the photo, tag or untag her/his likeness in the photo, request to have the photo taken down, post her/his own photos in response, or engage in other socioculturally meaningful practices. All this functionality, though, becomes unavailable if the person in the photograph does not have (or wish to create) an account. In other words, for the design to account for the person who appears in the photo, s/he must be treated as a user. Similar examples can be found in second wave HCI, e.g., group calendaring succeeding by first giving each member of the group an individual motivation to become a user. This tendency to user-ify is quite understandable. In some ways, \"user\" is the most (or perhaps even the only) meaningful way we have of talking about or accounting for the human(s) in human-computer interaction. If someone is not a user, why would we be talking about them, let alone designing for them?\ns0fl | Empowerment\n43ia | The structure of the user provides important value within HCI discourse and practice. The user not only gives us a vocabulary for talking about the human elements of computing, but it also enables us to account for them in\n3g2y | design. Numerous central concepts within the field-user studies, user-centered design, user experience-are made possible via the rhetorical construct of the user. Furthermore, thinking about users not in the abstract but as specific individual people can allow designers to move from generalities to specificities, i.e., it can facilitate the incorporation of human elements into computing design. Moreover, this impetus to user-ify resonates with our goals of empowerment; if \"HCI tools and methods can be used to help the under-served, under-resourced, and under- represented,\" we can accomplish number chi for good one.\ngc7v | Constraints\nwqfv | However, while the ideology of the user enables and empowers, it simultaneously limits and constrains. By providing focus and clarity with respect to users, a myopic fixation on the user limits our ability to see other configurations of interaction with computers, particularly in relationships that sit outside the bounds of what we would likely refer to as \"use\".\nj30a | The constraints imposed by the ideology of the user are enacted via multiple means. One of the most foundational questions in user-centered design, \"Who are your users?\" suggests that users are the (only) people in which you might be interested. To give someone meaningfully important consideration in HCI, they must first be user-ified, regardless of the appropriateness of that appellation. Documentation can enact similar constraints, providing a sort of technological paratext that prescribes the particular relationships that one can have (as well as those relationships one should have and should not have) with a computer. Even physical computing hardware can be designed to invite, to discourage, or to prevent entirely alternative uses not envisioned by a designer.\n7bdk | These constraints can be overcome. Emerging threads of research and design embody a kind of post-userism that moves beyond the ideology of the user. Nonetheless, as argued above, much of the scholarship and virtually all of the design within HCI provide limited conceptual grounding to help us account for (rather than subsume, condescend, or dismiss) relationships outside the purview of the user.\nfim0 | LEVELS OF REPRESENTATION\nojro | Where is a user? Put another way, where and how are the different definitions of human, computer, and interaction we described above codified and enacted? To answer this question, we must attend to how various subject positions are defined and represented relative to and within technology. We approach this representation ecologically to connote both enumerating the subject positions involved and describing the relationships among them. We argue that representations of technological subjects can be grouped into four levels:\nl6t9 | Interactive Design Methodologies\n1ujy | The Systems Level. These representations are codified in the technical workings of a system. How do the low-level variables, data structures, database schema, etc., represent the entities, relationships, and interactions of interest? We use the systems level to talk about the types of representations that lie beyond interaction but that still shape those interactions. Arguably, gradations exist within systems representations. For instance, there may be differences between bits shifting in processor registers and the relationships among columns in database tables. These various systems representations, though, are all conceptually distinct from other levels of representation. Of particular interest to HCI, and the examples that follow, are systems approaches that represent the user-e.g., authentication, user account, user data-and as a result influence possible subject positions.\n```",
