You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

ccmb | We measure productivity as earnings per minute. Figure 1 shows that the experimental intervention increases this outcome dramatically. In the treatment group, time taken on the post-treatment task drops by 10 minutes (37%) relative to the control group, who take an average of 27 minutes <LATEX>\left( p = 0 . 0 0 0 \right) .</LATEX> Average evaluator grades in the treatment group increase by 0.45 standard deviations <LATEX>\left( p = 0 . 0 0 0 \right) ,</LATEX> with roughly similar increases for overall grades and specific grades for writing quality, content quality, and originality.
ma93 | Figure 1 Panels (c) and (d) show that these effects are not limited to specific pockets of the time or grade distributions: the entire time distribution shifts to the left (faster work) and the entire grade distribution shifts to the right (higher quality). At the individual worker level, Figure 2 shows that treated workers who received a low grade on the first task experience both increases in grades and decreases in time spent, while workers who received a high grade maintain their grade level while substantially reducing their time spent.
c6hh | These results are virtually identical across our two main incentive schemes, covering 80% of respondents: a "linear" scheme in which respondents are paid $1 for each point they receive
y7ea | on each submission (each of which is graded on a 1-7 point scale), and a "convex" scheme in which respondents are additionally paid $3 for earning a grade of 6 or 7, giving them an extra incentive to produce high-quality output.
nav4 | Two supplementary interventions allow us to probe further. In one arm involving 20% of participants, we require participants in both the treatment and control group to spend exactly 15 minutes on each task. This holds effort fixed across the treatment and control groups, allowing us to interpret any difference in grades as a pure effect of ChatGPT access on productive capacity. In this arm, the treatment increases grades by a similar 0.39 standard deviations (p = 0.13), albeit imprecisely estimated and with a slight imbalance in pre-treatment
gem8 | outcomes (see Online Appendix Figure A.7).
e8nr | In another arm involving 30% of the treatment group, after completing the second task, respondents are shown their first-task output and given the opportunity to edit or replace it using ChatGPT if they wish. 23% choose to replace their response with ChatGPT's output and 25% use ChatGPT to edit their original response, suggesting that participants view ChatGPT as a way to improve output quality in addition to a convenient way to save time.
k78w | 2.3 Productivity Inequality
g9du | The control group exhibits persistent productivity inequality: participants who score well on the first task also tend to score well on the second task. As Figure 2 Panel (a) shows, there is a correlation of 0.49 between a control participant's average grade on the first task and their average grade on the second task.
f682 | In the treatment group, initial inequalities are half-erased by the treatment: the correlation between first-task and second-task grades is only 0.25 (p-value on difference in <LATEX>\left. \mathrm { s l o p e s } = 0 . 0 0 4 \right) .</LATEX> This reduction in inequality is driven by the fact that participants who scored lower on the first round benefit more from ChatGPT access, as the figure shows: the gap between the treatment and control lines is much larger at the left-hand end of the x-axis.
li1k | 2.4 Human-Machine Complementarity
pbea | ChatGPT could increase workers' productivity in two ways. On the one hand, it could substitute for worker effort by quickly producing output of satisfactory quality that workers directly submit, letting them reduce the time they spend on the task. On the other hand, it could complement workers' skills: humans and ChatGPT working together could produce more than the sum of their parts, for example if ChatGPT aids with the brainstorming process, or quickly produces a rough draft and humans then edit and improve on the draft. In our experiment, evidence for the complementarity story could come in two forms: (a) we could observe treatment-group participants choosing to expend significant time editing ChatGPT's output or repeatedly prompting ChatGPT in anticipation of earning higher grades, and (b) we could observe that treatment participants' essays receive higher grades than ChatGPT's raw output, suggesting that human input adds value.
ccpt | We observe neither of these pieces of evidence, suggesting that ChatGPT is increasing productivity primarily by substituting for worker effort. 68% of treated participants report submitting ChatGPT's initial output without editing it, and on average treated participants are active on the task for only 3 minutes after we first observe them pasting in a large quantity of text (presumably from ChatGPT). There is also no correlation between how long a participant is active after pasting in the ChatGPT text and the grade they ultimately receive, and treated
0fpw | respondents do not receive higher average grades than raw ChatGPT output that we give to evaluators to grade, meaning we find no evidence that human editing is improving the ChatGPT output. This is true even when participants are given strong pecuniary incentives to do so, in the convex incentives group.
dqn8 | 2.5 Task Structure
cop0 | As suggested by the preceding discussion, ChatGPT substantially changes the structure of writing tasks. Figure 3 Panel A shows that prior to the treatment, participants spend about 25% of their time brainstorming, 50% writing a rough draft, and 25% editing. Post-treatment, the share of time spent writing a rough draft falls by more than half and the share of time spent editing more than doubles.
lhkq | 2.6 Skill Demand
82ju | If ChatGPT is especially helpful to those with poor writing and communication skills relative to their other skills, it could have major labor market implications by expanding the available occupational choices and raise the earnings of individuals with strong idea-generation skills who struggle to effectively get those ideas onto paper.
y2qo | We perform several tests of this hypothesis. We construct two measures of a person's relative writing skills. First, at the beginning of the experiment, we ask participants to rank from 1 to 3 their skills at communication (writing and speaking), problem solving, and creativity. Second, in addition to assigning overall grades, evaluators separately assess each piece of output based on writing quality, content quality, and originality; the gap between a person's first-task overall score and their writing score affords another measure.
