        "content": "wtfz | One. The initial magmatic crystallization (four point five six billion years ago) and subsequent thermal metamorphism occurred prior to four point five billion years ago. The U-Pb ages of the various eucrite zircons reveal the timing of the ubiquitous thermal metamorphism of the initial basaltic crust of Vesta to be four point five five billion years ago at a metamorphic temperature of approximately nine hundred degrees Celsius. After an intensive initial differentiation at four point five six billion years ago, the magmatism on Vesta lasted until four point five three billion years ago, according to the Hf-W records of unbrecciated eucrite zircon. In addition, the asteroid may have suffered a large basin-forming collision at this stage. The U-Pb, and Hf-W studies of mesosiderite zircons also provide a high-temperature reheating age of four point five three billion years ago that is attributed to a catastrophic collision.\nqy1i | Two. After this early event one, the asteroid experienced moderate collisions prior to four point one five billion years ago. At this stage, none of the earlier zircon crystals were remelted or recrystallized and the crystals' U-Pb and Hf-W chronologies remained closed. Instead, the impacts were recorded by the U-Pb systems in phosphates and silicates in several brecciated eucrites. The reheating temperature likely exceeded their closure temperatures (approximately five hundred ninety to one thousand degrees Celsius) and rapidly quenched. Some regions may have exceeded the basalt melting point and formed the\n1k9e | impact melt. Because the studied eucrites resided at different locations on their parent body, their records indicate multiple collisions during approximately four point four to four point one five billion years ago.\n5bjs | Three. Later collisions occurred at approximately three point nine to three point five billion years ago. These events were recorded only by the forty Ar-thirty nine Ar ages, where the reheating temperature may have slightly exceeded the K-Ar closure temperature. Theoretical calculations indicate that such moderate reheating can be achieved by low-velocity (i.e., slower than the typical relative speed of asteroidal bodies) mild collisions. The absence of a U-Pb record (for either phosphates or silicates) at approximately three point nine billion years ago suggests that these later collisions were much weaker than the earlier ones.\nuodj | The multiple moderate collisions prior to four point one five billion years ago (event two) could be attributed to the start of the Late Heavy Bombardment, even though some data in Figure five are significantly earlier than the forty Ar-thirty nine Ar ages. Conversely, event two can be explained as an \"end-tail\" of the cataclysmic collisions at the earlier\nk16v | stage of greater than four point five billion years ago (event one). Such \"end-tail\" collisions significantly decreased by approximately three point nine billion years ago (event three), when only weak (or low-velocity) impacts occurred. This interpretation matches the recent theoretical models of an early bombardment (greater than or equal to four point five billion years ago) and a subsequent monotonic decrease in impacts in the inner solar system. Even though the number of key chronological data is still small, this is an important piece of evidence for the early collisional history of the inner solar system. Future studies of other asteroidal materials are expected to help reconstruct the whole history.\nb2lm | Six. Conclusions\nti7f | NanoSIMS U-Pb dating was conducted on apatite and merrillite minerals in three brecciated basaltic eucrites (Juvinas, Camel Donga, and Stannern) and two unbrecciated basaltic achondrites (Agoult and Ibitira). The weighted mean model two zero seven Pb star divided by two zero six Pb star age of the Agoult apatite was determined to be four five two four point eight plus-minus nine point six million years, significantly younger than its zircon age (four five five five million years) and older than the",
