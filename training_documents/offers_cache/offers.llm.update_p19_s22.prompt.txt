You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

00j4 | "I'm sorry sir, our underwriting team-"
fkpa | "Yeah, I heard you," I said, cutting him off. "I don't accept that."
7ovw | "Sir, it's not up to me it's just our pol-"
7h0s | "What am I gonna tell my salesman, who has a baby and another on the way? Are you going to tell him he's not going to be able to buy his pregnant wife and newborn food? Are you going to pay his mortgage for him?" I was seething.
7cdl | "Sir-" he began again, with unphased apathy, just trying to deliver the news.
8mej | "It's not yours to take." My aggression was quickly turning into desperation. "Shit, just send me half so I can pay my employees," I pleaded "It's Christmas Eve for fuck's sake."
mlec | "Sir, we're going to be holding onto the entirety of your funds for the next six months per your agreement . . . " The voice faded into the distance.
llys | Fuck.
rmu5 | I hung up and checked my accounts. $23,036.
3o98 | I owed my salesman a $22,000 commission check for $120,000 in sales I never got. Without wanting to give myself the opportunity to think about it, I wired it to him.

k1a2 | Good evening December 20, 2016
nlu6 | I screenshotted this image of my bank account because I knew I would tell this story some day.
siqn | The sunlight blinded me as we emerged from the matinee. Families shuffled in and out through the revolving doors, making their happy memories. I was in a daze. Leila led me to the car, her hand wrapped firmly around mine.
2ae7 | "What's wrong? What happened?" she asked.
u9wd | "The money isn't coming."
6i0o | "What do you mean?" she asked. "It's delayed?"
54u3 | I exhaled in defeat. "They are keeping it all."
1x9z | "Can they do that !? "
4235 | "Apparently," I said stoically, trying to maintain my composure in front of her parents.
8xlb | "What are you gonna do about the commissions?"
j21f | "I already paid him. Everything." I said it without looking at her.
jftb | Leila's concern turned to dread.
gj9e | We sat in silence the whole way home. I stared out the window. She held my hand in hers. It was more comforting than I anticipated. We'll get through this.
12a1 | 30 days earlier . . .
ucuv | I had decided to go all in on this new business I called "Gym Launch." Here was the idea: I would fly around the country to gyms and fill them up to full capacity using this new methodology that hinged on an offer I had perfected when I owned my chain of gyms.
2tn9 | Leading up to this moment, I had sold five of my six gyms. The funds from selling them, my life's work, I had put into an account I had with a new partner. This money was supposed to be the seed money for our new company.
0g39 | I was finally going to realize some level of success.
3qn6 | My alarm went off. I groggily swung my arm over blindly clawing at the bedside table. I switched off the alarm, while Leila managed to sleep through the commotion.
65yq | I laid there silently, pulling up the bank accounts - a daily ritual. The balance said $300.
p4rq | Wait. That couldn't be right. There was $46,000 in here yesterday.
33o8 | My adrenaline surged. Looking closer I saw "-$45,700 Payment Successful." I was frantic.
fopo | The money from selling all of my gyms was gone. I checked where the money went. To my "partner." He had taken all the money out.
b12h | Fuck.
vk7m | The last four years of my life had vanished that fast. I officially had nothing, and even less to show for it. No gyms. No equipment. No employees. Nothing.
39f8 | I felt dead inside.
upcg | Adding insult to injury, in that same 30-day period, my mother was in critical condition because of a near fatal accident (and was still under 24-hour supervision), and I had totalled my car in a head on collision at 60 miles per hour and earned a DUI as my consolation prize.
qzb9 | This was the cherry on top. My one saving grace during this time was selling a new "challenge offer" at a gym and collecting all the cash up front as my "fee" for turning their business around.
acan | So I did the only thing I knew. I sold. My salesman had done $120,000 in a single month, and I owed him a $22,000 commission check.
j623 | The problem was the $120,000 never came.
d7ly | "We need to talk," I said as Leila and I went into the other room. I worked up the courage to speak but stared at the floor, embarrassed.
plf9 | "I've got nothing," I said to her. "I'm a sinking ship, and you don't have to stay with me."
vk11 | She grabbed my chin and pulled my face towards hers so she could look into my eyes: "I would sleep with you under a bridge if it came to that." I would have cried tears of joy, but I was so emotionally exhausted my response appeared apathetic.
jj0l | I wouldn't stay with me.
qdqt | "Are we still gonna do these launches starting tomorrow?" She asked. "All my friends quit their jobs to do this." She was being matter of fact, but it still stung. I felt defeated. "Listen, this could go horribly wrong, "
6h7m | "I trust you. We'll figure it out."
b6vb | I had two things left at that point: a grand slam offer and an old business credit card with a $100,000 limit from when I had my gyms.
c5h2 | On the day after Christmas (two days after the gut-wrenching call with the payment processor) we were scheduled to launch six new gyms . . . at the same time. Between airfare, hotels, rental cars, gas, and ad spend (all multiplied by six), I was going to be spending $3,300 per day of money I didn't have. My last dollar had gone to paying my salesman. I still remember my hand shaking as the advertisements went live: Off-> ON.
eccu | Just like that, I was going into debt at a rate of $412 dollars per working hour. Just like that, $3,300 per day began getting deducted from my account.
rtpq | -$3,300 . . . I now officially have nothing
po9y | -$3,300 . . . I now have officially less than nothing
w5lk | -$3,300 . . . I have $10,000 less than nothing
pb48 | -$3,300 . . . This one decision is going to ruin my future forever.
nriw | But things started shaping up. Here's what happened that month (January 2017), as documented by my old processing records I dug up. You can see the month along the left column and the revenue collected that month along the right.
h7kb | Refunds
2mrs | We made $100,117! It was just enough to cover the $3,300/day that had been coming off the credit card. It was actually working. I could hardly believe it. I threw the hail mary, and the universe caught it. I went from looking up bankruptcy lawyers to figuring out what to do with $3,000,000 in profits, accrued within the first twelve months. It felt surreal. And in hindsight, it still kind of does.
f7it | By the end of the year we were doing $1,500,000+/mo. Twelve months from then, $4,400,000/mo. Per. Month. Twenty-four months after that, we crossed $120,000,000 in sales, donated $2,000,000 to help fund equal opportunity in low income areas. We met and befriended Arnold Swarzenegger (lifelong hero) and were asked to be board members of his charity After School All Stars.
