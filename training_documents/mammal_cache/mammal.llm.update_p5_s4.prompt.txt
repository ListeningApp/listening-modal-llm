You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

0i6j | DNAm networks relate to individual and species traits
87cq | We used signed WGCNA, an unsupervised analysis (33), to cluster CpGs with similar methylation dynamics across samples into co- methylation modules. We then summarized their methylation profiles as "module eigen- genes." The respective eigengenes of these modules were used to identify their potential correlations with various traits within and across mammalian species.
0qs3 | Our data analysis proceeded in two sequen- tial phases. First, we developed several comet- hylation networks using data from 11,099 DNA samples from 174 species (discovery dataset finalized March 2021). A eutherian network [network 1 (Net1)] was formed from 14,705 conserved CpGs using this dataset (Fig. 2A). Later, we generated a second dataset of 4357 samples from 30 tissues of 240 mammalian species (174 new species and 66 that are rep- resented in the discovery set), which were not used to define modules and were used as an independent validation set. All eutherian modules were present in the independent validation dataset according to module pres- ervation statistics (corKME) (34), validating the presence of these modules (corKME > 0.43, <LATEX>P < 1 0 ^ { - 2 2 }</LATEX> median <LATEX>\mathrm { c o r K M E } = 0 . 8 4</LATEX> (fig. S5). These modules were designated with colors according to WGCNA convention (Fig. 2A). The smallest module (lavenderblush3) con- sisted of 33 CpGs and the largest (turquoise) had 1864 CpGs.
z8f7 | To characterize the 55 modules with respect to species characteristics (e.g., maximum life span and average adult weight), module eigen- genes were calculated in all samples (discovery and validation set combined, 331 eutherian species). Because information on taxonomic order, tissues, maximum life span, age, sex and adult weight of each species was available,
7w7j | we were able to assess whether any of the mod- ule eigengenes correlated with these traits. Of the 55 modules, 30 were found to be correlated with at least one trait (Fig. 2B, fig. S7, and table S3). Specifically, 15 modules were related to taxonomic orders such as primates, rodents, or carnivores (Fig. 2B and fig. S11). Ten mod- ules related to tissue type (fig. S11), two to sex (fig. S11), one to age, seven to maximum life span, and four to average adult species weight. Some modules were related to multiple char- acteristics. In the following sections, we mainly focus on the modules that relate to mamma- lian maximum life span, adult weight, and age. Other modules related to taxonomic order, tis- sue type, and sex are described in the supple- mentary materials (fig. S11). We performed two analyses to ascertain whether these eutherian modules are also applicable to marsupials and monotremes. Using the discovery dataset, we first trained a network (Net2) in both eutherians and marsupials based on only 7956 probes that are mappable to both. The color bands under the hierarchical tree reveal that all the Net1 modules were also preserved in Net2 (Fig. 2A). Second, we selected CpGs in Net1 modules that were also mapped to marsupials or monotremes and confirmed that their eigengene relation- ships to primary traits were retained in these mammalian clades (table S3). For example, the magenta module, which is related to blood in eutherians, was also found to be so in mono- tremes (table S3), which confirms that the Net1 modules can indeed be applied to other mam- malian clades by selecting probes that are also mapped to those clades.
51vd | A functional enrichment study, accounting for the mammalian array background, revealed that the genes neighboring to module CpGs are implicated in many biological processes in- cluding development, immune function, me- tabolism, reproduction, stem cell biology, stress responses, aging, and various signaling path- ways (Fig. 2C and fig. S9).
baj1 | Relationship with protein-protein interactions
n1wo | We investigated whether the proteins encoded by cognate genes (closest to respective CpGs) within modules are known to mutually inter- act or predicted to do so by STRING protein- protein interaction networks, which integrate known and predicted protein associations from >14,000 organisms (35). A permutation test analysis evaluating the global cluster coeffi- cient (36) of each module showed that 14 mod- ules are significantly enriched <LATEX>\left( P < 0 . 0 0 1 \right)</LATEX> for genes encoding mutually interacting proteins (Fig. 2D). Overall, these results suggest that comethylation relationships can be reflected at the protein level for a subset of modules.
5bq3 | Modules related to maximum life span
ezla | To adjust for potential confounders, we used four regression modeling approaches to iden-
rsbu | tify modules that are associated with the log- transformed maximum life span (dependent variable): (i) a univariate regression model with a covariate that was the module eigen- gene (averaged per species); (ii) a phylogenetic regression model with a covariate that was again the module eigengene (averaged per spe- cies); (iii) a multivariate linear regression model that included the module eigengene, sex, tissue, and relative age as covariates; and (iv) model approach (i) applied to specific tissue types.
magd | The marginal analysis identified four mod- ules: magenta, black, midnightblue, and tan, that related significantly to maximum life span (the absolute value of the Pearson correlation exceeded <LATEX>r = 0 . 6 ,</LATEX> Student's t test <LATEX>P < 1 \times 1 0 ^ { - 3 3 } .</LATEX> The CpGs underlying the implicated modules exhibit the sample patterns, as can be seen from corresponding heatmaps (fig. S14C). Phylogenetic regression also identified asso- ciations of the same modules (table S3). Our fourth modeling approach, i.e., the tissue- stratified marginal analysis, indicates that the relationship of modules to maximum life span is often tissue specific. For example, the magenta and midnightblue modules relate to maximum life span in lung and liver (fig. S14A). By contrast, the black module relates to maximum life span only in skin, and the tan module exhibited a weak relationship to life span in the tissue-specific analysis.
