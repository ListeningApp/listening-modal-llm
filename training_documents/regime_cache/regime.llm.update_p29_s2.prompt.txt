You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

der6 | EXTENDING LINEAR RESPONSE WITH SYNTHETIC FORCINGS
8xg2 | In most practical applications, using a+ (€) is the choice of interest, as the points on the response curve are anyway computed with some numerical error, such as timestep discretization and statistical error. There is, however, a tradeoff to be considered. As one tightens the acceptable relative error by decreasing &, the value of na(€) is also decreased. In practice, values of & in the range 0.01 to 0.1 are small enough to lead to a bias of a few percent in relative magnitude, but large enough so that the benefit of the increased magnitude of the forcing is significant. We further illustrate the tradeoff in Section 4 with numerical results for several observables for overdamped and underdamped Langevin dynamics.
njvp | As a final remark in this section, note that computing a+ (€) requires computing the full response curve. Although this is not practical, the aim here is to provide a proof of principle demonstrating the potential computational gains obtained by making use of synthetic forcings and decide, between various strategies, the most promising one in order to adapt the approach to actual systems of interest.
txab | 3.4. Linearly combining extra forcings. As discussed in Section 3.3, with the addition of some extra forcing Lextra, it is possible to find a value of o which cancels the second-order response p2 due to the linearity of f2 in o, as shown in (3.12). We can extend this notion to linear combinations of extra forcings. In particular, one can combine k forcings in order to cancel the first k nonlinear orders of the response. That is, for a = (@1, ... , Ok), the synthetic perturbation Lphys +@1 Lextra, 1+. . . +@kLextra,k can be used, with a chosen such that p2,a ... = Pk+1,Q = 0. This is a nonlinear equation in o, with k unknowns scalar values and k conditions to solve.
dov0 | 4. Numerical results. The aim of the numerical illustrations presented in this section is to demonstrate the potential of the synthetic forcing approach, on the exam- ples given in Section 3.2. The numerical results are obtained by discretizing the PDEs determining the invariant probability measure of each system (namely the Fokker- Planck equation (3.3)) and the Poisson equation (2.23). The use of this method, particularly in low-dimensional systems, allows us to extensively and thoroughly ex- amine the quality of synthetic forcings, as we can easily compute full response curves and individual orders of the response, in contrast to Monte Carlo simulations, for which some statistical error and timestep discretization bias are present. This nu- merical method, however, cannot be used as such for higher dimensional systems, as solving the associated PDEs becomes too cumbersome a task. Thus, for higher dimensional systems, Monte Carlo simulations are usually preferred (see discussion in Section 5).
xd5o | We first discuss in Section 4.1 the numerical methods used, then present the numerical results for the one and two-dimensional overdamped Langevin, and one- dimensional Langevin dynamics in Sections 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4, respectively. We finally discuss in Section 4.5 the impact of the synthetic forcings approach on variance re- duction in the estimation of transport coefficients.
3gny | 4.1. Numerical method. The full response curve and the linear response are computed by solving the associated Fokker-Planck equation for each dynamics, and the Poisson equation (2.23), respectively. The main advantage of numerical methods based on solving partial differential equations is that the discretization error can be systematically reduced to a very small value by refining the mesh used to represent the functions at hand. There are two situations in which the solutions to PDEs are required to determine the response to external perturbations, which we outline below.
ws73 | Approximation of the linear response <LATEX>\rho _ { 1 } .</LATEX> The linear response is obtained by com- puting <LATEX>\mathfrak{f} _ { 1 }</LATEX> and approximating the integral on the right-hand side of (2.26). To approx- imate <LATEX>\mathfrak{f} _ { 1 } ,</LATEX> we solve the Poisson equation (2.23), which we recall here for convenience:
vyos | (4.1)
w4hq | <LATEX>\mathcal{L} _ { 0 } ^ { * } \mathfrak{f} _ { 1 } = - \widetilde { \mathcal{L} } _ { \mathrm { p h y s } } ^ { * } 1 .</LATEX> For overdamped Langevin dynamics, we directly solve (4.1) as we consider a bounded position space, namely the torus <LATEX>\mathbb{T} ^ { d } .</LATEX> For Langevin dynamics, instead of solving for <LATEX>\mathfrak{f} _ { 1 }</LATEX> in the expansion (2.21), we solve for <LATEX>\bar { \psi } _ { 1 }</LATEX> in <LATEX>\psi _ { \eta } = \psi _ { 0 } + \eta \bar { \psi } _ { 1 } + \eta ^ { 2 } \bar { \psi } _ { 2 } + \cdots , \imath ,</LATEX> i.e. <LATEX>\bar { \psi } _ { 1 } = \mathfrak{f} _ { 1 } \psi _ { 0 } .</LATEX> This function satisfies the Poisson equation
ghbe | (4.2)
1lkf | <LATEX>\mathcal{L} _ { 0 } ^ { \dagger } \bar { \psi } _ { 1 } = - \widetilde { \mathcal{L} } _ { \mathrm { p h y s } } ^ { \dagger } \psi _ { 0 } ,</LATEX> which is equivalent to reformulating (4.1) in terms of the <LATEX>L ^ { 2 } - \mathrm { a d j o i n } .</LATEX> Due to the unbounded momentum space for Langevin dynamics, solving (4.2) makes the problem easier to solve numerically than (4.1). Indeed, the unbounded momentum space needs to be truncated. A natural choice when solving for <LATEX>\bar { \psi } _ { 1 }</LATEX> is to set Dirichlet boundary conditions at the boundaries of the domain in <LATEX>p ,</LATEX> which is consistent with the fact that <LATEX>\bar { \psi } _ { 1 } \left( q , p \right)</LATEX> is expected to vanish as <LATEX>| p | \rightarrow + \infty .</LATEX> In contrast, there is no natural boundary condition for <LATEX>\mathfrak{f} _ { 1 }</LATEX> in (2.26) when the momentum space is truncated.
uobn | Once an approximation of <LATEX>\mathfrak{f} _ { 1 }</LATEX> or <LATEX>\bar { \psi } _ { 1 }</LATEX> is obtained, we perform a quadrature on one of the following integrals to directly find the linear response
