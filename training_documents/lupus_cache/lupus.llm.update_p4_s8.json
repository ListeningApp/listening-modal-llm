        "content": "4exe | In addition, the risk of infection in SLE is higher in the presence of comorbidities and when using glucocorticoids, immunosuppressive and immune modulatory therapy. The incidence of kidney involvement, diabetes, and higher lupus damage index scores were dramatically higher in SLE patients with an infection compared to SLE patients without an infection. In fact, the use of aggressive immunosuppressive therapy is a serious risk factor for the development of infections in SLE.\n0myz | Impact of Immune Therapy and Risk of Infections\nxh3i | The use of immunosuppressive therapy will induce difficulty in mounting an immune response to viral and bacterial infections in SLE, including the exposure to immunosuppressive agents including high-dose glucocorticoids, alkylating agents such as cyclophosphamide, in addition to mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine, cyclosporin, and hydroxychloroquine.\nsyiw | Importantly, glucocorticoid use is a significant risk factor for serious infections requiring hospitalization. Indeed, the risk for infection in SLE patients is a ten-fold increase in patients at a prednisone dose over twenty milligrams daily. Thus, the emphasis on keeping the prednisone dose below seven point five milligrams daily or the use of pulses of intravenous methylprednisolone to control disease activity.\nkg3t | Intravenous cyclophosphamide use has been associated with an increased risk in infection in particular HZ infections as described in SLE population studies, whereas the infection rates are similar among users of azathioprine, mycophenolate, and methotrexate. Further, mycophenolate use is associated with a lower risk of infection in non-Asian\nlvae | patients with lupus nephritis as compared to cyclophosphamide. However poor clinical outcomes with related deaths appeared to be more frequently observed among the Asian population.\no9sc | Mycophenolate is a protective against Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia and Coxsackie virus infections in transplant patients; however, this protective effect in SLE patients requires confirmation. Antimalarial agents are the major anchor medication in lupus and studies have supported fewer infection rates with their exposure.\n121u | Effective and targeted biological therapy with their steroid-sparing effects, are becoming available, yet many had adverse events, including serious infections. Infections either mild or severe do not seem to be a major concern in patients treated with belimumab as indicated in the post marketing data. On the other hand, rituximab's (an anti-CD-twenty monoclonal antibody) use has been associated with severe infections, including bronchopneumonia followed by sepsis, the frequent organisms involved during rituximab therapy include S. pneumonia, followed by E. coli and S. aureus. While severe infections are associated with rituximab exposure occurring within the first six months of treatment, these patients have been receiving high doses of glucocorticoids.\nzh03 | Like immunosuppressive therapy, biological therapy in SLE is associated with infectious comparable incidence rates including opportunistic infections. However, Janus kinase targeted therapy has a slightly higher rate of herpes zoster infections, with a dose dependent pattern of infectious risk.\n1mvw | Infections May Trigger the Development of SLE\n6d4s | The SLE disease process is triggered by genetic, immunological, and environmental factors including the possible role of certain microbial agents (viral, bacterial, parasitic, or fungal). Through molecular mimicry, bacterial DNA can also stimulate autoreactive B cells leading to an autoimmune response.\nmqah | Viruses associated with SLE onset include, human endogenous retroviruses, Epstein-Barr virus, parvovirus B nineteen, CMV and human immunodeficiency virus.\nxxr8 | The relationship between tuberculosis and SLE suggests an increased risk of SLE in patients exposed to tuberculosis based on molecular and epidemiologic data.\nrl4j | Exposure to Helicobacter pylori has been linked to a lower risk of SLE or delay in its onset like the protective role of helminth infections in SLE, attributed to the activation of lymphocytes and secretion of interleukin ten. Toxoplasma gondii appears to protect against progression of SLE, while Leishmania infection may trigger polyclonal activation of B cells and activation of ribonucleoproteins. Controversy remains about the role of Plasmodium falciparum in reducing the risk of SLE onset.\nvz32 | The onset of SLE is associated with exposure to certain vaccines including Bacillus Calmette-Gu√©rin, and BNT sixteen O two b two mRNA, with varying degrees of severity from cutaneous lupus to lupus nephritis. A recent systematic review meta-analysis study has emphasized the safety of HPV vaccination in SLE, given the low-level evidence of the temporal relationship between SLE development following the exposure of HPV vaccine.\nncb0 | Existing SLE May Undergo an Exacerbation Following an Infection\n8mp0 | Multiple factors are known to cause SLE flares, including exposure to UV light, certain hormones, and drugs, but infections also worsen existing SLE, leading to poor outcomes. Infections may trigger a worsening lupus disease process leading to a feedback loop that may reinforce autoimmunity. The exposure to influenza infection is associated with lupus flares leading to hospitalization within seven days of infection, regardless of patients' age, gender, underlying illnesses, or immunosuppressive therapies.\nxjyk | Others have confirmed the association of infection and high disease activity in hospitalized lupus patients independent of prednisone dose, comorbid conditions, or disease duration.\nmt0f | A better understanding of the interactions between viral proteins, bacterial microbiome and lupus related nuclear autoantigens and the host immune system in SLE could help improve the therapeutic management of challenging SLE patients with infections. Thus, vigilance should be borne in mind when challenged by infection in SLE and use of clinical predictors of infection is then fundamental.\nawab | Clinical Predictors of Infections in SLE\nixcc | A major challenge in the care of SLE patients is how to differentiate between a clinical presentation of an infection from a lupus flare. Investigators have suggested certain laboratory biomarkers that are indicative of infections, yet these biomarkers remain nonspecific and at times misleading. Further atypical presentation of infectious clinical syndromes in SLE may vary with the array of symptoms that mimic a lupus flare, and individual infections may present concurrently during a lupus flare. A predictor marker must then have high specificity and sensitivity for determining whether the patient is presenting an infection or a lupus flare.\n8p6h | Shaking chills, leukocytosis, and neutrophilia with normal dsDNA were associated with infection in SLE. Yet leukopenia is common in severe sepsis, and pneumococcal pneumonia, and neutropenia in typhoid infections and brucellosis.\npmgl | Certain clinical predictors of infections outlined below are applicable in clinical practice:\n90no | Serum C-Reactive Protein\njt0y | C-reactive protein is a key acute phase protein synthesized by the liver and secreted in response to interleukin-six stimulation. CRP has also the ability to opsonize bacteria, activate the complement pathway, and bind FcR on phagocytes, facilitating elimination of pathogens.\nqb7o | CRP has been an unreliable measure for lupus disease activity (except for serositis).\noae5 | Elevated CRP (in the absence of serositis) is higher in SLE patients with bacterial infections. The cut-off value of nineteen point two milligrams per liter has a sensitivity of eighty-one point two percent and a specificity of seventy-three point nine percent during an infectious event. However, limitations remain for the application of CRP in the diagnosis of bacterial infections in SLE and other rheumatic diseases.\ns0fl | Elevated Procalcitonin",
