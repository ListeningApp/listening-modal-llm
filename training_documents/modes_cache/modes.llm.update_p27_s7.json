Once she broadened her approach to include careful vigilance toward her clients' needs and nondirective strategies, Michele recognized that she was more able to engage a wider range of her clients in therapy. During our inter- view, Michele disclosed:\nxs3r | Years ago when I worked with learning disabled kids, I remember sometimes feeling that I must try to \"control\" the child's behavior. Now I prefer working with a child who has special needs and is out of control. When I do my detective work and decipher the base of the sensory problem, then it makes me feel good. In the past I needed to see things happening to know I was successful-today a child's smile makes me feel that the session was successful.\nffuj | Locating One's Comfort Zone of Preferred Modes\nh7f6 | A central objective of the IRM is to identify one's current \"comfort zone\" of interpersonal behavior during therapy. As you develop as a therapist, it is similarly important to practice broadening that comfort zone to include increas- ingly unfamiliar and unutilized interpersonal styles, or modes. The beginning of the chapter asked you to com- plete the Self-Assessment of Modes Questionnaire, Ver- sion Three, located in the Exercises section (Exercise Four point One). Now, you should use those responses to fill out the Per- sonal Modes Profile that follows. Doing so will indi- cate your preferred therapeutic modes and their relative strength. Following this, you should identify less famil- iar modes that might strengthen your relationships with clients or allow you to practice more successfully with a broader range of client personalities in Exercise Four point Two.\nt74k | Therapeutic Style and Daily Interpersonal Behavior: Striving Toward Integration\nqdn7 | The idea of developing a therapeutic style and using modes can be misunderstood as lacking a sense of genuineness. However, this conclusion emanates from a misunderstanding of the role of genuineness in therapy. The genuine therapist is one who sincerely wants and makes an effort to do what is best for the client. Genuineness is not simply being yourself. It is being the best person you can be, given the client's needs.\ndib4 | That said, it is nonetheless important for therapists to strive toward and integrate their therapeutic style and their more innate daily ways of interacting with others. The closer one's everyday interpersonal behavior is to one's therapeutic style, the more likely it is that a ther- apist feels able to interact therapeutically with clients in ways that feel natural. Thus, although it is important to broaden one's repertoire of therapeutic modes, it is equally important to develop a therapeutic style that feels true and is generally consistent with one's everyday ways of interacting.\nyvqj | To a certain extent, every therapist must practice a degree of interpersonal self-discipline. That is, you must exercise restraint regarding the extent to which you re- veal all aspects of your personality to clients. The Occupational Therapy Code of Ethics and occupational therapy's core values statement reinforce that it is in the best interest of clients to conduct therapy with prudence and circumspection. This sometimes includes controlling one's interpersonal impulses and always avoiding interactions with clients that may be perceived as exploitive or emotionally harmful. Any experienced therapist knows that at certain moments during therapy practice, particularly with more challenging clients, it takes impulse control and significant restraint to draw only on the aspects of oneself that have the potential to be therapeutic. It is impossible to appreciate all clients equally, and there are moments when we may wish to show clients we find more difficult how we really feel about them, but our values, ethics, and better judgment prevent us from doing this.\nvz2f | As therapists develop expertise in the therapeutic use of self, they find that they do not have to work as hard as they did before to exercise this capacity for circumspection and self-restraint. As therapists become more experienced in the use of self, the act of interacting therapeutically comes to feel natural. This sense of naturalness comes from knowing the benefits and limits of one's natural modes and developing comfort utilizing the modes that were not, at first, as easy to use. In addition, therapists often feel they can function more seamlessly with certain types of clients and in settings that match their natural inclinations, using certain modes rather than others. For example, a therapist once shared that she enjoys working with young children because she can freely\nwyu0 | if she happens to overuse the mode with a given client. Similarly, another therapist once told me that she prefers working in physical rehabilitation settings because she enjoys functioning in the role of teacher in that much of her job involves demonstrating certain tasks and instructing clients to relearn important daily living skills.\ns8xw | More experienced therapists often see little difference between their therapeutic styles and the ways they typi- cally behave with friends and family. Even though they may feel more relaxed and spontaneous in their rela- tionships with clients, therapists for whom there is lit- tle difference between their therapeutic styles and their everyday interpersonal interactions tend to make fewer interpersonal oversights with their clients; they tend to say and do the appropriate things at the right times. For example, when they provide feedback to a client that might be difficult to hear, it is well timed-consistent with their general way of relating-and presented with great sensitivity and tact. Therapists whose therapeutic style matches their everyday style generally feel they do not have to exercise considerable emotional restraint and extensive tactical thinking during therapy.\nafv1 | Vardit Kindler provides a succinct description of this match. She describes her therapeutic style and her behav- ior in everyday life as relatively indistinguishable.\nfwf1 | My general style of relating is very informal. I accept everyone as an equal. I look at people's strengths without being overly critical. This is my style of relating both inside and outside therapy.\n3wck | Similarly, Carmen-Gloria de las Heras explains:\njq2u | This ability to integrate and see an increasing number of parallels between one's therapeutic style and one's interpersonal style outside of therapy, combined with the ability to draw on a wide repertoire of interpersonal behaviors as appropriate for any given interaction, may be associated with decreased feelings of burnout and frustration. Having a therapeutic style that feels consistent with one's day-to-day personality is referred to as an integrated use of self.\n9zf9 | Assessing Mode Use\nclwo | To date, nine assessments of mode use based on the IRM have been developed. One of these assessments is featured in this chapter: The Self-Assessment of Modes, Version Three. The Self-Assessment of Modes, Version Three, consists of nine different clinical scenarios, each portraying a client or caregiver facing a dilemma. Four possible therapeutic responses (i.e., modes) are presented beneath each clinical scenario. Respondents are required to rank-order the responses from one to four based upon the degree to which they agree with the given response.\naki1 | Exercises for Learning and Reflection\nvf5h | One.
