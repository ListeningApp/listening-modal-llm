Discussion. subjects the opportunity to report changes in their experience of happiness and sadness as they occurred with J. T. Larsen et al.'s button press measures (Study 1a) and J. T. Larsen et al.'s continuous ESG (Study 1b). Just as subjects were more likely to report feeling both happy and sad after Life Is Beautiful than before and recall feeling both happy and sad during a bittersweet clip than during a control clip from The Son of the Bride, our subjects who watched the bittersweet clip spent more time reporting simultaneously mixed emotions (Study 1a) and reported more intense simultaneously mixed emotions (Study 1b) than those who watched the control clip.\n0w8m | These results provide the first evidence from online continuous measures of emotion that people can feel happy and sad at the same time. They extend prior research involving less sophisticated measures of emotion by providing evidence against the vacillation hypothesis, which contends that people can merely vacillate between happiness and sadness. The results do not imply that all\nvcu3 | events containing pleasant and unpleasant aspects elicit mixed emotions, but they do indicate that Life Is Beautiful can.\nhjzj | In terms of their implications for contemporary models of the structure of affect, the results of Study 1 are inconsistent with the valence-arousal model, which contends that happiness and sadness are mutually exclusive, but are consistent with the ESM, which contends that happiness and sadness can co-occur. More generally, they bear upon an age-old debate over the nature of emotion. Specifically, they provide evidence against the claim that valence is an irreducible aspect of emotional experience and for the rival claim that positivity and negativity are separable in experience.\nj79f | Study 2: Demand Characteristics\n6tbv | One alternative interpretation for the results of Study 1 is that subjects who watched the bittersweet clip inferred that they were expected to report mixed emotions. If so, demand characteristics may have led them to report mixed emotions. The fact that Study la's subjects reported having no idea that we were interested in mixed emotions provides evidence against the operation of demand characteristics, but studies in which subjects are explicitly told that the researchers' hypothesis was that people could not feel both happy and sad at the same time would provide stronger tests.\nxb13 | In Study 2, we told subjects in the bipolarity hypothesis-bittersweet clip group that we had hypothesized that people cannot feel happy and sad at the same time and then showed them the bittersweet clip. We told subject in the no-hypothesis-control clip group that we were indifferent about mixed emotions and then showed them the control clip. All subjects completed the continuous ESG throughout the clip. If Study 1's subjects reported more mixed emotions because they actually experienced more mixed emotions, Study 2's bipolarity hypothesis-bittersweet clip group should report more mixed emotions than the no-hypothesis-control clip group. On the other hand, if demand characteristics led Study 1's subjects to report more mixed emotions, Study 2's bipolarity hypothesis-bittersweet clip group should report no more or even less mixed emotions than the no-hypothesis-control clip group. The bipolarity hypothesis-bittersweet clip and no-hypothesis-control clip were sufficient to test our hypothesis, so we intentionally confounded film clip (bittersweet vs. control) with stated hypothesis (bipolarity vs. no hypothesis).\ncxqi | Method. Subjects were thirty-nine Texas Tech undergraduates (twenty-one women; fifty-four percent). Data from two additional subjects were lost due to computer error.\nqfmx | Subjects were seated in separate cubicles and randomly assigned to the bipolarity hypothesis-bittersweet clip condition n equals twenty-one or the no-hypothesis-control clip condition\nrut3 | n equals eighteen. Before showing them the bittersweet clip, the experimenter told subjects in the bipolarity hypothesis-bittersweet clip condition\nm3cp | MIXED EMOTIONS\nmq4s | that our hypothesis was that people could not experience mixed emotions:\n95el | Some evidence indicates that emotions can also affect language comprehension, so we also need to keep track of how you're feeling during the film. We've also realized that the current study allows us to test a hypothesis we have about emotions. We do not think people can feel both happy and sad at the same time, and this study gives us a chance to see whether that's true.\na0a5 | After providing the continuous ESG instructions, the experimenter said,\ngocl | As I mentioned a moment ago, we have hypothesized that people cannot feel both happy and sad at the same time, but we'll let the data decide. So if you ever feel both happy and sad at the same time during the movie, then move into the interior of the grid, the portion that indicates that you're feeling both happy and sad to some degree.\nob1z | Following the clip, subjects were presented with several pairs of statements about what the experimenter had said during the instructions. The final pair of statements was \"The experimenter that (a) we believe that people cannot feel happy and <LATEX>{ \\text { ent sal } } \\\\ { \\text { sad at the } }</LATEX> same time, or (b) we believe that people can feel happy and sad at the same time.\" We discarded the data from the two subjects who answered incorrectly, leaving nineteen subjects in the bipolarity hypothesis-bittersweet clip condition.\nm4cb | To ensure that the question of mixed emotions would be comparably salient for subjects in the no-hypothesis-control clip condition, the experimenter told these subjects that a peripheral aim of the study involved mixed emotions. The experimenter also indicated, however, that we were indifferent about the results:\nm61y | Some evidence indicates that emotions can also affect language comprehension, so we also need to keep track of how you're feeling during the film. We've also realized that the current study allows us to settle a debate that other psychologists have been having. Some researchers think that people can feel happy and sad at the same time; others think people cannot feel happy and sad at the same time. We really don't care one way or the other, but this study will allow us to find out.\n```",
