  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,

82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

r5il | INTRODUCTION
5gui | The regio- and stereo-selective formation of C-C and C-N bonds represents a fundamental yet synthetically challenging step required for the production of many valuable drugs and agrochemicals. Genome mining efforts have revealed several enzymatic strategies employed by nature to catalyze these reactions for the biosynthesis of important natural products. Arguably, the best characterized class of enzymes known for this type of reactivity are radical S-adenosylmethionine (rSAM) enzymes, which use powerful radical-mediated chemistry to catalyze various types of C-C bond formation and a breadth of other reactions. In addition to rSAMs, the analysis of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) has shown a preponderance of mononuclear heme and nonheme enzymes responsible for catalyzing the oxidative formation of Csp2-Csp3> Csp2-Nsp2, and Csp3-Nsp2 bonds. Inter- and intra-molecular bond formation by cytochrome P450s (CYPs) is prevalent in the biosynthesis of pharmacophores that include phenol cross-link formation during the assembly of glycopeptide antibiotics (GPA) (e.g., teicoplanin and vancomycin)" and desertorin or orlandin alkaloids, flaviolin dimerization, tryptophan nitration,7 and amination for indolactam generation, among others. CYPs have also been recently shown to dimerize tryptophan-containing cyclic dipeptides.9,10

NRRL S-1868 and consists of the CDPS AspA that generates cyclo-L-Trp-L-Pro (cWP), also termed brevianamide F. The CYP AspB subsequently forms the N1- C7'-linked dimer termed aspergilazine A (Figure 1A).16 CYPs that share a very high degree of sequence identity to AspB have been found to catalyze different modes of cWP dimerization, including the C3-C6' and intramolecular C-N linkage of naseseazine C by NascB. Another recently discovered CYP NzeB was found to have more relaxed regio- and stereo- specificity to form mixtures of both aspergilazine A and naseseazine C.18,19 The divergent chemoselectivity of CYP dimerases provides an attractive alternative to synthetic routes for late-stage functionalization, particularly for the assembly of asymmetric DKP-dimers.

Both radical coupling and cationic pathways have been shown to be energetically plausible, and the most commonly invoked mechanism involves a primary oxidation catalyzed by an iron(IV)-oxo pi cation radical intermediate (compound I, or CYP-I), followed by a secondary oxidation by the resultant Fe++-OH compound II (CYP-II).8,20,21 However, direct insight into this process is extremely limited due to the complexity in preparation of the substrates involved (a carrier- protein-linked peptide in the case of GPAs),3,22 direct access to the fleeting intermediates in the catalytic cycle, or both.
v8uq | In this study, we use a combination of steady-state and transient kinetics, alternative substrate analogs, and single turnover approaches to evaluate the mechanism for C-N bond formation by the CYP DKP-dimerase AspB. The data provide kinetic and spectroscopic evidence for the unexpected reactivity of an iron-superoxide intermediate for initiating substrate dimerization to form aspergilazine A. We also demonstrate that this reaction trajectory is generalizable to C-C bond formation catalyzed by NzeB. This catalytic strategy rationalizes the circumnavigation of canonical CYP ferryl reactivity to promote selective bond formation that may be extended to the biosynthesis of many other natural products.

h2l3 | Inverse Steady-State Kinetic Solvent Isotope Effect in AspB-Catalyzed Formation of Aspergilazine A. As very little is known about the mechanism for CYP-catalyzed oxidative DKP-dimerization, we sought to explore the basis for C-N bond formation using the DKP dimerase AspB. In vitro multiple turnover studies with recombinant AspB and a surrogate redox partner system composed of spinach ferredoxin, ferredoxin reductase (sp. Fd/FdR), and NADPH as a source of reducing equivalents resulted in nearly complete consumption of the cWP substrate to form one major product (≥98%) and minor amount of another product with m/z = 565 corresponding to a DKP dimer (Figure 1B). The highly chemoselective profile is in good agreement with prior in vivo fermentation experiments by Li et al., which showed that 98% of the substrate was converted to aspergilazine A, while the other ~2% corresponded to two other DKP dimers with varying linkages. Thus, we assigned the major product peak as aspergilazine A.
dfzb | The C-N linkage of two molecules of cWP involves a two- electron oxidation of the substrates, and mechanisms that are initiated by indole or DKP N-H abstraction by CYP-I have been advanced. 18,19,23 A structural alignment of AspB with other well-characterized CYP monooxygenases shows a distinct alteration of residues at the I-helix that are known to be critical for O-O heterolysis in O2-activating CYPs (Figures S1A,B). Notably, AspB lacks the highly conserved acid (Asp or Glu) on the I-helix distal pocket that forms half of the "acid- alcohol pair" that is crucial for mediating proton delivery to the ferric peroxo-anion intermediate (Figure S1C).24-28 Due to this deviation (a proline is found at the corresponding position in AspB), we performed steady-state kinetic solvent isotope effect (KSIE) experiments to determine if an alternative mode of proton-delivery was operant. A comparison of the rates of product formation by AspB in H2O and D2O buffers revealed an inverse KSIE of 0.66 ± 0.1 (Figure 1C,D). This phenomenon is highly unusual for a P450 that employs CYP-I as an oxidant, as rate-limiting proton-transfer steps are involved in its generation.29 Furthermore, increasing the concentration of protons in AspB reactions by lowering the pH resulted in a slower rate of product formation (Figure S2). This is the opposite trend from what was previously observed for the analogous I-helix acid mutant (D251N) in the camphor monooxygenase CYP101.28 In that case, an increase in the turnover rate and corresponding ~5-fold increase in the KSIE at lower pH was attributed to an extended proton-delivery chain involved in the generation of CYP-I. In contrast, the availability of protons appears to impede product formation in AspB despite the absence of an I-helix acid.
u6ty | Inverse KSIEs have been reported for some atypical P450 reactions and used as a rationale to invoke intermediates that precede compound I.30 These include substrate transforma- tions that are either postulated or demonstrated to be mediated by a ferric-peroxoanion species, such as the 17,20 lyase chemistry catalyzed by CYP17Al in the conversion of 17- hydroxypregnenolone to dehydroepiandrosterone, and more recently, an epoxide ring-opening cascade of tirandamycin L by mutants of the CYP TamI. However, the nucleophilicity of a ferric peroxoanion complex would make it unlikely to serve as an effective reagent for cWP dimerization.
