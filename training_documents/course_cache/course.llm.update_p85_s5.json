The theory of island biogeography and species richness depend on\n0fsl | · Area size: Large size has larger populations and higher habitat heterogeneity\n0m3g | · Distance to mainland: Nearness -> Higher colonization rate\n9sp0 | P equals S up arrow · Habitat connectivity: Low connectivity means lower colonization rate\nnbpk | · Speciation-extinction dynamics: Related to time and population size/area\nxs3r | Lecture Seven - Foraging Theory\nffuj | What is Optimal Foraging Theory, O F T?\nh7f6 | It is a behavioral ecology model that helps predict how an animal behaves when searching for food.\nt74k | Aim of the Optimal Foraging Theory\nqdn7 | · To predict the foraging strategy of a forager or predator to be expected under specified conditions.\ndib4 | Important terminologies\nyvqj | Ideal Free Distribution theory - theory which makes a case of uniform distribution of food for predators such that there is no need for foragers to switch foraging patches.\nvz2f | · Functional response - deals with a predator's intake rate in response to variation in prey distribution and densities.\nwyu0 | · Aggregate response - explains how predators are distributed in response to prey availability.\ns8xw | · Total response equals Functional response plus Aggregate response.\nafv1 | Assumptions inherent in Optimal Foraging Theory\nfwf1 | One. The foraging behavior that is exhibited by present-day animals is the one that has been favored by natural selection in the past but almost enhances an animal's fitness at present.\n3wck | Two. High fitness is achieved by a high net rate of energy intake (i.e. gross energy intake minus the energetic costs of obtaining that energy).\njq2u | Three. Experimental animals are observed in an environment to which their foraging behavior is suited.\n9zf9 | Scenarios which unjustify the O F T\nclwo | One. Other aspects of the organism's behavior may influence fitness more than optimal foraging does. For example, premium on avoidance of predators coercing animals to forage at places and at times associated with lower predation risk trading off efficiency in food gathering.\naki1 | Two. Variation in the efficiencies of energy gathering process exploiting different dietary constituents (e.g. nitrogen) by many consumers (herbivores and omnivores) creating the need for consumers to forage on a mixed and balanced diet.\nvf5h | Theoreticians and Mathematicians\nl51p | O F T makes predictions about foraging behavior based on mathematical models.\ns9zz | Important Question\nx97k | Is it necessary for a real forager to be equally omniscient and mathematical, if it is to adopt the appropriate optimal strategy?\nqwix | Theoreticians are omniscient mathematicians - the foragers need not be.\n6lnq | The answer is NO, because\nnxb1 | Theory says that if a forager that in some way manages to do the right thing in the right circumstances, then this forager\nkwpw | One. Will be favored by natural selection.\nusfa | Two. Possible inheritance of newly acquired abilities by future generations.\ndnjr | Three. Abilities spread, in evolutionary time, throughout the population.\nqser | Parameterizing the O F T One\n8gam | Foraging entails predators expending time and energy in obtaining food.\nz4db | Intake rates of a predator is dependent on the searching (encounter rate) and handling (i.e. pursuing, subduing, and consuming it) times of prey.\nlw7l | Generalists pursue (and may then subdue and consume) a large proportion of the prey types they encounter.\n2exi | Specialists continue searching except when they encounter prey of their specifically preferred type.\n16py | Parameterizing the O F T Two\nm4ov | Specialists will only pursue profitable prey items, but may expend a great deal of time and energy searching for them.\n9uqd | Generalists will spend relatively little time searching but they will pursue both more or less profitable types of prey.\n8szx | An optimal forager should therefore balance the pros and cons so as to maximize its overall rate of energy intake.\niwdc | Parameterizing the O F T Three\n4vks | Given that a predator already includes a certain number of profitable items in its diet, should it expand its diet (and thereby decrease its search time) by including the next most profitable item as well?\nuyaf | The next most profitable prey item for an optimal forager\nd1qh | E i h i\nnyqt | Profitability equals\n7odd | where E i is the energy content of the next most profitable i-th prey item and h i its handling time.\n0le2 | In addition, E over h is the average profitability of the 'present' diet (i.e. one that includes all prey types that are more profitable than i, but does not include prey type i itself), and\n5dw0 | s is the average search time for the present diet.\ni4yq | Parameterizing the O F T Four\nfj3g | If a predator does pursue a prey item of type i, then its expected rate of energy intake is E i over h i\nzuua | If it ignores this prey item, whilst pursuing all those that are more profitable, then it can expect to search further. The total expected rate of energy intake\nelwn | E (s plus h)\njnqv | where E is the average energy content, s is the average search time and h is the average handling time for the present diet.\nunp3 | The most profitable, optimal strategy for a predator will be to pursue the i-th item if, and only if\nv8vk | E i over h i is greater than E over (s plus h).\nsr40 | The optimal diet model leads to a number of predictions\n5zjj | One. Predators with shorter handling times than search times should be generalists, because the short times taken to handle prey items already found would allow them to commence searching for another prey.\nf56l | Two. Predators with longer handling times than search times should be specialists because once prey has been seen and began to be handled (include pursuit), the predator cannot go in for another food. Therefore, such predators should go in for the most profitable prey.\nar2z | Parameterizing the O F T Five\nyad0 | Three. Predators should have broader diets in unproductive environments (where prey items are relatively rare and s is relatively large) than in a productive environment (where s is smaller).\n3g38 | Four. Predators should ignore insufficiently profitable food types irrespective of their abundance.\nvtbo | Five. Provides a context for understanding the narrow specialization of predators that live in intimate association with their prey. Since their whole lifestyle and life cycle are finely tuned to those of their prey, handling time is low.\nq8pa | Two studies of optimal diet choice that show a clear but limited\nuc9x | correspondence with the predictions of the optimal diet model. Diets are more specialized at high prey densities; but more low profitability items are included than predicted by the theory.\n```",
