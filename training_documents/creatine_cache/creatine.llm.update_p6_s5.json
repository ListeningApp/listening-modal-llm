For example, Kayton et al. found that in a sample of two hundred seventy high school boys and girls, twenty-one percent of boys and three percent of girls reported supplementing with creatine. Furthermore, in a sample of elite Olympic level sample of young German athletes (fourteen to eighteen years), twelve percent of those surveyed reported supplementing with creatine. Therefore, these trends warrant additional research to determine with greater certainty whether creatine supplementation, both acute and longer-term, is safe for children and adolescents.\n90no | In summary, based on the limited evidence, creatine supplementation appears safe and potentially beneficial for children and adolescents.\njt0y | Does creatine increase fat mass?\nqb7o | The theory that creatine supplementation increases fat mass is a concern amongst exercising individuals, possibly because some experience a gain in body mass from creatine supplementation. However, randomized controlled trials (one week to two years in duration) do not validate this claim. Acute creatine supplementation (seven days) had no effect on fat mass in young and older adults; however, fat-free mass was increased. Furthermore, three weeks of creatine supplementation had no effect on body composition in swimmers.\noae5 | The addition of creatine to high-intensity interval training had no effect on body composition in recreationally active females. In addition, the effects of creatine supplementation during resistance training overreaching had no effect on fat mass. Moreover, in a group of healthy recreational male bodybuilders, five grams per day of creatine consumed either pre- or post-training had no effect on fat mass. In other short-term studies lasting six to eight weeks, there were no changes in fat mass from creatine supplementation. Becque et al. found no changes in fat mass after six weeks of supplementation plus resistance training. In another six-week investigation, no significant differences in fat mass or percentage body fat were observed after creatine supplementation. Furthermore, creatine supplementation during an eight-week rugby union football season also had no effect on fat mass.\ns0fl | One might suggest that eight weeks or less of creatine supplementation is insufficient to arrive at a definitive conclusion regarding creatine's effect on fat mass. Nonetheless, there are several investigations that have used much longer treatment periods. For example, healthy resistance-trained males were randomly assigned in a double-blind fashion to supplement with creatine (i.e., twenty grams per day for one week followed by five grams per day for eleven weeks) or placebo. Lean body mass and muscle fiber size increased; percent body fat and fat mass were unaffected over the twelve-week training period. In older males (approximately seventy years), twelve weeks of creatine supplementation during resistance training had no effect (compared to placebo) on fat mass. Furthermore, Gualano et al. assessed the effects of creatine supplementation (twenty-four weeks), with and without resistance training, in older females. Results showed no effect from creatine on fat mass. Candow et al. examined the effects of creatine supplementation in older adults (fifty to seventy-one years) over a thirty-two week treatment period. Study participants were randomized to supplement with creatine or placebo before or after resistance training (three days per week). There was an increase over time for lean tissue and strength with a decrease in fat mass. From a clinical perspective, children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia who supplemented with creatine (zero point one grams per kilogram per day) for two sequential periods of sixteen weeks experienced a significant reduction in fat mass. In contrast, the children who did not consume creatine gained fat mass. In two studies involving postmenopausal women, Lobo et al. found no change in absolute or relative body fat from one year of low-dose creatine supplementation. Furthermore, two years of creatine supplementation also had no effect on fat mass.\n43ia | Recently, Forbes et al. conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis on randomized controlled trials involving creatine supplementation in conjunction with resistance training on fat mass in older adults (fifty years or more).\n3g2y | Nineteen studies with a total of six hundred nine participants were included. Participants supplementing with creatine had a greater reduction in body fat percentage. There was no significant difference in absolute fat mass loss; however, the creatine group lost approximately zero point five kilograms more fat mass compared to those on placebo.\ngc7v | In summary, creatine supplementation does not increase fat mass across a variety of populations.\nwqfv | Is a creatine 'loading-phase' required?\nj30a | Pioneering research in the early nineteen hundreds using animal models showed that creatine supplementation could augment creatine content by seventy percent. Decades later, Harris et al. published a seminal paper which showed that 'loading' with creatine increased skeletal muscle creatine stores, as evaluated from muscle biopsies collected from the vastus lateralis in young, healthy human participants. This research sparked incredible interest in studying creatine supplementation strategies that would increase intramuscular creatine content, helping shape current recommendations.\n7bdk | Creatine 'loading' is defined as supplementing with oral creatine for five to seven days with a dosage of twenty to twenty-five grams per day, often divided into smaller doses throughout the day (e.g., four to five, five gram servings per day). Creatine 'loading' may also be prescribed relative to body mass, for example, zero point three grams per kilogram per day for five to seven days (i.e., twenty-one grams per day for a seventy-kilogram individual). The 'loading' phase of creatine supplementation is followed by a daily 'maintenance' phase often ranging from daily three to five gram servings per day. In addition to the seminal work of Harris et al., several other investigations have demonstrated increased intramuscular creatine stores in humans from the creatine 'loading' phase. A common misconception regarding creatine supplementation is that individuals must 'load' with creatine to increase intramuscular\n```",
