You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

3194 | Recall from Section 2.3, and in particular in Proposition 2.4, that the estima- tor <LATEX>\widehat { \Phi } _ { \eta , t }</LATEX> defined in (2.38) has asymptotic variance of order <LATEX>\sigma _ { R , \eta } ^ { 2 } / \eta ^ { 2 } .</LATEX> Indeed, (2.42) suggests that this asymptotic variance is of the same order as the one associated with the equilibrium estimator, i.e. <LATEX>\sigma _ { R , 0 } ^ { 2 } / \eta ^ { 2 } ,</LATEX> up to a small bias of order
r22o | <LATEX>\eta :</LATEX> (4.9)
nupw | This suggests that the asymptotic variance <LATEX>\sigma _ { R , \eta } ^ { 2 }</LATEX> has sufficiently small variations in n, which validates increasing <LATEX>\eta</LATEX> as a way to substantially reduce the variance.

tffb | na (€) defined in (3.15), i.e. the first value of n at which the response curve departs & in relative error relative to the linear response. For the results here presented, we use & = 0.05. For each of the dynamics, the scaled asymptotic variance as a function of n is illustrated in Figure 6, where the values of na(€) are represented as dashed vertical lines to highlight the great reduction in variance potential. As expected, Figure 6 is consistent with (4.9), and it shows that increasing the regime of linear response has a dramatic effect on the variance.
ewwt | In order to quantity the variance reduction, we define the gain as the ratio of the variance of the equilibrium system and its synthetic counterpart:
2tj1 | gain = no (€)2 OR, no (E ) .2
nbhq | na (E) 2 OR, na (E)
w251 | (4.10)
1vgx | For each of the cases presented in Table 1, namely the modified-fluctuation dissipation (MFD), Feynman-Kac forcing (FK) and divergence-free vector field (DF), a is chosen to be a* or a+ (€), and the associated quantity na (€) is computed, where no(€) =0.05 for all three dynamics. Note that for Langevin dynamics, the results here presented for the modified fluctuation-dissipation and the Feynman-Kac forcing both correspond to their p counterparts.
yjnk | The results in Table 1 show that the variance can be dramatically reduced with the use of synthetic forcings. Although no choice of extra forcing is universally better, we can achieve reduce the variance by a factor of over 1000 in all cases.
9zmh | 5. Extensions and perspectives. Let us conclude this work by discussing potential extensions of our approach and practical applications to real molecular dy- namics systems. The notion of synthetic forcings, as here presented, can be applied to a number of actual systems to assist in the computation of transport coefficients, e.g. Lennard-Jones fluids for the computation of shear viscosity, or systems of atom chains for the computation of thermal transport (see [32, 8, 31]).
mi3g | The methodology here presented, however, must undergo some adaptation to be applied to actual systems. The numerical method we rely on, namely discretizing and solving the associated PDEs, does not scale well to higher dimensions and thus cannot be used as such. One typically relies on Monte Carlo simulations, which normally limits the number of values of n used due to the high computational cost. Additionally, the computation of the optimal values of o, presented in Section 3.3, also cannot be done as such, as it relies on either the PDE approach, or the computation of full response curves.
ntjg | One preliminary idea for the computation of o in real systems is the notion of prescreening. Transport coefficients are intensive quantities, i.e. they do not depend
86at | too drastically on the system size. This suggests, in practice, that one performs two simulations with small system sizes, with 01 / @2, from which the value of a* can be extrapolated, which can then be used in a large scale simulation. The results here presented suggest that such an adaptation, which is work in progress, is worth the effort.
