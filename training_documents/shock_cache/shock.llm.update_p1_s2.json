In addition to treating the pathologic process causing impaired cardiac function, prompt hemodynamic support is essential to reduce the risk of developing multiorgan dysfunction and to preserve cellular metabolism. Pharmacologic therapy with the use of vasopressors and inotropes is a key component of this treatment strategy, improving perfusion by increasing cardiac output, altering systemic vascular resistance, or both, while allowing time and hemodynamic stability to treat the underlying disease process implicated in the development of cardiogenic shock. Despite the use of mechanical circulatory support recently garnering significant interest, pharmacologic hemodynamic support remains a cornerstone of cardiogenic shock management, with over ninety percent of patients receiving at least one vasoactive agent. This review aims to describe the pharmacology and hemodynamic effects of current pharmacotherapies and provide a practical approach to their use, while highlighting important future research directions.\n90no | Cardiogenic shock is a clinical syndrome characterized by insufficient cardiac output to meet basal metabolic requirements, leading to life-threatening end-organ hypoperfusion. The development of cardiogenic shock has downstream effects on the entire circulation, causing tissue hypoxia and injury, inflammation, and vasoplegia as part of a systemic inflammatory response syndrome in many cases. Physiologic compensatory mechanisms include endogenous sympathetic stimulation which augments cardiac output by increasing heart rate and myocardial contractility. In addition to the direct cardiac effects produced by these endogenous compounds, peripheral vasoconstriction serves to increase systemic vascular resistance and mean arterial pressure. These compensatory responses occur at the expense of maladaptive increases in cardiac afterload, myocardial oxygen requirements, and filling pressures, with resulting reductions in coronary perfusion pressure. Therefore,\njt0y | prompt hemodynamic support is essential to restore cellular metabolism and prevent worsening systemic and myocardial ischemia, which drives the \"shock spiral\" that in many cases leads to circulatory collapse and death.\nqb7o | The initial goals of therapy for patients with cardiogenic shock can broadly be defined by two overarching principles: first, to rapidly identify and treat the underlying cause of shock (for example, urgent revascularization in acute myocardial infarction related cardiogenic shock) to enable cardiac recovery; second, to improve tissue perfusion and oxygenation through obtaining a minimum acceptable cardiac output and blood pressure, achieved through hemodynamic support strategies that may include the use of vasoactive medications and in select cases temporary mechanical circulatory support. The current review focuses on the pharmacologic hemodynamic supports that can be offered in this clinical context.\noae5 | Nonstandard Abbreviations and Acronyms\ns0fl | AR adrenergic receptor CS cardiogenic shock\n43ia | MCS mechanical circulatory support\n3g2y | Epidemiology of Cardiogenic Shock\ngc7v | Defining cardiogenic shock has traditionally been challenging, owing to the various clinical, biochemical, and hemodynamic definitions used in the seminal outcome trials and societal guidelines. The Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions has recently sought to harmonize these definitions through a pragmatic classification system that can be applied to a range of clinical setting and helps enable the diagnosis of cardiogenic shock across the full clinical spectrum of disease severity, ranging from \"at risk\" to fulminant circulatory collapse. Importantly, the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions diagnostic and staging system of cardiogenic shock has been validated across multiple clinical subgroups, including cardiogenic shock with and without acute myocardial infarction, patients admitted to intensive care, and those with cardiogenic shock complicating out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. The use of a uniform definition for cardiogenic shock and its severity will play a crucial role for future epidemiologic and clinical trials, allowing direct comparison between outcomes associated with specific therapies, systems of care, and treatment protocols.\nwqfv | Despite the challenges with defining and diagnosing cardiogenic shock, it is a common problem in clinical practice with an estimated incidence of four hundred eight per one hundred thousand hospitalizations based on the United States National Inpatient Sample. Acute coronary syndromes are the most common cause of cardiogenic shock, accounting for seventy percent of cases. The management of this cohort of patients is both costly and requires significant health care resource use. The average length of hospital stay ranges between eight point nine and eighteen point six days with an associated cost of treating a patient with acute myocardial infarction related cardiogenic shock in the United States of forty-one thousand seven hundred seventy-four dollars to forty-five thousand two hundred fifty-two dollars. Despite significant improvements over the past two decades in contemporary revascularization techniques and supportive care, one-year mortality rates continue to range between fifty percent and sixty percent.\nj30a | Although the epidemiology and outcomes of in-hospital cardiogenic shock have been well described, there remains a paucity of data in relation to the incidence, treatment provision, and outcomes of cardiogenic shock in the prehospital environment. A recent population-based cohort study of a large provincial emergency medical services registry demonstrated that the overall incidence of emergency medical services treated cardiogenic shock was fourteen point five per one hundred thousand\n7bdk | Vasoactive Medications in Cardiogenic Shock\nfim0 | person-years, with an overall thirty-day all-cause mortality of forty-three point nine percent. Despite large numbers of patients with cardiogenic shock receiving the initial phase of their treatment by emergency medical services, prehospital therapeutic interventions (for example, mechanical ventilation, and vasoactive medications), in addition to many in-hospital interventions, are yet to be proven effective through high-quality observational or randomized data.\nojro | Current Use of Vasoactive Medications in Clinical Practice\nl6t9 | The use of vasoactive medications in cardiogenic shock is common. In the intensive care unit setting, twenty-five percent of admitted patients receive at least one vasoactive medication, increasing to greater than ninety percent in patients with cardiogenic shock. Although comparative studies assessing these agents are limited, norepinephrine is increasingly administered for patients requiring hemodynamic support with cardiogenic shock. The requirement for vasoactive medications is independently associated with short-term mortality and a stepwise increase in risk of in-hospital mortality has been observed with increasing number of vasoactive agents administered. Furthermore, a dose-dependent relationship with higher required peak doses to achieve hemodynamic stability is also associated with an increased risk of death. Although the observed excess mortality risk associated with the use of this drug class is of concern, these findings are likely to be confounded by increased illness severity necessitating the use of multiple agents at high doses. Nonetheless, these data underscore the need for further evaluation of the utility of these commonly used medications, compared with alternate vasoactive sparing strategies such as mechanical circulatory support.\n1ujy | CARDIOVASCULAR PHARMACOLOGY AND PHARMACODYNAMICS OF VASOACTIVE MEDICATIONS\nqzor | The study of the physiologic properties of vasoactive medications dates back to eighteen ninety-three, when the English physician George Oliver assessed the effects of various glandular extracts derived from sheep on radial artery vasoreactivity in his son. Evolving from these early experiments, the contemporary conceptual framework for these agents was established and is broadly divided into three categories in accordance with their predominant hemodynamic effects: vasopressors, inotropes, and inodilators. Vasopressors improve perfusion to vital organs by increasing systemic vascular resistance and therefore mean arterial pressure. Inotropes augment cardiac output by increasing myocardial contractility and in many instances heart rate. Inodilators have the\na0by | Downloaded from http://ahajournals.org by on August 14, 2023\n```",
