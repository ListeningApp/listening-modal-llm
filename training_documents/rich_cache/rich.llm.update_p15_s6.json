This they must learn, and they will remain where they are as long as they continue to do as they do. The individual worker, however, is not held down by an entire class's ignorance of these laws; he can follow the tide of opportunity to riches, and this book will tell him how.\nk38m | No one is kept in poverty by a shortness in the supply of riches; there is more than enough for all. A palace as large as the capitol at Washington might be built for every family on earth from the building material in the United States alone, and under intensive cultivation this country would produce wool, cotton, linen, and silk enough to clothe each person in the world finer than Solomon was arrayed in all his glory, together with food enough to feed them all luxuriously.\nnkj9 | The visible supply is practically inexhaustible, and the invisible supply really is inexhaustible.\n35a8 | Everything you see on earth is made from one original substance, out of which all things proceed. New forms are constantly being made, and older ones are dissolving, but all are shapes assumed by one thing.\n337o | There is no limit to the supply of formless stuff, or original substance. The universe is made out of it, but it was not all used in making the universe. The spaces in, through, and between the forms of the visible universe are permeated and filled with the original substance, with the formless stuff - with the raw material of all things. Ten thousand times as much as has been made might still be made, and even then we should not have exhausted the supply of universal raw material.\ncuth | No one, therefore, is poor because nature is poor or because there is not enough to go around.\n09z2 | Nature is an inexhaustible storehouse of riches; the supply will never run short. Original substance is alive with creative energy, and is constantly producing more forms. When the supply of building material is exhausted, more will be produced. When the soil is exhausted so that food stuffs and materials for clothing will no longer grow upon it, it will be renewed or more soil will be made. When all the gold and silver has been dug from the earth, if humanity is still in such a stage of social development that it needs gold and silver, more will produced from the formless. The formless stuff responds to the needs of mankind; it will not let the world be without any good thing.\n13fv | The Science of Getting Rich\nv5pj | This is true of man collectively. The race as a whole is always abundantly rich, and if individuals are poor it is because they do not follow the certain way of doing things which makes the individual rich.\ntrab | The formless stuff is intelligent; it is stuff which thinks. It is alive and is always impelled toward more life.\ngrxs | It is the natural and inherent impulse of life to seek to live more; it is the nature of intelligence to enlarge itself, and of consciousness to seek to extend its boundaries and find fuller expression. The universe of forms has been made by formless living substance throwing itself into form in order to express itself more fully.\nu9dn | The universe is a great living presence, always moving inherently toward more life and fuller functioning.\nt25w | Nature is formed for the advancement of life, and its impelling motive is the increase of life. Because of this, everything which can possibly minister to life is bountifully provided. There can be no lack unless God is to contradict himself and nullify his own works.\nx62u | You are not kept poor by lack in the supply of riches. It is a fact which I shall demonstrate a little farther on that even the resources of the formless supply are at the command of the man or woman who will act and think in a certain way.\naoc8 | CHAPTER FOUR\n3mdu | The First Principle in The Science of Getting Rich\nm04v | Thought is the only power which can produce tangible riches from the formless substance. The stuff from which all things are made is a substance which thinks, and a thought of form in this substance produces the form.\n3aip | Original substance moves according to its thoughts; every form and process you see in nature is the visible expression of a thought in original substance. As the formless stuff thinks of a form, it takes that form; as it thinks of a motion, it makes that motion. That is the way all things were created. We live in a thought world, which is part of a thought universe. The thought of a moving universe extended throughout formless substance, and the thinking stuff - moving according to that thought - took the form of systems of planets, and maintains that form. Thinking substance takes the form of its thought, and moves according to the thought.\nq3gu | Holding the idea of a circling system of suns and worlds, it takes the form of these bodies, and moves them as it thinks. Thinking the form of a slow-growing oak tree, it moves accordingly, and produces the tree, though centuries may be required to do the work. In creating, the formless seems to move according to the lines of motion it has established. In other words, the thought of an oak tree does not cause the instant formation of a full-grown tree, but it does start in motion the forces which will produce the tree, along established lines of growth.\ntxab | Every thought of form, held in thinking substance, causes the creation of the form, but always, or at least generally, along lines of growth and action already established.\ndov0 | The thought of a house of a certain construction, if it were impressed upon formless substance, might not cause the instant formation of the house, but it would cause the turning of creative energies already working in trade and commerce into such channels as to result in the speedy building of the house. And if there were no existing channels through which the creative energy could work, then the house would be formed directly from primal substance, without waiting for the slow processes of the organic and inorganic world.\nxd5o | No thought of form can be impressed upon original substance without causing the creation of the form.\n3gny | A person is a thinking center and can originate thought. All the forms that a person fashions with his hands must first exist in his thought. He cannot shape a thing until he has thought that thing.\nws73 | So far, humankind has confined its efforts wholly to the work of its hands, applying manual labor to the world of forms and seeking to change or modify those already existing. Humankind has never thought of trying to cause the creation of new forms by impressing thought upon formless substance.\nvyos | The Science of Getting Rich\nw4hq | When a person has a thought-form, he takes material from the forms of nature and makes an image of the form which is in his mind. People have, so far, made little or no effort to cooperate with formless intelligence - to work \"with the Father.\" The individual has not dreamed that he can \"do what he seeth the Father doing.\" An individual reshapes and modifies existing forms by manual labor and has given no attention to the question of whether he may produce things from formless substance by communicating his thoughts to it.\nghbe | We propose to prove that he may do so - to prove that any man or woman may do so - and to show how. As our first step, we must lay down three fundamental propositions.\n```",
