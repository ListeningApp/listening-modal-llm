You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

5nx9 | When you view a workbook, you have several options at the top of the page.
px96 | From left to right, you can perform the following tasks:
3glu | · Go back to your profile
lpib | · Keep on clicking and go through other workbooks
y912 | . Edit the details of the workbook that you have opened
i5sa | · Download the workbook, as shown in following screenshot:
rvhq | If you scroll to the bottom of the dashboard, you have the following additional controls:
8kyr | 1. Undo, Redo, and Reset any changes that you have made. For instance, if you have filtered your workbook and want to revert to the original state, just click on the Reset button.
95fm | 2. Share your work in the following way:
i5qs | ° You can share the Current View, which includes filter conditions or parameter selections. Alternatively, you can share the Original View.
26wo | ° Embed Code allows you to copy an automatically generated block of HTML that you can use to embed the visualization on another web page. This code identifies the viewing attributes of your workbook, such as whether the toolbars are showing, the height and width of the workbook, and its title. For instance, if you want to embed the dashboard on your blog, you just need to copy the code. Then, in the management console of your blog, either insert the code directly, or create and then insert a snippet of HTML. If you have the capabilities, you can utilize Tableau Public's JavaScript API to embed the visualization in a webpage and then allow users to interact with it through web objects that are native to the source page. That's beyond the scope of this chapter though.

zjvs | ° To share the workbook with others, you can copy the link as well as simply highlight and copy the text and then paste it into a new e-mail in the tool of your choice.
ifv4 | ° You also can share the workbook on Twitter or Facebook by clicking on either of the two buttons that open a pop-up on your browser and ask you to enter your credentials for the medium that you have selected, as shown in the following screenshot:
9uf2 | When you share your work via Twitter or Facebook, the description that you enter in the workbook details will automatically be populated, as shown in following screenshot. You can always change the description and remove the via @tableau string, but it's much more likely that people will find your tweet if you leave that tag:

g6ns | The information that you provide about your work is important; it's the first part of the story that you're telling that people will take in. The workbook name is important, and so is the description and additional links.
3jab | If you scroll down the page past the Share button, you will see the workbook title as well as a link that allows you to edit the workbook details, as shown in the following screenshot:
ozht | Now, perform the following steps:
walw | 1. Make sure that the Title of the workbook says exactly what you want to appear on your profile.
243h | 2. Add a Permalink. Though this isn't required, it's a good way to promote your blog.
yup5 | 3. Enter a good description in the Description. This is the text that search engines will index. Also, if you want people to tweet your work, then you need to enter a description that's 82 characters or less, because the link that Tableau generates for your workbook will consist of 62 characters.
etg9 | 4. Toolbar Settings typically include control buttons as well as a link to your author profile. If you choose not to include those, then the HTML generated to embed your work will be adjusted.
6hid | 5. An additional setting that you can adjust is Show workbook sheets as tabs. If all the worksheets in your workbook are on your dashboard and you have hidden them, then you don't need to select this.
