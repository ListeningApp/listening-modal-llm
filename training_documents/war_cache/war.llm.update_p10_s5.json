        "content": "e8nr | On the north-western periphery of Europe, the major countries had not experienced the trauma of defeat, humiliation and territorial amputation. Here, ethnic divisions (with the partial exception of Belgium, where the divide was, in any case linguistic and cultural rather than strictly ethnic) played no great role in\nk78w | War and Political Violence in Twentieth-Century Europe\ng9du | politics. Ideological conflicts were largely along class, not ethnic, lines, and the ruling elites, backed by adaptable constitutions, could accommodate and institutionalise conflict. In their colonial territories and settler dominions, of course, such states could exercise and back the use of massive violence towards the indigenous populations. Colonialism fostered racist attitudes back in the homeland. But since the ethnic minorities there were small and insignificant, in terms of challenging for political power, or were integrated (as were the Welsh and the Scots, if not the Irish) into the constitutional arrangements of the existing nation-state, ethnically based violence was not to be expected. Nor, from the point of view of the British state, was the violence deployed in Ireland motivated by ethnic considerations.\nf682 | As the outstanding work of Michael Mann has shown, ethnicity, where rival ethnic groups are involved in a real (or imaginary) contest for state power in disputed territories - not just in Europe and not just in the inter-war period - turned into possibly the most potent element in large-scale political violence in the twentieth century as more and more ethnically split countries sought to push through policies based on organic nationalism aimed at ethnically 'cleansed' nation-states.\nli1k | Let me turn briefly here to the third question I raised. Was there simply more violence in the twentieth century? Or was it qualitatively different from what had gone before, more modern? Most experts on genocide agree in stressing its modernity. Michael Mann, above all, has argued - convincingly to my mind - that the mass killing of civilians (or less murderous brutal persecution and 'cleansings') on ideological grounds 'in the name of the people', whether ethnically driven (as against Armenians, Jews, Bosnian Muslims, Albanian Kosovans or Rwandan Tutsis) or class-driven (as in Stalinist anti-Kulak terror or Pol Pot's 'classicide') forms a crucial component of what makes modern political violence modern. Of course, the mass killing of civilians was nothing new. And ideology - of a religious, not secular kind - was also used in earlier times to justify it. Tens of thousands were killed in Albigensian Crusade of the early thirteenth century, the French wars of religion of the latter half of the sixteenth century, and the Thirty Years War of the seventeenth century, for example, most of them in the name of religion. The sacking of Magdeburg by Catholic forces in sixteen thirty-one, when possibly as many as thirty thousand men, women and children were slaughtered, and Cromwell's ruthless storming of Drogheda and Wexford ten years later, in which some four thousand five hundred people (though mainly garrison soldiers) were put to the sword in God's name, were particularly brutal massacres on the grand scale. But religious violence - or violence in the name of religion - usually stopped at converts. That is to say, conversion to the other side was usually sufficient to prevent or mitigate violence. And sieges did not normally lead to massacres where the garrison readily accepted\npbea | force majeure and surrendered promptly according to given rules. Moreover, ethnicity was seldom, if ever, a sole or prime factor.\nccpt | How different this became once the idea - in essence, of course, a positive one - of popular sovereignty implanted itself from seventeen eighty-nine onwards. The upturning and abuse of the original ideals of nationalism was a necessary accompanying development, and in the late nineteenth century the ideological forces which would light the conflagration after nineteen eighteen were already gathering pace. As noted earlier, traditional or long-standing social resentments, often laden with violence, were now presented with ideological justification. Violence against disliked or supposedly threatening ethnic minorities escalated wildly. Spontaneous outbursts - which on investigation usually turned out to be locally organised 'spontaneity' - could produce huge bloodletting in massacres and pogroms. But for violence to take shape as full-scale genocide a further ingredient was needed: the ideologically driven modern state. Ethnicity or class, depending upon regime, then turned into givens for the sections of the population affected, unchangeable stamps which, irrespective of all other considerations, determined life or death for millions. Being a Jew under Hitler, a Kulak under Stalin, an intellectual under Pol Pot, was tantamount to a death warrant. This was, therefore, a very modern feature of modern political violence.\n0fpw | Two other important components, both already touched on, complement this vital feature in the link between modernity and violence. One is bureaucracy and planning; the other comprises science and technology. Both are unmistakable in the Nazi paradigm. One of the most shocking aspects of Nazi violence, to latter-day sensibilities, is that it occurred in such a modern state, with an advanced economy, sophisticated administration, a high level of education and elevated culture. Of course, in a way this comes close to saying that such barbarism might have been expected in a primitive society, but not in a modern, civilised one. Whatever the prejudice in the presumption, it misses the point. Nazi violence could only be so extreme precisely because it was so modern. To accomplish it needed the planners and orchestrators in a multiplicity of state and party offices; it needed the academics - a good number of them historians, some later to achieve great renown - who put their intelligence and abilities to working out how to 'de-judify' (their expression) cities such as Warsaw and Cracow; it needed the data-collectors using punch-card machines as a more efficient way of compiling lists of victims; it needed doctors at the forefront of their profession prepared to engage in the most vile of medical experiments in the interests of scientific progress; it needed the chemists of the Degesch company to produce\ndqn8 | War and Political Violence in Twentieth-Century Europe\ncop0 | the Zyklon-B, first for disinfection, then for human extermination; and it needed the engineers of Topf and Sons, Erfurt, who could design to order the Auschwitz gas chambers and crematoria.",
