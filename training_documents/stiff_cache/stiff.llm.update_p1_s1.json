The results are analyzed with the aim of obtaining a phenomenological description of secant Young's modulus variation according to different test conditions. Using empirical fitting equations, the influences of different factors such as axial strain, vertical consolidation stress, consolidation stress ratio, and stress history on the secant Young's modulus under axisymmetric (triaxial) loading conditions at small and intermediate axial strains are singled out and presented. The main purpose of this paper is to identify the factors affecting the nonlinear secant stiffness of sand and to quantify their relevance at different levels of strain.\nb2lm | INTRODUCTION\nti7f | Stiffness reduction with increasing strain and shear stress levels has been widely recognized in geotechnical engineering for the last half century. Moreover, more recently the improvement achieved in the reliable measurement of soil behavior at small strains (epsilon approximately ten to the negative five) and intermediate strains (ten to the negative five less than epsilon less than or equal to five times ten to the negative three) in the laboratory has highlighted the degree of nonlinearity exhibited by soil stiffness, emphasizing the paramount importance of this phenomenon for predicting the displacement of geotechnical constructions.\noksu | Based on the above, this paper is aimed at the purely phenomenological description of the secant Young's modulus (E sub sec) nonlinearity at small and intermediate strains, as inferred from a large number of drained triaxial compression tests performed on three sands.\nwtow | All the triaxial tests were performed on specimens prepared by means of an air pluvial deposition subjected thereafter to both isotropic and anisotropic consolidation. Both the local axial strain and the local radial strain were measured in many tests. The results obtained have been analyzed with the aim of quantifying the relevance of the different factors that influence the E sub sec nonlinearity at small and intermediate strains of the three test sands.\no22k | EXPERIMENTAL DATA\nnwfz | Test Sands\nnvfy | The soils used were Toyoura, Quiou, and Ticino sands. Toyoura sand has been widely used for laboratory stress-strain tests in Japan. Ticino sand has been used for Calibration Chamber and laboratory stress-strain tests in Italy since nineteen seventy-six. More recently, Quiou sand (a French sand) has also been used in Italian Calibration Chamber and stress-strain laboratory tests. Toyoura sand is a subangular, uniform, fine quartz sand that does not contain fines. Quiou sand is a subangular, well-graded, coarse to medium carbonate sand containing about two percent of fines. Quiou sand is a crushable material containing seventy-three percent in weight of shell fragments. Ticino sand is a medium to coarse, uniform, predominantly silica sand that does not contain fines. The main physical properties of these sands are shown in Table one.\nmror | Sample Preparation\nzlxc | Specimens with seventy millimeters in diameter and one hundred forty millimeters in height were reconstituted by dry pluvial deposition method. Only for some tests on Ticino sand were smaller samples tested (i.e., forty and sixty millimeters in diameter). The ratio of height to diameter H over D of all specimens is two.\nk0bw | Toyoura sand specimens were reconstituted to a void ratio after consolidation e, ranging from zero point sixty-five to zero point eighty-nine. For Quiou sand specimens, the e sub c ranged between zero point seventy-nine and one point zero four, while for Ticino sand specimens the e sub e ranged between zero point fifty-eight and zero point eighty-eight.\naq5a | All the relevant information concerning the triaxial tests performed is given in Table two.\nsc5y | Triaxial Tests\n0yab | Apparatus\nw95z | The triaxial testing systems used for the tests, developed at ISMES (Istituto Sperimentale Modelli e Strutture, Italy) and the Technical University of Turin, are computer-controlled triaxial cells with internal tie rods. A load cell to measure the axial load without any piston friction is located inside the pressure chamber. In the triaxial apparatus developed at the Technical University of Turin, the loading ram is virtually frictionless. The axial strain was measured locally using high-resolution submergible LVDTs, and externally. The details of the test apparatuses were described.\n0i1k | Twenty-six tests on Toyoura sand and eight tests on Quiou sand were performed at the Technical University of Turin, while all the tests on the Ticino sand (one hundred eighty-four) and other tests on the Quiou sand (thirty-six) were performed at ISMES. The axial strain was only measured externally for the majority of the Ticino sand tests.\ndqlg | Test Procedures\np6pq | Two sets of drained triaxial compression tests were performed at constant axial strain rate and lateral pressure with confining stress ranging between fifty and eight hundred kilopascals. The first set\nzse6 | was performed on isotropic normally consolidated (N C) and overconsolidated (O C) specimens. The second set was performed on K zero (the condition of zero radial strain) N C and O C specimens. The K zero condition was obtained by adjusting the cell pressure as the axial stress increased in order to prevent radial displacement. The radial deformation was measured locally using two proximity transducers placed horizontally on the specimen. The adopted overconsolidation ratio ranged between one point two and eight. After the consolidation stage, a rest period of one to two hours was adopted before starting the shearing phase.\np2n3 | The shearing stage of triaxial tests was carried out in drained conditions, under a strain-controlled frame, at a constant rate\nohh7 | of axial strain (about zero point zero one percent per minute). The radial pressure was kept constant.\nvbni | The consolidation stress ratio, overconsolidation ratio, and effective vertical stress at the end of consolidation are also shown in Table two.\ndgcw | Test Results\ngvwz | Typical results of the triaxial compression tests on Toyoura and Quiou sands are shown in Figures one and two. These figures show the secant Young's modulus E sub sec versus the axial strain, plotted in logarithmic scale, for four compression loading tests with almost the same void ratio (Toyoura sand: zero point seventy-seven to zero point eighty; Quiou sand: zero point eighty-seven to zero point eighty-nine) and the effective vertical consolida-",
