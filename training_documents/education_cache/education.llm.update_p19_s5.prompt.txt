You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

naev | Few are going above and beyond in delivering on the student experience. Just four out of 10 institutions reported that the experience they provide students consistently (9 percent) or even occasionally (28 percent) exceeded student expectations. Institutions in the UK, Germany and Australia lagged behind the other jurisdictions in the study, with just 29, 28 and 24 percent, respectively, indicating that student experience exceeded expectations.
7h0h | Nearly 8 out of 10 higher education institutions are making customer centricity a top or high priority
a64c | "What priority is your institution placing on its customer-centric strategy?"
gi7n | The future of higher education in a disruptive world
3pn1 | Many institutions have some distance to go in matching leading customer experience practices in other sectors.
wjuz | The survey revealed that security, technology and people/process hurdles stand between institutions and the successful execution of customer-centric strategies. While higher-education institutions face numerous obstacles to success, their lack of qualified staff was listed as the number one barrier to the successful execution of customer-centric strategies, cited by 33 percent of respondents.
3yxv | Barrier number two, cited by 29 percent of institutions, was students who "arrive lacking key academic and/or personal skills." It is, to put it mildly, unorthodox for a provider which actually selects its own customers then to say that some of them are the problem in executing a customer-centric strategy.
d8zj | Institutions are also dealing with several other security and technology challenges, including concerns over data security and privacy (31 percent), difficulty sharing student data and analytics between channels, jurisdictions and locations (28 percent), and a lack of integrated communication channels (27 percent).
ywxn | The KPMG International-commissioned research conducted by Forrester Consulting on its own terms suggests that many institutions have some distance to go in matching leading customer experience practices in other sectors, and it's thought that even their responses might be inflated due to lack of awareness about what other sectors are actually doing.
uxhs | Turning specifically to the eight critical capabilities of a connected enterprise, a very mixed picture emerged:
ed6e | Insight-driven strategies and actions: Sixty-nine percent of respondents had sound data analytics strategy and governance processes, but just half had the analytics tools (49 percent) and data collection and enrichment practices (49 percent) to deliver timely and accurate insights for decision making.
6qqm | Experience centricity by design: Most institutions said they could design student journeys (73 percent) and were co-designing learning pathways with students (69 percent), but some have more work to do to better integrate their ecosystems for education, research and knowledge exchange, with just 60 percent reporting good or excellent execution in this area.
onum | Responsive operations and supply chain: Seventy-five percent or more said that operational excellence was embedded in their institution and that their service capabilities were agile, but fewer said that assets and liabilities were aligned with strategy (65 percent) or that their operational approach was driven by a clear view of demand (56 percent).
3iir | Aligned and empowered workforce: Decision makers gave their institutions high marks for institutional design and governance (68 percent) as well as leadership and culture (67 percent) capabilities. However, they more critically rated their workforce strategy capabilities (59 percent) - the ability to optimize current capabilities, plan for future institution needs and develop career paths that manage and retain talent.
7a0a | Seamless interactions and commerce: Nearly three-quarters (72 percent) rated their intake and referral management capabilities favorably, but institutions could do more to develop a clear channel strategy that promotes seamless interactions and supports omnichannel access, with just 57 percent and 48 percent, respectively, rating their execution as good or excellent.
o1qp | Integrated partner and alliance ecosystem: Most institutions reported having a clear understanding of when to enhance their internal capabilities with those offered by partners (68 percent), but 50 percent lacked integrated partner governance to effectively engage and manage partnerships, alliances and vendors to meet stakeholder needs.
jrik | Innovative products and services: Most institutions were effective at understanding current and future needs (63 percent), but less-developed at outcome measurement (53 percent) and learning-planning capabilities (49 percent) mean just half were continuously monitoring and improving the quality of learning offerings.
xv78 | Digitally enabled technology architecture: Sixty-seven percent said their digital strategy promoted a flexible, resilient and experience-centric operating model, but only about half built their capabilities on common digital platforms (54 percent) and even fewer had an enterprise architecture that they feel could support both current and future strategy objectives (43 percent).
sdks | The future of higher education in a disruptive world
y8fb | The ability to execute on most capabilities leaves room for improvement, assuming that respondents were not being too optimistic in the first place. Over two-thirds of institutions described their ability to execute on objectives tied to both experience centricity and to responsive operations and supply chain as good or excellent; at least 50 percent cited good or excellent execution on objectives around aligned and empowered workforces (63 percent), seamless interactions and commerce (55 percent), insight-driven strategies and actions (52 percent), and an integrated partner and alliance ecosystem (52 percent). The weakest areas for higher-education institutions included innovative products and services (49 percent) and digitally enabled technology architecture (46 percent).
521q | Near-term investments will focus on shoring up strong areas of execution. In the near term, institutions will be significantly investing in some stronger areas (experience centricity) as well as some weaker areas (digitally enabled architecture). However, many are deprioritizing investments in less-developed areas (innovative products/services).
yogo | Long-term investment priorities will remain relatively stable. Over the next two to three years, institutions will continue to put investment into areas of strength (experience centricity), but they will fail to boost investment to improve weaker capabilities (innovative products/services, digitally enabled architecture).
2285 | Even though most decision makers surveyed by Forrester Consulting indicated that "consumer centeredness" was a top or high priority, many institutions have designed their service delivery models, operational processes and technology solutions to meet the needs and preferences of funders and policy makers, rather than students.
ys0g | 3.Operating model
7zvp | A further building block of transformation is adopting a target operating model. Many universities are unable to articulate clearly what is their existing operating model, or at best they post-rationalize from the status quo rather than point to a plan deliberately executed. The challenges ahead require a clear conceptual approach to a target operating model, showing how the enterprise will organize itself to execute its strategy and what detailed processes will be used.
ww6u | 4. Technology
hpi6 | Investment in technology will likely be key to efficient transformation, the challenge being to link seamlessly front-, middle- and back-office systems while coping with the complexity of the modern higher-education institution.
4uhb | As seen in the KPMG International-commissioned research conducted by Forrester Consulting, only about half of the surveyed higher education institutions built their capabilities on common digital platforms (54 percent) and even fewer had an enterprise architecture that they felt could support both current and future strategy objectives (43 percent).
epyi | To reach the scale and efficiency of operations which tomorrow's funding climate will be willing to pay for, a huge agenda of investment in technology will be required by universities over the next decade.

ppx4 | The future of higher education in a disruptive world
qf11 | For most higher-education institutions, deliberate and proactive transformation or optimization will be the means of surviving and thriving in a world which is becoming tougher. University leaders should be asking themselves:
8oqt | - How can we operate on a scale that yields productivity gains sufficient to cover our rising salary and other costs?
6zah | - Which customers do we want to serve and can do so responsibly?
4v5o | - How will we really know what they want and feel?
ha9e | What are the most important learning, personal and consumer experiences that we need to deliver?
xrnt | - How can we better use data to make decisions in real-time that meaningfully improve student experiences and make our operations more responsive?
c8ra | — How future-proofed are our operations and information infrastructure in the face of disruptive factors?
p1l0 | - What organizational capabilities does our workforce require to prepare for the profound changes in roles and workflow brought about by digital transformation?
