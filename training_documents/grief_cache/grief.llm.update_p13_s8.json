        "content": "atmh | Affirmation of the uniqueness of grief is not a new emphasis in the field of bereavement. Colin Parkes said, \"From the start, Bowlby and I recognized that there was a great deal of individual variation in\n7hgg | Grief Counseling and Grief Therapy\nxwsv | the response to bereavement and that not everybody went through these phases in the same way or at the same speed.\"\n756b | An interesting affirmation of the uniqueness and subjective quality of grief comes from an fMRI study of grief by Gundel, O'Connor, Littrell, Fort, and Lane. After investigating the grief experience in the brains of eight women, they concluded that grief is mediated by a distributed neural network that subserves a number of neural processes affecting various parts of the brain and its functions, including affect processing, mentalizing, memory retrieval, visual imagery, and autonomic regulation. This neural network may account for the unique, subjective quality of grief, and this finding provides new leads in our quest to understand the health consequences of grief and the neurobiology of attachment.\n6bx7 | I believe that the mediators of mourning outlined in detail in Chapter three hold the key to understanding individual differences in the mourning experience-the adaptation to loss from death.\nspl6 | Introduction\n7wzm | Grief Counseling and Grief Therapy\ne9xj | Introduction\n9vl6 | One ATTACHMENT, LOSS, AND THE EXPERIENCE OF GRIEF\nc2fd | ATTACHMENT THEORY\njzvp | Before one can fully comprehend the impact of a loss and the human behavior associated with it, one must have some understanding of the meaning of attachment. There is considerable writing in the psychological and psychiatric literature as to the nature of attachments-what they are and how they develop. One of the key figures and primary thinkers in this area is the late British psychiatrist John Bowlby. He devoted much of his professional career to the area of attachment and loss and wrote several substantial volumes as well as a number of articles on the subject.",
