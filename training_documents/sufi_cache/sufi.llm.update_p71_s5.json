        "content": "8kqn | Because of the tendency to stress discipline and group-attention without contemporaneous adjustments of other factors, many such formulations (some of them called schools or cults) crystallised in the short or long term, and not infrequently they have claimed a monopoly of truth or effective ritual. This process, mirroring limited thinking-patterns, frequently goes so far as to lead to virtual destruction of the dynamic of the formulation of the School. In practice, exclusivism and dogmatism, beyond a certain point, militate against certain necessities of flexibility. There is a continuing need for regeneration.\nct3i | What appears to some people as the sum total of the human heritage of philosophy, metaphysics or even magical thinking can also be viewed, for the foregoing reasons, as heavily burdened with the wreckage or misinterpretation of formulations previously operated by coherent Schools. The factor causing this state of affairs is endemic in the human community, and has often been unsuspected by large sections of whole civilisa-\ntvep | tions; though made the subject of close attention and rectification by specialists outside of mechanical and confined thought. Such specialists are those who can grasp internal principles and dynamics: not those who merely rearrange.\ndmvx | THE TRADITION MAINTAINED BY COMPETENCE\n9z6z | In contradistinction to the public and overt formulations familiar to all as stabilisations of many forms of religious, psychological and community action philosophies and other systems, there has always been a continuous, altruistic stream of guardianship of this comprehensive and adaptational knowledge, throughout history. This is based on capacity and knowledge, not on arbitrarily deciding to become a specialist.\n4qhr | There are excellently sufficient reasons why the foregoing facts have never been more publicly known or accepted in any real depth. Among those more easily understandable by customary thinkers is the fact that 'to make an announcement such as this, to those who are basically selfish will serve mainly to increase their selfishness at the expense of their real, inner desire for truth'—thus further masking the potentialities of the Teaching from such people.\n3qb9 | Another, easily-understood, reason is that the existence of narrow systems of thought (over-simplified to contain the aspirations without regard to potential, and to permit a wide-scale disciplining of populations) has produced a type of 'expert' or concentrator of this kind of bias who will automatically feel insecure if any attempt is made to widen his horizons. The result will be opposition, distrust and confusion.\naksw | From time to time, certain cosmological and human factors being in alignment, there is both a need for and a possibility to reestablish, by means of a special and skilled effort, formulations and activities which maximise the prospects of more rapid and thorough penetration of the teaching which leads to the development referred to as \"knowing oneself or 'having wisdom'. Several such periods, cyclic in character, have occurred in recent times: none of them has been generally recognised for what it is. This,\np87k | again, is not to say that because one believes this one is automatically able to find it. The correct approach is everything.\ninmq | ROLE OF AN INTERVENTION\nigkq | The first stage of this knowledge concerns answers to the questions generally phrased as involving the origin, nature, being and future of mankind itself, collectively as well as in the individual. The manner and order of procedure of approaching these questions themselves involves a capacity whose absence or ineffectiveness in the ordinary individual spells his incapacity to participate in his own development. He is in need of an organising intervention to break the vicious circle which results.\nfy1j | KNOWLEDGE OF THE END CREATES THE MEANS\nfujm | The desire for an 'awakening', often used as a technical term, may or may not be accompanied by the information and experience essential to precede this stage. The Teaching, for its part, is carried out—and is able to cross ideological boundaries—because of a knowledge of the objective: an objective which is at worst postulated as an assumption that it exists; at best glimpsed: and thenceforward is the subject of repeated attempts to devise a means to recover this glimpse.\nqq4d | The working hypothesis or traditional framework provides the structure by which the would-be illuminate attempts to approach this goal. In the case of the School, knowledge alone provides the basis upon which the structure can be devised.\nma98 | 'Once you know the end, you can devise the means.' The end does not justify the means - it provides it. The means, employed in this sense, is the structure referred to in some literature as 'The Work'.\nrboa | THE SCHOOL\nbdkb | One of the structures within which this knowledge is studied, collected, conserved and transmitted has often been termed a School. There are others, continuously at work, whose existence\nl47b | and mode of operation is not of applied value, though frequently a matter of curiosity and inquisitiveness, occupying much time and giving rise to much effort, due to the faultily-based assumption that a lively interest in something once heard about may lead to familiarity with it, and hence usefulness to be gained from it. Since, however, its modus operandi is far from having an exactly operable analogy in current thought, it is in fact, if not in theory, 'completely concealed'.\nzio7 | It is extremely common for encounters to take place between people who are interested in this area, and those working in it, without the former being in any way able to enter into it—or, most frequently, for them to have any conception or recognition of the role or method of operation of the other individuals.\nmty2 | The 'School Work' is a lower-level activity which nonetheless has to be passed through before a recognition of the higher level is possible. Acceptance of this principle is among the first requirements leading to the necessary effective time-scale and order of events in which the Teaching may take effect. One of the chief barriers to accepting this fact—even as a working hypothesis—is the overvaluation of the role, potentiality and knowledge of the learner.\ntbjy | It is for this reason that such stress is placed, in so many traditional systems of which viable fragments subsist, upon the need for what is approximately rendered in familiar parlance as humility. Its distortion is self-abasement.\nmszq | WHAT HUMILITY IS NOT FOR\ni0p0 | As one of the great Sufis said: 'My humility is not there to impress you - it is there for its own reason.'\nok43 | The person that you feel yourself to be, according to the Sufis, is a false person, which has no true reality. When humility is exercised, people begin to realise that they do not, as it were, exist at all. This perception of oneself as 'Adam (not-being) is stressed in Hujwiri's Revelation, in the second chapter dealing with the real meaning of poverty. When people take pride in their humility, they have merely adopted another concocted 'self as part of their not-being: and this is what produces hypocrites.\nqnqv | The purpose of seeing through one's own nothingness is to see beyond into what is really there to which one's real self can relate. Humility is therefore directly concerned with the quest for Absolute Truth.\niwpq | NO VALUE IN MAKING A VIRTUE OF A FUNCTION",
