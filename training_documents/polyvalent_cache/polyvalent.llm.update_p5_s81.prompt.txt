You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.

These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

bfax | Phage Concentration Determination Using ELISA.
f2y8 | Non-specific protein immobilization at the liquid/solid inter- face (of a microtiter plate) is one of the most commonly used methods of preparing wells for ELISA. This immobilized target is recognized by soluble molecules like antibodies or peptide- displaying phages. Stages of ELISA, which assumes specific recognition, may be described using a modified Langmuir-like isotherm.46 It should be noted that this model cannot be applied for initial non-specific precaution.46 Since wells are coated with TnT molecules and the number of available target molecules (active sites), they may bind a limited number of phages. Moreover, the number of bound phages limits the amount of bound HRP-conjugated antibodies. The surface density of HRP enzyme (i.e., the amount of HRP immobilized on the liquid/solid interface) is a crucial factor affecting the rate of substrate (3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine, TMB) oxidation. The reaction rate may be expressed by the rate of the change of absorbance at 370 nm (which is the maximum absorption of the yellow byproduct47) under the assumption that the kinetics of the enzymatic reaction is zero order (Michaelis-Menten model and enzyme saturation). In this case, the measured signal is the enzyme activity defined as the slope of the linear time function of absorbance (eq 13).
o7qm | Enzyme activity is proportional to the amount of bound HRP- conjugated antibodies and indirectly to the number of bound phages (eq 14). When the reaction is stopped by the addition of sulfuric acid, the enzyme is denatured. As a result, the blue complex dissociates into a yellow product (adsorption maximum at 450 nm) and transparent TMB.47,48

nhsg | The application of kinetic-based ELISA (also shortened to k- ELISA) was previously described and developed by several authors.49 : 49-52 The signal recorded in this way has significant advantages such as independence from time-shifting, path length, wells material heterogeneity, and air bubbles.35 Single- data-point absorbance reading is easier and more high- throughput but generates a higher error.

4jmz | the A3 clone gave the calibration curve as y = 0.0010x + 0.0006 and R2 = 0.9961, indicating specific interaction with the studied target, while for the wild-type variant, it was y = 0.0006x + 0.0013 and R2 = 0.6323. Such a low R2 coefficient may suggest mainly non-specific interaction of the wild-type phage. For the A3, we also calculated sensitivity to be 0.264 x 109 abs.mL.pfu-1.min-1. The empirically found range of the linearity of the signal enables the calculation of Ka via ELISA. In this range, da/d(CM13) equals the constant value of sensitivity calculated above. The range of the linearity limits and indicates the range of analysis. To maximize the reproducibility of experiments, we decided to work with a phage concentration of about (1.0-10.0) × 109 pfu/mL, which corresponds to about 1.6-16 pM.
b7cq | Determination of Ka via k-ELISA. ELISA (also k-ELISA) can be used to measure the dissociation constant (Ka), which is commonly applied to describe affinity." According to the mathematical model presented above, the Ka value can be calculated via pre-incubation of a receptor with varied concentrations of ligand and subsequent detection of the soluble receptor (phage) via ELISA. This approach was

Moreover, the authors applied a wide range of ligand concentrations, high excess compared to the receptor and treated the concentration-signal function as logarithmic, while the discussion above concluded that it is not possible to apply Frigeut's method for almost completely saturated receptors (due to ligand excess).
1o7p | In our work, analysis was performed for clones: A3, B7, D11, and wild-type M13. These clones were selected for further analysis because they exhibited the highest affinity in screening and could be easily amplified; therefore, the C9 clone was not chosen. The phages' total concentration was about 1 × 1010 pfu/mL (16 pM) and was carefully determined using the biological method immediately before analysis. The range of ratios of total TnT and total phage concentration was 1:2, 1:1, 2:1, and 4:1. Increasing TnT concentration causes an increase in the saturation of phage-displayed receptors. As a result, a decrease in the ability to bind to immobilized TnT molecules occurs. Experimental data were analyzed according to the presented mathematical model. Calculated values of Ka (from linear slope regression) are listed in Table 3.
