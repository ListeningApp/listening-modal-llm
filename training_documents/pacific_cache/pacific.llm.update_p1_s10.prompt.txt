You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

f682 | The Tara Pacific expedition-A pan-ecosystemic approach of the "-omics" complexity of coral reef holobionts across the Pacific Ocean
li1k | Abstract
pbea | Coral reefs are the most diverse habitats in the marine realm. Their productivity, structural complexity, and biodiversity critically depend on ecosystem services provided by corals that are threatened because of climate change effects-in particular, ocean warming and acidifica- tion. The coral holobiont is composed of the coral animal host, endosymbiotic dinoflagellates,
ccpt | associated viruses, bacteria, and other microeukaryotes. In particular, the mandatory photo- symbiosis with microalgae of the family Symbiodiniaceae and its consequences on the evolu- tion, physiology, and stress resilience of the coral holobiont have yet to be fully elucidated. The functioning of the holobiont as a whole is largely unknown, although bacteria and viruses are presumed to play roles in metabolic interactions, immunity, and stress tolerance. In the context of climate change and anthropogenic threats on coral reef ecosystems, the Tara Pacific project aims to provide a baseline of the "-omics" complexity of the coral holobiont and its ecosystem across the Pacific Ocean and for various oceanographically distinct defined areas. Inspired by the previous Tara Oceans expeditions, the Tara Pacific expedition (2016- 2018) has applied a pan-ecosystemic approach on coral reefs throughout the Pacific Ocean, drawing an east-west transect from Panama to Papua New Guinea and a south-north tran- sect from Australia to Japan, sampling corals throughout 32 island systems with local repli- cates. Tara Pacific has developed and applied state-of-the-art technologies in very-high- throughput genetic sequencing and molecular analysis to reveal the entire microbial and chemical diversity as well as functional traits associated with coral holobionts, together with various measures on environmental forcing. This ambitious project aims at revealing a mas- sive amount of novel biodiversity, shedding light on the complex links between genomes, tran- scriptomes, metabolomes, organisms, and ecosystem functions in coral reefs and providing a reference of the biological state of modern coral reefs in the Anthropocene.
0fpw | Introduction
dqn8 | The 20th century has seen the earth enter into the now widely called Anthropocene [1]. Anthropogenically induced changes are happening on both global and local scales and are altering the physiology of organisms and ecosystems by modifying the entire earth's physical, chemical, and biological processes [2]. Among marine ecosystems, coral reefs have the unfor- tunate privilege of being highly sensitive to these environmental modifications [3]. In particu- lar, the thermally mediated process of coral bleaching-i.e., the loss of the obligate photosynthetic microalgal endosymbionts-is increasingly decimating corals. Projections esti- mate that approximately 25% of reefs have already been lost, and up to 99% will be threatened and dramatically transformed by 2050 [4]. Even though they cover only approximately 0.2% of the ocean's surface [5], coral reefs harbor approximately 30% of ocean biodiversity [6], provid- ing ecological services (fisheries, tourism, coastal protection) to nearly 1 billion people [7], and are estimated to be worth USD 30 billion per year [8].
cop0 | The late 20th century has also seen our world entering into the "-omics" revolution sparked by the development of high-throughput analyses of DNA, RNA, proteins, and metabolites. This revolution has changed our approach to investigate organisms, and it is about to change the descriptions of ecosystems as genes-to-ecosystem modeling improves [9]. It will advance our capabilities to investigate the biodiversity and functioning of our oceans in a holistic way. Holistic approaches, interrogating components across the various levels of organization of an ecosystem, appear accessible today, as exemplified in the Tara Oceans project [10], which con- tinues to decipher biodiversity and structural networks across all plankton organisms in the ocean [11].
lhkq | Tara Pacific is a unique scientific expedition inspired by earlier maritime explorations that uncovered the unchartered territories of marine biodiversity. Coral reef research
82ju | started with the contribution of Charles Darwin during "the voyage of the Beagle" (1831- 1836), when Darwin explored many reefs in the Indian and Pacific Oceans and established his biophysical theory of the formation of coral reefs and atolls [12]. He also highlighted the paradoxical high diversity of reef organisms living in a nutrient-poor system. Later, the Great Barrier Reef Expedition (1928-1929) led by Charles Yonge was a landmark in coral reef research, as it established the scientific basis of coral physiology (nutrition, symbiosis, growth, etc.). The "polypifers," later called coral polyps, were then demonstrated to host a large population of organisms (protists, viruses, bacteria, archaea, and all sorts of unicellular and multicellular eukaryotes), which are intimately involved in the physiology of the coral animal host in a complex and still mysterious system named the holobiont [13].
y2qo | The Tara Pacific expedition has built on these early tracks, applying the most recent tech- nologies to map the "-omics" complexity of the coral holobiont within its ecosystem and across the Pacific Ocean. Through the exploration of marine biodiversity at scales spanning from organisms to genes to biomolecules, Tara Pacific is undertaking the first pan-ecosystemic study of coral reef diversity across an entire ocean basin (Fig 1). Given that a holistic approach integrating all components of the reef biota is unrealistic, the Tara Pacific expedition focuses its approach on widely distributed coral and fish holobionts and their contextual biological (plankton) and physicochemical environment, including modifications in the context of global changes (Fig 2).
1piq | The geographic and sequencing extent of Tara Pacific will bring an exceptionally compre- hensive description of coral holobionts, together with the surrounding fish and plankton biota. Such unprecedented sequencing coverage and depth will place coral reefs among the first eco- systems with a comprehensive description of their hologenomic diversity (i.e., the totality of genomes making up the coral holobiont) across their natural environments. We will go beyond the mere description of species composition to investigate in detail the gene content and gene expression of these communities, as well as the interconnectedness with their hosts and habitats. Broad emerging patterns will then be accessible through large-scale data mining and network analyses.

rhaz | The coral host
wak1 | Scleractinian corals evolved over 450 million years ago [14] and belong to the phylum Cni- daria, animals located close to the root of the metazoans. Because of their place in the early Eumetazoa and as a sister group of bilaterians, the cnidarians allow interesting evolutionary analyses regarding the origins of animal complexity and the coevolution of early animals with microbes. Shinzato and colleagues [15] were the first to show that the coral genome is as com- plex as the one of vertebrates and that it has retained many ancestral genes lost in other line- ages. Subsequent studies confirmed the deep genomic differences between coral taxa [16]. Moreover, the exceptional longevity of corals, reaching several hundred to thousands of years, makes them attractive emerging models for aging studies.

qy1i | Reef corals host symbiotic unicellular algae of the family Symbiodiniaceae inside their endo- dermal cells [17], raising intriguing questions on animal-plant interactions, photosymbiosis, coevolution, and speciation [18]. The divergence and genetic variation within and between populations of coral species is also investigated, allowing us to firmly ground the exact taxo- nomic status of each coral host [19].
