You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

hntf | the mid-1980s, led to Pacific hake being declared overfished (i.e. below 25% of - average - unfished spawning biomass) in the United States in 2002. The strong 1999 year class was subsequently observed in the acoustic survey and fisheries, and a new assessment and abundance estimate led to the stock being declared rebuilt in 2004.
99fo | The allocation issue was resolved with the development and eventual implementation of the Agreement between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of Canada on Pacific Hake/Whiting (the Treaty), which was signed in November 2003. The Treaty specifies a process for developing annual stock assessments and total allowable catch (TAC), including a default harvest rate of F40% and fixed allocations of 73.88% and 26.12% for the United States and Canada, respectively. The Hake Treaty established a Joint Management Commission (JMC) that decides the annual TAC. JMC decisions are guided by the terms of the Treaty and the JMC's three advisory bodies consisting of the Joint Technical Committee (JTC), the Scientific Review Group (SRG) and an Advisory Panel. The JTC conducts the annual stock assessment and develops potential yield amounts for JMC consideration. The SRG assures the technical integrity of the stock assessment and the assessment's potential yield estimates. The Advisory Panel is composed of hake industry participants from the United States and Canada, who provide their perspectives about the fishery.
y5r7 | Management of the coastal Pacific hake fishery is shared among the JMC, who recommends the annual TAC, the U.S. NMFS (NOAA Fisheries) and the Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO), which are responsi- ble for domestic management of their countries fisheries. In the United States, NOAA Fisheries receive advice from the Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC), which recommends specific management and enforcement measures. Canada gives priority to domestic fisheries in allocating yield between domestic and joint venture fisheries.
lrry | An Individual Vessel Quota (IVQ) system was implemented for the British Columbia trawl fleet in 1997, with allocation based on a combination of vessel size and landings history. Although vessels may deliver joint venture hake quota to domestic shore-side processors, they are not permitted to deliver domestic allocation to joint venture/processor operations at sea. There is no direct allocation of quota to individual shoreside processors. IVQ holders declare the proportion of their hake quota that will be landed in the domestic market, and shoreside processors must secure catch from vessel license holders (Devitt, 2009).
hvhm | In the United States, yield is allocated among coastal tribes and the three domestic sectors. Washington coastal tribes have a treaty right to request amounts of fish to conduct fisheries within their respective usual and accus- tomed fishing areas. The Makah tribe has been full participants in the hake fishery since 1996. Beginning in 2009, the Quileute tribe has been requested and allocated an amount but has yet to harvest any hake. The Quinault tribe has also expressed interest in the hake fishery.
863b | 248
fj24 | A formal allocation structure for the U.S. non-tribal fishery sectors was developed by the PFMC and implemented by NOAA Fisheries in 1997. Each year, the non-tribal allocation is divided among the shore-based trawl sector (42%), the mothership sector (24%) and the catcher-processor sector (34%). This action stabilised the fishery and resolved a highly contentious allocation battle and alleviated the race to fish. The allocation provides each group with a relative amount of stability in business planning by reducing the excessive competitive pressures associated with an open-access, derby style fishery: it slowed the pace of the fishery and opened opportunities for the fishery to act more rationally, improve product quality and expand product forms.
uz3c | Shortly after the 1997 allocation agreement, the companies licensed to operate in the at-sea catcher-processor sector of the U.S. Pacific hake fishery formed the Pacific Whiting Conservation Cooperative (PWCC) to promote rational harvest, optimal utilisation and minimal waste in the fishery. The PWCC fishing cooperative ended the race-for-fish in the catcher-processor sec- tor 14 years before the comprehensive rationalisation of the U.S. Pacific hake fishery. Their efforts resulted in decreased bycatch and waste, improved product quality and reduced fishing effort. The PWCC also sponsors scientific research, including stock assessment-related projects and bycatch avoidance programs. The cooperative model developed by the PWCC was later adopted in other fish- eries, such as the walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma) fishery off Alaska.
d5bi | Management of the U.S. fishery transitioned in 2011 to a fully rationalised fishery, with an individual quota share program for the shoreside fishery and formal cooperatives for the mothership sector in addition to those for the catcher-processor sector. Bycatch of other groundfish species is strictly managed under the quota share system in the shoreside hake fishery, while sector-specific overfished rockfish species catch limits are used to ensure their minimal bycatch in the mothership and catcher-processor fisheries. Endangered Species Act listed salmonid impacts are managed under the aegis of a NOAA Fisheries Biological Opinion, for which specific measures include closed areas, seasonal fishery structure and overall limits on Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) bycatch.
ba4l | Mid-water trawl nets are required in the U.S. hake fishery. These are four-seam nets designed to catch schooling fish such as walleye pollock and Pacific hake, whose schools tend to behave in unison. Bycatch of non-hake species in the Pacific hake fishery is generally quite low, as Pacific hake tend to aggregate in large acoustically recognisable schools in the pelagic zone and mid-water trawl gear is fished off the bottom minimising interactions with non-hake species. Nonetheless, bycatch of limiting rockfish species has occasionally been an issue. The U.S. non-tribal hake fishery sectors are held to hard bycatch limits that, if exceeded, can result in closure of non-tribal fisheries, to limit impacts on certain depleted rockfish species. Prior to 2009, the rockfish bycatch limits were not sector specific; that is, high bycatch in one sector could close the fishery for all the non-tribal sectors. In both 2007 and 2008, there were mid-season closures due to bycatch of limiting species, but the

y219 | fishery was reopened later in the year once bycatch quota was reallocated from other fisheries. Despite these closures, about 90% of the U.S. hake TAC was achieved in both those years, similar to other recent years without closures. The bycatch limits were applied at the specific sector level beginning in 2009, minimising the potential for one sector to affect the other sectors. Under the trawl rationalisation program, bycatch in the shoreside hake fishery is now managed using a quota share system.
06ht | The three U.S. non-tribal sectors track tow-by-tow catch and bycatch amounts using real-time catch information collected by fishery observers. When the rare high bycatch tow occurs, that information is shared with the rest of the fleet so that other vessels can avoid fishing in the area of high bycatch. The U.S. hake industry also works in partnership with NOAA Fisheries in testing newly developed bycatch reduction devices (BRDs) specifically designed for the hake fishery. Lomeli and Wakefield (2012) tested two open escape window BRD designs, with the goal of providing a tool to reduce the bycatch of Chinook salmon and rockfish in the hake fishery. The most successful design reduced bycatch by about 80% for Chinook salmon and 20% for widow rockfish (Sebastes entomelas).
v3r2 | The coastal Pacific hake stock is characterised by low recruitment punc- tuated by very strong year classes (Figure 9.5), leading to highly variable estimates of catch at FMsy. The fishery is managed to sustain the stock through these fluctuations in recruitment. The 40-10% rule, which decreases allowable catch from the FMsy rule when the spawning stock is below 40% of modeled average unfished biomass (catch goes to zero at 10% of unfished biomass), providing a precautionary mechanism to curtail harvest when the stock is low, had been used in the PFMC process for many years before being written into the Treaty. The JMC determines TAC by considering current stock status, uncertainties in the data and model projections and the potential effect on future stock status, while limited by the F40% default harvest rate and the 40-10% rule. The coast-wide fishery, on average, has attained 85% of the TAC in the most recent years (2008-2012), mostly due to unused tribal allocation and bycatch restrictions.
nv42 | A final challenge to the management of Pacific hake is the potential over- lap of the coastal stock and its fishery with other smaller stocks. An overlap is unlikely to be a major risk biologically for the large coastal stock (although it could contaminate the compositional data used for assessment) but could be biologically risky to the other, smaller stocks, depending on the fishing mortal- ity experienced by those stocks.

The U.S. fishery observers began monitoring Pacific hake catch on foreign vessels in 1977, more than two decades before most other U.S. west coast fisheries carried observers. Domestic catcher-processors and at-sea processing vessels (motherships) vol- untarily began carrying observers in 1991, in what was essentially an outgrowth of the observing conducted on many of these same vessels in the Alaska walleye pollock fishery. From 2004 to 2010, vessels delivering Pacific hake to shore- side plants operated under an electronic monitoring program that required no at-sea discarding of catch, at-sea monitoring using cameras and catch mon- itors at the shoreside processing facilities to record catch and bycatch. Since 2011, comprehensive observer coverage in the U.S. Pacific hake fishery has been mandatory, with human observers onboard catcher-processors, mother- ships, catcher vessels delivering to motherships and catcher vessels delivering to shoreside plants; there are also port samplers that monitor the catch delivered to shoreside plants.
5zyf | Canada first deployed fishery observers on foreign vessels targeting Pacific hake in 1987. Since 1996, on-board observers have monitored and sampled the catch of all domestic groundfish vessels, and all landed catch from trawlers is subject to a dockside monitoring program. Currently, surveillance and mon- itoring measures include a combination of at-sea observers (10-100% cover- age) on vessels fishing for Pacific hake in Canadian waters (for headed-gutted freezer vessels, 100% at-sea observer coverage is required); electronic mon- itoring (e.g. deck cameras) and full retention of all fish brought on board; and 100% dockside (offload) monitoring. This monitoring program is sup- plemented by coast-wide surveillance via over-flights by fishery enforcement officers and patrol vessels (Devitt, 2009).
9own | 9.5.2 Fishery-independent surveys
bqfb | The adult stock of coastal Pacific hake has been surveyed acoustically starting in (for more details cf. review by Ressler et al., 2007), although earlier surveys covered only part of the coastal stock's range. The stock was surveyed on a triennial basis from 1977 through 2001 with a switch to a biennial schedule from 2003 to 2011. A supplemental survey was conducted in 2012, followed by the regular biennial survey in 2013. Surveys between 1977 and 1992 were con- ducted entirely by the NOAA's Alaska Fisheries Science Center. In 1995, the operation became a joint United States-Canada survey with the addition of the DFO Canada, Pacific Biological Station, and in 2003, NOAA's Northwest Fisheries Science Center took over the U.S. portion of the survey.
wwdt | The acoustic survey is conducted in the summer months, from mid-June through early September, typically moving south to north from Monterey, California, to Dixon Entrance, Alaska, using a design that covers waters from about 50 to 1500 m deep along parallel transects at 10-nm spacing. The parallel transect design was developed when computing power and
mn1r | Biology, fisheries, assessment and management of Pacific hake
5vqw | analytical techniques designed to minimise or remove spatial and/or temporal autocorrelation in data were limited. Recent surveys have used geostatistical analysis techniques (i.e. kriging) to compute biomass and variance, and as a result, zigzag transects or other less-regular transect designs could be used in the future. In some years, the survey has had to extend farther south or north in response to observed hake aggregations to cover the entire extent of the stock. The survey was expanded in the 1990s to include northern and offshore areas of the hake distribution that had not been included in the original survey design (Dorn et al., 1993; Dorn, 1996), and a set of expansion factors were calculated in an attempt to calibrate the early survey data years so that they would be to be roughly comparable to the updated survey design. However, this proved an unresolvable task given the natural variation in northern migration between years.
meyw | The survey relies on 38 kHz as the primary acoustic frequency to estimate Pacific hake biomass, although additional frequencies as available on the U.S. and Canadian survey vessels are also used to help distinguish hake from other acoustic targets. Acoustic backscatter attributed to Pacific hake is scaled to biomass or abundance using a length-based model of target strength (TS), the log-transformed acoustic backscatter expected from a single fish or unit biomass. In 1995, this model was changed from a weight-based TS of -35 dB/kg to a TS-length relation of <LATEX>T S = 2 0 \log L - 6 8</LATEX> (Traynor, 1996), where <LATEX>L</LATEX> is fork length in centimetres. Variability in Pacific hake TS has continued to be an active area of research (e.g. Henderson and Horne, 2007); data from the most recent field measurements (Fleischer et al., unpub- lished data) were generally consistent with mean and variation indicated in Traynor (1996).
