        "content": "fj24 | Mechanism of eosinophil-mediated killing of helminth parasites\nuz3c | The mechanism by which eosinophil-mediated protection against helminth infection occurs is incompletely understood, but in most cases it appears to involve antibody-induced release, complement-induced release, or both of toxic granule proteins and reactive oxygen inter-\nd5bi | feature articles\nba4l | Reviews and\nffx8 | mediates by activated eosinophils. Interestingly, evidence suggests that there might be significant differences in the susceptibility to and mechanisms of eosinophil-mediated killing between different life-cycle stages of the same parasite. Unlike protozoa, helminths are too big to be engulfed by phagocytes and can only be killed by these cells when the latter have been activated by products of the adaptive immune response.\ns6su | Eosinophils, which frequently accumulate in tissues soon after worm invasion, might also play a role in innate defense against this type of parasitic pathogen. For example, L three larvae of S stercoralis are killed within seventy-two hours when implanted in chambers in susceptible mice, with eosinophils being prominent among the cells infiltrating the chambers. Larval attrition is greatly reduced when worms are transferred instead into I L five-deficient mice. This rapid and nonspecific eosinophilic response might be a barrier-limiting mechanism active against the invasion of many tissue-dwelling helminths.\ny219 | EOSINOPHILS AND PATHOGENESIS\n06ht | Eosinophils have also been implicated in the pathogenesis of helminth infection. Similarities between the sequelae of hypereosinophilic syndrome, a syndrome characterized by extremely high levels of eosinophilia and eosinophil-mediated end-organ damage, and the pathologic consequences of infection with helminths, including loiasis and lymphatic filariasis and toxocariasis, suggest a primary role for eosinophils in the pathogenesis of these infections. The association between the severity of clinical manifestations and the degree of eosinophil activation, as exemplified by increased eosinophil responsiveness to platelet-activating factor in patients with sowda, a hyperreactive form of onchocerciasis associated with severe dermal pathology, provides additional indirect support for this hypothesis.\nv3r2 | Although eosinophils can cause tissue damage through a number of different mechanisms, including direct cellular cytotoxicity, physical damage caused by tissue infiltration (space occupying), and thromboembolic phenomena caused by eosinophil-induced hypercoagulability, it\nnv42 | feature articles\nxags | Reviews and\njc47 | is the release of eosinophil granule proteins and other cytotoxic substances that has been best correlated with helminth-induced tissue damage. Eosinophil cationic proteins (including major basic protein, eosinophil cationic protein, and eosinophil-derived neurotoxin) are toxic to various normal tissues and cells both in vitro and in vivo. Other potentially toxic inflammatory mediators that are released by activated eosinophils include leukotrienes, platelet-activating factor, reactive oxygen species, and lysosomal hydrolases. These mediators not only damage the parasite and surrounding tissues (reactive oxygen intermediates and hydrolases) but play a role in the perpetuation of the local immune response (platelet-activating factor and leukotrienes).\nko3c | Serum and urine levels of eosinophil granule proteins provide an indirect measure of degranulation in the tissues and are markedly increased in many helminth-infected patients. Furthermore, deposition of eosinophil granule proteins in the affected tissues of patients with helminth infection has also been described. One of the characteristics of the posttreatment reaction in onchocerciasis is an increase in blood and tissue levels of eosinophils and eosinophil granule proteins that is temporally related to the onset of symptomatology and preceded by an increase in serum levels of I L five. Although localization of eosinophils and their products in the skin is most pronounced at sites of microfilarial degeneration, which is consistent with the hypothesis that eosinophil-mediated parasite killing plays a major role in pathogenesis, the possibility that recruitment of eosinophils occurs secondarily in response to parasite death cannot be excluded.\nxek3 | More direct evidence that eosinophils contribute to the pathogenesis of helminth infection comes from animal models. Eosinophilic infiltration of the cornea and conjunctival tissue, a characteristic component of onchocercal sclerosing keratitis in human subjects, occurs within seventy-two hours of intrastromal injection of sensitized mice with onchocercal antigens. Attenuation of both the eosinophil response and ocular inflammation is observed in I L four knockout mice on a C fifty-seven BL six background, whereas eosinophil infiltration and corneal opacification is increased in mice treated with I L twelve at the time of corneal sensitization to onchocercal antigens despite decreased local expression of T H two cytokines, including I L five. The presence of eosinophil infiltration in a T H one environment could be accounted for by a marked increase in corneal chemokines, including RANTES and eotaxin. Taken together, these data suggest that eosinophils, rather than the cytokine milieu, are the crucial factor in the development of onchocercal keratitis.\nbbpr | Although it seems clear that eosinophils play a role in some models of helminth-induced pathology, they do not appear to be essential to the development of pathologic sequelae in all cases. Liver granulomas in schistosomiasis typically contain a high percentage of activated eosinophils, the major source of T H two-associated cytokines in the granuloma milieu. Despite this, anti-I L five-treated mice infected with schistosomiasis produce normal-sized granulomas, despite the absence of\n5zyf | eosinophils. Similarly, lung infiltrates in N brasilien- sis-infected mice treated with anti-I L five differ from those of N brasiliensis-infected control mice in the absence of eosinophils but not in size or number of lesions. Finally, in contrast to the attenuation of ocular disease observed in I L four knockout C fifty-seven BL six J mice, corneal opacification is exacerbated in sensitized I L four knockout BALB slash C J, STAT six knockout BALB slash C J, and I L five knockout C fifty-seven BL six J mice after intrastromal injection of onchocercal antigen and is accompanied by increased tissue infiltration by neutrophils (but not eosinophils). Whether these findings reflect a true lack of involvement of eosinophils in the pathologic sequelae of natural infection with these parasites or the induction of alternative mechanisms of pathogenesis in the setting of dysregulation of the cytokine milieu remains to be elucidated.\n9own | CONCLUSIONS",
