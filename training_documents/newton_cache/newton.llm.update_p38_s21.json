Next, we show script A of the quantity X sup star , zero contains script A of the quantity X sub K plus one , zero . In particular, we prove the contrapositive statement I in script I of the quantity X star , zero implies I in script I of the quantity X sub K plus one , zero . Suppose I in script I of the quantity X star , zero the result will follow by showing that the X sub K plus one remains bounded away from zero. Let Delta sub b n d equals the minimum of the set Delta sub zero , Delta sub one , Delta sub two , Delta sub sep , Delta sub e v x . Having X sub K in B of the quantity X star , Delta sub b n d implies script I of the quantity X star , zero equals script I of the quantity X sub K , delta . Additionally, the bound applies and so alpha in the interval bar alpha , one implies\ncg8u | Alpha absolute value P sub K sup I absolute value is less than or equal to the norm of P sub K sup script I of the quantity X sub K , delta is less than or equal to delta divided by two ,\n2hsv | Inexact Newton-type Methods for Optimization with Nonnegativity Constraints\n7s7l | which yields\nuwdf | X sub K sup I plus alpha P sub K sup I is greater than or equal to X sub K sup I minus alpha absolute value P sub K sup I absolute value is greater than or equal to X sub K sup I minus the quantity delta divided by two is greater than the quantity delta divided by two ,\njjgp | where the final inequality follows from I in script I of the quantity X star , zero equals script I of the quantity X sub K , delta implies X sub K sup I is greater than delta . Finally we compute the step as\ndf4g | X sub K plus one equals P of the quantity X sub K sup I plus alpha P sub K sup I equals X sub K sup I plus alpha P sub K sup I is greater than zero , which is the result.\nqc2j | Now for the second part of the result. Fix Delta greater than zero . From the first part of the result we know that for X sub K in B of the quantity X star , Delta sub b n d we have script A of the quantity X sub K , delta equals script A of the quantity X sub K plus one , zero equals script A of the quantity X star , zero , which implies X sub K plus one sup script A of the quantity X sub K , delta equals X sub K plus one sup script A of the quantity X sub K plus one , zero equals zero and X star sup script A of the quantity X sub K , delta equals X star sup script A of the quantity X star , zero equals zero .
