Why? We have no pent up demand. All desire has been satisfied. When you \"pull the trigger too early,\" each successive instance we promote, we sell even fewer. Eventually, we run out of sufficient demand to make even a single sale. This is the sad state many businesses find themselves in always trying to generate more demand to make another quick sale.\n8x23 | Hormozi Law: The longer you delay the ask, the bigger the ask you can make. \"The longer the runway, the bigger the plane that can take off.\"\nnf5i | We must endeavor to keep our supply (and satisfaction of desire) under the demand that we are able to generate. This maximizes profits and keeps desire ravenous in our customer base. This is the real key to never going hungry.\n6f7n | Summary Points\nr0bb | The reason I titled this sub-section \"Delicate Dance of Desire\" is that supply and demand are inversely correlated (in theory). If you satisfy zero desire (provide zero supply), you will not make money, and eventually leave people feeling rejected (Note: it takes much longer than you think).\nucxa | Conversely, if you satisfy all the demand, you will kill your golden goose, and not know where your next meal will come from. Mastering supply and demand comes from the elegant dance between the two. If you sleep with your significant other everyday they have less desire than if you haven't slept with them for a week. We want the ravenous prospect, not merely the aroused.\ndpzv | Therefore, understanding the interplay between these variables is key to enhancing your offer and the amount of profits you will make over time. Up to this point, we have covered all the things inside of your offer that can make it immune to price comparison and transform regular services and products into things that people will find a way to pay for. It would follow that the next variable that can make your offer more desirable is how it is presented. In other words, the outside variables that position the product in your prospect's mind. These forces are often more powerful than your core offer. In this next section Enhancing Your Offer, I will show you how I:\np3zg | One. Use scarcity to decrease supply to raise prices (and indirectly increase demand through perceived exclusiveness)\ndcq6 | Two. Use urgency to increase demand by decreasing the action threshold of a prospect.\n4onb | Three. Use bonuses to increase demand (and increase perceived exclusivity).\nj6i2 | Four. Use guarantees to increase demand by reversing risk.\nsu8b | Five. Use names to re-stimulate demand and expand awareness of my offer to my target audience.\nap79 | I will define each, then give you examples of how to use them. We will use all these variables to enhance our offer and shift the demand curve in our favor, leaving our customers always wanting for more. We will start by tactically stimulating \"fear of missing out\" also known as FOMO through scarcity.\no2lj | ENHANCING THE OFFER: SCARCITY\n9ksk | \"Sold out.\"\n3rje | SCARCITY (X LEFT /Y SPOTS) SOLD OUT ! Number of Units/Availability\n1ib3 | Scarcity is one of the most powerful and least understood forces to unlock unlimited pricing power. If you want to learn how to sell air for millions of dollars, then pay attention.\nlokq | The reason an authority (like a doctor), a celebrity (like Oprah), or a celebrity authority (like Doctor Oz or Doctor Phil) can charge egregious rates is because of implied demand. People assume that there is a lot of demand for their time, and, therefore, not a big supply of it. As a result, it must be expensive.\ni9g3 | That being said, it's hard for most businesses to understand what it's really like to have an uneven supply-demand curve until you've experienced it. I'm going to try and walk you through what it felt like for me the first time I experienced it in order to give you a taste of the power.\naprs | When I got into this world of acquisition, I saw mentors of mine selling days of time for fifty thousand dollars or more. My mind was blown for two reasons. First, because I didn't understand how they could make so much money for a single day. Second, because I didn't understand who in their right mind was buying it. Over time, I learned.\nnna4 | I'll start with the buyer. If I have a rare problem, and I must solve this problem for my own pursuit of happiness, it will consume all of my attention. By the nature of my problem being specialized, there will be very few people who can solve it. This means there is not a large supply of solvers. In many cases, I will perceive only one possible \"solver\" (Supply equals one).\n83b6 | Real Life Value Case Study\nph9z | There are many people who can solve the problem: how do I make ten thousand dollars per month?\nmuji | But far fewer who can solve: How can I add five million dollars in profit without adding any extra product lines to my business? (This was a real project that took me sixty minutes and resulted in exactly five million dollars in bottom line profit by slightly altering the pricing model of the business). You could say the business owner was ... \"very happy\" with the result of the engagement.\nglmb | Beyond that, if solving this problem speeds up my achievement of a goal by a year or two, or immediately results in me making hundreds of thousands of dollars, or millions of dollars, that solution becomes far more valuable, does it not? Of course it does. And so, it would follow, if I can pay someone fifty thousand dollars for a day of their time, and see an increase of five hundred thousand dollars per month in revenue within three months because of the insights and strategies revealed, that would be a helluva return on investment, right?\nsaqe | So there are two components to the value: first, how rare the sources are; second, the actual value being provided. The value and rarity compound to create some truly breathtaking profits.\ne6o9 | Specialized consultants are paid millions of dollars to solve problems worth tens of millions to clients. The client pays for all the experience and expertise the expert has and avoids the cost of errors (time and money). In short, they skip the bad stuff and go straight to the good stuff more quickly and for less money than it would cost to figure it out on their own ... a beautiful economic exchange.\nwgep | I personally experienced this for the first time when I had two different people offer me fifty thousand dollars for a day of my time after speaking at an event. They were scaling an education business in a niche (not too dissimilar from my own) and could not get\n71hf | past the one million dollar per month mark. As someone who was doing one million dollars per week in the same business type (at the time), I was a very specific type of person with the keys to their problem.\nefpl | So what happened, you ask? Drum roll ... I didn't accept their offers. Why? Because I was making more than fifty thousand dollars per day in profit from my business and didn't want the distraction.\n01ri | Author Note:\n1lfn | It was years later that I started Acquisition.com to help these very people. But instead of charging a day rate, I simply become an equity holder in the company to completely align interests for short and long term (and so I can see the implementations through). And as my time is limited by the laws of physics, for everyone else below that three million to ten million dollar per year mark, I make all these materials for free.\n```",
