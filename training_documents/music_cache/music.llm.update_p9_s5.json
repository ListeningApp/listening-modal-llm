Plutarch's Dialogue on Music approaches the nearest to history ; but, though it abounds with particulars relative to the subject, it is so short and defective, that it rather excites than gratifies curiosity.\nz8tt | Some of the writings of Aristotle and Aristoxenus that are lost, though they were not express histories of music, would, nevertheless, had they been preserved, have satisfied our doubts concerning several parts of ancient music, which are now left to conjecture.\n9g22 | A GENERAL HISTORY OF MUSIC\n41fx | \"Aristotle, the disciple of Plato,\" says Plutarch, \"regarded melody as something noble, great, and divine.\" Now, as this passage is not to be found in the remaining works of Aristotle, it is imagined that Plutarch took it either from his Treatise on Music, or the second book of his Poetics, where he treated of the Flute and Cithara, both which works are lost. And yet Kircher, in his Musurgia, speaking of the ancient writers on Music, whose works he had consulted among the manuscripts in the Jesuit's College Library at Rome, names Aristotle ; but I sought in vain for the Treatise which he had written expressly on Music, nor could I find there any work by that philosopher relative to the subject, except his Acoustics.\n7um8 | Almost all the ancient philosophers, especially the Pythagoreans, Platonists, and Peripatetics, wrote treatises on Music, which are now lost. Meursius, in his notes on Aristoxenus, enumerates, among others, the following ancient writers on music, of whom we have nothing left but the name: Agenor, of Mytilene, mentioned by Aristoxenus, from whom sprung a sect of musicians called Agenorians ; as from Eratocles, the Eratocleans ; from Epigonus, the Epigonians, and from Damon, who taught Socrates music, the Damonians.\nuow2 | But of all the ancient musical writers, the name of no one is come down to us, of whose works I was in greater want than those of the younger Dionysius Halicarnassensis, who flourished, according to Suidas, under the emperor Adrian, and who wrote twenty-six books of the History of Musicians, in which he celebrated not only the great performers on the Flute and Cithara, but those who had risen to eminence by every species of poetry. He was, likewise, author of five books, written in defence of Music, and chiefly in refutation of what is alleged against it in Plato's Republic. Aristides Quintilianus has, also, endeavoured to soften the severity of some animadversions against Music in the writings of Cicero ; but though time has spared the defence of this author, yet it does not indemnify us for the loss of that which Dionysius junior left behind him ; as testimonies are still remaining of his having been a much more able writer than Aristides Quintilianus.\niat7 | But though all the musical histories of the ancients are lost, yet almost every country in Europe that has cultivated the polite arts, has, since the revival of learning, produced a history of Music, except our own. Italy can boast of two works under that title ;\nywwr | \n0i6j | PREFACE",
