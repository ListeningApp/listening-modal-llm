You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

8sye | Among the most common metabolic abnormalities in cancer, de novo nucleotide biosynthesis is often upregulated in order to support the metabolic demands associated with increased DNA and RNA synthesis. Strikingly, activation of the @2A-adrenergic receptor (ADRA2A), and more broadly, Gai-mediated signalling has been found to regulate purinosome formation and downstream purine biosynthesis, representing an exciting mechanism by which GPCR-mediated signalling may promote aberrant cell proliferation327 (Figure 1). A by-product of injury, hypoxia, and cell death, the release of the nucleoside adenosine into the tumor microenvironment by the breakdown of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is also a potent signalling regulator that plays a role in multiple physiological and pathological processes. There are four subtypes of adenosine- binding GPCRs with distinct expression patterns and G protein-binding specificities. A2AR (ADORA2A) and A2BR (ADORA2B) in particular, are well-known to mediate an anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effect thus diminishing the antitumor immune response, and highlighting the complex interplay between GPCR-mediated signalling between cancer hallmarks (see above)328.
r04h | Conclusions and Perspectives
orpr | GPCRs and their coupled heterotrimeric G proteins are central to a diverse array of cellular processes, including the activation of numerous signalling and transcriptional networks. Since the original discovery that G protein-mediated signalling has the potential to induce cell transformation, dysfunctional G protein-mediated signalling has been increasingly tied to cancer initiation and progression. Both mutation and aberrant expression are molecular mechanisms that contribute to subverting the normal function of GPCRs and heterotrimeric G proteins to conferring pro-oncogenic capabilities on them. However, given that GPCR signalling is centrally embedded in normal physiology, cancer cells can also modulate the function of GPCRs to promote an immune suppressive and a pro-oncogenic state through dysregulated paracrine and autocrine (oncocrine) or even compensatory signalling mechanisms.
k36m | While hyperactive GPCR and heterotrimeric G protein-driven signalling has often been found to be pro-oncogenic, a growing body of literature is supporting a paradigm of the cell context specific nature of such signalling pathways. Loss-of-function mutations or copy number loss of genes GPCRs and heterotrimeric G proteins have unveiled the tumor suppressive roles that these protein families play in certain cancer types, highlighting the complexity of G protein-driven signalling and the significant impact of cellular states in the integration and output of these signalling events. Further insight into the relationship between cell type lineage and the functional duality of GPCR signalling outcomes will likely reveal unanticipated mechanisms driving cancer, and potentially novel vulnerabilities that can be targeted therapeutically. Moreover, while GPCRs and their coupled heterotrimeric G proteins have been primarily studied from a signalling perspective, their central role in diverse cellular functions strongly suggests their involvement in broader processes such as the regulation of epigenetic networks. Future work defining these nodes of connectivity will likely expand our understanding of GPCRs in cancer even further.

sy14 | Within the complex network of cancer signalling, numerous opportunities arise for GPCRs to be used for therapeutic intervention. Interfering with GPCR activity using both pharmacological inhibitors and biologics, encompassing antagonists, inverse agonists, allosteric modulators, in addition to antibody-based therapies, can inform novel therapeutic strategies. Specifically, positive and negative allosteric modulators (PAMs and NAMs, respectively), will likely emerge as pharmacological avenues for cancer prevention and treatment, as they may dial up or down the signalling capacity of GPCRs that are aberrantly modulated in cancer rather than directly stimulating or inhibiting them, or competing for their natural ligands. Guided towards the development of precision therapeutic approaches, more comprehensive characterization of dysregulated GPCR expression and signalling coupled with the diverse modes of action of these
ghss | inhibitors will likely reveal context-specific dependencies that can provide opportunities to rationally target GPCRs for cancer therapies.
3s61 | Recent studies investigating the range and depth of biased GPCR signalling, and the potential impact of GPCR mutations in G protein-coupling selectivity, will likely also enable the development of novel approaches exploiting the tremendous potential of GPCRs as signal transducers to modulate signalling in cancer and other diseases. Moreover, advances and emerging techniques in the field of gene editing may also add to the repertoire of mechanisms by which we can modulate GPCR activity.
s3rm | Given the large proportion of FDA-approved drugs that target GPCRs, there is mounting evidence supporting the utility of repurposing existing drugs to block or modulate GPCR-mediated oncogenic signalling circuitries, either alone or as adjuvant therapies. Regarding the latter, drug resistance has remained a major challenge in the era of precision medicine. GPCR modulators administered along with conventional anticancer agents may allow abrogating the initiation of compensatory signalling mechanisms and resultant drug resistance. Similarly, the dynamic influx of immune cells to the tumor, which leads to a highly infiltrative "hot" tumour or a poorly infiltrative "cold" tumour, is in part dependent on the chemokine gene signature of the tumour itself, which may provide a powerful prognostic tool to predict therapeutic response rates in the clinic. Harnessing the immunomodulatory power of GPCRs or their ability to regulate tumour-immune interactions could revolutionize current immunotherapies and result in durable clinical responses while preventing tumour relapse. Investigation exploring combining GPCR-targeted therapies with existing chemo- and immunotherapies either for the treatment of cancer, or as cancer preventative strategies are currently ongoing. Ultimately, just as we gain a clearer understanding of the complex mechanisms underlying cancer initiation and progression, so too will the role of GPCRs as cancer drivers and therapeutic targets become more important.
