You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

yad0 | 1) TESTICULAR ANATOMY (Figure 1)
3g38 | a) The Organization of the Testis: The testes are paired ovoid organs located in the scrotum of the male. The average testicular volume is 20cc in healthy young men and decreases in
vtbo | 4.4
q8pa | elderly men. Normal longitudinal length of the testis is approximately 4.5-5.1 cm. This extra- abdominal location maintains the testis at a temperature about 2°C-3℃ lower than normal body temperature and this is required for normal spermatogenesis. The testis is surrounded by the tunica albuginea, a thick protective covering of the testis. It is suspended by the spermatic cord, which also contains the vas deferens, spermatic artery, and venous and lymphatic plexus. This tunica is thickened to form the mediastinum where the rete testis is found. The testis itself is composed of a series of lobules (in humans approximately 300 lobules) divided by fibrous septa from the mediastinum. The testis contains seminiferous tubules and interstitial cells. The tubules are segregated into regions by connective tissue septa and occupy approximately 80% of the testicular volume. The tubules are long, V-shaped tubules, the ends of which terminate in the rete testis (see Figure 1).
uc9x | i) Function of the Tunica: This capsule contains blood vessels, smooth muscle fibers and nerve fibers sensitive to pressure. The functional role of the testicular capsule is unknown but may relate to movement of fluid out through the rete testis or control of blood flow to the testis. In humans, it creates a partition between groups of seminiferous tubules, which are present within these lobules. The tough, fibrous tunica may also serve a protective function because of the position of the testes external to the pelvis. There are three layers that comprise the tunica-the tunica vasculosa, tunica albuginea, and tunica vaginalis.
zy7o | ii) The lobules are composed of one to four seminiferous tubules, which are long looping structures that open at both ends into the rete testis. Within these lobules are the seminiferous tubules and the interstitial tissue that includes the blood and lymphatic vessels, nerves, Leydig cells, and macrophages.
kcar | iii) Seminiferous Tubules are long tubes lined with stratified epithelium about 150-250 um in diameter and 30-70 cm long. The combined length of the seminiferous tubules in a testis is approximately 250 m! The tubuli recti or straight tubules connect these seminiferous tubules to the rete testis, a complex series of channels that connect to the epididymis by the ductuli efferentes.
00aw | iv) Mediastinum supports the blood vessels, lymphatic system, and the ducts within the testis that transport the sperm and connect to the rete testis.
351p | v) Rete Testis/Efferent Ducts (Ductuli efferentes): The rete testis receives drainage from the central, superior, and posterior regions of the testicular seminiferous tubules. The rete coalesces in the superior portion of the testis to form efferent ducts, which leave the testis, entering the head or caput of the epididymis. The sperm move through the tubuli recti (straight tubules lined by simple cuboidal epithelium) to the rete testis (anastomosing channels in the mediastinum of the testis) to the efferent ducts (lined by columnar epithelium) that connect the testis to the initial segment of the epididymal duct. In the human, there are about 10-20 efferent ducts that have cilia that beat in the direction of the epididymis. This region plays an important role in the absorption of fluids secreted by the seminiferous epithelium. This region is surrounded by large lymphatic channels and blood vessels associated with large clusters of Leydig cells. The efferent ducts coalesce into a variable pattern within the caput to form a single epididymal tubule.
zzcb | 4.5
mxnx | vi) The artery to the testis is specialized in that it is highly coiled and intimately associated with a network of anastomotic veins that form the pampiniform plexus (Figure 1). This vascular arrangement facilitates the exchange of heat and small molecules, including testosterone. The counter-current exchange of heat in the spermatic cord provides blood to the testis that is 2ºC-4º C lower than rectal temperature in the normal individual.
