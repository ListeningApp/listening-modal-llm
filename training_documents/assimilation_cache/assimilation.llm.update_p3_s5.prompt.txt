You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

gipz | This function reaches its minimum at <LATEX>x _ { 2 } ^ { * } = \left( y _ { 2 } + \alpha y _ { 3 } \right) / \left( 1 + \alpha ^ { 2 } \right) ,</LATEX> so <LATEX>x _ { 2 } ^ { * }</LATEX> is the reanalysis value of <LATEX>x _ { 2 } .</LATEX> The corresponding filtering value of <LATEX>x _ { 3 }</LATEX> is <LATEX>x _ { 3 } ^ { * } = \alpha x _ { 2 } ^ { * } ,</LATEX> the forecast value of <LATEX>x _ { 4 }</LATEX> is <LATEX>x _ { 4 } ^ { * } = \alpha x _ { 3 } ^ { * } = \alpha ^ { 2 } x _ { 2 } ^ { * } ,</LATEX> and the reanalysis value of <LATEX>x _ { 1 } ,</LATEX> is <LATEX>x _ { 1 } ^ { * } = \alpha ^ { - 1 } x _ { 2 } ^ { * } .</LATEX> We obtain the same values if we use the process model relation <LATEX>x _ { 3 } = \alpha x _ { 2 }</LATEX> to eliminate <LATEX>x _ { 2 }</LATEX> from the cost function (20.3) and minimize with respect to
b4wj | <LATEX>x _ { 3 } .</LATEX> These solutions do not give any uncertainty estimates (confidence sets) for the re- analysis and filtering values. In this case, such estimates can be inferred from the data model (20.2) and the explicit form of the solution. However, in the general case, the re- analysis and filtering values are obtained numerically and uncertainty estimates are not immediately available. If the process error terms <LATEX>5 ;</LATEX> do not vanish, the cost function must be extended with additional terms. We refer the reader to [89] for a more detailed discus- sion of the variational approach and its relation to the probabilistic approaches discussed in the next sections.
5xlt | 20.2.2 . Maximum Likelihood Approach
9bz4 | Next we demonstrate a maximum likelihood approach to the same example. Assume that the process error variables <LATEX>\xi _ { j }</LATEX> are random and have standard normal distributions. Assume for the moment that <LATEX>X _ { 1 }</LATEX> has a fixed but unknown value <LATEX>x _ { 1 } ,</LATEX> which we wish to estimate from the observations <LATEX>Y _ { 2 }</LATEX> and <LATEX>Y _ { 3 } .</LATEX> This is therefore a reanalysis problem. Probability theory shows that
yfv2 | <LATEX>Y _ { 2 } \sim N \left( \alpha x _ { 1 } , 1 + \tau ^ { 2 } \right) , \quad Y _ { 3 } \sim N \left( \alpha ^ { 2 } x _ { 1 } , 1 + \tau ^ { 2 } + \alpha ^ { 2 } \right) , \quad \text { cov } \left( Y _ { 2 } , Y _ { 3 } \right) = \alpha .</LATEX> The joint distribution of <LATEX>\left( Y _ { 2 } , Y _ { 3 } \right)</LATEX> is Gaussian with density
pujl | <LATEX>f _ { Y _ { 2 } , Y _ { 3 } } \left( y _ { 2 } , y _ { 3 } \right) \propto \exp \left( - \frac { 1 } { 2 } \left( y _ { 2 } - \alpha x _ { 1 } , y _ { 3 } - \alpha ^ { 2 } x _ { 1 } \right) \Sigma ^ { - 1 } \left( y _ { 2 } - \alpha x _ { 1 } , y _ { 3 } - \alpha ^ { 2 } x _ { 1 } \right) ^ { T } \right) ,</LATEX> (20.5)
3rqe | where <LATEX>\Sigma</LATEX> is the covariance matrix,
nsi3 | <LATEX>\Sigma = \left( \begin{array}{} { 1 + \tau ^ { 2 } } & { \alpha } \\ { \alpha } & { 1 + \tau ^ { 2 } + \alpha ^ { 2 } } \end{array} \right) .</LATEX> The proportionality constant implied in Eq. (20.5) does not depend on the unknown pa- rameter <LATEX>x _ { 1 } . \text { If } y _ { 2 }</LATEX> and <LATEX>\mathcal{Y} _ { 3 }</LATEX> are actual observational data, the maximization of the expression on the right-hand side of Eq. (20.5) leads to the maximum likelihood estimate
nil3 | <LATEX>\widehat { x } _ { 1 } = \frac { \alpha \left( 1 + \tau ^ { 2 } \right) y _ { 2 } + \alpha ^ { 2 } \tau ^ { 2 } y _ { 3 } } { \alpha ^ { 2 } + \alpha ^ { 2 } \tau ^ { 2 } + \tau ^ { 4 } }</LATEX> (20.6)
68a1 | The reanalysis estimate <LATEX>\widehat { x } _ { 1 }</LATEX> is a linear combination of the observations <LATEX>\mathcal{Y} _ { 2 }</LATEX> and <LATEX>\mathcal{Y} _ { 3 } .</LATEX> If <LATEX>0 <</LATEX> <LATEX>\alpha < 1 ,</LATEX> <LATEX>\mathcal{Y} _ { 2 }</LATEX> has the larger weight. If, furthermore, the observation errors <LATEX>\zeta _ { i }</LATEX> have very small standard deviations <LATEX>\left( \tau \ll 1 \right) ,</LATEX> the weight for <LATEX>\mathcal{Y} _ { 3 }</LATEX> is very small, so the reanalysis estimate depends mainly on the observation that was made right after the unknown state. One can show that <LATEX>\mathscr{E} \widehat { x } _ { 1 } = x _ { 1 } ,</LATEX> so the estimate is unbiased, and it is not hard to show that <LATEX>\widehat { x } _ { 1 }</LATEX> has a normal distribution and to find its variance.
seik | Approaches to estimating <LATEX>x _ { 2 } \left( \text { reanalysis } \right) \text { and } x _ { 3 }</LATEX> (filtering) from observations using the maximum likelihood method are discussed in the exercises. We next introduce a general Bayesian approach to data assimilation and then return to this example.
