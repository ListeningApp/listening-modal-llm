In this case we can see that\nkh8s | G sub k superscript i of script P of x sub k superscript i minus alpha sub k G sub k superscript i minus x sub k superscript i equals negative alpha sub k of G sub k superscript i squared less than negative alpha sub k epsilon sub k squared. We immediately see from the term wise nonpositivity of thirty-four that\nplxa | F of x sub k plus one minus F of x sub k is less than negative rho alpha sub k epsilon sub k squared. Case two seven b: Continuing from thirty-four we obtain\n6wac | F of x sub k plus one minus F of x sub k is less than or equal to rho of left angle G sub k superscript script A comma script P of x sub k superscript script A minus alpha sub k G sub k superscript script A right angle plus alpha sub k left angle G sub k superscript script I comma p sub k superscript script I right angle less than or equal to rho left angle G sub k superscript script A comma script P of x sub k superscript script A minus alpha G sub k superscript script A minus x sub k superscript script A right angle equals rho sum over i in script A of x sub k comma delta sub k G sub k superscript i of script P of x sub k superscript i minus alpha G sub k superscript i minus x sub k superscript i.

Thirty-five\n2s5u | Inexact Newton-type Methods for Optimisation with Nonnegativity Constraints\nk9cc | Note each sum in thirty-five is term-wise negative. Since diagonal x A G A is greater than six percent, we have\n6t52 | E sub k colon diagonal x g squared equals E dot A of X sub k comma delta sub k i i\n08mw | This implies two possible cases: either\n6iat | v i left angle g squared i in A of X sub k comma delta sub k i eight k g a squared equals two eighty-two point four\npony | g i squared.\nspym | In either case, the negativity of each term of thirty-five implies\nrms6 | f of X sub k plus one minus f of x sub k is less than negative P min\ndwg7 | Combining with Case one gives\n3o8c | f of X sub k plus one minus f of x sub k is less than negative P min, and zero percent equals negative P min two, U k, one twenty-eight percent squared, epsilon squared k\nvm29 | Thirty-six\nkwxl | If I of X sub k comma delta sub k equals empty set, we apply thirty-one to obtain\nkd8r | f of X sub k plus one minus f of X sub k is less than negative P min one two of one minus P squared L g min of one comma two,\nz2jh | On the other hand, if I of X sub k comma zero k not equal to empty set, the lower bound for ok in thirty depends inversely on the inactive portion of the step double vertical bars P E double vertical bars. The step size can therefore become small if double vertical bars P g double vertical bars is too large. To avoid this, we will make use of the fact that the gradient is bounded. In particular, by combining the right inequality of twenty and twenty-two, we obtain\nnvte | min of one comma zero vertical bar P F I vertical bar less than or equal to G k I less than or equal to E x squared,\n994g | which implies\np39w | epsilon ok min of one comma zero raised to the power of three over two\ng6k3 | k two of one minus P L g\nxmvn | Imposing this on the step size lower bound thirty gives\nv2zu | Q k greater than or equal to min of one comma zero min\nz2nh | The decrease is therefore given by\nyhx0 | f of X sub k plus one minus f of X sub k is less than negative P min\nmi09 | two one, alpha k min one, two eighty-two epsilon\n15ri | less than or equal to negative P min\ndfj2 | less than or equal to negative P min, min of one comma zero min two of one minus P L g one raised to the power of three over two Q k k min.
