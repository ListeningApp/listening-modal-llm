You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

pujl | 482 the soluble fraction (Fig 4I). This analysis identified only four proteins which show significant
3rqe | 483 increases in the insoluble fraction relative to the soluble fraction (Ckmt1, Tau, Taf15, and
nsi3 | 484 Hspb1) and one protein which significantly increases in the soluble fraction and showed no
nil3 | 485 change in the insoluble fraction (Plk2) (Fig 4I). Of note, Taf15 has previously been observed in 486 detergent-insoluble fractions of brains from Alzheimer's patients, correlated with both Amyloid
68a1 | 487 ÃŸ and Tau insolubility(98-101). Ckmt1 has also been found in Neurofibrillary tangles and interacting with phosphorylated Tau inclusions(102-104).
seik | 488
oq7c | 489 490 Neuroproteasomes are differentially regulated by ApoE isoforms to determine formation of 491 endogenous sarkosyl-insoluble Tau inclusions
z4mi | 492
hkft | 493 Our findings raise the intriguing possibility that a fraction of endogenous mouse Tau becomes
jai3 | 494 sarkosyl-insoluble following neuroproteasome inhibition. We sought to validate these findings
p57i | 495 by immunoblot and extend them to determine if the same principle would hold for human Tau 496 isoforms, without pathogenic and aggregation-driving mutations. We therefore cultured primary
u5ug | 497 mouse cortical neurons from either WT or hTau-KI mice (105). The entire mouse Mapt sequence
i9k5 | 498 is replaced with the human Mapt sequence (including upstream gene regulatory elements) at the
20z2 | 499 endogenous locus in hTau-KI mice. hTau-KI mice express all six human isoforms of Tau protein
4cgs | 500 using the endogenous Mapt regulatory elements and therefore, hTau is expressed at normal 501 physiological levels(105). DIV12-14 neurons were treated with either the neuroproteasome
htre | 502 inhibitor iBEp or the cell-permeable proteasome inhibitor Epoxomicin. We then performed
da3c | 503 sarkosyl fractionations to separate treated neurons into soluble and insoluble fractions and
890q | 504 immunoblotted these fractions for total Tau and GAPDH. The R2295 antibody reacts against 505 both total human and total mouse Tau and is highly specific, making it the ideal tool to monitor
jomo | 506 endogenous Tau in WT and hTau-KI samples(106). We observed no Tau signal in primary
06fi | 507 neurons cultured from Tau knockout (Tau-KO) mice, demonstrating the specificity of our
hb4s | 508 antibodies and approach (Fig S5A)(106). We found a significant increase in sarkosyl-insoluble
cqq2 | 509 Tau from both the WT (Fig 5A) and hTau-KI neurons treated with iBEp (Fig 5B, S5B).
1ews | 510 Intriguingly, we find no change in sarkosyl-insoluble Tau in neurons treated with the cell-
afyn | 511 permeable Epoxomicin compared to DMSO controls, despite the fact that Epoxomicin inhibits
8sye | 512 cytosolic proteasomes and neuroproteasomes (Fig 5A,B). We reason that Epoxomicin inhibits
r04h | 513 neuroproteasomes and likely induces the formation of Tau inclusions (similar to iBEp), but these
orpr | 514 Tau inclusions cannot be detected because simultaneous inhibition of cytosolic proteasomes
k36m | 516 induces autophagy and other compensatory mechanisms which can clear these inclusions. This
wnuz | 515
sy14 | 517 claim is supported by an extensive body of work on Tau clearance mechanisms(31-35, 93). We
ghss | 518 posit that such compensatory mechanisms are not triggered when neuroproteasomes are
3s61 | 519 specifically inhibited, which is consistent with our observations that Epoxomicin induces p62 expression whereas iBEp does not (Fig 4D, G).
s3rm | 520
pqxb | 521 Many of our experiments rely on the use of iBEp because the biotin tracer on an irreversible and
08qc | 522 specific inhibitor allows us to track which proteasomes are inhibited. However, we wanted to
hdj2 | 523 validate our findings using a proteasome inhibitor with a distinct mechanism of action from
a57g | 524 Epoxomicin. We therefore modified MG132, a reversible peptide aldehyde proteasome inhibitor, with a sulfonated biotin linker on the nonreactive N-terminus(84). This negatively charged 526 water-soluble linker renders Sulfo-MG132 (SulfoMG) cell-impermeable, much like the historical
g8m3 | 525
a9av | 527 use of sulfonated linkers to perform surface biotinylation (Fig 5C). We observe efficient 528 conjugation by HPLC analysis (Fig S5C, D). All molecules were HPLC-purified as single peaks 529 530 and confirmed by LC/MS analysis (Fig S5E, F). We find significant inhibition of proteasomes using SulfoMG despite the moderate loss of efficacy compared to MG132 as a consequence of
73l3 | 531 the linker (Fig S5G). MG132 is a reversible inhibitor and therefore, we cannot detect the
ornm | 532 covalent modification of the proteasome subunits. Instead, we turned to cellular and functional
u2z1 | 533 readouts of permeability. We found a similar induction of autophagy markers in neurons treated 534 with MG132 as with epoxomicin and a similar lack of induction with SulfoMG as with iBEp 535 (Fig 5C). Confident in its use as a chemically orthogonal cell-impermeable proteasome inhibitor, 536 we next incubated DIV13 primary hTau-KI neurons with SulfoMG. We find that SulfoMG 537 induces similar partitioning of hTau into the sarkosyl-insoluble fraction as iBEp (Fig 5D).
atmh | 538
7hgg | 539 Moreover, we find that MG132, like Epoxomicin, does not affect the sarkosyl-insoluble accumulation of Tau (Fig 5D).
xwsv | 540
756b | 541 Next, we examined whether neuroproteasome inhibition would induce sarkosyl-insoluble
6bx7 | 542 endogenous Tau inclusions in vivo. Here, we only used iBEp and not SulfoMG for three reasons: 543 first, because SulfoMG is reversible and is therefore subject to being washed out by CSF flow in
spl6 | 544 vivo; second, because we could biochemically monitor iBEp permeability using the presence of
7wzm | 545 the biotin signal; and third, because Epoxomicin is a more specific proteasome inhibitor than
e9xj | 546 MG132. We tested iBEp permeability in vivo by stereotactically injecting iBEp into the CA1 547 region of the mouse hippocampus for 72 hours. Hippocampi were microdissected and separated 548 549 into cytosolic and membrane-enriched fractions and samples were immunoblotted (Fig 5E). We fail to observe penetration into the cytosol until we inject 64uM, so we chose to inject at 10-fold
9vl6 | 550 under this dose as our maximal concentration (Fig 5E). This in vivo dose is consistent with and
c2fd | 551 far lower than previous studies using Epoxomicin alone (9.0 and 13.5mM (107, 108)). We
jzvp | 552 performed stereotactic injections of 6.4 uM iBEp and contralateral injections of the vehicle
f71y | 553 (0.07% DMSO) into the hippocampus of hTau-KI and Tau-KO mice. After 72 hours, we
31e1 | 554 collected the hippocampi and performed sarkosyl extractions into soluble and insoluble fractions.
40ry | 555 We fail to observe any detectable Tau in the Tau-KO mice in DMSO- or iBEp-injected
d1j2 | 556 hippocampi (Fig S5H). Mirroring our data in primary neurons, we find a strong increase of
wstc | 557 sarkosyl-insoluble Tau in hippocampi from hTau-KI mice injected with iBEp (Fig 5F).
ba1e | 558
en95 | 559 In our experiments, we find that inhibiting neuroproteasomes to saturation induces the
l3do | 560 accumulation of sarkosyl-insoluble Tau. Taken together with our data demonstrating that ApoE
u9bo | 561 isoforms regulate neuroproteasome localization (ApoE4<E3<E2), we predicted that neurons
7avo | 562 from ApoE4-KI mice would be more susceptible accumulating sarkosyl-insoluble Tau relative to
uzo6 | 563 neurons from ApoE3-KI or ApoE2-KI mice. To test this prediction, we crossed each of the
89b4 | 564 ApoE-KI lines to the hTau-KI lines, generating mice which endogenously express ApoE2, E3, or
5f7e | 565 E4 as well as hTau. DIV14 primary neurons from each line (hTau/ApoE2 double KI,
h83u | 566 hTau/ApoE3 double KI, and hTau/ApoE4 double KI) were then treated with a range of iBEp
kjoa | 567 doses spanning four log units. Neurons were then separated into sarkosyl-soluble and insoluble
wb1c | 568 fractions and immunoblotted. We found no sarkosyl-insoluble Tau aggregates at baseline in any line, which suggests that the ApoE4-induced reduction of neuroproteasomes levels alone is not 570 sufficient to drive Tau aggregation (Fig 5G, S5I). However, after treatment with even the lowest 571 dose of iBEp, we found accumulation of sarkosyl-insoluble Tau in hTau/E4-dKI neurons,
ak13 | 569
s7el | 572 rendering E4 neurons over 25-fold more susceptible to Tau aggregation than E3 neurons (Fig
0lfu | 573 5G). Conversely, neurons from hTau/E2-dKI mice were over 10-fold less susceptible to
cnjl | 574 neuroproteasome-inhibition induced Tau aggregation than neurons from hTau/E3-dKI mice (Fig 5G). Overall, these data demonstrate that ApoE isoforms differentially shift the threshold for the neuroproteasome-dependent formation of endogenous sarkosyl-insoluble Tau inclusions.

umx0 | 580
o306 | 58 We noticed that neuroproteasome inhibition induces the shift of sarkosyl-insoluble Tau into a 582 species which migrates at a higher molecular weight on an SDS-PAGE gel, at approximately 64kDa (Fig 5A, B, D, F, G, S5B, S6A). Similar shifts in molecular weight of Tau are observed 583
qm1b | 584 in the AD brain and is a hallmark phenotype of multiple neurodegenerative disorders (109, 110).
n9ms | 585 This molecular weight shift can in part be due to Tau phosphorylation at many residues.
icdp | 586 Therefore, we wanted to address whether iBEp-induced Tau aggregates are phosphorylated.
wtse | 587 Rather than profiling by a panel of phospho-specific antibodies against Tau, we took a more
bm7g | 588 unbiased approach and measured Tau phosphorylation by quantitative phosphoproteomics. We
jr68 | 589 treated primary WT neurons with iBEp for either 1, 6, or 24 hours and then performed sarkosyl
axix | 590 fractionations. Soluble and insoluble fractions were processed for TMT labelling in preparation
05y4 | 591 for quantitative mass spectrometry and then peptides were run over an Fe-NTA column to enrich
2fb0 | 592 for phospho-peptides (Fig 6A). We then used this enriched population for quantitative phospho-
s9fn | 593 proteomics analysis at the single peptide level (Table S4). Here, we find a time-dependent
k5r6 | 594 increase in Tau phosphorylation at only 4 of 26 identified sites which correspond to human S202,
z9v9 | 596 T205, T217, and S404 (Fig 6A). This is a specific signature of phosphorylation which
gpu9 | 595
u5ws | 597 corresponds to sites at which Tau is phosphorylated in the AD brain and detected by established antibodies (S202 - CP13(111), T205 - AT8(112), and S404 - PHF1(113)) as well as CSF 598 biomarkers for AD progression (T217)(114).

8t55 | 600 To validate these data, we treated hTau-KI neurons with iBEp and then fixed and stained these
7imw | 601 neurons. We observed no staining in neurons cultured from Tau-KO mice using the R2295
lf1t | 602 antibody to detect total Tau or the CP13 antibody to detect phosphorylated S202 (Fig S6B).
tze7 | 603 Incubating neurons with secondary antibodies alone showed no signal (Fig S6C). We therefore
ryvv | 604 exclusively used CP13 for our ICC experiments to detect phosphorylated Tau. We find a
zdrh | 605 significant elevation of CP13 signal in iBEp-treated primary hippocampal hTau-KI neurons 606 compared to controls (Fig 6B). This iBEP-induced signal appears punctate and distributed in
osmo | 607 both axons and MAP2+ dendrites (Fig 6B). To validate these data, we conducted
0b8v | 608 immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis of sections from hTau-KI mice stereotactically injected with iBEp and contralaterally injected with vehicle control (0.07% DMSO). After stereotactic 610 injections, animals were allowed to recover for 72 hours and then were perfused and sectioned
fucs | 609
yply | 611 612 for IHC. We observed no staining in the Tau-KO mice using the AT8 antibody or with secondary antibodies alone (Fig S6D, S6E). We observe a threefold induction of phosphorylated Tau signal
75n5 | 613
ec91 | 614 in hippocampi injected with iBEp compared to the contralateral PBS controls. We see a strong increase in AT8+ inclusions mislocalized to somatodendritic compartments in iBEp-injected
wul6 | 615 hippocampi, which extend into the stratum radiatum and stratum moleculare (Fig 6C).
4rhy | 616 617 While sarkosyl-insoluble Tau reflects aggregated Tau species(99, 106, 115-117), there are
092d | 618 varying definitions of a protein aggregate: misfolded proteins which cluster together, proteins
94ul | 619 which form stable inclusions, inclusions which are resistant to varying detergents, and then in
0vdu | 620 some cases, proteins which form very stable aggregates and even amyloids(118, 119). Thioflavin
a230 | 621 S (ThioS) is a dye that stains the ÃŸ-sheet structures of amyloid aggregates, including both
dvoe | 622 aggregated Tau tangles and amyloid plaques. Therefore, ThioS is used for the neuropathological
677t | 623 diagnosis of a wide variety of neurodegenerative disorders(8, 54, 120). We conducted ThioS
5hk6 | 624 staining of sections from hTau-KI mice stereotactically injected with iBEp and contralaterally
viei | 625 injected with vehicle control. After stereotactic injections, animals were allowed to recover for
rk0j | 626 72 hours and then brains were perfused, sectioned, and stained for ThioS. We find a strong 627 increase in ThioS staining from the CA1 region of hippocampi exposed to iBEp relative to
c6x9 | 628 vehicle controls (Fig 6D). ThioS+ inclusions appear as flame-like inclusions in both the CA1
g5at | 629 pyramidal layer and the granule cell layer of the Dentate Gyrus (Fig 6D, E, S6F-J).
re3j | 630 Neuroproteasome inhibition-induced flame-like ThioS+ aggregates co-localize with both
6z45 | 631 phosphorylated Tau (AT8) and total Tau (DA9) (Fig 6F, G, S6K) in single Z-plane images from
20af | 632 neurons in the CA1 and DG of hippocampus. We conclude that some neuroproteasome-induced
huae | 633 aggregates we observe are indeed composed of Tau. In addition to these large ThioS+ inclusions, 634 we also observe some thread-like ThioS+ inclusions in the hippocampal neuropil as well as
rblh | 635 widely distributed thin ThioS+ inclusions that appear dispersely throughout the iBEp-injected
gl5i | 637 hippocampus (Fig 6G, S6L, M). The ThioS+ inclusions formed following neuroproteasome
