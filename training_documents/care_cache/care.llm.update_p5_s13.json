Kilbourne, Eisman, and colleagues describe economic analyses as applied to implementation studies, highlighting both the similarities and the differences between implementation science and clinical research approaches to this critical area.\n0i1k | Dr. Mckay and colleagues address considerations in moving implementation research from the developed world into more comprehensive global contexts.\ndqlg | Finally, Dr. Chambers and colleagues summarize the important issue of capacity-building and training opportunities in implementation science.\np6pq | Funding\nzse6 | This work was supported by Department of Veterans Affairs grants QUE fifteen-two eighty-nine and CIN thirteen-four zero three.\np2n3 | Supplementary materials\nohh7 | Supplementary material associated with this article can be found, in the online version, at doi: ten point one zero one six/j.psychres.twenty nineteen point zero four point zero two five.",
