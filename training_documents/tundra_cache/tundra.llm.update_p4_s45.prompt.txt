You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.

q1q2 | Field reference data were collected from across all footprints in summer 2014 and summer 2015 (figure 1). The majority of plot locations (n = 592) were established in advance using a stratified random scheme to ensure inclusion of wide ranges of slope, aspect, elevation, and glacial history across all footprints. An additional 47 plots were collected in the course of visiting the stratified random plots, to capture a wider range of shrub characteristics, and 92 more plots were collected in 2015 to represent additional shrub types and vegetation across topographic transects. For each of these 731 total field plots, we took nadir photographs from approximately 1 m height using a standard point-and-shoot consumer digital camera, capturing roughly 1 x 1.3 m of ground area. We also recorded brief notes at each plot describing plant species and surface features present in the plot and the general area, including vegetation height measured using a meter stick; thaw depth measured using a steel thaw probe; and moss + organic soil depth, measured using a meter stick after slicing a slit in the moss/ organic mat with a serrated knife. The center coordinates of each plot photo were precisely measured using a TopCon GR-3 survey grade GNSS system operating in real-time kinematic (RTK) mode (nominal accuracy 4 cm).
cb7r | 2.3. Reference plot classification
68xu | This area has benefited from previous vegetation classification efforts, in particular by the Alaska Geobotany Center at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks, which has produced a hierarchical series of maps for the area depicting multiple landscape features. These include vegetation maps (http://arcticatlas.org) that provided a
hd35 | valuable benchmark for this project. Vegetation classes for the Alaska Geobotany Center maps were established using the Braun-Blanquet classification approach (Braun-Blanquet 1965, Walker et al 1994), in which species associations are grouped into a hierarchy of successively broader units. The classification system has the potential to precisely describe the finely heterogeneous vegetation community distribution of the Toolik Lake area, but the maps have limited or absent map accuracy information, and are polygon-based rather than raster, with varying minimum mapping units (i.e., resolution) that necessarily simplify the distribution and arrangement of vegetation patches on the landscape (small-extent maps have the smallest minimum mapping units, 2.5 m2). Since it was desirable that the final map classes in this project correspond as well as possible with legends used on previous maps, preliminary vegetation classes for this project were established by examining communities described in available maps and literature, especially Walker and Barry (1991), Walker et al (1994), Walker and Walker (1996), Raynolds et al (2005), and the related hierarchy of maps, particularly Walker and Maier (2007). To assign each plot photo (i.e., each plot location) to a plant community, photo order was randomized, and each photo was visually examined. Based on plant species and other features visible in the photo, as well as plot notes, each plot location was assigned to the class that best described the center of the photo, where GNSS coordinates had been measured. Because it wasn't yet clear how well we would be able to distinguish vegetation classes in the final model, initial class assignments were as granular as possible, to permit more flexible subsequent grouping. Finally, 69 additional reference plots locations were selected from the orthophotos, to provide more reference data for gravel pads, blockfields (rock), and open water-classes that were underrepresented in the field data but could be confidently identified in the orthophotos.
2zpk | 2.4. Input data layer processing
epu7 | A total of 33 predictor variable layers at 20 cm resolution were derived from the airborne lidar and RGBN imagery using a variety of tools (table 2). Most layers fall into three general categories: lidar-derived canopy metrics (e.g., sum and standard deviation of canopy heights), lidar-derived topographic metrics (e.g., topographic position index, SAGA wetness index), and first-order imagery metrics (e.g., NDVI, percent red, standard deviation of hue). Additionally, there is one compound layer, shrub biomass, which was derived previously using lidar canopy metrics and NDVI (Greaves et al 2016, 2018) and downscaled to 20 cm resolution for use here. We also included lidar return intensity (pulse amplitude), which acts as a surface metric (Chust et al 2008, Lang and McCarty 2009). The raw intensity of near-infrared (1550 nm) laser returns is affected by surface characteristics, especially wetness (water absorbs the laser pulse, leading to low return intensity in wet areas), surface roughness (relatively smooth, dry areas may reflect the pulse more strongly), and the presence of green vegetation (which strongly reflects infrared radiation) making it a potentially valuable predictor of surface features and vegetation distribution (Eitel et al 2016). Although our intensity data are not radiometrically calibrated or normalized (Yan and Shaker 2014), the intensity response showed few flight-line artifacts, and the nonparametric nature of the Random Forest modeling approach permits the inclusion of raw, uncorrected data. All predictor metrics were selected to be ecologically meaningful for Arctic vegetation distribution, as well as being likely to improve prediction of vegetation characteristics based on previous work (e.g., Ohmann and Gregory, 2002, Dirnböck et al 2003, Naito and Cairns, 2011, Kushida et al 2015, Greaves et al 2016).
7od1 | Owing to the prevalence of noise in data layers with such high resolution, most layers were smoothed using a circular mean Focal Statistics filter (Spatial Analyst in ArcGIS, ESRI, Redlands CA). This type of smoothing retains the original spatial resolution, but tends to improve classification predictions (e.g., Gottfried et al 2014) by decreasing the impact of meaningless local variation, instrument noise, and small shadows. We initially processed layers at several smoothing distances (0.5 m, 0.75 m, 1 m, 1.25 m), but we only retained layers that appeared important in preliminary models and had a Spearman correlation less than 0.95 at the reference plot locations. Once the layers were prepared, the values of all predictor layers at the location of each reference plot were extracted for model training and validation.
0bqy | 2.5. Random forest modeling
b780 | Random Forest (Breiman 2001) is a machine learning algorithm that uses ensembles ('forests') of classification or regression trees. In a Random Forest, each tree selects and permutes random subsets of predictor variables at each splitting node, which reduces overfitting and improves the strength of predictions. Additionally, Random Forest is non-parametric, models local interactions naturally, and is relatively robust against the collinearity common to ecological variables (but not perfectly; Dormann et al 2013), making it an effective tool for ecological research (e.g., Cutler et al 2007, Evans and Cushman 2009, Reese et al 2014, Belgiu and Drăgu 2016).
