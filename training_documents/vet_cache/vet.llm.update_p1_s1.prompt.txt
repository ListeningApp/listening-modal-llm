You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

b8hf | CHAPTER 1
hntf | The Medical History
99fo | OVERVIEW
y5r7 | The art of practicing medicine will always begin with two essential components: the history and physical examination. The history is certainly the most important diagnostic aid in medicine and the physical examination is easily second. The history is frequently key in determining cause of an illness, its significance, treatment options and even prognosis. Any clini- cian who fails to appreciate the value of a thorough history, who does not develop expertise in being able to obtain an owners' complete account of their concerns, or who takes "short cuts," will create an environment for misdiagnosis or errors in therapy. As is true for any individual with expertise, practice is critically important. Repetition can improve history-taking skills if coupled with frequent self-assessments. This is an excellent method to avoid repeating errors. One can ask after any difficult diagnosis is confirmed, what questions should have been asked that were not? What did the owner know but was never asked? Could I have changed the formu- lation of a question to gain better insight? The excellent clini- cian is an excellent historian and excellent listener. The excellent clinician continuously works to improve his or her skill set.
lrry | Obtaining a history is a "process" which should be approached in a methodical manner. This "process" should ensure that no valuable question is forgotten. Thus, the suc- cessful clinician has a group of questions consistently asked of every owner. Each question can be expanded or altered as dictated by answers given about the patient by the historian (usually the owner). In some cases, the order of questions may be changed. In other cases, answers provided may stimulate a subsequent set of questions. The clinician should always strive to be an approachable and compassionate listener. One will be well served by having the pet owner calm in order for her or him to provide clear and thoughtful responses. The medical history is a "story" about the patient. The following guidelines should assist with successful procurement of the patient's medical history.
hvhm | THE APPROACH TO THE PET OWNER
863b | 1. Meeting a client for the first time forms the foundation for any relationship. The adage is true: "You only have one
fj24 | chance to create a first impression." In this scenario, the "you" includes the primary clinician plus all hospital employees, because "the relationship" often begins before the veterinarian ever meets a client. As a client enters your facility and meets the receptionist or any other employee, opinions are formed and trust may or may not begin to be established. Successfully placing a client at ease is much easier when all hospital employees are respected members of the veterinary team with the same goal of providing the best care for a pet and the owner.1 Owner and pet "needs" must be perceived as having highest priority.
uz3c | 2. Having every client completely comfortable in your pres- ence is desirable but not easily achieved. Remember that with you being a complete stranger, a client may be inse- cure regarding your trustworthiness in caring for their pet. Many but not all owners prefer a warm, friendly, under- standing, patient, and compassionate veterinarian. If an animal arrives in a life-threatening situation, the clinician may speak quickly and even go so far as to remove the pet from the owner in order to provide treatment. Once the patient is stable, the clinician should return to an examina- tion room to obtain the detailed history and begin to build a client-doctor relationship.
d5bi | 3. Your greeting should inform the client who you are and in what capacity you function at the veterinary facility. Every clinician should be well groomed, speak clearly and use an understandable vocabulary.
ba4l | 4. Verify that the owner can understand what is being said or asked. Clearing any form of obstruction between you and the pet owner's ability to understand your questions is extremely important.
ffx8 | 5. Verify the patient's age, gender, neuter status, and breed (signalment), even if this information has previously been entered into the medical record. Incorrect data can be misleading and could cause disastrous outcomes in case management. Also, verify vaccination history, routine use of anti-parasite products, as well as all previously and cur- rently used medications.
s6su | 6. The clinician should determine the relationship between the person to whom one is speaking and the pet. The more familiar an individual is with an animal, the more valuable their information. Next, one can inquire how long the person has "known" this pet. Have they lived in the same home for 12 years or have they been together for 12 days?
y219 | 7. When seeing an ill pet, the clinician will benefit from knowing when the animal was last "normal." It also may be quite important to understand the owner's definition of "normal."
06ht | 8. Owners of ill pets may be fearful and anxious. Stress can impair an ability to recall essential historical information. Remember that your patience should be a virtue. It might require you to repeat questions several times. Alternatively, one may inquire about a subject using more than one perspective or more than one question.
v3r2 | REQUIREMENTS FOR A THOROUGH HISTORY
nv42 | Box 1-1 lists the criteria necessary for obtaining a complete history. This box has been modified from a document created for physicians by the American Board of Internal Medicine.2 It seems obvious for the clinician to always try to ask the key questions pertinent to a specific primary concern or "owner chief concern." However, typical issues caused by one disease will almost always overlap with observations associated with another. Although initial differential diagnoses based on sig- nalment or another factor might steer the examining clinician to a correct diagnosis, it behooves the clinician to avoid "tunnel vision" in situations where another disease process might actu- ally be responsible for the illness (Box 1-2). Owner concerns or initial clinician suspicions are, therefore, always subject to misinterpretation. One objective of the medical history is to obtain an actual "feel" for what is clinically wrong with the animal based on owner-perceived issues. Some clinical signs are difficult to fully understand until either the owner or clini- cian actually imitates what is being seen or heard. One example is trying to determine if an owner is observing cough- ing, retching, reversed sneezing, regurgitation, or vomiting. It may be quite valuable to have an owner make a video record of an actual worrisome "event."
xags | In addition to questions integral to every history, specific clinical abnormalities may have a set of questions designed to help clarify the nature of a medical disorder. The reader is
