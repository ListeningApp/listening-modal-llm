You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

nvfy | Each gill filament drops ventrally (the descending limb) from the central axis and then climbs dorsally (the ascending limb). The ascending lamellae attach either to the mantle skirt (lateral filaments) or the visceral mass (medial filaments).

zlxc | Fig. 11. Section of three gill filaments of Mytilus showing capture of suspended food particles by the laterofrontal cirri.
k0bw | Water (blue arrows) is propelled between the filaments by the beating lateral cilia.
aq5a | Food particles are shifted to the frontal cilia (red arrows) which transport them to the labial palps. After Silvester & Sleigh (1984).
sc5y | In the majority of bivalves, adjacent filaments are held together by junctions; this gill type is known as eulamellibranch. In more primitive bivalves (mussels and scallops), neighbouring gill filaments are attached to one another simply through interlocking clumps of cilia; this gill type is known as filibranch. Together, these filaments form a lamella. Therefore, each gill has four lamellae. The combined descending limbs of all the lateral filaments together form a descending lamella and the ascending filaments form an ascending lamella (Fig. 12). Captured food is passed into longitudinal ciliated food grooves formed along the dorsal and ventral edges of the lamella.

p6pq | Structure of the bivalve
zse6 | (lamellibranch) gill.
p2n3 | Each filament is folded into a V shape. There are two Vs (demibranchs), one medial and one lateral to the central axis. Together these form a W shaped holobranch.
ohh7 | 1.12 Food sorting
vbni | The food grooves of the gill lamellae are located on their dorsal and ventral edges. A maximum of five such grooves, two ventral and three dorsal, are associated with each holobranch (Fig. 13).
dgcw | In mussels and pen clams, food and sediment particles are transported both ventrally and dorsally (mostly ventrally) by frontal cilia to the five anteriorly directed food grooves which carry them to the labial palps. Very little sorting occurs in these species. In less advanced lamellibranchs, such as the Arcidae (e.g., Ark clams) Anomiidae (saddle oysters) Ostreidae (true oysters) and Pectinidae (e.g., scallop) the gills sort food from sediment. In these groups, tracts of frontal cilia transport food particles ventrally to the three anteriorly directed food grooves, while sediment particles are transported dorsally to the two ventral tracts which are directed posteriorly. Sediment and mucus are then ejected as pseudofaeces.
gvwz | 1.2 The role of the labial palps in feeding
sk5m | Particles are graded for size by the ciliated labial palps before being ingested (Fig. 14).

bfax | Fig. 14. Selection of food particles by the labial palps for transfer to the mouth.
f2y8 | Ridge cilia generate a current across the ridges, towards the mouth. Slope cilia beat downwards towards the groove. Groove cilia generate a current towards the edge of the palp.
o7qm | Sediment particles which are rejected are transported to the edge of the lamellae in the grooves between the ridges and fall as pseudofaeces into the mantle cavity. This material, which consists of particles and mucus, is moved posteriorly in a ventral ciliary tract on the inner surface of the mantle skirt to a position close to the inhalant syphon. Occasional rapid contractions of the adductor muscles compress the mantle cavity and force water and pseudofaeces out of the inhalant syphon. Excess food material is removed by the labial palps in order to prevent gill saturation. In dense suspensions, the palps channel most of the filtered material away from the mouth and towards incorporation into pseudofaeces so that the animal can continue to filter and ingest at an optimum rate (Bayne et al., 1976).
d52l | The mucus food string from the labial palps enters the mouth and is transported by cilia posteriorly through the oesophagus to the stomach.
qlbb | 2. Digestion
nhsg | The digestive strategy of bivalve molluscs is unique among higher animals because both extracellular and intracellular digestion are important. The mouth of bivalves has foliar lips which may be folded and meshed (e.g., in scallops). The short oesophagus leads into the stomach which is irregular and complex in form with highly folded ciliated walls (Fig. 15 and Fig. 16). The stomach extends posteriorly, surrounded by digestive caeca (which form the digestive gland), into the intestine, rectum and anus.

qecd | 2.1 The stomach
1o7p | Cilia and mucus are just as important in the gut as in the mantle cavity. The stomach is generally elaborate, with large ciliary sorting areas and a long rotating style (Fig. 17).
cp13 | The oesophagus enters the stomach anteriorly and the intestine exits posteriorly. Evaginations in the stomach wall form the gastric ceca (diverticula). These give rise to the digestive ceca (diverticula) ducts which are associated with ciliary sorting fields, consisting of ciliated ridges and grooves, similar to those in the labial palps.

kpvt | The sorting fields move large particles over the crests of the ridges; smaller mineral particles are collected in the grooves and moved to rejection tracts. The rejecting tracts move material to the intestine while food particles tend to be re-suspended in the fluid in the stomach.
jie2 | A ciliated intestinal groove extends from the stomach into the intestine. The left side of the groove is bordered by a ciliated ridge, the major typhlosole, which arches over the groove and partially isolates it from the stomach. Another ridge, the minor typhlosole, lies on the right side of the intestinal groove. The major typhlosole and intestinal groove originate in the left gastric cecum and extend into the intestine, together with the minor typhlosole. The typhlosole and intestinal groove provide a continuous stream of mineral particles out of the stomach and into the intestine.
d0ik | A style sac with a ciliated secretory epithelium extends posteriorly from the stomach. The epithelium secretes the crystalline style which consists of a protein matrix onto which are secreted a variety of digestive enzymes, including amylases, glycogenases, lipases and cellulases (Morton, 1983). There are no proteases in the stomach, since these would digest the proteinaceous enzymes of the style; protein digestion is intracellular in the digestive ceca.
0x0s | The cilia of the style sac cause the style to rotate, resulting in its abrasion and release of digestive enzymes which perform extracellular digestion (Fig. 18). Rotation of the style stirs the contents of the stomach and drags the mucus food string through the oesophagus. Acid released from the style and digestive ceca reduces the pH of the stomach fluid and this reduces the viscosity of the mucus, releasing bound food particles onto the sorting fields.
4exe | Fig. 18. Processes of extracellular and intracellular digestion in the bivalve mollusc stomach and digestive diverticulae. (A) The basic digestive cycle starts before food ingestion with dissolution of the crystalline style and presence of fragmentation spherules in the stomach. (B) Food arriving in the stomach is mechanically reduced by the rotating style and shield and extracellular digestion begins. (C) Particles are then passed to the digestive diverticulae for intracellular digestion. (D) Cessation of feeding is followed by progressive passage of food particles from the stomach to the digestive diverticulae. (E) During the quiescent interfeeding phase, the stomach empties and the crystalline style is re-formed, while intracellular

kg3t | digestion in the diverticulae is completed and fragmentation spherules begin to form. (A) The movement of fragmentation spherules to the stomach starts the next cycle. From Morton (1983).
lvae | Partially digested food passes into the digestive ceca via the gastric ceca. The digestive ceca ramify into secondary ducts that terminate in blind-ending pouches (acini). The acinar epithelium is responsible for enzyme secretion, nutrient absorption and pinocytosis and intracellular digestion.
o9sc | These tubules are of two cell types, digestive cells and basophil secretory cells. Digestive cells are the most abundant type. They are columnar and vacuolated and are responsible for intracellular digestion of food. The free surface of the digestive cell is extended into microvilli and the cytoplasm is characterised by the presence of numerous cytoplasmic vesicles types. Particulate matter is taken up at the base of the microvilli by pinocytosis and is initially stored within small vesicles called phagosomes. Phagosomes fuse with lysosomes in their maturation process. Digestion takes place within these lysosomes which contain hydrolytic enzymes. The end products of digestion are released directly into the haemolymph system and waste products are contained in residual bodies within the digestive cells. The cells eventually rupture and the waste material is swept along the ciliated secondary and primary ducts of the ceca towards the stomach, and ultimately to the intestine.
121u | The ducts of the ceca are divided longitudinally into inhalant and exhalant channels. Cilia provide an exhalant current which carries undigested material to the typhlosoles and intestinal groove; this current also draws undigested material into the inhalant channel. It is possible (Morton, 1983) that the currents alternate with time. Mathers (1973) has shown the existence of an interval between the time when the food arrives in the ducts and the return to the intestine of residues from the digestive process.
zh03 | 2.2 The intestine
1mvw | The function of the intestine is primarily to form faeces. The intestine often passes through the pericardial coelom and is surrounded by the heart ventricle. It then passes dorsally over the posterior adductor muscle and terminates at the anus where faeces are discharged into the exhalant chamber at the base of the exhalant siphon.
6d4s | 3. Digestive enzymes
mqah | Both stomach and digestive ceca contain a variety of digestive enzymes, particularly carbohydrases. In bivalves, digestive enzymes are produced by the style, by the cells of the digestive ceca (diverticula) and, in some genera examined, in the midgut (Purchon, 1971). Bivalve molluscs show an evolutionary trend towards extracellular digestion, which is believed to provide the most efficient utilisation of food (Reid, 1968).
xxr8 | Digestive enzymes include amylase, cellulase, alginase, lipase, phosphatase and several proteases (including chymotrypsin and cathepsins) (Mathers, 1973; Morton, 1983).
rl4j | Kristensen (1972) examined carbohydrases from the crystalline styles of a number of bivalves, including the blue mussel (Mytilus edulis) and found less activity than in the digestive gland. However, Wojtowicz (1972) recorded a 40-times greater activity of a-amylase in the style than in the digestive gland of the scallop Placopecten magellanicus, but other carbohydrases (a-glycosidase, ß-glucosidase, ß-galactosidase, laminarase and chitobiase) were confined to the digestive gland. Cellulase has been recorded in the style and digestive glands of several filter feeding bivalves, including M. edulis (Crosby & Reid, 1971). The high activity of cellulase in the stomach contents suggests that this enzyme is produced by gut bacteria.
vz32 | The localisation of enzymes in the digestive tract of the Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) is shown in Table IV.
ncb0 | The activities of the carbohydrases (amylase, cellulase and laminarinase are located throughout the digestive tract in the epithelia, such as the lysosomal enzyme, N-acetyl glucosaminidase, which is particularly strong around the gastric shield and in the cells of the tubules of the digestive gland. Non-specific esterases are present in the canal of the digestive gland and the apical part of the stomach and intestinal epithelium. Acid phosphatase, a lysosomal enzyme, is very active in the digestive gland while alkaline phosphatase, which indicates active transport, is localized in the canals of the digestive gland and the base of the tubules.

awab | Protease activity, in the tubules of the digestive gland and some parts of the intestine, is low at the start of digestion but builds up towards the end. These enzymes have an optimum pH of 5.5, as with lysosomal enzymes; this is associated with intracellular digestion. Given their location on the apical zones of microvilli, these enzymes appear to be membrane-bound (Boucaud-Camou et al., 1985).
ixcc | Data from Lebesnerais (1985). Lysosomal proteases (cathepsins) are also known as dipeptidyl peptidases (DPPs); they are classified according to letter or number (Agarwal, 1990). Most of the cathepsins become activated at the low pH found in lysosomes. Thus, the activity of this family lies almost entirely within these organelles.
8p6h | Similar distributions of enzymes within the digestive tract of other bivalve species have been identified: grooved carpet shell (Ruditapes decussatus) (Henry, 1987); blue mussel (Mytilus edulis) (Janssen, 1981) and king scallop (Pecten maximus) (Henry et al., 1993; Henry et al., 1991). The movement of food through the digestive tract of the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas and the sites of enzyme action and uptake of nutrients is shown in Fig. 19.
