You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

n1wo | Spawning is hypothesised to occur in dense aggregations several 100 km off- shore of southern and Baja California in January through March, at depths of 100-500 m (Alverson and Larkins, 1969), but spawning aggregations have seldom been directly observed (Alverson and Larkins, 1969; Bailey et al., 1982; Stauffer, 1985; Saunders and McFarlane, 1997). Occasional reports of suc- cessful spawning north of this region have been made over the years (Bailey, 1980; Hollowed, 1992; Dorn, 1996; Saunders and McFarlane, 1997; Benson et al., 2002) consistent with the expected shift associated with warming of the CCLME. Fertilised embryos and larvae remain beneath the mixed layer (Bai- ley, 1982), and as larvae grow, they move inshore to the continental shelf and slope (Bailey, 1981).
5bq3 | The survival of larval Pacific hake is strongly influenced by environmental conditions (such as upwelling, advection and water temperature) experienced during the first few months after spawning (Bailey, 1981; Bailey and Francis,
ezla | 1985; Bailey et al., 1986; Hollowed, 1992; Agostini, 2005). Cold ocean years typically produce weak year classes, while more variation in year class strength occurs among warm ocean years. Cold ocean years along the west coast also have stronger upwelling, equatorward transport after the spring transition and offshore advection (the opposite conditions prevail in warm years). Depressed Pacific hake recruitment in cooler years may be due to advection of embryos and larvae to un-favourable habitat or the presence of different dominant zooplankton prey and/or predator species (Bailey, 1981; Hollowed, 1992; Agostini, 2005). Warm years with weak upwelling and offshore advection early in the year might allow larvae to quickly reach favourable coastal habitat and take advantage of upwelling-driven biological production later in the year (Hollowed and Bailey, 1989).
rsbu | 9.3.3 Juveniles and adults
magd | 9.3.3.1 North-south distribution
tb74 | The north-south distribution of the migrating coastal stock ranges on average from about 25° to 55°N, with adults from southern and offshore spawning areas feeding off Oregon, Washington and British Columbia from April/May through September/October (Alverson and Larkins, 1969; Bailey et al., 1982; Francis, 1983; Dorn, 1995; Figure 9.3, left panel). Age structure, size
8l69 | distribution and environmental conditions are all important factors in deter- mining the spatial distribution and annual coast-wide migration of the Pacific hake stock and its availability to both monitoring surveys and commercial fishing operations. Usually, the oldest, largest fish travel the greatest distances north into Canadian waters (Stauffer, 1985; Dorn, 1992) likely because they can sustain higher swimming speeds (Ware, 1978; Francis, 1983). A greater fraction of these fish also tends to be females, which, beyond the age of 3 years are on average larger than males (Dark, 1975; Beamish and McFarlane, 1985). During warm years, Pacific hake migrate farther northward than in cool years (Dorn, 1995; Ware and McFarlane, 1995; Saunders and McFarlane, 1997; Wilson et al., 2000; Figure 9.3) due to an intensified northward California undercurrent, weaker upwelling and equatorward surface flow and changes in prey distribution.
1jyv | The northward feeding migration begins during the winter and early spring, when poleward transport dominates. These conditions favour the northward movement of Pacific hake. When equatorward transport in surface waters and upwelling conditions in the springtime are strong, the northward movement of Pacific hake is impeded because the fish must swim against strong southward currents, they may avoid cold upwelled waters, or they may find favourable feeding areas farther south after upwelling has improved productivity. The role of ocean conditions in the timing of the southward migration in the fall is less known. Thomson et al. (1989) noted that Pacific hake typically disap- pear from the La Perouse Bank area around the time of the fall transition and linked this disappearance to marked declines in prey production. Saunders and McFarlane (1997) suggested that factors influencing southward migration might be similar to those influencing northern migration (i.e. age-dependent swimming speed and favourable current patterns).
olce | Changes in adult Pacific hake migration may affect where spawning occurs (Figure 9.4, right panel) and how well the embryos, larvae and juveniles of suc- ceeding year classes grow and survive. Ressler et al. (2007) reviewed evidence of a more northerly distribution of both spawning and summertime feeding aggre- gations, including a more northerly distribution of adult hake in summer sur- veys, year-round presence of adult hake in southeast Alaska and the presence of hake larvae and juveniles off Oregon, Washington and British Columbia in summer during some recent years.
erx1 | 9.3.3.2 Cross-shelf distribution
b3bt | Pacific hake form dense daytime aggregations on the continental shelf break and near the edges of mid-shelf banks and basins, sometimes extending 40 km or more offshore over water depths as great as 2000 m (Bailey et al., 1982; Dorn, 1995; Ware and McFarlane, 1995; Swartzman, 2001). Pacific hake are found primarily between depths of 50 and 500 m during the day, most commonly in aggregations at depths of between 150 and 250 m.
