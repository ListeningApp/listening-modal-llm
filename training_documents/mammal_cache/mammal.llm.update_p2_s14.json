        "content": "5rcb | We generated a dataset consisting of DNAm profiles of fifteen thousand four hundred fifty-six DNA samples derived from seventy tissue types from three hundred forty-eight mammalian species using the mammalian methylation array. We evaluated whether methylation levels of cytosines in DNA sequences that are conserved across species would allow us to construct what could be called a phyloepigenetic tree. To avoid potential confounding by different tissue types, we generated tissue-specific phyloepigenetic trees. We defined the \"congruence\" between traditional phylogenetic trees and phyloepigenetic trees as the Pearson correlation coefficient between distances based on phyloepigenetic trees and evolutionary\n524j | RESEARCH\nxd3m | gruence in liver (one hundred fifty-eight species) and skin (one hundred thirty-three species) may have been due to potential variability in sampling between species. The varying congruence across tissue types shows that the CpG probes do not serve as genotyping proxies. The tissue dependence of congruence\n8qb6 | distances in traditional phylogenetic trees. We observed high congruence (zero point nine three) for the blood-based phyloepigenetic tree (one hundred twenty-four species) and lower congruence values for nonblood tissues (congruence equals zero point five eight for liver and zero point seven two for skin). The lower con-\nwkbn | indicates that phyloepigenetic trees are derived based on differences in methylation levels and not sequence conservation. This point was also corroborated by three sensitivity analyses, which confirmed that the high congruence was indeed due to differences in methylation levels\nftfg | RESEARCH | RESEARCH ARTICLE\n7xi5 | RESEARCH | RESEARCH ARTICLE\nw8r5 | (see the supplementary text). In particular, the phyloepigenetic trees based on the one hundred eighty CpGs with the most significant detection P values across all three hundred forty-eight species still are congruent with traditional trees.\nybik | To identify CpGs that exhibit a pronounced phylogenetic signal in relation to methylation and phylogenetic trees, we used Blomberg's K statistic. Among the top five hundred CpGs showing significant phylogenetic signals, selected by variance Z score, we observed an enrichment in upstream intergenic regions. To further investigate regions with the strongest phylogenetic signal, we divided the data into groups relative to the transcriptional start sites. This analysis also confirmed that intergenic regions exhibit significant phylogenetic signals, whereas the promoter regions did not show such signals.\ngii5 | DNAm networks relate to individual and species traits\nq5eu | We used signed WGCNA, an unsupervised analysis, to cluster CpGs with similar methylation dynamics across samples into co-methylation modules. We then summarized their methylation profiles as \"module eigengenes.\" The respective eigengenes of these modules were used to identify their potential correlations with various traits within and across mammalian species.",
