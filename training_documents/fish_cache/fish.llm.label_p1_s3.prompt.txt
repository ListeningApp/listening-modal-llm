  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data

  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

936l | 9.1 Introduction
06yq | Pacific hake (Merluccius productus) is the most productive and economically important commercial fish species off the west coast of North America, south of Alaska. The largely mid-water and domestic fisheries catch upwards of 200,000 t each year and are managed jointly by the United States and Canada. Pacific hake migrate along the coast each year, typically spawning near the southern end of their range in the winter. Their movement, growth and reproductive success are all heavily dependent on environmental conditions along the coast. Pacific hake are an important part of the California Current Large Marine Ecosystem (CCLME) along with being a key target for North American west coast fisheries.
dpv6 | 9.2 Stocks
8r5j | Three or more biologically and genetically distinct stocks of Pacific hake occur along the west coast of North America. These stocks include the large coastal stock and smaller, spatially restricted inshore stocks, one within Puget Sound and another in the Strait of Georgia (Iwamoto et al., 2004; Figure 9.1). A 'dwarf' Pacific hake stock had previously been recognised off Baja Califor- nia but is now considered a separate species (Vrooman and Paloma, 1977; Ermakov, 1982; Mathews, 1985; Grant and Leslie, 2001). Here, we focus on the large coastal stock of Pacific hake, which is the most abundant groundfish population in the CCLME. The majority of this population migrates annually from offshore of southern California and Mexico (~lat. 30-35°N) during the winter spawning season to coastal areas as far north as Haida Gwaii (formerly the Queen Charlotte Islands; lat. 53ºN) or, in some years, southeast Alaska (~58°N), during the spring, summer and fall. Although there is thought to be little overlap in time and space among hake stocks, recent research supports the hypothesis that hake from the separately managed inshore stocks over- lap with the large coastal stock, particularly in the summer. Gao et al. (2010) found evidence of two stocks of hake off the Washington coast based on iso- topic signatures in the core of otoliths. This finding is consistent with Puget Sound or Strait of Georgia stocks being found throughout the Strait of Juan de Fuca and near the northern-western tip of Washington. In addition, King et al. (2012) reported genetic evidence, supported by differences in biological parameters and parasite infection levels, of three separate stocks of resident Pacific hake in Canadian waters. They also found that there was likely mixing of inshore resident stocks and the coastal stock during the summer, especially

In the summer, the Strait of Georgia stock extends into Queen Charlotte Sound, while the Puget Sound stock may extend through the Strait of Juan de Fuca. The large coastal stock occurs along the entire coast depicted here, depending on the year (and time of year).

82qc | in Queen Charlotte Sound where the Canadian fishery operates to varying degrees each summer. On the basis of these two studies, mixing of inshore resident and migratory coastal stocks occurs in some, if not all years, result- ing in some harvest of resident Pacific hake by the fishery targeting the coastal stock. The exploitation level of inshore stocks is likely dependent on the relative population sizes of coastal and inshore stocks and their spatial distributions in any year.
ls7d | 9.3 Biology, life history and ecology
tzt3 | 9.3.1 Environment
t8vv | Pacific hake reside primarily within the CCLME. Climate and ocean condi- tions affect the distribution and abundance of coastal Pacific hake throughout its life history (cf. Ressler et <LATEX>a l . ,</LATEX> 2007 for a more extensive review of this topic). The California Current exhibits spatially complex and temporally varied flow dynamics. During the spring and summer, northerly wind stress drives coastal upwelling and southward surface flow, while in fall and winter, southerly wind stress leads to downwelling and northward surface flow (e.g. Hickey, 1979; Strub and James, 2000; Figure 9.2, top). Along Vancouver Island, the large volumes of freshwater discharged from coastal rivers onto the continental shelf result in northward surface flow in the summer as well (Thomson et al., 1989). The California Undercurrent, a subsurface northward flow, exists year-round on the continental shelf and upper slope, at a varying proximity to the shelf break (reviewed by Hickey, 1989; Huyer <LATEX>e t</LATEX> al., 1989; Thomson et al., 1989; Pierce et al., 2000; Agostini et al., 2006; Figure 9.2, bottom). The Undercurrent is nearly contiguous from lat. 33° to 51ºN, with a relatively narrow core (10-20 km) at depths of 200-300 m where mean sustained velocities of 10-20 cm/ s have been recorded (Pierce et al., 2000). Upwelling brings cool, dense and nutrient-rich waters to or near to the surface along the coast, increases the productivity of the CCLME (Mann and Lazier, 1996; Batchelder et al., 2002) and contributes to favourable feeding areas for Pacific hake during the summer months.
qvnu | Climate forcing at inter-decadal (e.g. regime shifts) and inter-annual time scales (e.g. El Niño/La Niña events) affects the distribution and productivity of marine species within the CCLME (McFarlane et al., 2000; Benson and Trites, 2002; King, 2005). Regime shifts, detected from coincidental changes in the distribution, survival, and abundance of many marine plankton and fish species, occurred in 1925, 1947, 1977, 1989 and 1998 (King, 2005). These shifts represent relatively abrupt, widespread and persistent changes in productivity, with effects cascading through all trophic levels. Within these regimes, ocean conditions are affected by El Niño events, resulting in warming of coastal waters offshore of the shelf-break and stronger poleward flow in the CCLME, and La Niña events, that couple cooling of surface temperatures with reduced poleward flow. A warming trend detected in all global oceans accounts for

Note pre- vailing poleward flow on shelf and slope in winter (a), and prevailing equatorward flow between spring and fall transition (b-d.) Seaward of the shelf and slope, equatorward flow exists all year. Meanders and eddies are superimposed upon broad patterns, particularly during summer and fall.

This velocity section is based on acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) data collected during the 1995 acoustics-trawl survey for Pacific hake (7 July-28 August, 1995) and analyzed by Pierce et al. (2000). The depth range for this average section is from 22 to 125-325 m, depending on bottom depth. This figure reprinted from review by Ressler et al.

v8uq | a 1℃ increase in average annual water temperature in the CCLME over the past 50 years (Di Lorenzo et al., 2005). This warming is likely to have widespread consequences for the CCLME, including the patterns in spawning, recruitment, abundance and distribution of the coastal Pacific hake stock that we describe in this chapter. King et al. (2011) concluded that warmer years would likely reduce recruitment success for Pacific hake and/or result in a northward shift in spawning and rearing areas. However, increased upwelling could increase euphausiid density at the continental shelf break resulting in increased growth of Pacific hake, while warmer conditions would likely result in farther average northward migration and development of resident stocks farther north as well.
x972 | 9.3.2 Embryos and larvae
cwrw | Spawning is hypothesised to occur in dense aggregations several 100 km off- shore of southern and Baja California in January through March, at depths of 100-500 m (Alverson and Larkins, 1969), but spawning aggregations have seldom been directly observed (Alverson and Larkins, 1969; Bailey et al., 1982; Stauffer, 1985; Saunders and McFarlane, 1997). Occasional reports of suc- cessful spawning north of this region have been made over the years (Bailey, 1980; Hollowed, 1992; Dorn, 1996; Saunders and McFarlane, 1997; Benson et al., 2002) consistent with the expected shift associated with warming of the CCLME. Fertilised embryos and larvae remain beneath the mixed layer (Bai- ley, 1982), and as larvae grow, they move inshore to the continental shelf and slope (Bailey, 1981).
4i0e | The survival of larval Pacific hake is strongly influenced by environmental conditions (such as upwelling, advection and water temperature) experienced during the first few months after spawning (Bailey, 1981; Bailey and Francis,

u6ty | 1985; Bailey et al., 1986; Hollowed, 1992; Agostini, 2005). Cold ocean years typically produce weak year classes, while more variation in year class strength occurs among warm ocean years. Cold ocean years along the west coast also have stronger upwelling, equatorward transport after the spring transition and offshore advection (the opposite conditions prevail in warm years). Depressed Pacific hake recruitment in cooler years may be due to advection of embryos and larvae to un-favourable habitat or the presence of different dominant zooplankton prey and/or predator species (Bailey, 1981; Hollowed, 1992; Agostini, 2005). Warm years with weak upwelling and offshore advection early in the year might allow larvae to quickly reach favourable coastal habitat and take advantage of upwelling-driven biological production later in the year (Hollowed and Bailey, 1989).

on9b | 9.3.3.1 North-south distribution
a8ge | The north-south distribution of the migrating coastal stock ranges on average from about 25° to 55°N, with adults from southern and offshore spawning areas feeding off Oregon, Washington and British Columbia from April/May through September/October (Alverson and Larkins, 1969; Bailey et al., 1982; Francis, 1983; Dorn, 1995; Figure 9.3, left panel).

bd9h | distribution and environmental conditions are all important factors in deter- mining the spatial distribution and annual coast-wide migration of the Pacific hake stock and its availability to both monitoring surveys and commercial fishing operations. Usually, the oldest, largest fish travel the greatest distances north into Canadian waters (Stauffer, 1985; Dorn, 1992) likely because they can sustain higher swimming speeds (Ware, 1978; Francis, 1983). A greater fraction of these fish also tends to be females, which, beyond the age of 3 years are on average larger than males (Dark, 1975; Beamish and McFarlane, 1985). During warm years, Pacific hake migrate farther northward than in cool years (Dorn, 1995; Ware and McFarlane, 1995; Saunders and McFarlane, 1997; Wilson et al., 2000; Figure 9.3) due to an intensified northward California undercurrent, weaker upwelling and equatorward surface flow and changes in prey distribution.
m047 | The northward feeding migration begins during the winter and early spring, when poleward transport dominates. These conditions favour the northward movement of Pacific hake. When equatorward transport in surface waters and upwelling conditions in the springtime are strong, the northward movement of Pacific hake is impeded because the fish must swim against strong southward currents, they may avoid cold upwelled waters, or they may find favourable feeding areas farther south after upwelling has improved productivity. The role of ocean conditions in the timing of the southward migration in the fall is less known. Thomson et al. (1989) noted that Pacific hake typically disap- pear from the La Perouse Bank area around the time of the fall transition and linked this disappearance to marked declines in prey production. Saunders and McFarlane (1997) suggested that factors influencing southward migration might be similar to those influencing northern migration (i.e. age-dependent swimming speed and favourable current patterns).
gy8c | Changes in adult Pacific hake migration may affect where spawning occurs (Figure 9.4, right panel) and how well the embryos, larvae and juveniles of suc- ceeding year classes grow and survive. Ressler et al. (2007) reviewed evidence of a more northerly distribution of both spawning and summertime feeding aggre- gations, including a more northerly distribution of adult hake in summer sur- veys, year-round presence of adult hake in southeast Alaska and the presence of hake larvae and juveniles off Oregon, Washington and British Columbia in summer during some recent years.
y4mj | 9.3.3.2 Cross-shelf distribution
vpgq | Pacific hake form dense daytime aggregations on the continental shelf break and near the edges of mid-shelf banks and basins, sometimes extending 40 km or more offshore over water depths as great as 2000 m (Bailey et al., 1982; Dorn, 1995; Ware and McFarlane, 1995; Swartzman, 2001). Pacific hake are found primarily between depths of 50 and 500 m during the day, most commonly in aggregations at depths of between 150 and 250 m.
