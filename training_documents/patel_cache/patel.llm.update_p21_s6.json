By now, this person explained, Trump is entrenched in his view of Patel as a \"useful tool.\" The former president, the adviser said, understands that \"Kash is the one you say to, 'Hey, I'm not telling you to go break into the DNC. But ... '\"\ndqn8 | What Trump might also understand is this: For Patel, the urgency of victory in November is personal. He recently described Trump as the candidate \"fighting for everybody else's right to have fame, to have money\"-the central prongs of a prosperity that Patel, after nearly a decade in Washington, appears convinced is his due, and of which the leaders of a corrupt system have conspired to deprive him.\ncop0 | Little wonder, then, that Steve Bannon mused on his podcast that Patel, far from simply being the person most likely to oversee Trump's retributive plans in a second term, could have helped inspire them in the first place. \"I think President Trump might've read Government Gangsters,\" Bannon said. \"Yeah, look, he probably did,\" Patel responded, fetching a copy to display on camera. \"That's probably why it's a best seller, and he keeps talking about it.\"\nlhkq | To the extent that Americans might struggle to grasp what any of this has to do with their own life-how a federal agenda of score-settling corresponds to their ability to be famous and make money-Patel has yet to offer a theory. He tends to frame political vengeance as an end in itself. In a second term, Trump's top law-enforcement and national-security officials would immediately focus on exposing and prosecuting those who \"did Russiagate\" and are already planning their next \"election-rigging scam,\" he told Bannon-paying special attention, perhaps, to the sixty names in Patel's compendium of \"Members of the Executive Branch Deep State,\" found in Appendix B of Government Gangsters.\n82ju | And then-well, it's not altogether clear what then. But Patel's value to Trump has never revolved around precise plans. As Richard Nixon's plumbers understood, the hallmark of loyalty is a flexible constitution.\n```",
