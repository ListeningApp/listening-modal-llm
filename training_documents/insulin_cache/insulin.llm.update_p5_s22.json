        "content": "vz32 | To summarise the available data, insulin in the VTA reduces extracellular somatodendritic DA concentrations through increased DA reuptake, reduces LTD of excitatory inputs, and decreases PPTg-evoked DA release in the NAc.\nncb0 | Two point three. Insulin action in the ventral striatum\n8mp0 | In the NAc, DA-projections target GABAergic MSN, which form several subpopulations depending on the expression of D one or D two receptors. The activity of MSNs is modulated by inputs from cholinergic and GABAergic interneurons as well as glial cells. All of these different cell types within the NAc express insulin receptors. Hence, insulin can activate a complex signalling pathway in downstream DA target areas independent of its action in the VTA.\nxjyk | Two point three point one. Insulin increases DA release and reuptake\nmt0f | Similar to its action on somatodendritic DA release in the VTA, insulin increases DAT surface expression and DA reuptake through P I three K-signaling in the DA terminals. Despite their role in reuptake, DATs are also known to mediate AMPH-induced DA-efflux through reversed transport. In line with this, insulin has been shown to facilitate AMPH-stimulated DA release mediated by DAT in hypoinsulinemic mice. In ex-vivo slices of the NAc and the dorsal striatum, Stouffer et al. demonstrated that insulin increases terminal DA release by acting on cholinergic interneurons. Furthermore, acute insulin administration has been shown to stimulate ATP release from astrocytes, which activates purinergic signaling cascades in DA neurons to facilitate DA efflux. Due to the dynamic action of insulin on DA outflow and reuptake, the net effect is\nawab | difficult to predict. However, Stouffer et al. demonstrated that insulin-mediated DA release is higher than DA reuptake suggesting a positive net effect of insulin on extracellular DA concentrations in DA downstream targets. In line with this, systemic intra-peritoneal application of insulin has been shown to increase DA release in the NAc thirty minutes after the injection and the dorsal striatum eighty minutes after the injection in a dose-dependent manner. Likewise, ICV administration increased DA-release and DA content in the striatum. More specifically, while insulin application in the striatum has been shown to increase DA release, insulin administration in the VTA induces a long-lasting decrease of DA release in the striatum. Notably, the insulin release after food intake inhibits excitatory synaptic transmission in the VTA for three hours—and hence considerably longer that the duration of the postprandial insulin spike itself—likely underlying the long-lasting depression of DA release in the striatum.\nixcc | Two point three point two. Insulin modulates excitatory inputs on MSN\n8p6h | Besides, its direct effect on MSN, insulin has been shown to modulate excitatory transmission on MSN in a concentration-dependent manner. While low physiological insulin concentrations increased excitatory\npmgl | transmission on MSN neurons, high insulin concentrations suppressed excitatory transmission on MSNs.\n90no | In summary, the effect of insulin on terminal DA release in the striatum is dependent on the site of administration. While insulin applied in the striatum increases terminal DA release, insulin applied to the VTA suppresses phasic DA release by inhibiting excitatory inputs.\njt0y | Two point four. Impact of insulin signalling on reward behaviour in rodents\nqb7o | Unsurprisingly, the aforementioned effects of insulin on DA signalling within the mesolimbic pathway have been linked to changes in reward-seeking behaviour. The differential effects of insulin in the DA midbrain and the downstream targets result in different behavioural alterations depending on the site of insulin administration and the homeostatic status.\noae5 | Two point four point one. The effect of insulin on food approach behavior\ns0fl | Injections of insulin into the VTA decreased food anticipatory behaviour and food approach behaviour in a light-dark box. Insulin infusions in the VTA as well as in\n43ia | the NAc reduced regular chow consumption in rodents. The insulin action in the VTA is dose and time-dependent. While low doses of insulin (zero point zero zero five to zero point five milliunits) do not modulate food intake behaviour, reduced food consumption can only be observed for high insulin levels (five milliunits) in the first twenty-four hours after the intervention. Mebel et al. investigated the influence of hunger and satiety status and demonstrated that five hundred nanomolar insulin applied to the VTA did not modulate regular chow feeding in hungry mice within the first four hours, but rather suppressed sweetened high-fat diet intake when applied in sated mice suggesting that insulin primarily suppresses \"hedonic feeding\" through modulating reward behaviour. Consistent with this, mice lacking insulin receptors in DA neurons had increased food intake, leading to increased body weight and adiposity.\n3g2y | Two point four point two. Impact of insulin on reward sensitivity\ngc7v | In rats fed ad libitum intra-VTA application of low levels of insulin increased the threshold for intracranial self-stimulation suggesting reduced reward sensitivity. Opioid-stimulated feeding—a model for hedonic feeding—was only suppressed, when insulin was applied in the VTA. Neither insulin application in the NAc nor in the hypothalamic nuclei showed a similar effect suggesting that this effect is specific to the VTA. ICV-insulin application combined with the D two-receptor antagonist raclopride reduced the lick rate in a sucrose-licking task (fixed-ratio), while insulin alone was not sufficient to induce this effect, confirming that insulin action is dependent on DA signalling. Both ICV and intra-VTA insulin infusions have been shown to inhibit conditioned place preference to a high-fat diet or sweetened froot loops in a concentration-dependent manner in ad-libitum-fed rodents; again suggesting a reduced reward sensitivity.\nwqfv | Two point four point three.
