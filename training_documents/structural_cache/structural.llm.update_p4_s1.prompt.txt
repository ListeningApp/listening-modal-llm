You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

hvhm | conservation of the metal ligands, is that the mononuclear copper center observed in the M. capsulatus (Bath) pMMO crystal structure may not be conserved in pMMOs from other methanotrophs.8 A caveat to this discussion is that, although the EXAFS samples did not photoreduce during data collection, we cannot exclude the possibility of instantaneous photoreduction upon exposure to X-rays, which would complicate a comparison of EPR and EXAFS data.
863b | In the first scenario (scenario 1 in Figure 3), the dicopper center is occupied by EPR silent, antiferromag- netically coupled Cu"Cu" and the mononuclear copper site is CuII, giving rise to the type 2 signal. Upon reduction, the dinuclear site would be converted to Cu'Cu", explain- ing the increase in the Cu-Cu distance observed by EXAFS. However, the XANES spectra indicate the presence of CuI in the as-isolated pMMO, which would only be consistent with this model if the zinc site were loaded with Cu". If the mononuclear copper site is not present in all pMMOs, the spectroscopic data are not compatible with scenario 1. Another possibility (scenario 2 in Figure 3) is that the dicopper site is Cu'Cu" and the mononuclear copper site is EPR-active CuII. The zinc site could be occupied by either Cul or Cu". If pMMOs from other organisms have the dicopper and zinc sites and lack the mononuclear copper site, the zinc site would have to be occupied by Cul. One issue with this scenario is that the increase in the Cu-Cu distance upon reduction would have to be attributed to a change other than redox chemistry. Finally, the dicopper center could be a trapped valence CulCu" site (scenario 3 in Figure 3). The type 2 signal would then derive from the dicopper site, and reduction would result in the loss of the EPR signal as well as an increase in the Cu-Cu distance. Copper at the mononuclear and zinc sites could either be Cul or Cu". Because site-directed mu- tagenesis is currently not an option for pMMO, which is obtained directly from methanotrophs9 rather than from
fj24 | a heterologous expression system, other methods to distinguish among these scenarios, including spectro- scopic and structural characterization of pMMOs from other methanotrophs, must be pursued.
uz3c | In Search of the Active Site
d5bi | Subunit Localization. Prior to the crystal structure, experiments using radiolabeled acetylene, a suicide sub- strate, were used to probe the active-site location. In three different studies, the 24 kDa pmoA subunit was labeled.24,36,37 Similar studies with the related enzyme ammonia mo- nooxygenase are consistent with this result, with a 28 kDa subunit acquiring the label.38,39 Some labeling of the 47 kDa pmoB subunit was also observed.24 The labeling is believed to derive from an activated acetylene intermedi- ate that covalently modifies residues in the active site or nearby.37 These data thus suggest that the active site is located in the pmoA subunit with perhaps some involve- ment of pmoB. According to the crystal structure, pmoA is the least involved in metal coordination, contributing only Glu 195 to the zinc site. If the zinc site represents the location of the active site, it is curious that pmoC, which contributes the other three ligands, is not modified. One way to explain the acetylene-labeling results is to consider a cluster of hydrophilic residues in pmoA adja- cent to the zinc site (Figure 4).8,14 These residues, which include His 38, Met 42, Asp 47, Asp 49, and Glu 100 as well as Glu 154 from pmoC, are highly conserved and could conceivably form a metal-binding site that was depleted during purification and/or crystallization. Label- ing of pmoB is easier to rationalize because both the mono- and dinuclear copper centers are located within this subunit.
ba4l | The structural data offer an explanation for why pmoA and pmoB might both be labeled. Dalton and co-workers suggest that the side "holes" observed in the cryo-EM and
ffx8 | Structure and Mechanism of pMMO Balasubramanian and Rosenzweig
s6su | crystal structures represent a route for substrate entry.16 These openings are near the pmoB dicopper center as well as the zinc site and adjacent pmoA hydrophilic cluster. One possibility is that labeled acetylene products diffuse to the two locations, exploiting these "holes". Diffusion between these sites in pmoB and pmoA may be further enhanced by two adjacent cavities (Figure 5). The first is lined by several conserved hydrophobic residues, includ- ing Pro 94 from pmoB and Leu 78, Ile 163, and Val 164 from pmoC. The second includes some of the same residues and extends to the zinc site.14 Although these observations do not address the exact location of the active site, they do help solve the puzzle of the acetylene labeling data. A corollary to this argument is that the active site probably is not located at the pmoB mononuclear copper center because there is not an obvious path for diffusion of acetylene intermediates from this location to the pmoA subunit.
y219 | Active-Site Identity. Detailed knowledge of the identity, coordination environment, and oxidation state of the active site is critical to understand how pMMO activates O2. There are five possibilities for the active site: the pmoB mononuclear copper center, the pmoC/pmoA zinc center, the pmoB dinuclear copper center, the pmoA hydrophilic cluster, and the trinuclear cluster proposed by Chan and co-workers. At this juncture, the mononuclear copper site in pmoB seems unlikely because all of the ligands to the metal at this site are not conserved.8 Because no evidence for a trinuclear copper cluster was found in the crystal structure, we will not consider this option either, although methane hydroxylation at such a site has been investigated recently by density functional theory (DFT) calculations.40 There is currently no evidence for metal binding at the pmoA hydrophilic cluster either. The remaining two options, the pmoC/pmoA zinc center and the pmoB dinuclear copper center, warrant further discussion.
06ht | O2 Activation at a Mononuclear Copper Center. Even though the pmoB mononuclear copper site has been discounted, the possibility of O2 activation at a mono- nuclear copper center remains if the pmoC/pmoA zinc center contains copper in vivo. In considering this site, it
