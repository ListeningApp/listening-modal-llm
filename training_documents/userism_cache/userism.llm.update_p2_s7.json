        "content": "dqvj | What, then, is a user? To some extent, being a user represents a particular type of relationship, i.e., a particular subject position, that people can have in relationship to technology. In the words of the software engineering ISO standard, \"a user is 'an individual or group' who 'uses a software product to perform a specific function' and 'benefits from a system during its utilization.' However, the user is also a rhetorical device used both to justify the existence of HCI as a field and to distinguish it from each of computer science and cognitive psychology. In practice, the user enables us to engage with and account for human beings who will interact with computing technology during the design and evaluation of those technologies. However, as we argue below, the dominance of the user simultaneously constrains the types of human-computer interactions we can meaningfully account for in our research.\nr17u | To be sure, \"user\" is not the only term used to refer to human beings in HCI. Experimental subjects, ethnographic informants, social network egos and alters, gamers, museum attendees, employees, citizens-these and many other roles lie within the purview of HCI research and practice. When it comes to design, though, we generally account for these humans who use the technologies we build and study as users. The ideology of the user refers to this impetus to \"user-ify\" people, that is, to see or place people in the subject position of technology user.\n3c47 | The user, however, does not exist as an a priori entity. Rather, it is repeatedly created, enacted, and reified over the historical development of HCI, albeit with some changes along the way. Here, we track that evolution of \"user.\" In doing so, we show that the notion of the user continues both to exist and to exert significant influence, despite numerous large-scale intellectual and practical shifts in the field.\ng345 | Here Come the Waves: A History of User\nsvhz | Different observers have offered varying accounts of the history and development of HCI as a discipline.\noaen | Articulation of three waves of HCI. For our purposes, these waves can be characterized by their responses to each of three definitional questions:\n5u67 | One. What is a human?\ndvms | Two. What is a computer?\nqrd3 | Three. What is an interaction?\nrxrg | Answering these three questions plays an essential role in articulating the default subject position of the user: a human interacting with a computer.\ntf43 | First Wave\nfcco | First wave HCI is grounded in its disciplinary ancestors: cognitive/experimental psychology and computer science, most notably exemplified by the text The Psychology of Human-Computer Interaction. This paradigm emphasizes quantitative metrics of improved performance, especially speed (faster is better) and errors (fewer is better). Fitts' law as applied to interface design provides a prototypical example. Both its mathematicality and its objects of interest-time, distance, size-are characteristic of first wave HCI. The modernist values of efficiency, calculability, and predictability become clearly apparent in this formulation. To be clear, research still actively pursues first wave types of questions. Thus, first wave constitutes HCI in the following way:\n8uji | One. A human is a rational actor trying to optimize performance (increase speed, reduce errors, etc.).\ndf3e | Two. A computer is an information processing device to enable that rational actor to perform its task.\n53eu | Three. An interaction is an information exchange between human and computer (e.g., GOMS).\na5u1 | Thus, the first wave user is a rational actor who functions as part of an information processing loop with the computer. In practice, this generally means a single human sitting in front of and operating a single computer terminal. This model human processor becomes the canonical depiction of the user, the one from which future conceptions of the user arise and against which alternative conceptions are contrasted.\nry7u | Second Wave\n5mda | Second wave HCI moves, as it were, \"from human factors to human actors.\" An important component of this shift involves acknowledging the context in which computer use occurs. In the case of second wave, this context was often one of professional work, including the ways that individual technology use both shapes and is shaped by the group(s) and/or organization(s) of which that individual is a member. Furthermore, the human is treated as a situated actor with her or his own plans, motivations, goals, etc. These shifts result in the following constitution of HCI:\ni4li | One. A human is a situated actor (often a member of an organization) trying to accomplish a task within a particular organizational context, often as part of a\nr8sm | group of other people who may be members of the same or different organizations.\ncuin | Two. A computer is a software application used in the conduct of work (calendar, spreadsheet, word processor, etc.).\nn1i7 | Three. An interaction involves using software to accomplish a goal, often related to the individual's work context.\n0r5m | Thus, the second wave user is a situated actor who employs software applications to perform the tasks associated with her or his job within the context of a particular work and/or organizational setting. In these ways, second wave HCI moves to acknowledging the presence of multiple users, each of whom is interacting either with their own or with shared software application(s). The focus on the user, though, is still paramount. Second wave HCI is driven by developing \"a better understanding among researchers, and many system designers too, about the 'users' of computer systems.\" On one hand, Bannon argues convincingly for treating people as more than \"just\" users, acknowledging that they are simultaneously workers, practitioners, etc. On the other, the focus in second wave very clearly remains on the people who directly interact with, i.e., use, the system.\nne2o | Third Wave\nsqxn | The third wave of HCI begins to grapple with life outside of professional and organizational work contexts. Moving beyond the workplace and productivity, computing takes on numerous varied roles: leisure, socializing, gaming and sport, sensing and expressing emotion, cultural production and meaning making, etc. As computing moved \"off the desktop\" into smartphones, mp3 players, cars, tablets, etc., it moved into myriad other facets of our lives. These developments constitute HCI in yet another way:\n6pmo | One. A human is a person engaging in (a set of) socio- cultural practices embedded within a numerous broader contexts, including cultural, historical, political, organizational, etc.\n195r | Two. A computer is a technological system that may consist of a single device, a constellation of devices, an infrastructure, or a more complex assemblage that arises from and is embedded within a particular set of contexts.\nkqmi | Three. An interaction is the experience of leveraging a technological system in the course of an individually, socially, or culturally meaningful practice.\ng8rd | Ultimately, the model is of a human using technology to engage in socio-culturally situated practices.\nnns9 | Thus, the third wave user becomes a person using technology to engage in socio-culturally situated practices (commerce, leisure, artistic performance, sport, etc.). Work along these lines includes situations involving one user and",
