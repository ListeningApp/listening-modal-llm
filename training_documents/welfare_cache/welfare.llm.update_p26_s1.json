        "content": "7od1 | present Dutch welfare administration compared to Norway, but studying their role exclusively between two thousand and two thousand thirteen/two thousand fifteen would have shown that the social partners were virtually absent in the Dutch welfare administration (except pension fund boards). These are important arguments for longitudinal studies to draw more balanced conclusions about public sector reform.\n0bqy | Our study also raises some further questions for future research. For example, in two thousand fifteen, well after the crisis of two thousand eight, a reform followed in both countries with a 'revival' of NPG ideas and a focus on decentralization. This raises the question of whether NPG-type reforms are contingent on relatively favourable economic conditions? Another fundamental issue is how different NPG reforms actually are from TPA and NPM? As Lapuente and Van der Walle argued: \"Post-NPM represents a reassertion of old public administration values as well an attempt to remedy some of the disintegrating tendencies associated with NPM, and not an abandonment of NPM reforms.\" Other scholars have theoretically questioned if the models are internally consistent: NPM has at least two faces: market and management; and also NPG would have many meanings. However, we have shown in this paper that despite internal variety, the NPM and NPG models can be used to uncover convergence and divergence in reform characteristics and their impact on welfare administrations over time.\nb780 | A final issue for further study is about radical-versus incremental reform. Pollitt and Dan argued that \"The structure of political system may be facilitating or inhibiting for rapid or large-scale reform. The incremental decision-making process in, say, Norway or the Netherlands is more likely to inhibit such reform whereas the centralized, majoritarian system in the U K and a more consensual one is more likely to facilitate reform\". We found the opposite effect in Norway and the Netherlands, where large-scale reform took place despite the incremental process. Or should we say that radical, large-\nccmb | scale reform follows up on incremental decision-making that did not lead to consensus? Then it is the stalemate that facilitates a quite sudden, large-scale reform, especially when a political majority wants to leave behind the previous system.\nma93 | To foster understanding of public sector reform, these issues need more attention in future comparative research.",
