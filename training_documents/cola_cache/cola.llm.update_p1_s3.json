This work aimed to study the influences of carbonated beverages on the testis growth and the expression levels of androgen receptor of mice.\nb8hf | Methods. Two experimental groups of thirty mice each PEP-one and PEP-two drank fifty percent and one hundred percent Pepsi-Cola, respectively for fifteen days. Other two experimental groups of thirty mice each COC-one and COC-two drank fifty percent and one hundred percent Coca- Cola, respectively for fifteen days. The control group of thirty mice drank water. Bilateral testes were harvested aseptically on days zero, five, seven, ten, thirteen and fifteen. Real-time PCR and Western blot were implemented to detect levels of androgen receptor mRNA and protein in testis tissues.\nhntf | Results. Testes masses of PEP-two, COC-one and COC-two were greater than those of PEP-one and control group. On day fifteen, testis longitudinal diameter of carbonated beverages-treated mice was increased as compared to control group. Testis longitudinal diameter, testes transverse diameters and androgen receptor proteins levels of PEP-two and COC-two were increased in comparison with control group. Serum testosterone concentrations of PEP-two were higher than that of COC-one and control group. Levels of androgen receptor mRNAs of four carbonated beverages-treated mice were increased by sixty point eighteen percent, sixty-seven point twenty-six percent, sixty-five point ninety-three percent and seventy-eight point seventy-six percent.\n99fo | Conclusions. A high concentration of Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola could raise testis longitudinal diameter and testis transverse diameter, enhance testosterone secretion, and increase serum epidermal growth factor concentrations.\ny5r7 | INTRODUCTION\nlrry | Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola are two main carbonated beverages drunk by numerous consumers over the world. Carbonated beverages consumption may lead to obesity, cardiovascular diseases and type two diabetes mellitus. Carbonated beverages increased weight body of rats after consuming over one year. Epidemiologic studies evaluated the association between caffeine and fertility, which indicated that health damage effects of carbonated beverages on adolescents and children\nhvhm | GENERAL ENDOCRINOLOGY\n863b | were serious. Previous studies also suggested that carbonated beverages affected fertility. Massive consumption of coffee or caffeine increased testosterone production. Coca-Cola could induce incidence of malignant mammary tumors in Sprague-Dawley rat. However, many reports were questionnaire and prospective investigations based on the local populations in a region. Some reports even showed the opposite. So far there has been little documentation regarding correlation between carbonated beverages consumption and reproduction function and fertility in humans and animals. Carbonated beverages have been associated with alterations in estradiol and other hormones which may affect ovulation, the length of the follicular or luteal phase. The exact mechanisms that carbonated beverages affected the fertility are undetermined. Comparative experimental studies are scanty.\nfj24 | Our preliminary study showed that administration of Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola for twenty-five days could decrease ovaries mass, reduce the ovarian cortex thickness, as well as affect follicles development. Besides, Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola could inhibit burn repair and physics strength of the healed tissues of the burned rabbits. Therefore, drinking carbonated beverages may threaten reproductive success.\nuz3c | Androgens play an important role in sexual differentiation and secondary characteristics formation of the male mammals. Androgen exerts its physiological functions by combining its specific androgen receptor in target tissues. Testosterone, a crucial androgen, has an important role on forming puberty and maintain normal male libido. Currently, it remains undetermined whether long-term intake of carbonated beverages influences the synthesis and secretion of testosterone.\nd5bi | The present study aimed to investigate the effects of carbonated beverages, including Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola, on the testis development and expression levels of androgen receptor of mice, and also to\nba4l | provide scientific bases for the rational consumption of carbonated beverages, and prevent prostate dysfunction and cancer.\nffx8 | MATERIALS AND METHODS\ns6su | Animals\ny219 | One hundred fifty non-copulating male mice, body weight of twenty point eighty-four plus or minus two point forty-five grams, were bought from Lanzhou University. They were allocated into five groups: Pepsi-Cola one, Pepsi-Cola two, Coca-Cola one, Coca-Cola two and the control group of thirty. Mice were raised in mice cages that were equipped with automatic water dispensers under the same conditions kept at thirty to fifty percent humidity and twenty-two to twenty-four degrees Celsius. Water was provided ad libitum. Mice were freely fed with daily ration feeds. Each mouse was weighed every day. The experiment was begun after an adaptation period of seven days.\n06ht | Animal treatments and sample collection\nv3r2 | Pure Pepsi-Cola and Coca-Cola were purchased from the monopolized store; fifty percent Pepsi-Cola and Coca-Cola was prepared by releasing one liter of pure Coca- Cola or Pepsi-Cola with one liter of tap water. Mice in Pepsi-Cola one and Pepsi-Cola two drank freely fifty percent and pure one hundred percent Pepsi-Cola, respectively for consecutive fifteen days. Animals in Coca-Cola one and Coca-Cola two drank freely fifty percent and pure one hundred percent Coca-Cola, respectively for consecutive fifteen days. Mice in the control group drank freely tap water. Bilateral testes were aseptically collected from each mouse on days zero, five, seven, ten and fifteen, respectively. Blood was harvested from the jugular vein of each mouse killed by neck dislocation. Serum was isolated from blood by centrifugation at three thousand times g for ten minutes, and then stored at negative twenty degrees Celsius until analysis. Animal treatment was permitted by the Experiment Animal Care and Use Committee of Gansu province, China.\nnv42 | Measurements of testis mass, testis longitudinal and transverse diameter\nxags | The mass of each testis was measured using an electronic balance. The average was determined on the basis of both left and right values. The extraneous tissues and fats on the testis surface were removed using sterile scissors. The testis longitudinal diameter and testis transverse diameter of each testis were accurately measured with a vernier caliper.\njc47 | Measurements of serum testosterone and epidermal growth factor\nko3c | The contents of serum testosterone and epidermal growth factor\nxek3 | were measured using the mice ELISA kit, as per instruction manual. The detection level was zero point forty picograms per milliliter. Each assay was done in triplicate.\nbbpr | Determination of expression levels of androgen receptor mRNA\n5zyf | Total RNAs were extracted from the testis samples, then reversely transcribed into cDNA with the superscript first strand synthesis system for RT-PCR.\n9own | Appropriate primers of the androgen receptor were designed and synthesized. Only those primers showing dimmer-free reactions were used for further analysis.\n```",
