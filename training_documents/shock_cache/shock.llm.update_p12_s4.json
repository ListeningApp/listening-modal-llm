        "content": "6d4s | Comparing Mechanical Circulatory Support With Medical Therapy, an Urgent Need for Randomized Data\nmqah | MCS use in CS has increased dramatically over the past fifteen years, despite the cost, associated risk of major complications, and limited evidence to support its use. The rationale for the use of these devices is predicated on their ability to restore systemic perfusion, reduce cardiac filling pressures, limit myocardial oxygen consumption, and reduce vasoactive agent requirements. The Impella catheter-based micro-axial flow pump and venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation have been readily adopted to provide hemodynamic support and incorporated into a range of CS treatment algorithms. This practice has occurred despite very limited randomized data supporting the safety and efficacy of these treatments, in addition to determining\nxxr8 | Vasoactive Medications in Cardiogenic Shock\nrl4j | the appropriate timing and clinical indications for the commencement of these invasive therapies. There are several randomized controlled trials ongoing that are seeking to assess the role MCS use with respect to the timing of initiation and their use compared with medical therapy alone. Although these studies will be crucial to inform the in-hospital management of CS, MCS will not negate the need for pharmacologic support in both prehospital and in-hospital environments during the treatment phase before patients are established on MCS and in settings where this technology is not readily available.\nvz32 | CONCLUSIONS\nncb0 | The use of vasoactive medications in CS is common and underpins the contemporary hemodynamic support strategy for these patients. We have sought to present the unique pharmacology of these medications and provide a pragmatic approach to their use. However, despite the ubiquitous use of these agents in critical care settings, there remains a lack of robust, outcomes-based data, underscoring the need for further high-quality trials to guide future practice.\n8mp0 | Vasoactive Medications in Cardiogenic Shock\nxjyk | Vasoactive Medications in Cardiogenic Shock\nmt0f | Vasoactive Medications in Cardiogenic Shock",
