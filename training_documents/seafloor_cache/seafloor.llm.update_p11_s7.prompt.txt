You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

hpi6 | Site A is a local topographic high at the northern end of the row of craters. It rises ~10 m above background sediments over an area of ~100 x 80 m (Figs. 2, 5A). Chimneys and mounds are distributed around what may be a buried crater, partially covered by volcaniclastic material. The volcaniclas- tic cover sequence (up to 13.8 m thick) is underlain by 0.7 to 2.6 m of chimney talus, followed by intensely clay altered monomictic lapillistone that is crudely bedded with both matrix-supported and clast-supported intervals, extending to the bottom of the drill holes. The northernmost drill hole, TKAD001, is located next to an active chimney complex and reaches a depth of 22.3 m below seafloor (b.s.f .; App. Fig. A2). The upper ~14 m consists of variably altered volcaniclastic cover material with three discrete oxidized intervals, followed by altered lapillistone. The upper part of the clay-altered lapil- listone sequence is unconsolidated to poorly consolidated, with increasing cementation by anhydrite downhole, and is cut by a few anhydrite veins (2-5 mm wide). Disseminated
4uhb | sulfides (pyrite, sphalerite, and minor chalcopyrite, galena, covellite, and bornite) occur with anhydrite that has been partly hydrated to gypsum, both in the cement and in the vein fill. To the south of this drill hole, TKAD015 and TKAD027 were drilled in close proximity (~3 m apart) to a maximum depth of 7.3 m b.s.f., next to a partially buried chimney com- plex. The volcaniclastic cover is <1 m thick and contains frag- ments of chimney material, likely sourced by mass wasting from nearby (unknown) chimneys (App. Figs. A3, A4). The mineralized interval is a ~1.5- to 2.6-m-thick layer of chim- ney talus. As in TKAD001, intensely clay altered and poorly sorted lapillistone occurs below the chimney talus in both drill holes. TKAD028, located ~20 m east of TKAD015/027, intersected 0.5 m of volcaniclastic cover material, followed at depth by a narrow (0.7 m) sulfide interval dominated by barite and sphalerite at the top and becoming pyrite rich downhole (App. Fig. A5). This mineralized interval appears to correlate between the drill holes. The clay-altered lapillistone at the bottom of the hole is similar but better sorted than that found in TKAD015/027. Approximately 30 m to the east, TKAD029 encountered only the variably altered volcaniclastic cover material to a depth of 7.8 m b.s.f. (App. Fig. A6). This drill hole is located at the edge of the low-relief cinder cone where the volcaniclastic cover is thickest.
epyi | Site B is another crater-like feature (70 x 80 m) on a cone at the north end of the row of cinder cones (Figs. 2, 5B). Chimneys and mounds occur along the crater walls and on the outer flanks of the cone and are variably covered by vol- caniclastic material. Here, massive sulfide chimneys occur on top of chimney talus. At the western edge of the crater, TKAD016 intersected thin (0.2 m) volcaniclastic cover, fol- lowed by a layer of pyritic chimney talus ~0.4 m thick and then poorly sorted and crudely bedded monomict, matrix- supported, and intensely clay altered lapillistone (App. Fig. A7). The upper part of the lapillistone is cemented mainly by gypsum with a few large crystals up to 7 mm long; the lower part is mostly unconsolidated with patchy anhydrite cement that has been partially hydrated to gypsum, a few crosscutting veinlets of anhydrite, weak silicification, and disseminated sul- fide minerals (pyrite with minor sphalerite near the top and minor to trace chalcopyrite near the bottom). At the southern wall of the crater, TKAD026 intersected massive sphalerite- barite chimney material to a depth of 1.4 m b.s.f. (App. Fig. A8). The substrate of lapillistone contains minor patchy barite cement in the upper part and anhydrite cement in the lower part, with gray-white clay alteration that generally decreases downhole. At the center of the crater, the mineralized inter- val of chimney talus is thicker (up to ~3.9 m) in TKAD013, cemented by anhydrite-rich and clay-altered mud and fine- grained sulfide minerals (App. Fig. A9). This interval was not recovered in TKAD025 (located ~3.6 m away) owing to poor drilling conditions (App. Fig. A10). In the center of the cra- ter, intensely clay altered lapilli with minor disseminated sul- fides occur to ~4 m b.s.f., below which is a chaotic mixture of matrix-supported volcanic and chimney fragments. The volca- nic clasts are polymict (altered and unaltered), subangular to angular, and variably infilled by late-stage silica. Several short intervals within the lapilli units contain gypsum crystals up to
y51p | 3 cm long. On the upper rim of the volcanic cone in the east, a thin (0.6 m) cover of unconsolidated volcaniclastic material is directly underlain by altered monomict lapillistone, with increasing sulfate cement and decreasing alteration intensity downhole to a depth of 7.4 m b.s.f. (see TKAD012, App. Fig. A11). At this site, there are fewer disseminated sulfides com- pared to the other drill holes and decreasing sphalerite abun- dance downhole.
x95m | Site C is a large volcanic cinder cone, rising to ~70 m above the seafloor and with a diameter of ~120 x 90 m (Figs. 2, 5C, D). Chimney complexes and mounds occur on the flank of this cone in the vicinity of a circular slump feature. TKAD032 intercepted unconsolidated volcaniclastic cover material to 1.8 m, followed by intensely altered volcaniclastic breccia to 6.9 m b.s.f. (App. Fig. A12). The altered sequence consists of monomict lapillistone with subrounded to subangular vesic- ular clasts but variable clay alteration. The uppermost lapil- listone is matrix supported with variable sulfate cement and veins and disseminated pyrite, sphalerite, and chalcopyrite (decreasing downhole). Several horizons are clast supported (up to 60% clasts), with angular monomict clasts, and appear to be autobreccias. One gypsum-rich interval occurs at 6.4 to 6.6 m b.s.f. TKAD033 was drilled at the edge of a small crater or collapse feature near the summit of the cone. The recov- ered rock types are similar to those in TKAD032, with a tran- sition between the volcaniclastic cover and the clay-altered footwall occurring at 1.1 m b.s.f. (App. Fig. A13). Variable alteration intensity gives this rock a polymict appearance.
