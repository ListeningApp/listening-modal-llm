Let x equal X and y belong to the intersection of B at x star, Delta, and X star. The fact that y and X star only have nonzero components in the set I of x star, zero, while the optimality condition seven c implies the gradient of F at x star only has zero components in the set I of x star, zero, allows us to write\nul2a | F of y is less than or equal to F of x star plus the quantity L sub g divided by two times the norm of the difference between y and x star squared, so by choosing y close enough to X star, we have y belongs to the set N of x star. This implies that the set N of x star is a neighborhood of X star, in\n4eaf | X star. Let x equal X and y equal x sub k for x sub k belong to the intersection of B at x star, Delta, and X star. Then, x star plus t times the difference between x sub k and x star belongs to the intersection of B at x star, Delta, and X, for any t in the interval from zero to one. Hence,\n4b6k | Forty-five applied to fifty-two yields the quantity mu divided by two times the norm of the difference between x sub k and x star squared is less than or equal to F of x sub k minus F of x star.
