You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

xh3i | the decrease of <LATEX>\Phi _ { 2 }</LATEX> with increasing irradiance has resulted in a modified method to estimate <LATEX>R _ { \mathrm { d } }</LATEX> (Yin et al., 2009, 2011a). The analysis using the modified method, now known as the Yin method (Tcherkez et <LATEX>a l . ,</LATEX> 2017b), indicates that the inhibition of <LATEX>R _ { \mathrm { d } }</LATEX> by light is less than the original Kok method suggests (Yin et al., 2011a).
syiw | Less information is available on the change in <LATEX>f _ { \mathrm { a c t } }</LATEX> or in <LATEX>\rho _ { 2 }</LATEX> with <LATEX>I _ { \mathrm { a b s } }</LATEX> that could partly explain the Kok effect. Peltier & Sarrey (1988) indicated that the inhibition of chlororespiration (a pro- cess in chloroplasts that involves a respiratory electron transport chain within the thylakoid membrane) might be responsible for the Kok effect. Data of Zhang et al. (2018) and Ver Sagun et al. (2019) suggested that cyclic electron transport around PSI increased with increasing <LATEX>I _ { \mathrm { a b s } } .</LATEX> If this also applies to the limiting light conditions, an increase in <LATEX>f _ { \mathrm { c y c } }</LATEX> with increasing <LATEX>I _ { \mathrm { a b s } }</LATEX> would pre- dict a part of the Kok effect (Fig. 2d). According to Eqns 2 and 3, <LATEX>f _ { \mathrm { c y c } }</LATEX> has a dual effect on the expression of the Kok effect, that is, via both terms <LATEX>f _ { \mathrm { a c t } }</LATEX> and <LATEX>\rho _ { 2 } .</LATEX> Eqn 3 suggests that parameter <LATEX>\rho _ { 2 } ,</LATEX> related to state transition, could be affected not only by <LATEX>f _ { \mathrm { c y c } }</LATEX> (Fig. 2d) but also by the <LATEX>\Phi _ { 2 } / \Phi _ { 1 }</LATEX> ratio. Tcherkez et al. (2017a) speculated the possible role of state transition in the Kok effect. The model of Eqns 1-3 predicts that an increase <LATEX>\mathrm { i n } f _ { \text { Cyc } } \text { or in } \Phi _ { 2 } /</LATEX> <LATEX>\Phi _ { 1 }</LATEX> with increasing <LATEX>I _ { \mathrm { a b s } }</LATEX> leads to the state transition in favour of PSI with increasing irradiance, and this could engender part of the Kok effect (Fig. 2d).
kg3t | The Kok effect is not ubiquitous. Early reports found little Kok effect at low O2 conditions and in <LATEX>\mathrm { C } _ { 4 }</LATEX> plants (Cornic & Jarvis, 1978; Ishii & Murata, 1978). These observations have led to suggestions that photorespiration might be involved in the Kok effect, as confirmed by other studies where photorespiration was manipulated by changing measurement temperatures (Ishii & Schmid, 1981; Way et al., 2019) or by lowering leaf water potential (Sharp et al., 1984). Again, the model analyses of Far- quhar & Busch (2017) demonstrated that the change in <LATEX>\Gamma ^ { * } / C _ { \mathrm { c } }</LATEX> therefore, in relative amounts of photorespiration, with increas- ing <LATEX>I _ { a b s }</LATEX> can explain much of the diminution of the Kok effect in <LATEX>\mathrm { C } _ { 4 }</LATEX> plants and at low O2 or high CO2 concentrations or low tem- peratures. They also showed that the change in <LATEX>\Gamma ^ { * } / C _ { \mathrm { c } }</LATEX> can gener- ate the apparent inhibition of <LATEX>R _ { \mathrm { d } }</LATEX> as inferred by the Laisk method, which is based on <LATEX>A - C _ { i }</LATEX> curves at two or more irradiances (where <LATEX>C _ { \mathrm { i } }</LATEX> is the intercellular <LATEX>C O _ { 2 }</LATEX> concentration). The decrease in <LATEX>C _ { i }</LATEX> with increasing <LATEX>I _ { \mathrm { a b s } }</LATEX> is the result of stomatal regulation, and its influence on estimates of <LATEX>R _ { \mathrm { d } }</LATEX> by the Kok method was noted by Kirschbaum & Farquhar (1987), who proposed a method to cor- rect for this decrease in <LATEX>C _ { \mathrm { i } }</LATEX> ;. The further drawdown in <LATEX>C _ { c } ,</LATEX> relative to <LATEX>C _ { 1 } ,</LATEX> is regulated by <LATEX>g _ { \mathrm { m } }</LATEX> (Evans & von Caemmerer, 1996). The Kok method would underestimate <LATEX>R _ { \mathrm { d } }</LATEX> if light-dependent changes in <LATEX>C _ { i }</LATEX> (Villar et al., 1994) or in <LATEX>C _ { c }</LATEX> (Ayub et al., 2011) are not cor- rected for. Simple <LATEX>g _ { s }</LATEX> and <LATEX>g _ { m }</LATEX> models when coupled with photo- synthesis models like Eqns 1-3 can account for the refixation of CO2 released from respiration and photorespiration (von Caem- merer, 2013), and in fact, the refixation fractions of (photo) respired <LATEX>C O _ { 2 } c a n</LATEX> be calculated analytically from stomatal, meso- phyll and carboxylation resistances (Yin & Struik, 2017). As such, the light inhibition of <LATEX>R _ { \mathrm { d } }</LATEX> predicted for photorespiratory conditions by Farquhar & Busch (2017) and the need to correct
lvae | for light-dependent changes in <LATEX>C _ { i }</LATEX> and <LATEX>C _ { c }</LATEX> are basically analogous to the statement of Loreto et al. (2001) that the lower <LATEX>R _ { \mathrm { d } }</LATEX> than <LATEX>R _ { \mathrm { d l } }</LATEX> resulted from the failure of the original Kok or Laisk methods in accounting for the refixation of respired <LATEX>C O _ { 2 }</LATEX> in the light.
