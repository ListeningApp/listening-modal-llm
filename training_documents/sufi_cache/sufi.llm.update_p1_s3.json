        "content": "2wez | IDRIES SHAH LEARNING HOW TO LEARN\nbe46 | PSYCHOLOGY AND SPIRITUALITY IN THE SUFI WAY - by the author of THE WAY OF THE SUFI\ntqt5 | For some of us, the time has come to mobilize. If you have an interest in assisting in this process - we all have strengths to bring to the table.\nbbh2 | Introduction\n20he | It was as recently as nineteen sixty-four that Idries Shah's The Sufis appeared. It was evident that with this new classic on the subject, there had emerged the Exemplar who from time to time comes forward to offer the Sufi Way in new forms that fit modern needs. For Sufism is not the study of the past, or the worship of medieval saints; it is always, has ever been, evolutionary in spirit and action. The great Sufi classics of the Middle East, for instance, were once abrasively original, with new insights and information that shocked the hidebound.\na5h1 | Idries Shah has offered us many books, as many-faceted as Sufism has to be, from the reissue of these classics, to jokes from the Nasrudin corpus, to printed university lectures, to traditional stories retold in fresh and sharpened language. Learning How to Learn, and others that Shah is writing now, in a modern format, pioneer where we, in our time, face the biggest challenges: human nature itself, how to understand our behaviour and our organisations and our cultures. Shah significantly calls anthropology and psychology the infant sciences; for he holds that we have hardly begun to use these tools.\n4ahr | It is now a commonplace that in the higher reaches of physics the same language and concepts as in traditional mysticism are used; but this common ground, this frontier, extends to include the new original thinking in psychology, anthropology, the religions, esotericism. Shah would like to aid this confluence. Specifically, he is offering the Sufic viewpoint, and - more than that - making available a stock of knowledge, of information. In our lifetime we shall see - are already beginning to see - our scientists, usually the younger ones, because of their greater flexibility, approaching Shah with the question: What do you have in your possession, as part of your tradition, that we modern researchers may use, that we may have overlooked or perhaps don't even suspect exists? I have seen this happen: a simple question opening up a new field.\nfnl1 | Is it not worth our while to consider how it can have come about that what amounts to a treasure house of information, the results of centuries of research and skilled practice, can have existed so long without us being able to concede that it might be there? I am not talking about 'the secrets of the East', conceived of as something\nymgi | between Shamanism and tea-table spiritualism - what Shah dismissed as 'spills, thrills and chills'. There have always been travellers to the mystic East. 'Tell me, Master, what is the Secret?' 'Oh, you want a Secret, dear child, is that it? Well, stand on your head for a week, and chant this mantra . . . ' But those of us who have tried to approach Sufism through what is offered to us in the West seem nearly always to have gone through something like that, and had to outgrow it: it is how we have been conditioned to think. What we find in the East is not the glamorous and the mystic but an approach to humanity, both as individuals and as an organic unity, that goes far beyond our own sciences, in conception and achievement - in sophistication.\nv5n4 | How has this come about?\ndkef | For one thing, perhaps the culture we inhabit is not the advanced, open-minded culture we believe it is. Outsiders, who have always been valuable in providing insights into societies, although they are always resisted at first, judge us differently.\nu00j | We are judged as being fettered, and in many ways. We easily talk now of Western arrogance; we begin to know we are insular. But it is a slow business, for we have to contend, in the case of the Middle East and Central Asia, with the implanted results of hundreds of years of suspicion of the dreaded Saracen. This has had, still has, stultifying effects on our culture, from ignorance and bigotry about Islam, to something like this: that the symbols for the planets in astrology - Mars, Venus, Mercury and the rest - are no more than Arabic letters, easily recognisable as such to those who know Arabic. Yet we ascribe to them amazing origins. A tiny example, even an absurd one, of an enormous unmapped area. But why is it not being researched?\n8wq2 | We may go on murmuring about Western complacency, but it is another thing actually to face it. Shah instances our belief that we in the West pioneered certain psychological ideas. But the 'discoveries' of Freud and Jung are to be found in Al Ghazzali and Ibn El Arabi, who died in the twelfth century, and in other great thinkers of the time. Al Ghazzali wrote extensively about conditioning: then, as now, Sufi teachers were concerned about freeing people from social and religious indoctrinations. What happened to all that expertise? It was used. It became the property of doctors of the mind, of the soul, of the body; it has been built on, developed ... But we, in the West, have been cut off from it - are still cut off from it, and will be until we are prepared to think hard about our own mental sets.\nz6o6 | Another instance: we tell ourselves about our infinitely various and rich language. But the fact is that English is impoverished; it lacks words and concepts we need. Any writer who has tried to describe certain processes and experiences has come up against it: the absence of words. There are ways around it - analogy is one - but the problem remains. A handful of pitiful and worn terms - unconscious, soul, spirit, collective unconscious, super-mind, ego, super-ego, id, paranormal, ESP, super-nature - and suddenly, very soon, you've run into the sand. You cannot use these words for fresh experiences, new ideas, because each is loaded with unwanted associations. But other languages are not so barren; their words are not so overloaded. No, this is not an essay in disparagement of English, or in admiration of other tongues, for the sake of it, but a plea for recognition: if there is a desperate and urgent need for something, that need may be met. I hope so. Meanwhile, it is hard going. I am not a linguist, to put it mildly, but my tiniest acquaintance with Persian, for example, shows our own dreadful deprivation. But that is the language of a culture where certain kinds of spirituality were in active operation for hundreds of years. Friends who study 'primitive' cultures and know the language of American Indians, or certain African societies, say that these, too, are well supplied with concepts that we lack. Our language is probably the best of tools for technical processes, as long as technical processes are still conceived of as being restricted to the mechanical, but when they impinge on the frontiers of the mind . . .",
