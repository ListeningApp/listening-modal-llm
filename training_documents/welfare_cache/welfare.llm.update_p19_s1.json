The former governing role of the social partners in social benefits was moved to a national state agency and their major role in the PES board was 'replaced' by an advisory body. In two thousand thirteen, the social partners reached a so-called \"social agreement\" with the government, including a Jobs Agreement for people with physical or mental disabilities. In two thousand fifteen, this led to a certain return of social partners in the governance of the Dutch welfare administration, as members of the Central and Regional Work Chambers of the thirty-five Dutch labour market regions. Despite this role, their current position is much less direct and powerful than it was before two thousand two.\ny7ea | In short, divergence between current systems is expressed for both levels and stakeholders. Compared to the Netherlands, the Norwegian system has a much stronger degree of compulsory cooperation between the state and the municipalities levels. However, the role of the social partners in the governance of the activation policy is stronger in the Netherlands. Clients are represented in advisory bodies in both countries, without a direct governing role.\nnav4 | Discussion\ngem8 | In this paper we analysed whether reform trajectories in two welfare administrations reflect NPM and NPG ideas, and how the relationships between levels of government and between public and private stakeholders evolved into the current design of the welfare administrations. Three main lessons about convergence and divergence can be learned from our longitudinal study.\ne8nr | Growing convergence and hybridity in reform\nk78w | We have seen more convergence in reform paths lately but after an equally long period of strong divergence. In the first decade since nineteen ninety, both countries changed their welfare administration\ng9du | twice, and both times in different directions; we call this a 'double divergence' over time and between nations. While Champion and Bonoli perceived the NAV and SUWI reform as having similar characteristics, our findings suggest they represent different governance models: NPG ideas were prominent in the original two thousand six NAV reform, and NPM ideas are clearly reflected in the two thousand two SUWI reform. Lately we saw more convergence in reform trajectories: a joint adoption of NPM in both countries two thousand eight to twenty fourteen and a shared resurgence of NPG ideas since twenty fifteen, in line with the broader international trend towards decentralization and collaborative services. Recently both countries have again made efforts towards greater standardization and efficiency NPM. Although there seems increasing convergence in reforms between the two countries, it is early to say whether it will persist, as the period of more convergence lasts about as long as the previous divergent reforms.\nf682 | Related to the many shifts in governance since nineteen ninety, both countries have developed more hybrid and complex systems over time. Alternating NPM and post-NPM, all reforms criticized the previously dominant organization of the welfare state according to traditional hierarchy and functional differentiation. But despite their often radical character, reforms did not completely replace previous models. Although hybridity with coexisting, overlapping and partly competing elements can be viewed \"the rule rather than the exception of the new modes of governance currently being practiced in the provision of social services\", so far the frequent reforms do not indicate that the different principles of TPA, NPM and NPG are well aligned. At least more balanced combinations of public management models appear necessary to prevent hybridity in a form of barely cohesive layers. Divergence between nations and policy fields\nli1k | A second lesson is that increasing convergence in reform paths does not necessarily imply more similar welfare administrations. On the contrary, despite greater convergence in reforms since two thousand eight, the present welfare administrations in Norway and the Netherlands are more different than alike. Norway and the Netherlands thus proved to be two cases that can illustrate how a common 'activation' policy has led to significantly different welfare administrations.\npbea | Divergence usually points to the need for contextualized research as it is expected that the new welfare administrations take on a specific form due to different national socio-economic, institutional and political contexts. For example, Christensen and coauthors found \"a strong element of path dependence in the reform trajectories\" in a comparison of Germany, the United Kingdom, and Norway. Champion and Bonoli described the impact of path dependence as \"once a country has started down a path, it becomes increasingly difficult and costly to completely depart from it,\" given increasing returns on prior investments. Contrasting, in our study path dependency does not seem an obvious explanation for the different reform paths and their impact on welfare administrations. After all, path dependence would imply that the initial path is reproduced in both countries, which is very different from the radical shifts we found over the past thirty years, most prominently in NAV and SUWI.\nccpt | Also, it has been debated if economic crises and activation policies have triggered similar reform trends across countries. For example, the economic crisis since two thousand eight with the government in a strong role for saving banks could easily be viewed an important driver of common NPM-type interventions for efficiency gains in welfare administrations. It is tempting to link such an explanation to NAV's return of the benefit administration to the central level two thousand eight and SUWI's merger of UWV and CWI two thousand nine. But economic crises may also be a welcome excuse for national governments\n0fpw | rather than a driver for administrative reform - as the said shifts in NAV and SUWI were already planned in two thousand six and two thousand seven, before the banks in two thousand eight erupted. So we should be careful to give too much explanatory power to common economic pressures.\ndqn8 | To better understand governance and organizational reforms and hybrid shifts in governance regimes, we may need to delve deeper into the specificity of the policy field in which these shifts are taking place. Our study highlights important differences between the subfields in the welfare administrations. For example, there appears to be growing scope for decentralized actors and organizations in the PES, but the benefit administration shows an opposite trend towards more centralization. This might be related to the specific tasks and risks in national social insurance where decentralization could be less effective for large, automated systems and increase the risk of error. Conversely, the services provided by PES are closely tied to the local and regional labour market, and require cooperation with third parties and beyond professional borders to be effective, so here decentralization is a recurrent trend.",
