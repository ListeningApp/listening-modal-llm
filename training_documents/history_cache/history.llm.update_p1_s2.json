Excessive hyperactive, inattentive, and impulsive children have been described in the literature since the nineteenth century. Some of the early depictions and etiological theories of hyperactivity were similar to current descriptions of ADHD. Detailed studies of the behavior of hyperactive children and increasing knowledge of brain function have changed the concepts of the fundamental behavioral and neuropathological deficits underlying the disorder. This article presents an overview of the conceptual history of modern-day ADHD.\na0by | Introduction\nu1ky | The characteristic features of children and adolescents with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder are excessive motor activity, inattention, and impulsiveness.\nhtm9 | The contemporary concept of ADHD as defined in the DSM-IV-TR is relatively new. However, an analysis of historical literature suggests that children presenting with symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity have previously been described by several authors during the last two hundred years. The clinical characterizations, underlying concepts, and nomenclature of the described dysfunctions have changed over the time. Many of the historical descriptions are, however, consistent with the modern diagnostic criteria for ADHD. The present article gives an overview of the conceptual history of modern-day ADHD.\n8hul | The first example of a disorder that appears to be similar to ADHD was given by Sir Alexander Crichton in seventeen ninety-eight. Crichton was a Scottish physician who was born in Edinburgh in seventeen sixty-three. In seventeen eighty-five, he received his M.D. from the University of Leiden, The Netherlands. He then decided \"to undertake a European medical tour\" and practiced in hospitals in Paris, Stuttgart and Vienna. In his clinical practice, Crichton observed many cases of insanity and became increasingly interested in mental illness. In seventeen ninety-eight, he published \"An inquiry into the nature and origin of mental derangement: comprehending a concise system of the physiology and pathology of the human mind and a history of the passions and their effects\". In this work of three books, he demonstrated observations of clinical cases of mental illness. Up until the end\n87vz | of the eighteenth century, when Crichton published his inquiry, it was uncommon to focus on mental issues from a physiological or medical perspective. Crichton mentioned that at the time there were only two other authors who had \"written fully on the subject of Mental Diseases\".\nym66 | The second chapter of book two \"On Attention and its Diseases\" is of special interest to the present subject. Crichton begins this chapter with a definition of attention: \"When any object of external sense, or of thought, occupies the mind in such a degree that a person does not receive a clear perception from any other one, he is said to attend to it\". Crichton emphasizes that the intensity of healthy attention varies within a normal range both between individuals and even within a person at different times. A distraction of attention does not necessarily have to be pathological, e.g. mental stimuli, volition, or education can have a great impact on healthy attention. Crichton distinguishes two possibilities of abnormal inattention as the oppositional poles of pathologically increased or decreased \"sensibility of the nerves\":\nl0a3 | The morbid alterations to which attention is subject, may all be reduced under the two following heads: First. The incapacity of attending with a necessary degree of constancy to any one object.\nu8nw | Second. A total suspension of its effects on the brain. The incapacity of attending with a necessary degree of constancy to any one object, almost always arises from an unnatural or morbid sensibility of the nerves, by which means this faculty is incessantly withdrawn from one impression to another. It may be either born with a person, or it may be the effect of accidental diseases.\nl2v9 | When born with a person it becomes evident at a very early period of life, and has a very bad effect, inasmuch as it renders him incapable of attending with constancy to any one object of education. But it seldom is in so great a degree as totally to impede all instruction; and what is very fortunate, it is generally diminished with age.\nafbe | In this short description of the first alteration of attention, Crichton gives several indications that he was depicting the same disorder as defined in the current DSM-IV-TR criteria of ADHD. His characterization of the disorder as \"the incapacity of attending with a necessary degree of constancy to any one object\" is consistent with the second symptom of criterion A one, Inattention: the \"difficulty sustaining attention in tasks or play activities\". Crichton further describes\n78r8 | that \"this faculty is incessantly withdrawn from one impression to another\", which fits with a second DSM-IV-TR symptom of inattention, namely the circumstance that the patient \"is often easily distracted by extraneous stimuli\". The American Psychiatric Association furthermore determines that for the diagnosis of ADHD, the symptoms have to be present before the age of seven. Crichton also reports that the disorder can be \"born with a person\" and \"when born with a person it becomes evident at a very early period of life\". The proximate conclusion that \"it renders him incapable of attending with constancy to any one object of education\" suggests that Crichton observed school difficulties in these children, which are commonly seen in children with ADHD. Crichton states that the disorder \"generally diminished with age\". The notion that ADHD is a disorder of childhood and affected children \"grow out\" of ADHD during puberty was common until the nineteen nineties. Recent studies have shown that about fifty percent of children diagnosed with ADHD retain symptoms of ADHD into adulthood.\n320g | According to Crichton, the incapacity of attending, if not innate, can also be caused by nervous disorders. This notion was later rediscovered in the concepts of minimal brain damage or dysfunction.",
