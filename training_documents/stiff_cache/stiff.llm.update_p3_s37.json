In order to eliminate the effect of the difference of density on test results in these figures, the secant Young's modulus was normalized by dividing it by the following void ratio functions: Toyoura sand F left e right equals left two point one seven minus e right squared over one plus e, while for Quiou sand F left e right equals left three point eight two minus e right squared over one plus e.\nnwfz | In spite of a certain scatter observed at very small strain, it can be seen that the small strain secant Young's modulus E sub c of Toyoura sand is virtually the same for the four tests left E sub zero over F left e right approximately two hundred fifty megapascal, that is, it does not depend on the K e, the horizontal stress sigma sub b prime, or the OCR, being only a function of the axial consolidation stress. On the other hand, in the case of Quiou sand, the small strain secant Young's modulus of the O C specimens left E sub zero over F left e right approximately sixty to seventy megapascal is higher than that of the N C specimens left E sub zero over F left e right approximately forty to fifty megapascal. In other words, for a clean sand, such as Toyoura sand, the E sub c value is a function of the effective axial stress and is quite independent of the radial effective stress and the stress history, as already shown by Flora et al., Kohata et al., and Lo Presti et al. In the case of sand containing crushable material, such as Quiou sand, although E sub zero does not depend on the K sub c or the sigma sub h prime, it instead depends on the stress history.\nnvfy | On the other hand, at intermediate strain, it can be seen that the reduction of E sub s c in N C specimens occurs for curly E sub a larger than zero point zero zero one percent. It can be also seen that the reduction of E sub s e c in N C Quiou sand is much more pronounced than that observed for N C Toyoura sand; for example, E sub sec over E sub zero at varepsilon sub a equals zero point zero one percent is about zero point five five in the N C Toyoura specimen and is about zero point four five in the N C Quiou specimen. In the case of O C specimens, the sudden reduction of E sub sec occurs for strain levels larger than about zero point zero five percent for both sands. This experimental fact indicates that the amount of plastic deformation decreased for axial strain by as much as zero point zero five percent, as a consequence of the mechanical overconsolidation. It is said that the linear threshold strain increases according to the overconsolidation history, as reported by Jardine et al. and Tatsuoka and Kohata.\nmror | STIFFNESS NONLINEARITY\nzlxc | Empirical Fitting Equation\nk0bw | In order to evaluate the effects of the confining pressure, the stress ratio at consolidation, and the overconsolidation his-\naq5a | tory on the secant Young's modulus E sub s e c under small and intermediate strain levels, an empirical study was performed on a large number of triaxial compression test results on Toyoura, Quiou, and Ticino sands.\nsc5y | It has generally been recognized that the shear modulus of sand can be expressed by means of an empirical equation as a function of the void ratio, the confining pressure, and strain levels. For example, Iwasaki and Tatsuoka indicated that the shear modulus of clean sands obtained from resonant column and cyclic torsional tests can be expressed by\n0yab | G sub c q equals K left gamma right F left e right p prime n left gamma right (one)\n```",
