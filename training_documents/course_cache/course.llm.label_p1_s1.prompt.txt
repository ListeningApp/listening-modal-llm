You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

06yq | Microdosing with psychedelics to self-medicate for ADHD symptoms in adults: A naturalistic study
dpv6 | ARTICLE INFO
8r5j | ABSTRACT
2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

h2l3 | Scope and Objectives
dfzb | Basic differences between animals and plants
u6ty | 1. Trophism
awvu | · Plants only one trophic level; animals up to 5-7 or more levels (Predators of 6th degree)
on9b | . Algae - Copepod - Fish larvae (1) - Dragon fly larvae (2) - Tilapia (3) - Pied kingfisher (4)
a8ge | · Grass - Locust - Preying mantis (1) - Lizard (2) - Cobra (3) - Mongoose (4) - Python (5) - Leopard (6)
h27a | · The relationship between competition and predation in community structuring is far more complex for animals as these can be both prey and predators at the same time (plants are normally only prey for herbivores and few are predatory - carnivorous plants e.g. Drosera spp.) 5
pdjh | 2. Mobility
xmgs | . Generally, all plants are immobile (except for a few algae) whereas all animals are mobile (except corals and barnacles)
bd9h | · Field study of animals far more difficult due to seasonal movements, cryptic behaviour etc.
m047 | · Implications - challenges in assessing animal population dynamics (distribution, abundance, density and diversity)
gy8c | 3. Ranges
y4mj | · Animals have larger ranges than plants, especially for migratory animals
vpgq | · Spatio-temporal (circadian/ circannual) variation in animal ranges poses challenges for describing community structure and interspecific interactions
ousl | 4. Behaviour
m4ju | · Animal generally have more complex and diversified behavioural patterns (intra-/ inter- specific interaction, predation, reproduction)
a0mb | 5. Reproduction
ki8m | · Plants are immobile and reproduction is by fertilization agent (animals, wind or water)
km8w | . Many plants depend on animals for their reproduction. E.g. pollinators of pollen and dispersers of seeds
wzno | · Mobile animals actively search for reproductive partners, engage in complex courtship behaviour (e.g. vocalization, body display, pheromone attraction, building of structures such as nesting sites, mating chambers) to initiate copulation
xagm | · Immobile animals (e.g. marine corals and barnacles) reproduces in a way similar to that of plants (more passive fertilization modes)
iwn5 | 6. Dispersion
uooz | · Plants depends on agents for dispersal whereas animals disperse by themselves by virtue of their mobility
pxbq | · Good dispersers include flying organisms as well as aquatic organisms that can tolerate a broad temperature range, or highly prolific species with high population turnover
jfsr | Plant and Animal Interactions
u15r | · Plants depend on animals and vice versa
lq35 | . Examples of animal dependencies on plants: Food (Herbivory), Building materials (Nests), Roosting and shelter (Protection)
3g9w | · Examples of plant dependencies on animals: Pollination, Seed dispersal, Protection (Predators on Herbivores)
d09o | Different aspects of Animal Ecology
ylhz | · Evolutionary Ecology - Focus on how ecology and evolution are linked as inter-related processes. Ecology drives speciation/extinction which again affect community structure
a3td | · Behavioural Ecology - Focus on how ecology and behaviour is linked. Survival strategies such as Optimal Foraging and Reproductive strategies such as Semelparity/Iteroparity
ex5k | . Population Ecology - Focus on how population grow, are regulated and interaction within and between different species (Competition, Predation, Mutualism, Parasitism)
9d4o | · Community Ecology - Focus on how communities of animals are structured with groups made up of taxonomical and ecological guilds
cjq2 | · Macro-ecology: Focus on large scale (global) patterns of animal communities, spatio-temporal patterns of distribution, abundance an diversity on the Earth
5esx | ECOSYSTEM: Biotic and abiotic factors interacting in a specific area (Ghana's coastal woodland)
m5ka | Practical Implications
byu8 | · Understanding the relationship amongst niches, species, community structure and functioning;
76b0 | *Land and water - Species-area relationship, habitat heterogeneity, island biogeography models
zxz6 | Crop pests: Predator-prey relations, anti-predator strategies, invasive species ecology
xnth | Design of conservation regions - Species diversity concentrations, gradients, endemic centres
vafm | Vector control of tropical diseases - Trophic organisations and food webs, predation, competition
2zmw | * World fish stock - Food webs, predator-prey relations, invasive alien species

epu7 | OJoseph H. Connell's (1961) Tidal Barnacles (Balanus balanoides/ Chthamalus stellatus)
7od1 | Adult Chthamalus usually occur above Balanus
0bqy | · Chthamalus larvae do settle in Balanus Lower Tide Zone (LTZ)
b780 | · Adult Balanus never in high tide zones (due to desiccation)
ccmb | . Methodology - Connell suspected that adult Balanus out competed adult Chthamalus. He kept removing Balanus adult in lower zones in experimental plots in one set as well as removing Chthamalus from upper zone in another
ma93 | · Results
c6hh | 1. Removing Balanus from lower zones caused Chthamalus to survive
y7ea | 2. Balanus never settled in upper zone even as Chthamalus was removed there
nav4 | · Conclusion
gem8 | 1. Adult barnacles compete over space in lower zones
e8nr | 2. Balanus is superior (crushing Chthamalus) leaving a small realized niche (upper zone) for Chthamalus
k78w | 3. Fundamental niche of Chthamalus includes dry upper zones where Balanus cannot withstand desiccation 23

pbea | · Experimental Design
ccpt | 1. Ant-Removal Plots were sprayed with pesticides regularly
0fpw | 2. Rodent-Removal Plots were fenced and subjected to intensive trapping protocols
dqn8 | 3. Both ants and rodents removed
cop0 | 4. Control Plots with both ants and rodents present
lhkq | · Results
82ju | 1. Rodents removed - Ant colonies increase above control plots
y2qo | 2. Ants removed - Rodents densities increase above control plots
1piq | · Conclusions
7fqw | 1. As one competitor is removed the remaining increase. Density Compensation occur - Release of extra resources that is no more utilized by the removed species
rhaz | 2. Ants and rodents have overlapping limited food resource niche (seeds) over which they compete

wtfz | OPaine's (1966) starfish (Pisaster) in rocky intertidal zones of the US: Predator- mediated Coexistence
qy1i | · Picaster (a keystone predator) predates differentially on the dominant competitors (bivalves & acorn barnacles)
1k9e | · Removal of the predator showed that the more dominant competitors crowded out the inferior species (goose barnacles, limpets and chitons)
5bjs | . This reduced the total number of coexisting species from 15 to 8
