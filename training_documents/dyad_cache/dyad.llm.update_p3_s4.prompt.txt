You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

dvoe | Mao was even more hesitant to approve Kim's proposal than Stalin. Until the spring of 1949, he and his colleagues had had little interest in Korea, and they only learned about Kim's "armed unification" intentions when they met with him in April 1949. During the meeting, they expressed concern that South Korea, under the militant Syngman Rhee, who was also committed to a unified Korea, might attack the north with Japanese backing. Mao promised that were that to happen, he would send some Chinese troops to aid North Korea, and he agreed to return two ethnic Korean divisions that fought under the People's Liberation Army (PLA) to North Korea. At the same time, he warned Kim against launching any military initiative in the south. In April 1950, the last ethnic Korean division that had participated in the Chinese Civil War returned to North Korea. From a Chinese perspective, this was done to increase the North Korean defensive rather than offensive capabilities.10
677t | In light of Stalin's demand for a Chinese approval of the planned war, Kim visited Beijing in mid-May. At that time, Mao and his colleagues heard for the first time of the change in Stalin's view concerning the war, and they requested that he acknowledge that it was, indeed, the case. Stalin's telegram granting approval arrived on May 14. The Chinese leadership then reluctantly agreed to Kim's initiative, and in a meeting on May 15, Mao promised Kim that if American forces intervened in the war, the PLA would come to the KPA's assistance. Given this lukewarm Chinese support, however, Kim avoided informing the PRC about his intention to launch the 4 war until it started. Although Mao was outraged by this behavior, it did not undermine his intention to assist North Korea militarily.11
5hk6 | Concrete North Korean preparations for war had started under a heavy veil of secrecy. The KPA attack plan was ready on May 29. It aimed at the fast occupation of all of South Korea "in order to prevent the landing of the American imperialists."1" On June 11, the KPA headquarters distributed a top-secret command for a
viei | large-scale military exercise in the border area. This was the cover for the military deployment that started on June 12 and took place over the following two weeks. The division commanders received their attack orders on June 18. At the same time, Pyongyang radio announced additional conciliatory moves toward South Korea, including the release of prisoners. The deception also included public calls for a peaceful reunification and false diplomatic initiatives aimed at calming Seoul's apprehensions by demonstrating Pyongyang's goodwill, thus refuting rumors of KPA's preparations for invasion."
rk0j | Altogether, the process that led to the North Korean invasion did not include any major miscalculations. Armed unification ranked certainly at the top of Kim's order of priorities but was far less important for the USSR and the PRC. Both Stalin and Mao made this clear to Kim, but they seem to have miscalculated the war dynamics that would involve not only strategic considerations but also reputational ones. Here they seem to have made a similar mistake to the one conducted by the American policymakers on the eve of the war.
c6x9 | b. The American surprise
g5at | i. The American intelligence assets
re3j | In the period between the end of WWII and the breakout of the Korean War, the American intelligence system in the Far East was in a decrepit state. This was the outcome of deep cuts in the defense and intelligence budgets, a high level of bureaucratic competition, and a poor level of coordination among the various operating intelligence organs. Monitoring the Korean Peninsula, moreover, ranked low in the intelligence order of priorities. 4
6z45 | Collection in the Far East was mainly made by Sigint and Humint as well as some open-source intelligence (Osint). Although visual aerial reconnaissance, which proved its value during WWII, was used extensively in the Korean War itself,14 this means of collection, which could have provided good information about the deployment of the KPA forces for war, was not used until June 1950.
20af | Sigint collection was divided between a number of relatively small army, air force, and naval units. Beginning in 1949, their activity was loosely coordinated by the newly established Armed Forces Security Agency (AFSA),15 whose prime target was the USSR. Until 1948, AFSA had been "astonishingly lucky" in reading Soviet military, police, and industrial traffic. Then, based on information that was passed to the Soviets by an AFSA linguist named William Weisband who had been recruited by the KGB, the Soviet cipher systems stopped working, leaving communication intelligence (Comint), the United States' main source of collection, almost completely in the dark on the road leading to the war.16
huae | In addition, Comint collection in the Far East suffered from fundamental difficulties, such as a lack of skilled operators because of a high level of personnel turnover and a relaxed working manner that meant that interception facilities operated only five-and-a-half days a week, eight hours a day."The situation was even worse in the Korean case. Despite their being a source of concern, the US Communications Intelligence Board (USCIB) ranked Japan and Korea (with a lesser focus on Korea), number fifteen on its order of "high importance" priorities. Accordingly, when war broke out, North Korea was covered by two full-time and one part-time cyptanalyst, one linguist, and two analysts.1 4 AFSA, moreover, had no Korean dictionaries or typewriters and no books about the country.19
rblh | Given its type of regime, North Korea constituted a challenging target for Humint. This task had become even more difficult because of the cumbersome organization of the various bodies involved in this mission. Following the withdrawal of US forces in June 1949, American military assistance to the South Korean army was provided by the Korean Military Advisory Group (KMAG), which also passed information from ROK sources to the Pentagon. In addition, the United States maintained three small intelligence missions in Korea: the Korean Liaison Office (KLO), established by MacArthur's G-2, Gen. Charles Willoughby after the
gl5i | American forces left South Korea in 1949 and tasked with intelligence collection and analysis;20 the Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI); and a CIA element that was linked to the local police and intelligence services. Their main sources were the South Korean collection agencies." Although South Korean officers claim that the intelligence that they collected about the coming attack was valuable,22 there is a consensus that G-2 in Tokyo regarded it as conflicting and useless.23
