        "content": "hpi6 | Site A is a local topographic high at the northern end of the row of craters. It rises approximately ten meters above background sediments over an area of approximately one hundred by eighty meters. Chimneys and mounds are distributed around what may be a buried crater, partially covered by volcaniclastic material. The volcaniclastic cover sequence, up to thirteen point eight meters thick, is underlain by zero point seven to two point six meters of chimney talus, followed by intensely clay-altered monomictic lapillistone that is crudely bedded with both matrix-supported and clast-supported intervals, extending to the bottom of the drill holes. The northernmost drill hole, TKAD zero zero one, is located next to an active chimney complex and reaches a depth of twenty two point three meters below seafloor. The upper approximately fourteen meters consists of variably altered volcaniclastic cover material with three discrete oxidized intervals, followed by altered lapillistone. The upper part of the clay-altered lapillistone sequence is unconsolidated to poorly consolidated, with increasing cementation by anhydrite downhole, and is cut by a few anhydrite veins, two to five millimeters wide. Disseminated\n4uhb | sulfides (pyrite, sphalerite, and minor chalcopyrite, galena, covellite, and bornite) occur with anhydrite that has been partly hydrated to gypsum, both in the cement and in the vein fill. To the south of this drill hole, TKAD zero fifteen and TKAD zero twenty-seven were drilled in close proximity, approximately three meters apart, to a maximum depth of seven point three meters below seafloor, next to a partially buried chimney complex. The volcaniclastic cover is less than one meter thick and contains fragments of chimney material, likely sourced by mass wasting from nearby (unknown) chimneys. The mineralized interval is an approximately one point five to two point six meter thick layer of chimney talus. As in TKAD zero zero one, intensely clay-altered and poorly sorted lapillistone occurs below the chimney talus in both drill holes. TKAD zero twenty-eight, located approximately twenty meters east of TKAD zero fifteen/zero twenty-seven, intersected zero point five meters of volcaniclastic cover material, followed at depth by a narrow, zero point seven meter, sulfide interval dominated by barite and sphalerite at the top and becoming pyrite rich downhole. This mineralized interval appears to correlate between the drill holes. The clay-altered lapillistone at the bottom of the hole is similar but better sorted than that found in TKAD zero fifteen/zero twenty-seven. Approximately thirty meters to the east, TKAD zero twenty-nine encountered only the variably altered volcaniclastic cover material to a depth of seven point eight meters below seafloor. This drill hole is located at the edge of the low-relief cinder cone where the volcaniclastic cover is thickest.\nepyi | Site B is another crater-like feature, seventy by eighty meters, on a cone at the north end of the row of cinder cones. Chimneys and mounds occur along the crater walls and on the outer flanks of the cone and are variably covered by volcaniclastic material. Here, massive sulfide chimneys occur on top of chimney talus. At the western edge of the crater, TKAD zero sixteen intersected thin, zero point two meter, volcaniclastic cover, followed by a layer of pyritic chimney talus approximately zero point four meters thick and then poorly sorted and crudely bedded monomict, matrix-supported, and intensely clay-altered lapillistone. The upper part of the lapillistone is cemented mainly by gypsum with a few large crystals up to seven millimeters long; the lower part is mostly unconsolidated with patchy anhydrite cement that has been partially hydrated to gypsum, a few crosscutting veinlets of anhydrite, weak silicification, and disseminated sulfide minerals (pyrite with minor sphalerite near the top and minor to trace chalcopyrite near the bottom). At the southern wall of the crater, TKAD zero twenty-six intersected massive sphalerite-barite chimney material to a depth of one point four meters below seafloor. The substrate of lapillistone contains minor patchy barite cement in the upper part and anhydrite cement in the lower part, with gray-white clay alteration that generally decreases downhole. At the center of the crater, the mineralized interval of chimney talus is thicker, up to approximately three point nine meters, in TKAD zero thirteen, cemented by anhydrite-rich and clay-altered mud and fine-grained sulfide minerals. This interval was not recovered in TKAD zero twenty-five, located approximately three point six meters away, owing to poor drilling conditions. In the center of the crater, intensely clay-altered lapilli with minor disseminated sulfides occur to approximately four meters below seafloor, below which is a chaotic mixture of matrix-supported volcanic and chimney fragments. The volcanic clasts are polymict, altered and unaltered, subangular to angular, and variably infilled by late-stage silica. Several short intervals within the lapilli units contain gypsum crystals up to\ny51p | three centimeters long. On the upper rim of the volcanic cone in the east, a thin, zero point six meter, cover of unconsolidated volcaniclastic material is directly underlain by altered monomict lapillistone, with increasing sulfate cement and decreasing alteration intensity downhole to a depth of seven point four meters below seafloor. At this site, there are fewer disseminated sulfides compared to the other drill holes and decreasing sphalerite abundance downhole.\nx95m | Site C is a large volcanic cinder cone, rising to approximately seventy meters above the seafloor and with a diameter of approximately one hundred twenty by ninety meters. Chimney complexes and mounds occur on the flank of this cone in the vicinity of a circular slump feature. TKAD zero thirty-two intercepted unconsolidated volcaniclastic cover material to one point eight meters, followed by intensely altered volcaniclastic breccia to six point nine meters below seafloor. The altered sequence consists of monomict lapillistone with subrounded to subangular vesicular clasts but variable clay alteration. The uppermost lapillistone is matrix-supported with variable sulfate cement and veins and disseminated pyrite, sphalerite, and chalcopyrite, decreasing downhole. Several horizons are clast-supported, up to sixty percent clasts, with angular monomict clasts, and appear to be autobreccias. One gypsum-rich interval occurs at six point four to six point six meters below seafloor. TKAD zero thirty-three was drilled at the edge of a small crater or collapse feature near the summit of the cone. The recovered rock types are similar to those in TKAD zero thirty-two, with a transition between the volcaniclastic cover and the clay-altered footwall occurring at one point one meters below seafloor. Variable alteration intensity gives this rock a polymict appearance.",
