        "content": "b3bt | Classical electron microscopy tomography of FHV-infected Drosophila cells provided the first three-dimensional view of a positive RNA virus RC, confirming that all RC vesicles are continuous with the outer mitochondrial membrane, with a necked connection to the cytosol (Figure three a, left panel). Similarly, FHV-modified mitochondria provided the first\n0w8m | three-dimensional cryo-electron microscopy analysis of positive RNA virus RCs, revealing the RC in a near-native state and yielding striking views of the RNA and protein components of RCs, in addition to membranes (Figure three a, right panel). Among other results, spherules are densely packed with coiled filaments, matching extensive biochemical evidence that they contain FHV double-stranded RNA replication intermediates. As with alphaviruses, spherule size correlates with the length of the RNA replicated, with RNA density calculations indicating that most FHV spherules contain one double-stranded RNA.\nvcu3 | Two point one point two. Crown organization of viral RNA replication proteins at spherule necks. One stunning cryo-electron microscopy revelation was a twelve-fold symmetric, ringed, proteinaceous complex, designated the crown, above the cytosolic side of the spherule neck (Figure four a). Antibody labeling, volume calculations, and other results show that this crown consists largely if not solely of viral RNA replication protein A. Multiple advances resolved the nodavirus crown structure to approximately eight point five angstroms, revealing stacked rings of apical and basal lobes comprising a central turret with an interior floor and exterior legs. The crown interacts with the outer mitochondrial membrane both at the base of the central turret and at each leg, closely controlling the shape of the RC vesicle neck. Through these twelve-fold repeated interactions, the crown stabilizes the high-energy",
