You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

ccpt | All samples were slightly re-polished <LATEX>\left( < \sim 0 . 3 \mu m \right)</LATEX> after the initial SEM-EDS observations and then gold coated and baked at ~100℃ in the NanoSIMS air-lock system prior to the isotopic

The detailed analytical protocols and calibration methods are given in Takahata et al. (2008) and Koike et al. (2014). A 2-nA <LATEX>\mathrm { O } ^ { - }</LATEX> beam was focused with a spot size of approximately 10 um. To obtain the 238U_206Pb age, secondary ions of 31 p+, 43 Ca+, 204Pb+, 206Pb+, <LATEX>2 3 8 U ^ { 1 6 } O ^ { + } ,</LATEX> and <LATEX>{ } ^ { 2 3 8 } U ^ { 1 6 } O _ { 2 } ^ { + }</LATEX> were simultaneously collected for 600 s per spot using the NanoSIMS multi-collectors. Then, in the magnetic peak jump- ing mode, the secondary ions of <LATEX>2 0 4 P b + ,</LATEX> <LATEX>2 0 6 p b ^ { + } ,</LATEX> <LATEX>2 0 7 P b +</LATEX> measured at the same spot for ~1 h to determine <LATEX>{ } ^ { 2 0 7 } P b - { } ^ { 2 0 6 } P b</LATEX> age. A natural apatite standard from Canada (called "PRAP" in Sano et al., 1999) was used to calibrate the measured 238 U/206 Pb ratios in the <LATEX>2 0 6 p _ { D } + p ^ { 2 3 8 } U ^ { 1 6 } O ^ { + } - 2 ^ { 2 3 8 } U ^ { 1 6 } O _ { 2 } ^ { + } / ^ { 2 3 8 } U ^ { 1 6 } O ^ { + }</LATEX> diagram. The <LATEX>2 3 8 \quad U J \_ 2 0 6 P b</LATEX> and <LATEX>2 0 7 \quad P b \_ 2 0 6 P b</LATEX> isochron ages were calculated using Isoplot software (Ludwig, 2012). The isochron ages were calculated for the individual meteorites, assuming that all phosphates in one meteorite (except for Juvinas, discussed later) recorded the same history. The model <LATEX>2 0 7 p b ^ { * } / 2 0 6 p b ^ { * }</LATEX> ages were calculated for the in- dividual data, which provide in-situ thermal histories for individual analyzed areas. We assumed an initial 207/206/204 Pb composition (same to the Canyon Diablo troilite) and a specific <LATEX>2 3 8 U ^ { 2 3 5 } U</LATEX> ratio for the model <LATEX>2 0 7 p b * / 2 0 6 p b ^ { * }</LATEX> calculations, which does not affect our results and discussion. For details concerning the age calculations, see the supplementary information.
