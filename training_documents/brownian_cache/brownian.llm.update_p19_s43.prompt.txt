You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

m04y | where the subscript <LATEX>e q</LATEX> indicates the equilibrium value, and <LATEX>E _ { n }</LATEX> and <LATEX>p _ { n } \left( x \right)</LATEX> are respectively the eigenvalues and normalised eigenfunctions of the corresponding Schrödinger-like problem. Obtaining the spectrum <LATEX>E _ { n }</LATEX> and <LATEX>p _ { n } \left( x \right)</LATEX> may be complicated by the fact that the actual Schrödinger potential <LATEX>\bar { U }</LATEX> (35) can develop temperature dependent features as the temperature is decreased- see Fig. 15. Even for the simple polynomial potential in the Langevin equation it is clear that at low temperatures <LATEX></LATEX> becomes non-trivial, developing highly asymmetrical trapping wells. The increasing energy gap between the two minima indicates that, for a fixed initial condition, higher order terms in the spectral expansion can become important as the temperature is lowered.
23jk | To illustrate the importance of these higher-order terms for the two-point function evolution in the polyno- mial potential we examine the accuracy of a finite trun- cation of the spectral expansion at two temperatures, <LATEX>\Upsilon = 1 0</LATEX> and <LATEX>\Upsilon = 2</LATEX> 2, for the evolution of <LATEX>\langle x ^ { 2 } \left( t \right) \rangle ,</LATEX> ini- tializing trajectories at <LATEX>x = 1 :</LATEX> <LATEX>P \left( x , t = 0 \right) = \delta \left( x - 1 \right) .</LATEX> In
oa63 | Fig. 16 we plot the error associated with a finite trunca- tion of the spectral expansion, keeping only the first two (dashed line) or fifty (solid line) terms, at two different temperatures <LATEX>\Upsilon = 2</LATEX> (green, top curve) or <LATEX>\Upsilon = 1 0</LATEX> (blue, bottom curve). This error is computed by comparing the truncated expansion to the numerical solution of the Fokker-Planck equation. At early times, the error asso- ciated with keeping only two terms is larger than when
e3lv | 50 terms are kept, as one would expect, the discrepancy being more pronounced at lower temperatures. As the system relaxes, the contribution form the higher order terms decreases and the errors of the two truncations converge, until they are essentially indistinguishable at later times, as expected. This decay of the contribution from the higher eigenvalues occurs faster for the higher temperature, making the two-term truncation more ac- curate earlier. This observation reinforces our inference from the previous paragraph that as temperature is low- ered, higher order terms in the spectral expansion become more important for accurately describing the evolution, at least for a fixed initial condition. Crucially, this offers an explanation for why the the <LATEX>\mathrm { L P A } + \mathrm { W F R }</LATEX> offers poorer agreement as temperature is lowered since it would be ex- pected to most accurately describe circumstance where the lowest order terms in a spectral expansion dominate.
rqv6 | The relation between the spectral expansion and the
oa48 | range of validity of the effective action's derivative expan- sion is not entirely straightforward however, as it would also depend on the initial condition. The quantification of this relation would be an interesting undertaking which we leave for future work.
3fp1 | VIII. SUMMARY
557x | Collecting results scattered in the existing literature, we have recalled how Brownian motion can be formally described by a path integral involving a Euclidean Su- persymmetric action and how an effective average ac- tion functional <LATEX>\Gamma \left[ \chi \right]</LATEX> of the average position <LATEX>\chi ,</LATEX> incor- porating the effects of the fluctuating force and encod- ing all statistical properties of the process, can be cal- culated using functional Renormalisation Group (fRG) methods. We emphasised the importance of utilising the underlying symmetries of the problem, paying attention to the boundary terms which are often dropped, and showed how these can correctly incorporate any initial condition and, correspondingly, non-equilibrium evolu- tion. The fRG flow equations were written down for the first two orders of the widely used derivative expansion of the effective action, referred to as the Local Poten- tial Approximation (LPA) and Wavefunction Renormali- sation (WFR). We used a particular type of regulator, the frequency independent Callan-Symanzik regulator, for which the flow equations take on a relatively simple form, and further recalled that obtaining flow equations within the supersymmetric framework is convenient for ensuring compatibility with the Boltzmann equilibrium distribution, something that is not a priori obvious or guaranteed if one starts with the Onsager-Machlup form of the action (30) and considers it a Euclidean <LATEX>N = 1</LATEX> scalar theory in one dimension with the Schrödinger po- tential <LATEX>\bar { U } = \Upsilon / 4 V ^ { \prime \prime } - 1 / 4 \left( V ^ { \prime } \right) ^ { 2 } .</LATEX> We also reviewed how Brownian motion can be solved using a spectral expan- sion method of the Fokker-Planck (F-P) equation in a standard way.
