        "content": "0bqy | The X-ray absorption near edge spectra of purified pMMO samples exhibit a feature at eight thousand nine hundred eighty-four electron volts, attributable to a Cu one S to four P transition. This peak increases in intensity upon chemical reduction with dithionite, indicating that some of the copper ions are present as Cu two plus in purified pMMO. Treatment with hydrogen peroxide diminishes this peak, suggesting that some oxidation can occur. Complete oxidation might require turnover in the presence of a substrate. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure data for purified pMMO are best fit with two Cu-oxygen/nitrogen ligand environments, with Cu-oxygen/nitrogen distances ranging from one point nine three to two point two two angstroms. A second scattering interaction is best fit with a Cu-Cu interaction at two point five one angstroms for as-isolated pMMO and two point six five angstroms for pMMO reduced with dithionite. This Cu-Cu interaction was critical to our\n\nb780 | crystallographic model of the dicopper center because two point eight angstrom resolution data cannot necessarily resolve two copper ions at such a close distance. The extended X-ray absorption fine structure data also support the presence of exogenous ligands because the coordination number of two to four for the oxygen/nitrogen ligands exceeds the two nitrogen ligands coordinated to each copper ion in the crystal structure. Furthermore, the pMMO extended X-ray absorption fine structure resembles that of dicopper model compounds, in which the copper ions are four- and five-coordinate.\n\nccmb | Possible Oxidation States. When the spectroscopic data are taken together with the structure, they suggest several possible schemes for the oxidation states of the pMMO metal centers. We consider these scenarios in the context of three findings: all pMMO samples, including those from M. trichosporium O B three b and M. capsulatus, strain M, exhibit a type two Cu two plus signal that disappears upon reduction, extended X-ray absorption fine structure data indicate an increase in the Cu-Cu distance upon reduction, and as-isolated pMMO contains a mixture of Cu one plus and Cu two plus. An additional consideration, on the basis of the sequence\n\nma93 | conservation of the metal ligands, is that the mononuclear copper center observed in the M. capsulatus, Bath, pMMO crystal structure may not be conserved in pMMOs from other methanotrophs. A caveat to this discussion is that, although the extended X-ray absorption fine structure samples did not photoreduce during data collection, we cannot exclude the possibility of instantaneous photoreduction upon exposure to X-rays, which would complicate a comparison of electron paramagnetic resonance and extended X-ray absorption fine structure data.",
