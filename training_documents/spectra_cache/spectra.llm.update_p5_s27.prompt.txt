You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

43ia | Formed as a result of reaction 1, the excited water molecule can react by processes 3, 4, and 11 or with the unexcited water molecules, the concentration of which inside the cavitation bubble is high enough (see above). In the last case the energy can transform very effectively ("resonant quenching"). In addition, water molecules quench the excited states of hydroxyl radical37
3g2y | <LATEX>O H ^ { * } \left( ^ { 2 } \Sigma ^ { + } \right) + H _ { 2 } O \rightarrow O H \left( ^ { 2 } T I \right) + H _ { 2 } O + q</LATEX> (14)
gc7v | Thus, the total scheme (simplified of course) of chemical reactions inside the cavitation bubble, which lead to SL, in the presence of noble gas can be presented as follows:
wqfv | Spectra of Water Sonoluminescence
j30a | It is necessary to include also in this scheme reactions 5-8 and 14. It is seen from scheme 15 that the rate of luminescence quenching of H2O* and OH* species increases with the increase of water molecules concentration. This diminishes the total SL light emission and changes the spectra: the intensity of a short- wave part of the spectrum decreases more significantly as the "resonant quenching" is usually more effective. The difference in the spectra of water SL at high and low frequency is explained by SL quenching.16
7bdk | The proposed scheme may be seen strained. Actually, we did not find in the literature the experimental data on the formation and the emission of H2O *. M molecules, although the vibrational excited H2O.Ar van der Waals molecules are described.43 On the other hand, this propostion can easily explain the observed phenomena.
fim0 | Following the thermal theory of sonoluminescence and sonochemical reactions, the maximal temperature inside the bubble and, consequently, the yield of excited species must be at the stage of maximal compression, that is, at Rmin. However, the experimental results show that SL is over before Rmin is reached. This fact cannot be explained by thermal conductivity of the bubble content, as the maximum temperature is not yet achieved, but it can be the consequence of the processes of luminescence quenching. The number of collisions per particle for the time == 10-10 s is around 103, and the concentration of excited species is small (see above). The atoms of inert gas are not effective in the reactions of energy transformation, but it takes only a few collisions for water molecules in these processes. For larger molecules the energy transformation processes are more effective. For example, the SL spectra of potassium lines in octanol solutions are much broader than in the water solution, and the lifetime of the excited state of K atoms is around 0.05 ps.25
ojro | It has been shown recently6 that the time of SL flash decreases from 150 to 50 ps as the bulk temperature of water increases from 10 to 22 °C. This result can be explained by the increase of the rate of SL quenching as a consequence of the increase of water vapor concentration inside the bubble with the increase of bulk solution temperature. Actually, the lower the bulk solution temperature, the lower the vapor pressure inside the bubble and the lower the rate of sonoluminescence quenching. In this case the stationary state between the rates of excited species formation and the rates of SL quenching is achieved later, closer to the minimal size of a bubble. In addition, the rate of sonoluminescence quenching is lower at bulk solution temperature of 10 °C, so SL diminishes with time not as fast as in the case of the "more vaporous" bubble. Thus, the total SL intensity is much higher and the time of SL flush is longer at 10 °C.
l6t9 | Reactions of the Hydrogen Peroxide Formation. Next we shall consider shortly the chemical reactions inside or outside the cavitation bubble, which produce or destroy hydrogen peroxide.
1ujy | Hydrogen peroxide is formed by the recombination inside the bubble or in the liquid after the end of bubble compression:
qzor | OH + OH- (M) · H2O2 (16)
a0by | The reaction
u1ky | H + OH (M) H2O

8hul | can compete with the recombination (16) as the ratio of the rate constants of the respective reactions k17/k16 ~ 4,44 where k16 and k17 are the rate constants of reactions 16 and 17, respectively. Note that the excited hydroxyl radicals OH* can also take part in these reactions. Formed hydrogen peroxide can be destroyed by high temperature inside the bubble

78r8 | or react with hydrogen peroxide HO2 + H2O2 -> H2O + O2 + OH
320g | (22)
tp8g | Reactions 19-22 in the solution become observable at high enough concentrations of hydrogen peroxide and for a long time of ultrasound exposures. In this case the yield (time) (Y(H2O2)- (t)) dependency deviates from the linear one. We neglected the reactions of hydrogen peroxide destruction in the solution as we were working at short time of exposures on the linear part of yield (time) curves. Note also that we took into account only the concentration of OH radicals that avoided recombina- tion (17).
gxfd | Following ref 45, around 80% of original OH radicals recombine by process 17. So, the ratio of total number of original OH radicals to the number of radicals avoiding recombination (17) should be around 5:1. If we assume that OH radicals are formed, basically, by reactions (3a)-(4a), i.e., the number of original OH radicals corresponds to the number of photons emitted by OH* radicals, then the ratio obtained in this paper of OH*/OH ~ 5.6 (see Table 1 for xenon-water vapors filled cavitation bubble) agrees well with the results of ref 45. This is the maximum value for that ratio, as we did not consider the processes of sonoluminescence quenching of OH* radicals.
s2v1 | At high temperatures inside the bubble the reaction of H atoms with H2O molecule can increase the yield of OH radicals:46

9g22 | formation of OH radicals is the destruction of water molecules by reactions 1-4. At higher temperatures reaction 23 plays a dominant role and produces an additional quantity of OH radicals.47 There were considered 21 chemical reactions influencing the yield of OH radicals inside the cavitation bubble at the time of its implosion. Unfortunately, the mechanism of the excited species reactions inside the cavitation bubble was not considered in ref 47.
41fx | Thus, the mechanism of formation and chemical reactions of excited particles and radicals is very complex, and it can change depending on the conditions inside the bubble at the time of its compression. We did not consider in detail all the possible processes as, first, the mechanism of reactions and the type of the species formed are not clear, and, second, the calculation of temperature inside the bubble at high amplitude of its pulsation is complicated.47
