INTRODUCTION\nsb1e | Since the mid-two thousands, economists in both academia and development multilaterals have drawn increasing attention to the middle-income trap, especially in Southeast Asia and Latin America. Their writings have been valuable in identifying and defining the trap, in exploring its proximate sources (especially productivity slowdowns), in recommending policy remedies (such as improvements in human capital), and in highlighting the importance of broad political coalitions to implement such remedies. Why then-if experts and leaders are aware of the weaknesses of their economies, if they can identify the policies required to improve productivity, and if they recognize the need for broad support and engagement-has it been so difficult to move forward? In probing this question, we find that the existing analyses simply do not explain precisely why there is a trap. We propose that one answer to the puzzle is to get at how today's middle-income economies are different from their predecessors. And yet, as Shekhar Aiyar and colleagues conclude in their survey of the debate, \"there is virtually no theory about why and how middle-income economies may be\nw2yn | six hundred nine\nap6l | different.\" In our view, the absence of such a theory reflects the neglect of the political economy bases of the middle-income trap. To address this considerable gap, we argue for a deeper appreciation of the challenges inherent in upgrading policies, of the institutions required to address these challenges, and, most critically, of the political obstacles to developing such institutions.\niest | Among those writing about the middle-income trap, most agree on defining it as an extensive period of middle-income limbo, especially in contrast to earlier developers. Jesus Felipe, Arnelyn Abdon, and Ustav Kumar label countries stuck in the MI trap as those remaining in the income range of two thousand dollars to seven thousand five hundred dollars for over twenty-eight years or within a range of seven thousand five hundred dollars to eleven thousand five hundred dollars for more than fourteen years, or in middle income for a total of forty-two years (the median number of years earlier developers spent in middle income). We use these basic criteria to identify countries in the MI trap. Others find growth slowdowns since nineteen sixty to be more frequent in middle-income than in low- or high-income countries. Of one hundred and one middle-income economies in nineteen sixty, only thirteen had graduated to high income by two thousand eight. Today's middle-income countries are caught in a developmental nutcracker, \"unable to compete with low-income, low-wage economies in manufactured exports and unable to compete with advanced economies in high-skill innovations.\" There is also agreement that the trap reflects a slowdown in productivity growth as economies exhaust the gains from moving into middle-income status.\ncox8 | The emphasis on the need for productivity growth translates into broad agreement among economists on many of the policies needed to get out of the MI trap. These include more and better education (especially higher and technical), greater savings and better investment, better infrastructure, and more innovation and R and D. Views diverge on whether targeted industrial policies should be added to the mix, but\nppqi | this debate does not detract from the consensus on the list of policies above. Nor is there disagreement on the need for institutional strengthening, especially better administrative capacity to deliver public services and economic regulation.\noxou | Most studies of the MI trap-often drawing on the experiences of latecomers such as Finland, Ireland, Singapore, and South Korea-recognize the need for some minimal political requisites for enacting necessary policies, although that is rarely their primary focus. These requisites include political will, long time horizons on the part of political leaders, broad societal consensus, business-government collaboration, and some degree of inclusive politics.\n495n | Beyond these areas of agreement, the scholarship on the MI trap suffers from serious gaps. One is the lack of systematic attention to the difficulties inherent in the prescribed policies. Measures designed to improve local technological capacities, such as vocational training, R and D, or standards and testing, are in crucial ways much more challenging than many of the earlier investment-driven growth policies focused largely on the accumulation and mobilization of capital that helped countries move out of low-income to middle-income status. Subsequent upgrading of policies to get beyond MI and move closer to technological frontiers takes more time to implement, requires the participation of more actors (for example, teachers or trainers), and demands more technical and site-specific information. These features, in other words, necessitate more sophisticated institutional arrangements. In addition, as we discuss below, graduating to HI is more difficult in the twenty-first century than it was in the past century.\nawri | Most central to this article is the lack of scholarly attention to institutional origins. Few ask what would motivate key actors to coordinate. Why would self-interested political and economic elites expend scarce resources to construct the complex institutions required to implement initiatives in areas such as technical education and R and D? Which groups are most likely to take the lead in demanding upgrading and related institutions? Who are the likely coalition partners? That is, are politics-reflected in relations among key societal actors-in MI countries in fact less amenable to building the consensus economists advocate than were politics in other stages or trajectories of development?\nbl28 | Our answer to this last question is affirmative. The conditions that facilitated or accompanied the earlier ascension to MI status, such as\nd5bz | six hundred eleven\nap5o | foreign investment, low-skilled and low-paid work, inequality, and informality, over time generated cleavages that impeded subsequent upgrading policies and building the institutions necessary to implement them. What makes exiting the trap difficult is the institution-intensive nature of the required policy solutions combined with weak societal demand for such institutions.\n7zvf | The main political obstacle to institution building is the fragmentation of social groups and the resulting absence of strong upgrading coalitions. Growth trajectories on the way to MI status fractured the groups, especially business and labor, which are the core potential constituencies for a coalition that could take the big leap. Broadly put, big business is split between foreign and domestic firms, labor is divided between formal and informal sectors, and societies overall are riven by high inequality. These cleavages splinter interests and make coalition building more difficult.\nmov9 | These arguments reflect an expansion of our comparative lens beyond the small number of developmental states that successfully made the leap from middle-income to high-income status-especially countries like Finland, Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan-to those countries that have not made the leap. Much of the scholarship on the successes concentrated on the institutions of developmental states such as their professionalized, Weberian bureaucracies, \"pilot\" agencies, and close business-government collaboration. But this scholarship is limited by the range of institutions it addresses and, most critically, by a neglect of coalitional underpinnings. Focusing on the countries that have not made the leap alerts us to the underlying structural obstacles to forming the broad coalitions needed for institution building. As such, the implications of our arguments go beyond the study of the MI trap to address the shortcomings of what has become an apolitical institutionalist hegemony in development studies and practice.\nks7m | The article proceeds as follows: Section two examines the significant institutional challenges facing MI countries through the examples of human capital and investment in R and D. Section three turns to the sociopolitical obstacles to addressing these and other institutional challenges by exploring social cleavages, especially those created by inequality, foreign direct investment, and informality. Section four illustrates the fractious interests of groups in MI politics in the crucial case of education reform. Section five then broadens the comparative analysis and includes China as well. Section six concludes with some practical and theoretical\nw1w1 | six hundred twelve\n```",
