You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

colo | TACOTRON: TOWARDS END-TO-END SPEECH SYN- THESIS
d6r4 | ABSTRACT
9mrz | A text-to-speech synthesis system typically consists of multiple stages, such as a text analysis frontend, an acoustic model and an audio synthesis module. Build- ing these components often requires extensive domain expertise and may contain brittle design choices. In this paper, we present Tacotron, an end-to-end genera- tive text-to-speech model that synthesizes speech directly from characters. Given <text, audio> pairs, the model can be trained completely from scratch with ran- dom initialization. We present several key techniques to make the sequence-to- sequence framework perform well for this challenging task. Tacotron achieves a 3.82 subjective 5-scale mean opinion score on US English, outperforming a pro- duction parametric system in terms of naturalness. In addition, since Tacotron generates speech at the frame level, it's substantially faster than sample-level au- toregressive methods.
pk06 | INTRODUCTION 1
7wn9 | Modern text-to-speech (TTS) pipelines are complex (Taylor, 2009). For example, it is common for statistical parametric TTS to have a text frontend extracting various linguistic features, a duration model, an acoustic feature prediction model and a complex signal-processing-based vocoder (Zen et al., 2009; Agiomyrgiannakis, 2015). These components are based on extensive domain expertise and are laborious to design. They are also trained independently, so errors from each component may compound. The complexity of modern TTS designs thus leads to substantial engineering efforts when building a new system.
wcd0 | There are thus many advantages of an integrated end-to-end TTS system that can be trained on <text, audio> pairs with minimal human annotation. First, such a system alleviates the need for laborious feature engineering, which may involve heuristics and brittle design choices. Second, it more easily allows for rich conditioning on various attributes, such as speaker or language, or high-level features like sentiment. This is because conditioning can occur at the very beginning of the model rather than only on certain components. Similarly, adaptation to new data might also be easier. Finally, a single model is likely to be more robust than a multi-stage model where each component's errors can compound. These advantages imply that an end-to-end model could allow us to train on huge amounts of rich, expressive yet often noisy data found in the real world.
caos | TTS is a large-scale inverse problem: a highly compressed source (text) is "decompressed" into audio. Since the same text can correspond to different pronunciations or speaking styles, this is a particularly difficult learning task for an end-to-end model: it must cope with large variations at the signal level for a given input. Moreover, unlike end-to-end speech recognition (Chan et al., 2016)
qrvy | or machine translation (Wu et al., 2016), TTS outputs are continuous, and output sequences are usually much longer than those of the input. These attributes cause prediction errors to accumulate quickly. In this paper, we propose Tacotron, an end-to-end generative TTS model based on the sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) (Sutskever et al., 2014) with attention paradigm (Bahdanau et al., 2014). Our model takes characters as input and outputs raw spectrogram, using several techniques to improve the capability of a vanilla seq2seq model. Given <text, audio> pairs, Tacotron can be trained completely from scratch with random initialization. It does not require phoneme-level alignment, so it can easily scale to using large amounts of acoustic data with transcripts. With a simple waveform synthesis technique, Tacotron produces a 3.82 mean opinion score (MOS) on an US English eval set, outperforming a production parametric system in terms of naturalness1.
pn9j | 2 RELATED WORK
1pmc | WaveNet (van den Oord et al., 2016) is a powerful generative model of audio. It works well for TTS, but is slow due to its sample-level autoregressive nature. It also requires conditioning on linguistic features from an existing TTS frontend, and thus is not end-to-end: it only replaces the vocoder and acoustic model. Another recently-developed neural model is Deep Voice (Arik et al., 2017), which replaces every component in a typical TTS pipeline by a corresponding neural network. However, each component is independently trained, and it's nontrivial to change the system to train in an end-to-end fashion.
5z6q | To our knowledge, Wang et al. (2016) is the earliest work touching end-to-end TTS using seq2seq with attention. However, it requires a pre-trained hidden Markov model (HMM) aligner to help the seq2seq model learn the alignment. It's hard to tell how much alignment is learned by the seq2seq per se. Second, a few tricks are used to get the model trained, which the authors note hurts prosody. Third, it predicts vocoder parameters hence needs a vocoder. Furthermore, the model is trained on phoneme inputs and the experimental results seem to be somewhat limited.
yeoh | Char2Wav (Sotelo et al., 2017) is an independently-developed end-to-end model that can be trained on characters. However, Char2Wav still predicts vocoder parameters before using a SampleRNN neural vocoder (Mehri et al., 2016), whereas Tacotron directly predicts raw spectrogram. Also, their seq2seq and SampleRNN models need to be separately pre-trained, but our model can be trained

99fo | The backbone of Tacotron is a seq2seq model with attention (Bahdanau et al., 2014; Vinyals et al., 2015). Figure 1 depicts the model, which includes an encoder, an attention-based decoder, and a post-processing net. At a high-level, our model takes characters as input and produces spectrogram frames, which are then converted to waveforms. We describe these components below.
