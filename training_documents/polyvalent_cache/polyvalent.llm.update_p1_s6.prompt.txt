You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

xjyk | Determination of the Dissociation Constant for Polyvalent Receptors Using ELISA: A Case of M13 Phages Displaying Troponin T-Specific Peptides
mt0f | ■ INTRODUCTION
awab | Proteins are one of the most fundamental compounds that build living organisms. Various side chains of amino acids (mers in these biopolymers) enable multiple intra- and intermolecular interactions such as the Coulombic and van der Waals forces and aromatic T-T and ion-mediated salt bridges. Interactions between proteins are combinations of several attractive and repulsive forces between chemical groups of amino acids oriented properly to maximize attractive forces and minimize repulsive ones. Protein interactions often result in a conformational change in the tertiary protein structure, which regulates enzyme activity, opening channels or enabling motor activity. Understanding these interactions and their description measurably and comparably is a continuous aim of biochemistry and molecular biology.
ixcc | The reaction dissociation constant is widely used to describe the strength of interactions between biomolecules. In the biochemical convention, as opposed to in physical chemistry, Ka is presented with a unit (usually mole per liter with an appropriate prefix). Typical values of Ka of immunological complexes are usually in the nanomolar or micromolar range. Generally, Ka is determined using surface plasmon reso- nance." But there are also other kinetic-based methods which are applied for Ka determination, like bio-layer interferom- etry," 1,3,4 fluorescence correlation microscopy, thermal shift assay, nuclear magnetic resonance, gel chromatography,8 and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. .9
8p6h | Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was initially proposed as an alternative to radioimmunosorbent test to examine antigen-antibody interactions.10-12 Later, this technique was developed and applied to the study of varied molecular interactions.In general, ELISA exhibits a low limit of detection, especially in its sandwich-like variant." There are a few variants of ELISA; the simplest are direct, indirect, sandwich, and reverse types. Nevertheless, thanks to a wide range of commercially available antibodies and kits, setting up an ELISA experiment is very flexible nowadays. In a typical ELISA, the signal (target-ligand binding) is amplified only by an enzymatic reaction. However, when M13 phages are used, the signal is amplified twice. Every five pIII-displayed ligands may interact with the target, and the binding of one phage particle via single ligand-target interaction provides about 2000 particles of pVIII protein (per virion) ready to be detected by secondary antibodies. In this way, phages provide about 10 000 fold (4 orders of magnitude) amplification of the signal, enabling detection of such a low phage amount as about
pmgl | 108 plaque-forming units (pfu, the corresponding molar concentration of virions is about 10-13 M) administered into ELISA assay. ELISA may also be applied to study affinity between target and phage-displayed ligand (e.g., peptide).13-18
90no | Indeed, the difference between monovalent binding affinity and multivalent binding avidity is well-known in the literature. However, in the case of phage-ligand complexes, the interactions between phage and ligands were described as 1:1 stoichiometry complexes, while they should be treated as polyvalent receptor-ligand systems, as presented in these studies. Antibodies are not monovalent because IgG and IgA immunoglobulins contain two active sites (antigen-binding sites), whereas IgM contains ten active sites exposed on the pentamer of dimers. Their ability to bind antigens is called avidity as opposed to affinity, which refers to the interactions between one antigen and one antigen-binding site. Omitting polyvalency of the receptor may lead to mistakes in the determination of the dissociation constant.19 The formation of non-covalent immunological (and immunological-like) com- plexes between peptides and proteins may be discussed as a reversible reaction, and a qualitative description could be presented based on chemical equilibrium laws.2021 To the best of our knowledge, the mathematical model presented here is the first which enables the calculation of Ka (affinity) from ELISA under the assumption of phage polyvalency. However, the proposed model does not take into account the variability of the valency of M13 phage particles. The number of pIII protein copies per virion depends on several parameters. Empirically determined pIII number varies between studies according to the applied methodology." V 22 - 25
jt0y | As Ka is widely used to express the strength of interaction between proteins, it may be used to describe the strength of target protein binding by phage-derived peptides obtained via phage display. This technique is based on the application of genetically modified bacteriophages (like the Escherichia coli M13 bacteriophage) exposing artificial amino acids sequences on their coat proteins.2 A mixture of various variants of exposed peptides (called a library) may be screened for variants with desired properties like binding to a target protein. Within our studies, we have obtained a specific peptide as a selective receptor for human cardiac troponin T (TnT). We tried to measure the strength of the interaction between phage- exposed peptide and TnT via ELISA. However, we found a gap in the literature devoted to studying the interactions between ligands and polyvalent receptors, especially discussing their mathematical and physicochemical basis. Troponin T (TnT), next to troponin C (TnC) and troponin I (TnI), is part of the troponin complex that plays an essential role in muscle contraction.2 Even though the troponin complex is present in skeletal and cardiac muscle (but not in smooth muscle), cardiac isoforms of TnT and TnI are tissue-specific and may be distinguished from their skeletal isoforms. These two troponins are released into the bloodstream from myocytes for several reasons, e.g., after long-lasting ischemia of the muscle region.2 Increased concentration of cardiac troponins is one of the fundaments of the fourth universal definition of myocardial infarction approved by several renowned cardiol- ogist associations.29 Therefore, recognizing cardiac markers (TnT or TnI) in a highly efficient and selective manner is important for diagnosing myocardial infarction. Determination of Ka of isolated peptides enables a qualitative description of their affinity against TnT and, thus, the possibility of application in sensing devices.
qb7o | This paper proposes a mathematical model of interactions occurring during ELISA between a ligand (troponin T) and a non-monovalent receptor (M13 bacteriophage particle expos- ing TnT-specific peptides). The provided equations enable the calculation of the dissociation constant from ELISA experi- ments with the critical impact of polyvalency of a phage, which was not discussed in any publications previously. The applied method may also cover other systems where monovalent molecules interact with multiple active sites of receptor-like natural antibodies. In addition, the interaction between phage- displayed peptides and TnT molecules was discussed according to their chemical structures.
oae5 | ■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
s0fl | Mathematical Model. The reaction between TnT and phage-displayed peptide may be treated as a reversible non- covalent complex formation. 20,21,30 According to the induced fitting model, the interaction between the ligand and its binding site on the protein surface requires energy to deform structures and fit them in proper orientation and distance.20 However, if the interaction is strong enough, the energy released during the process of complex formation is higher than the energy required for complex dissociation. The reaction scheme of a reversible complex formation may be written as eq 1.
