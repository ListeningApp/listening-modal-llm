        "content": "knw2 | First-order differential operators Lextra equals GTVr, with G: X maps to R d such that div(Gyo) equals zero. The latter condition ensures that three point two is satisfied since Lextra equals negative GTV. r;\nmxnw | Second-order differential operators of the form Lextra equals negative delta star dz i or more generally negative delta Dijox i for some nonnegative function Dij: X maps to R positive. In the case Cextra equals negative delta x delta x;, the operator is self-adjoint, i.e. Cextra equals L'extra, so that three point two is easily seen to hold. For Lextra equals negative delta g Dijox i, it holds that Lextra equals negative delta g Dijox i, which also satisfies three point two.\nbdx4 | Third. First-order differential operators with nontrivial zero order parts, such as Lextra equals zero star equals delta x U minus delta x i for yo of x equals e to the power of negative U of x. Through some abuse of notation, we use delta r U to denote the multiplication operator by the function delta z U. These operators satisfy Lextra equals zero x star, so that three point two holds.\nl01c | The class of extra forcings outlined in items one and two can be easily implemented and realized in Monte-Carlo simulations. Implementing forcings of the form described in item three, however, requires some extra work to take care of the multiplication operator, as we now discuss.\nyphh | We denote the class of extra forcings described in item three as Feynman-Kac forcings, as sampling the dynamics requires the use of the Feynman-Kac formula due to the nontrivial zero order term. Consider the general dynamics two point one with generator two point two, as presented in Section two point one point one. Suppose that the dynamics has a unique invariant probability measure with density yo of x equals e to the power of negative U of x. The perturbed dynamics with generator Ln, a equals Lo plus n times open bracket C phys plus a C extra close bracket, with C extra equals TV* for some vector in R d, can be sampled by evolving the SDE\n3yor | dX t equals b of X t plus nF of X t minus na delta s times dt plus o of X t dW t,\nf9sc | and weighting trajectories with the Feynman-Kac weight\no5l0 | W t equals exp na integral over open bracket V U of X s close bracket ds.\nc1wq | In practice, this is done by evolving multiple replicas of the system with independent Brownian motions, and using resampling strategies to prevent the weights from degenerating.\ngr2b | From an analytical point of view, items one and two fit in the framework of Section two. Item three, however, does not directly fit in the framework of Section two. This is due to the fact that the steady-state measure of the dynamics with generator Ln, a equals Lo plus n times open bracket C phys plus Timex close bracket is not a probability measure in general. This is\njkky | EXTENDING LINEAR RESPONSE WITH SYNTHETIC FORCINGS\n7vxr | the case only if the weights W t are renormalized. At the level of generators, this amounts to shifting the spectrum of Ln, a by An, a, where An, a is the nonzero real principal eigenvalue of the operator Ln, vector (see) references therein. The magnitude of An, vector can be made precise in terms of a and n for n small, and turns out to be of order O of n squared for n small, as formally derived in Appendix A.\nqzyn | Of course, by linearity, one can consider linear combinations of these extra forcings. In the next two sections, we give specific examples of each of the three classes of extra forcings discussed here for both overdamped and underdamped Langevin dynamics.\nrcl1 | Three point two point two. Overdamped Langevin dynamics. We start by outlining some examples of synthetic forcings for the overdamped Langevin dynamics introduced in Section two point one point two. We consider successively the distinct classes of extra forcings following the general presentation of Section three point two point one.\n9qpf | Example three point one (Divergence-free vector field). We consider a first-order differential operator\ny5cx | C extra equals GTV,\nhexk | where G: X maps to R d is such that\nc05v | div open bracket G of q e to the power of negative V of q close bracket equals zero.\n1ytq | The resulting dynamics with the addition of C extra is\ntkax | d q t equals negative V V of q plus nF of q t plus anG of q t dt plus V two dW t.\n6mpz | β\nbi1x | Condition div open bracket G of q e to the power of negative V of q close bracket equals zero can be rewritten as div of G equals BGVV. This equality is satisfied when G is both divergence-free and orthogonal to VV, which is the situation considered. For instance, in any dimension d greater than two, with A an arbitrary anti-symmetric matrix, one possible choice for G is\nbnve | G equals A VV.\n7gvc | As can be generalized to G equals some smooth, compactly supported function of V A V V. More generally, any divergence-free vector field in dimension d can be written as G equals VU one cross ... cross VU a minus one, where U i are scalar functions, a form which was used. Thus, more generally, G satisfies the divergence condition if and only if it is of the form\njf19 | G equals VU one cross ... cross VU a minus one times e to the power of negative V.\n6hx6 | For the one-dimensional dynamics, the only divergence-free vector field is G of q equals e to the power of negative V of q. Of course, drifts such as the previous may not be used as such in the dynamics when the position space is unbounded, as it is not clear whether the dynamics is well-posed because of the factor e and when it is, whether it admits a unique invariant probability measure. Moreover, Assumption four may not hold.\nxcql | Example three point two (Modifying the fluctuation-dissipation relation). One possible choice for extra perturbations involving second-order derivatives is\nxcxb | C extra equals negative delta inverse V V T V q equals delta inverse four q minus V V T V q.\nci51 | L n, a equals C o plus n open bracket C phys plus a C extra close bracket equals one plus a n C o plus n phys.\njaj7 | The dynamics associated with L n, Q reads\nuc0w | d q t equals negative one plus a n V V of q t plus n F of q t dt plus one half times one plus a n\n494y | dW t.\n5whs | This amounts to increasing the magnitude of the terms involved in the fluctuation-dissipation as n increases when Q is greater than zero. Note that, in order for this perturbation to be admissible, we require that one plus a n is greater than zero.\nkigc | More generally, one could consider extra forcings of the form negative V star D of q V for some D: X maps to R d cross d with values in the space of symmetric matrices, possibly with D constant.\nk5st | Example three point three (Feynman-Kac forcing). This choice, although it showcases great promise and potential in extending the linear regime, as we will demonstrate in Sections four point two and four point three, is not practical to be simulated by a single long realization of the dynamics as the weights degenerate, rendering the simulation inefficient. Its general form is\nd8e8 | C extra equals TV* equals the sum of delta g, from i equals one to d\ngb7b | for some vector in R d. The generator Lo plus n times open bracket Lphys plus QLextra close bracket is the sum of first and second-order differential operators and a weight. Its stochastic representation corresponds to evolving the SDE\njxu0 | d q t equals negative V V of q t plus nF of q t minus a n times g dt plus one half β dW t,",
