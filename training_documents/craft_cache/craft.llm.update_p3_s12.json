        "content": "otkr | In terms of similarities, the authors identify and define key constructs very early in most of these articles, typically either in the introduction or in the first formal section. This is most noticeable in several of the headings of the first sections: \"Defining Social Capital,\" \"What is Management Innovation?,\" \"Defining Creative Deviance,\" and \"What Intuition Is: Bringing Together Intuitive Processes and Outcomes.\"\nibgs | As noted above, all the articles have a discussion and/or conclusion section. In addition to bringing the manuscript to a close and offering implications for future research, in many cases the authors also offer suggestions for managerial practice, recalling Lewin's oft-cited statement about the practicality of good theory.\ncolo | ILLUMINATING THE PATH: PROPOSITIONS AND OTHER TOOLS\nd6r4 | In his editorial advice about writing theory, Kilduff argued that while some approaches to theory development lend them-\n9mrz | selves to propositions, others do not; indeed, in many cases, propositions may be more distracting than helpful. It is an interesting exercise to study how the authors use propositions, as well as other techniques, to advance their ideas in the award-winning articles. Among the ten Best Articles, in five the authors communicate their theoretical contribution quite effectively without any formal propositions, using other means to accomplish the objectives of the paper. Among the five, one article focuses on conceptual synthesis across disciplines and theoretical perspectives, one presents an analytic classification scheme, one is an essay on the self-fulfilling nature of theory, one focuses on defining and illustrating a process, and one utilizes a summary of configurations and theoretical examples, as well as figures. Of those articles that contain propositions, four develop comprehensive sets of propositions; three of these relate to theoretical models aimed at predicting organizational outcomes (innovation and adaptation, organizational actions, creative products) and one predicts individual decision-making effectiveness. The remaining article primarily uses a formal model with a theorem and formal proof to communicate its main insights but also offers an example proposition that illustrates one of the cases derived from the model.\npk06 | Among the articles in which the authors do use propositions, there are important similarities. First, the propositions themselves are clearly worded, using the same terminology as is used in the rest of the paper, and they describe the expected direction (positive or negative) of relevant relationships. Many of the propositions in these articles are fairly complex and lengthy; therefore, clarity is especially critical. Further, moderating relationships are identified as such, and the effects of moderators on underlying relationships are clearly explained in the propositions. One final observation is that the propositions are an organic part of the article and have a logical and coherent flow. By \"organic\" I mean that the logical arguments in the article build to each proposition and that the\n7wn9 | series of arguments and propositions appears in the text this way, rather than as a lengthy discourse followed by a list of propositions all \"orphaned\" together on the last page of the manuscript. A quick way to check for logical and coherent flow is to simply read through the paper from one proposition to the next. Are they consistently worded? Taken together do they tell a story that fits with the manuscript's theoretical model as described in the paper and/or figure(s)?\nwcd0 | ACCESSORIZING: THE USE OF TABLES AND FIGURES\ncaos | With the exception of the essay, the ten award-winning articles all include at least one figure or table. Many of the articles illustrate conceptual constructs and relationships using boxes and arrows models, although not all of them use formal propositions to describe those relationships. Makadok and Coff include a figure illustrating a three-dimensional taxonomy of governance forms, to which they refer frequently. Birkinshaw also use a figure to illustrate a process framework. And in their paper on the role of time in the conceptualization of causal relationships, Mitchell and James use a variety of graphs and figures to convey their arguments. In several of the articles the authors use tables to summarize the defining elements of a typology or to organize and present lengthy literature reviews concisely. In addition to creating useful visual aids to help the reader quickly understand a framework or grasp a large body of information, tables can also sometimes help streamline and reduce the length of a manuscript.\nqrvy | One common feature of the articles with multiple formal propositions is that in all of them the propositions are labeled as such (P one, P two, etc.) in the relevant figure. This is immensely helpful for guiding the reader through the propositions and for linking the text to the figure. Even in articles without propositions, figures and tables are well integrated with the text. As one is constructing a paper, it is important to visualize the final published piece, with the tables and figures embedded adjacent to the ideas being ex-\npn9j | plained. This requires conscious effort, since when we prepare manuscripts for submission, we append the figures and tables to the end of the document, which may make it more likely that they are treated as afterthoughts (i.e., out of sight, out of mind). Effective authors not only use figures and tables that correspond to the text (e.g., same construct labels) but also actively integrate them (e.g., by giving an overview or by referring to them periodically in the text). While it is true, as Sutton and Staw noted, that \"diagrams are not theory,\" these accessories can be powerful tools for clarifying and enhancing the theoretical ideas in a paper.\n1pmc | CONCLUSION",
