You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

rsbu | The Small of Back (SoB) is vital in developing the TC2 software's Measurement Extraction Protocol (SizeUK 2002), as the software cannot locate the waist without some points of reference (TC2 2015). The SoB is defined as the deepest point of the spinal curve at the tangential change, closer to the buttocks (Kirchdoerfer et al. 2002), differing from traditional manual landmarking. The SoB represents the starting point for waist measurements and is key to how shape would be defined and, therefore, should be fully understood. Plus numbers (e.g. +6.35 cm) give the distance above the SoB; defining the upper limit for the region within which a scanner can find the smallest waist circumference. SizeUK allow an upper limit <LATEX>o f + 4 \quad c m</LATEX> and the FFIT +6.35 cm from the SoB; see Table 1.
magd | Equipment suitability
tb74 | The TC2 body scanner's suitability, reliability, and validity within clothing science research has been demonstrated by multiple authors (Pandarum, Yu, and Hunter 2011; Gropper et al. 2012; Kim et al. 2015; Gill and Parker 2017). Notably, the TC2 scanner provides a greater depth and volume of data than traditional methods (Loker, Ashdown, and Schoenfelder 2005; Gill 2015). As Bye, LaBat, and Delong (2006) prove, body scanning captures
8l69 | points, lengths, surface, shape, and volume, while tape measures - for example - only capture length.
1jyv | Out of FFIT's nine body shapes, we used Yim Lee et al.'s (2007) algorithm for FFIT's seven body shapes in our automatic shape sorting programme; see Table 2. We categorised participants into body shape using Visual Basic (Microsoft 1998); see Appendix's Table A1 and Box 1. We selected Yim Lee et al.'s (2007) algorithm as it is the same algorithm Simmons, Istook, and Devarajan (2004a; 2004b) used in FFIT's development. We accept that our excluded shapes (diamond and oval) would be categorised into 'other' shapes because of limitations in defining the abdomen and stomach - as Yim Lee et al. (2007) accepted. Yim Lee et al. (2007) even considered another category - 'Shape not known' - to filter unclas- sified shapes from the extracted measurements, as we use in Table 2; see Box 1 in Appendix Table A1.

j79f | To investigate alternative body measurement defini- tions' influence on the FFIT's body shape classification, we considered three sets of measurement definitions: DS1, DS2, and DS3.
6tbv | Definition Set 1 (DS1) includes the bust, waist, hip, and high hip measurements, the same as the FFIT measurement definitions (Yim Lee et al. 2007; Simmons, Istook, and Devarajan 2004a; Simmons, Istook, and Devarajan 2004b).
xb13 | Definition Set 2 (DS2) includes the bust, waist, and high hip measurements, the same as the FFIT defini- tions. The FFIT's Hip measurement definition is, how- ever, replaced with the SizeUK Hip measurement definition with TC2's (2011) Seat Girth measurement, presented in Table 1. For DS2, only the hip's definition is different. We maintain the other three measure- ments to see how changing only one measurement definition in four alters the body shape classification.
cxqi | Definition Set 3 (DS3) includes the bust, waist, high- hip, and seat (in place of the hip) girth measurements, the same as the SizeUK measurement definition (TC2 2015), presented in Table 1. The bust measurement and its parameter settings in the TC2 Measurement Extraction Protocol (TC2 2015) are the same for the FFIT and SizeUK; see Table 1. For DS3, all measurement definitions are as per the SizeUK sizing survey.
qfmx | Waist measurement parameters' selection
rut3 | This study's two waist measurement parameters are: SizeUK's SoB + 4.0 cm region (TC2 2015) and the FFIT'S SoB + 6.35 cm region (Simmons, Istook, and Devarajan 2004a, 2004b; Devarajan and Istook 2004).
m3cp | Shoulder measurements' parameters' selection
mq4s | The three shoulder measurement parameters we used to represent shoulder anthropometrics were: shoulder- to-shoulder (horizontal), shoulder-to-shoulder (calliper), and shoulder girth (TC2 2015). We selected these three parameters to capture the shoulder's shape,
95el | allowing shoulders to relate to the other shape classifi- cation measurements.
a0a5 | While higher complexities of shoulder anthropomet- rics - such as pitch, slope length, and front-to-back depth - may associate with FFIT body shape, we focussed on key measurements traditionally used in gar- ment construction. Using traditional measurements retains consistency with the FFIT's measurements and current practice. It was essential to select measurements that - like the other FFIT dimensions - could define the shape and provide a context within current pattern cut- ting practices.
gocl | Data handling
ob1z | Manchester Metropolitan University held the study's data within a database of UK scan data following the Data Protection Act (Great Britain 1998). A practitioner - with 15 years' experience - extracted participant data from the database before inspecting all scans to ensure the data's reliability and validity. Before con- ducting statistical analysis - i.e. Multinomial Logistic Regression, t-tests, or ANOVA -, we followed Tabachnick and Fidell's (2007a) procedures to check for violation of Normality, Linearity, and Homoscedasticity assumptions. We found no serious violations, allowing us to proceed with data analysis.
m4cb | Statistical analysis
m61y | We undertook all statistical analysis with SPSS (IBM 2017), with initial screening in Excel (Microsoft 2019). Significance for all tests was determined at the <LATEX>p \leq 0 . 0 5</LATEX> level. We interpret effect sizes and power requirements in line with Cohen's (1988) widely accepted benchmarks.
u2ob | Alternative measurement definitions
2gnm | We used Kappa Measure of Agreements to gauge the level of agreement between the FFIT categorical classi- fications under DS1, DS2, and DS3 measurement defi- nitions, investigating hypothesis 1. High agreement indicates high stability in the classification. Table 2 shows how many participants fit each of the FFIT's body shapes, according to differential measurement definitions. We selected the hourglass body as the ref- erence shape because it was the most common in DS1: FFIT's 'standard' interpretation.
