You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

06yq | Objective To evaluate the cyclooxygenases (COX) inhibi- tion, adverse effects and analgesic efficacy of dipyrone or meloxicam in cats undergoing elective ovariohysterectomy.
dpv6 | Study design Prospective, blinded, randomized, clinical study.
8r5j | Animals A total of 30 healthy young cats.
2taz | Methods The cats were randomly assigned to three post- operative groups: D25 (dipyrone 25 mg kg 1 every 24 hours), D12.5 (dipyrone 12.5 mg kg every 12 hours) and M (meloxicam 0.1 mg kg every 24 hours). In the first 24 hours, the drugs were administered intravenously (IV), and then orally for 6 (dipyrone) or 3 days (meloxicam). Pros- tanoids thromboxane B2 and prostaglandin E2 concentra- tions served as indicators of COX activity and, with physiological variables and pain and sedation scores, were measured for 24 hours after first analgesic administration. Rescue analgesia (tramadol, 2 mg kg-1 IV) was provided if Glasgow feline composite measure pain scale (CMPS-Feline) ≥5. Laboratory tests included symmetric dimethylarginine and adverse effects were evaluated regularly up to 7 and 10 days after surgery, respectively. Parametric and nonpara- metric data were analyzed with two-way ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis tests, respectively (p < 0.05).
o3ya | Results In the first half hour after analgesic administration, COX-1 activity was close to zero and remained significantly lower than before drug administration for 24 hours in all groups. The inhibition of COX-2 activity was significant for 30 minutes in all groups and up to 4 hours in group M. No

5gui | alterations in laboratory tests or significant adverse effects were observed. Pain scores and need for rescue analgesia did not differ statistically among groups.
82qc | Conclusions Dipyrone at both doses and meloxicam pro- vided a nonselective inhibition of COX-1 and -2 activities and effective analgesia without causing significant adverse effects or laboratory tests alterations.
ls7d | Clinical relevance Dipyrone at both doses provides equally effective analgesia without causing adverse effects in cats undergoing ovariohysterectomy.

t8vv | Introduction
qvnu | Dipyrone, also known as metamizole, is a drug used in some European and Latin American countries for its analgesic, antipyretic and spasmolytic effects (Levy et al. 1995). Although introduced in pharmacotherapy in 1922, the mechanism of action is not yet completely understood (Kötter et al. 2015). Previous studies have reported its action on different receptors: stimulation of the arginine-NO-cGMP pathway (Duarte et al. 1992); central action through inhibi- tion of cyclooxygenase-3 (COX-3) (Chandrasekharan et al. 2002); endogenous opioid system (Vazquez et al. 2005); in- hibition of COX-1 and COX-2 (Hinz et al. 2007) and endoge- nous cannabinoid system (Escobar et al. 2012).
kggw | Dipyrone may be a safe choice compared with opioids and non- steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). However, dipyrone has been withdrawn from the market in several countries
xrd1 | because it has been associated with agranulocytosis in humans (Kötter et al. 2015). Studies investigating this association are heterogeneous and some results carry significant biases, such as small sample size, presence of comorbidities and the combination of dipyrone with other drugs (Andrade et al. 2016). The esti- mated mortality from agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, anaphylaxis and gastrointestinal complications after short-term dipyrone use is reported as similar to that of paracetamol and lower than that of diclofenac and aspirin (Andrade et al. 1998).
5746 | In veterinary medicine, literature on this drug is sparse. Pharmacokinetics studies of dipyrone (25 mg kg 1) adminis- tered by various routes in cats (Lebkowska-Wieruszewska et al. 2018) and dogs (Giorgi et al. 2018) have been published. Clinical studies have demonstrated analgesia efficacy from dipyrone in several scenarios in dogs (Martins et al. 2010; Imagawa et al. 2011; Flôr et al. 2013; Teixeira et al. 2013; Zanuzzo et al. 2015a). Only one published study was identified that used dipyrone for pain management in cats. In that study, dipyrone (25 mg kg every 24, 12 or 8 hours for 5 days) combined with tramadol (2 mg kg every 8 hours) adminis- tered intravenously (IV) after ovariohysterectomy provided effective postoperative pain management with no significant adverse effects, biochemical alterations or erythrocyte oxida- tion (Teixeira et al. 2019).
7toz | In domestic animals, there are no reports of significant adverse effects or laboratory tests alterations associated with dipyrone, and a study reported no renal, hepatic, bleeding time or bone marrow function alterations in dogs (Sarchahi et al. 2017). Regarding gastrointestinal effects, no pathological changes in the gastrointestinal tract of control rats or rats with preexisting induced gastric ulcers were observed after dipyrone administration (Berenguer et al. 2002). In addition, there are reports of increases in gastric mucus and gastric prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) (Batu & Erol 2007) and less gastric PGE2 reduction than from piroxicam or celecoxib (Berenguer et al. 2002). However, the mechanisms of a protective effect by dipyrone on the gastric mucosa are still unclear (Collares & Troncon 2019).
j346 | The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of dipyrone on COX-1 and COX-2 activities, to assess postoperative pain in cats undergoing elective ovariohysterectomy after IV administration of dipyrone or meloxicam during the first 24 hours and to identify any adverse effects occurring in 7 or 4 days after surgery with dipyrone or meloxicam, respectively. Our hypothesis was that dipyrone may inhibit COX with few adverse effects and provide postoperative analgesia similar to meloxicam.

awvu | A total of 30 female domestic cats undergoing ovariohyster- ectomy were studied. All animals were deemed healthy and with an American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I based on medical history, physical examination, complete blood count (CBC) and serum chemistry tests. Acclimatization occurred in two visits at the hospital before the beginning of the study, when animals were also introduced to the envi- ronment, cage, observers and sedation and pain assessment tools. Exclusion criteria included excessive fear or aggressive- ness, signs of pre-existing pain, pregnancy, underlying diseases and recent use of anti-inflammatory drugs.
on9b | Anesthesia
a8ge | Cats were administered acepromazine (0.1 mg kg 1; Acepran 0.2%; Vetnil Indústria Comércio Produtos Veterinários Ltda, SP, Brazil) intramuscularly as premedication. After 15 mi- nutes, a 22 gauge catheter (Angiocath; Becton Dickinson, SP, Brazil) was placed in a cephalic vein and anesthesia was induced with IV propofol (5-8 mg kg ; Propovan; Cristália Produtos Químicos e Farmacêuticos Ltda, SP, Brazil); mainte- nance was accomplished with isoflurane (Isoflorane; Cristália Produtos Químicos e Farmacêuticos Ltda) in 60-70% oxygen (air-oxygen mixture) administered through a rebreathing cir- cuit. Pressure-controlled ventilation (Anesthesia Machine In- ter Linea A; Intermed, SP, Brazil) was instituted with a peak inspiratory pressure of 7-8 cmH20, tidal volume 8 mL kg , inspiratory:expiratory ratio of 1:2 and positive end-tidal expi- ratory pressure 1 cmH2O. The respiratory rate (fR) was adjusted to maintain end-tidal carbon dioxide partial pressure within 30-40 mmHg (5.0-6.0 kPa). End-tidal isoflurane concentration and inspired oxygen concentration were measured using a side stream gas analyzer (POET IQ2; Criticare Technologies Inc., WI, USA). Heart rate (HR), rhythm (DX 2020 multiparametric monitor; Dixtal Biomédica Indústria e Comércio Ltda, SP, Brazil) and Doppler systolic arterial pressure (SAP; Doppler 811-B; Parks Medical Electronics, OR, USA) were monitored during the entire procedure. Intraoperative IV fluid therapy was lactated Ringer's solution (3 mL kg 1 hour-1).
h27a | A remifentanil constant rate infusion (CRI; 0.2 ug kg-1 minute-1; Ultiva 2 mg; GlaxoSmithKline Brasil Ltda, RJ, Brazil) was administered IV with a syringe driver (ST670 syringe pump; Samtronic, SP, Brazil) starting after induction of

xmgs | anesthesia and finishing during abdominal closure. If SAP and/ or HR increased or decreased by >15% of values immediately before skin incision, remifentanil CRI was increased or decreased, respectively, by 0.1 µg kg 1 minute-1.
bd9h | Cats were randomly assigned by an online random sequence generator (http://www.randomization.com) to one of three groups, 10 cats in each. At 10 minutes before the end of the remifentanil CRI, during skin closure, cats were administered IV analgesics according to the assigned group: group D25, dipyrone (25 mg kg every 24 hours; D500; Zoetis Inc., SP, Brazil); group D12.5, dipyrone (12.5 mg kg - every 12 hours); or group M, meloxicam (0.1 mg kg 1 every 24 hours; Max- icam 0.2%; Ouro Fino Saúde Animal, SP, Brazil). The drugs were diluted in 0.9% saline solution to a final volume of 0.5 mL for each group. A collaborator prepared the injections so that the evaluator would be unaware of the group assignment. In the first 24 hours after anesthesia, the drugs were administered IV. At hospital discharge, the clients were directed to admin- ister the same drug orally for 6 days (dipyrone) or 3 days (meloxicam).
m047 | All the procedures were performed by a single anesthesiol- ogist (LAG) and a single senior surgeon (JMM) with an assis- tant using a standardized surgical protocol.
gy8c | Measurement of ex vivo COX activity
y4mj | Ex vivo COX-1 and COX-2 activities were determined by measuring concentrations of their major enzymatic products [thromboxane B2 (TXB2) and PGE2, respectively], according to an adaptation of a previously described technique (Duz et al. 2015). Blood samples (2 mL) were drawn from the cephalic vein catheter of six randomly selected cats per group and were transferred to a heparin tube (MiniCollect heparin 1 mL; Greiner Bio-One Ltda, SP, Brazil) and a glass tube at the following time points: immediately before the first analgesic administration and at 30 minutes, 4 and 24 hours. At 24 hours, blood was collected before the next drug administration.
vpgq | For TXB2 analysis, immediately after collection, 1 mL of whole blood in the glass tube was incubated at 37 ºC for 1 hour. Afterwards, the blood was centrifuged at 3000 g for 5 minutes at 4 ℃ and 100 uL of the supernatant plasma was harvested, added to 400 µL of methanol and homogenized. This solution was then centrifuged at 6000 g for 10 minutes and stored at -80 ℃ until COX-1 activity was determined by means of a technique previously described (Brideau et al. 2001).
ousl | For ex vivo COX-2 activity, heparinized blood (1 mL) was immediately transferred into two 1.5 mL polypropylene tubes (500 µL each). One tube contained 10 µL of lipopolysaccharide isolated from Escherichia coli 0111:B4 in 0.1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution. The sec- ond tube contained 10 µL of PBS and was used as the negative control sample. Samples were then incubated at 37 ℃ for 24

This solution was then centri- fuged at 6000 g for 10 minutes at 18 ℃; supernatant was harvested and stored at -80 ℃ until the time of PGE2 con- centration analysis.
ki8m | All tests were performed in duplicate and the quantification of TXB2 and PGE2 concentrations were performed with com- mercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits (Thromboxane B2 ELISA kit and PGE2 ELISA kit monoclonal; Cayman Chemical, MI, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
