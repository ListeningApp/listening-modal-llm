You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

o2kr | Practical approach for the diagnosis of biliary atresia on imaging, part 2: magnetic resonance cholecystopancreatography, hepatobiliary scintigraphy, percutaneous cholecysto-cholangiography, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, percutaneous liver biopsy, risk scores and decisional flowchart
v6sk | Abstract
1wj6 | We aim to present a practical approach to imaging in suspected biliary atresia, an inflammatory cholangiopathy of infancy resulting in progressive fibrosis and obliteration of extrahepatic and intrahepatic bile ducts. Left untreated or with failure of the Kasai procedure, biliary atresia progresses to biliary cirrhosis, end-stage liver failure and death within the first years of life. Differentiating biliary atresia from other nonsurgical causes of neonatal cholestasis is difficult as there is no single method for diagnosing biliary atresia and clinical, laboratory and imaging features of this disease overlap with those of other causes of neonatal cholestasis. In this second part, we discuss the roles of magnetic resonance (MR) cholecystopancreatography, hepatobiliary scintigraphy, percutaneous biopsy and percutaneous cholecysto-cholangiography. Among imaging techniques, ultrasound (US) signs have a high specificity, although a normal US examination does not rule out biliary atresia. Other imaging techniques with direct opacification of the biliary tree combined with percutaneous liver biopsy have roles in equivocal cases. MR cholecystopancreatography and hepatobiliary scintigraphy are not useful for the diagnosis of biliary atresia. We propose a decisional flowchart for biliary atresia diagnosis based on US signs, including elastography, percutaneous cholecysto- cholangiography or endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and liver biopsy.

06yq | Introduction
dpv6 | Biliary atresia is an important cause of obstructive jaundice in infants causing progressive fibrosis and obliteration of extra- hepatic and intrahepatic bile ducts and resulting in biliary cirrhosis in the absence of early surgery. Jaundice with pale
8r5j | stools and dark urine is present within the first days or weeks of life. The prevalence of biliary atresia ranges from 1 in 5,000 to 1 in 20,000 worldwide depending on the geographic area, with the highest prevalence in Taiwan [1-3]. The aetiology of biliary atresia is unknown and different causes have been pro- posed including viral infections, genetic factors or toxins [4].
2taz | There are two forms of biliary atresia: the non-syndromic form, which accounts for about 80% of cases, and the syndromic form, also called biliary atresia splenic malforma- tion syndrome, which accounts for about 20% of cases [3]. The syndromic form is associated with polysplenia (asplenia), intestinal malrotation, preduodenal portal vein, interrupted

r5il | inferior vena cava, aberrant hepatic artery, abdominal heterotaxia and congenital heart disease [5]. There are also different subtypes of biliary atresia according to the extent of fibrosis in extrahepatic bile ducts and the presence of a cyst of the extrahepatic bile duct. In all cases, intrahepatic bile ducts

The histology is charac- terized by bile duct proliferation, bile plugs, portal or perilobular fibrosis, oedema and the preservation of the basic hepatic lobular architecture [7, 8]. Histology is not specific

qvnu | and disorders such as parenteral nutrition-associated cholesta- sis, cystic fibrosis and «-1-antitrypsin deficiency may mimic biliary atresia. Liver biopsy specimens obtained before 6 weeks of age could be indistinguishable from neonatal hep- atitis [8-10]. If left untreated, patients with biliary atresia will die within the first years of life from complications of biliary cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease.
kggw | The primary treatment for biliary atresia is the Kasai hepatoportoenterostomy, which consists of resecting the choledocal remnants, gallbladder and portal plate and construct- ing a jejunal Roux-en-Y anastomosis (Kasai procedure) or cholecystostomy to restore biliary drainage. If biliary atresia pa- tients have surgery within the first 60 days of life, bile flow can be established in 70% of cases; patients who have surgery after 90 days of life achieve sufficient bile flow only in 20% of cases [11]. Liver transplantation is performed if primary Kasai hepatoportoenteostomy fails or in case of delayed diagnosis with advanced cirrhosis that contraindicates Kasai surgery. Rapid di- agnosis at the onset of symptoms is the main goal of imaging considering the paramount importance of early surgical treatment.
xrd1 | Differentiating biliary atresia from other nonsurgical causes of neonatal cholestasis is challenging. Gamma- glutamyl transpeptidase is an important biomarker in the dif- ferential diagnosis of neonatal cholestasis showing higher levels in children with biliary atresia than in those without biliary atresia [12]. Ultrasound (US), magnetic resonance (MR) cholangiopancreatography, hepatobiliary scinti- graphy, liver percutaneous biopsy, percutaneous cholecysto- cholangiography and endoscopic retrograde cholangio- pancreatography (ERCP) are used in the work-up for biliary atresia, but surgery with intraoperative cholangiography and biopsy is the only reference standard for diagnosis.
5746 | We divided our results in two linked papers. In part 1 [13], we discussed the prenatal US and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) diagnosis and the early postnatal US findings. In this second part, we discuss the role of MR cholecysto- pancreatography, nuclear medicine, percutaneous biopsy, per- cutaneous cholecysto-cholangiography and risk scores. Based on this literature review and discussions within the European Society of Paediatric Radiology (ESPR) Abdominal Taskforce, both via e-mails and during plenary sessions, a suggested diagnostic pathway for patients with suspected bil- iary atresia is proposed as a consensus statement from the ESPR.
7toz | Systematic review
j346 | The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement was applied to this review. In December 2019, two of the authors (M.N. and B.M.D., both with 16 years of experience) independently and systematically
v8uq | searched on PubMed all articles published from Jan. 1999 to Dec. 1, 2019. Keywords included (MRI) AND (biliary atre- sia), (percutaneous cholecystocholangiography) AND (biliary atresia), (ERCP) AND (biliary atresia), (percutanous liver bi- opsy) AND (biliary atresia), (nuclear medicine) AND (biliary atresia), (biliary atresia) AND (risk scores). The two readers in consensus selected eligible papers based on title and abstract. Only articles in English were considered for analysis. We matched author names and affiliations to avoid data duplica- tion and we included only the most recent or complete study of the same authors including the same patients. No papers were dismissed due to the children's ages or the type of study.

4i0e | One hundred fifty-two studies were identified for initial re- view. On the basis of title or abstract, 141 papers were exclud- ed and 11 [14-24] papers were identified as relevant.
h2l3 | A fast spin echo three-dimensional (3-D) MR cholangiopancreatography is recommended with echo time (TE) 600-700 ms, repetition time (TR) 1,500-2,500 ms (the- oretical, dependent on respiratory gating), flip angle 140° and fat suppression using a 1.5-tesla (T) unit (Fig. 2). Acquisitions are strictly coronal and almost isotropic to allow for non- distorted detection and assessment of the smaller structures. Real-time navigator gating is necessary to synchronize breath- ing. Field of view 18-24 cm and acquisition matrix 256×256 are adequate. We suggest using a flexible surface coil accord- ing to the child's weight (minimum 12 channels).
dfzb | Gentle swaddling and natural sleep or sedation are both possible options. We recommend the patient fast for at least 4 h before the MRI and no digestive contrast.
u6ty | The MR cholecystopancreatography diagnosis of biliary atresia was made on the basis of the non-visualization of the extrahepatic biliary tree [15, 17, 19, 22, 24] or the non- visualization of the extrahepatic bile duct and gallbladder, also considering periportal thickening and high signal intensity in the porta hepatis on T2-weighted images [14, 21] (Fig. 2). Other authors considered the non-visualization of the extrahe- patic bile duct and gallbladder abnormalities [20, 23] (Fig. 3).
awvu | The meta-analysis performed by He et al. [25] included 7 MR cholecystopancreatography studies (age range: 1-15 days) for biliary atresia diagnosis reporting a sensitivity of 89.7% (range: 84.8-93.4%), a specificity of 64.7% (range: 58.0- 71.0%), a positive likelihood ratio of 3.10 (range: 1.59-6.06), a negative likelihood ratio of 0.16 (range: 0.06-0.44) and a diagnostic odds ratio of 32.48 (range: 8.22-128.29).

The MRI-based decision tree using these findings with MRI triangular cord thickness cutoff of 5.1 mm showed 97.3% sensitivity, 94.8% specificity and 96.2% accuracy, comparable to US. MRI scans in this study were performed using sedation. This was a retro- spective study with the possibility of bias. The authors did not assess the reproducibility of MRI triangular sign thickness and the baseline characteristics (gender and laboratory results) were different between the biliary atresia and non-biliary atresia groups. The proportion of patients with visible or dilated com- mon bile duct on MRI in the non-biliary atresia group (94/96, 97.9%) was much higher than in other studies because the au- thors included 42 patients with choledochal cyst and partially visualized common bile duct in the visible common bile duct group, compared with previous studies that excluded these cases (mean age±standard deviation in the biliary atresia group 59.3 ±30.2 days and in the non-biliary atresia group 57.9±43.1 days).

gy8c | According to Siles et al. [18], non-enhanced MR cholecystopancreatography visualization of the entire extrahe- patic bile duct system, including confluence of intrahepatic bile ducts, is possible but was only observed in 62.5% of neonates and infants younger that 3 months in a normal phys- iological state. For infants younger than 30 days, this result dropped to 50%. This compromises the ability of MR cholecystopancreatography to exclude the diagnosis of biliary atresia at the optimal time for surgery.

vpgq | Hepatobiliary scintigraphy uses Tc-99 m-labelled iminodiacetic acid derivatives as a radiotracer. Patient preparation for imaging should include phenobarbital to activate liver excretory en- zymes and increase bile flow for a minimum of 3-5 days before the hepatobiliary imaging study. Scintigraphy can exclude bil- iary atresia by demonstrating transit of radiotracer into the bow- el (Fig. 4). Cholescintigraphic images should be acquired at multiple times up to 24 h.
