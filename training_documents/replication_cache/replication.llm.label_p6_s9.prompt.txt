You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

pxbq | Detailed perspective and cross-sectional views of crown complexes of (a,d) nodavirus at 8.5 Å resolution, (b,e) alphavirus at 2.6 Å resolution, and (c,f) coronavirus at 30.5 A resolution. Positioning of the nodavirus and coronavirus crowns in their respective membranes is as defined by cryo-EM tomographic reconstructions, while the positioning of the alphavirus crown on the membrane diagrams is interpreted from detergent interactions observed in single-particle cryo-EM reconstruction. In panels b and e, two different shades of blue are used to visualize individual nsP1 protomers. Abbreviations: cryo-EM, cryo-electron microscopy; nsP, nonstructural protein. Images are derived from electron density maps and structure coordinates associated with References 21, 41, 42, and 65 and drawn to a common scale.

u15r | spherule structure against the high membrane curvature of the neck and electrostatic repulsion of the closely packed dsRNA. Crowns frequently are the origins of filaments that likely represent nascent progeny (+)RNAs being exported into the cytosol (26). Below we outline recent find- ings that similar crown-like complexes of RNA replication factors are formed by alphaviruses and coronaviruses, suggesting that such features are widely conserved in (+)RNA viruses.
lq35 | Mapping a genetically engineered hexahistidine (His6) tag showed that the FHV crown apical lobe corresponds to the protein A RdRp domain (21) (Figure 4a). This accessible position appears consistent with the RdRp domain's roles in RNA template recruitment (22) and potentially in negative-strand RNA [(-)RNA] synthesis, but less compatible with (+)RNA synthesis due to its distance from the vesicle-bound dsRNA template (21). Thus, (+)RNA synthesis might depend on an alternate protein A state with its RdRp domain deeper in the crown, either by bending of one or more crown apical lobes toward the vesicle or through an alternate form of protein A, as suggested by asymmetric electron-dense bodies often seen inside the crown turret (21). Further mapping of protein A's RNA capping and other domains within the crown should provide more powerful foundations for understanding and testing crown function and RC assembly and maturation.
3g9w | Given these new revelations on FHV RC and crown structure, the tight linkage of FHV spherule formation to viral RNA synthesis (24) suggests that the spherule RC may be formed dur- ing (-)RNA synthesis by inflating the vesicle with the dsRNA product, like blowing up a balloon (12). A similar model was proposed among other alternatives for Semliki Forest alphavirus (27).
d09o | 2.2. Alphavirus-Like Superfamily
ylhz | The alphavirus-like superfamily of (+)RNA viruses includes members that infect animals, insects, fungi, and plants, united by four conserved domains in their RNA replication proteins: an RNA MTase/capping domain, membrane-interactive Iceberg region (11), superfamily 1 NTPase/helicase, and RdRp (Figure 2). Through multiple phylogenetic interconnections, this alphavirus-like superfamily, the nodavirus-tombusvirus clade discussed above, and the flavivirus superfamily discussed below are now grouped together in phylum Kitrinoviricota, which represents ~50% of (+)RNA viruses (1). This broad linkage underscores structural and functional parallels discussed here within and beyond this phylum.
a3td | Alphavirus RNA replication has best been studied for Semliki Forest virus and Sindbis virus, and increasingly for some more clinically important pathogens such as Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) (28-30). Alphaviruses encode a nonstructural polyprotein that is processed by a viral protease into nonstructural proteins (nsPs) 1-4 (Figure 2). nsP1 contains the RNA MTase/capping domain, the Iceberg region, and a second membrane-associating region. nsP2 has the NTPase/helicase, the protease, and a potential 2'-O-MTase. nsP3 has a macrodomain, zinc- binding domain, and hypervariable region. nsP4 contains the RdRp domain. Alphavirus RNA replication occurs in characteristic ~60- to 70-nm spherule vesicles (31, 32) that are induced on the plasma membrane and then, to degrees varying among different alphaviruses, are endocytosed into endosomal and lysosomal compartments (33, 34).
ex5k | Equivalent spherule RCs are induced by numerous plant-infecting alphavirus-like viruses (35, 36). EM studies confirmed the same spherule architecture as for alphaviruses and provided particularly detailed views of spherule necks through freeze-fracture studies with turnip yellow mosaic virus (37). Evidence for spherules as the sites of viral RNA synthesis progressively accumu- lated from multiple viruses. For example, autoradiography mapped incorporated 3H-uridine to cytopathic vesicles bearing spherules (32), electron-dense fibrils inside spherules were identified as dsRNA-i.e., potential replication intermediates-by RNase sensitivity in low salt (38) and dsRNA-specific antibodies (39), and Br-rUTP incorporation was mapped directly to spherules by EM immunogold labeling (40). Further details of spherule formation and function were revealed

zxz6 | Additional connections between alphavirus and nodavirus RCs emerged when cryo-EM single- particle analysis of CHIKV nsP1 revealed an nsP1 dodecamer ring (41, 42) (Figure 4b). This nsP1 dodecamer has been visualized to date from exogenously expressed, detergent-solubilized nsP1, and not in an alphavirus RC. Nevertheless, the parallel 12-fold symmetry of crowns in active no- davirus RCs (Figure <LATEX>\left. 4 a \right)</LATEX> and conservation of the capping domain, Iceberg region, and polymerase domain between alphaviruses and nodaviruses (Figure 2) suggests that the nsP1 dodecamer likely forms the membrane-bound base of a larger crown also incorporating nsP2, nsP3, and the nsP4 RdRp, and serves as a cytosolic export channel for progeny
xnth | <LATEX>\left( + \right) \mathrm { R N A s } .</LATEX> One nsP1-nsP1 dodecamer interface includes amphipathic detergent-binding projections, sug- gesting that oligomerization and membrane binding may be coupled. As in nodavirus crowns (21), nsP1's ordered contacts with lipids (43, 44) likely generate and stabilize the curvature of the membrane neck. Additionally, the nsP1 MTase domain structure shares features with eukaryotic mRNA cap (guanine-N7) MTase Ecm1, suggesting structural and mechanistic interpretations of alphavirus 5' RNA capping reactions involving <LATEX>\mathrm { m } ^ { 7 } \mathrm { G T P }</LATEX> methylation, <LATEX>\mathrm { m } ^ { 7 } \mathrm { G M P - n s P 1 }</LATEX> complex for- mation, and m7GpppRNA formation.
vafm | 2.3. Flaviviruses
2zmw | A third class of (+)RNA viruses forming spherule RCs are the Flaviviridae, which include major pathogens such as Zika, yellow fever, and dengue viruses. Flaviviruses encode a single polypro- tein that is cleaved into three structural proteins and seven nonstructural (NS) RNA replication proteins (45) (Figure 2). NS5 contains the RdRp and RNA capping enzyme. NS3 contains an RNA helicase/NTPase and the polyprotein processing protease. NS2A, NS2B, NS4A, and NS4B are membrane-spanning proteins that induce a continuous membrane network comprising vesicle packets, convoluted membranes, and virion assembly/budding sites (46, 47).
bf9k | Flavivirus-induced vesicle packets contain the viral RNA replication proteins, dsRNA, and nascent RNA and are the site of genome replication (48, 49). Three-dimensional EM tomogra- phy showed vesicle packets to comprise a bounding membrane vesicle bearing multiple spherule invaginations retaining necked openings to the cytosol (50-52) (Figure <LATEX>\left. 3 b \right) ,</LATEX> confirming parallels noted in EM tomography of nodavirus spherules (17) (Figure <LATEX>\left. 3 a \right) .</LATEX> The convoluted membranes contain replicase proteins but no RNA, and they may be sites for replication factor production and storage preparatory to RC formation (52).
otkr | While most Flaviviridae form spherule RCs, HCV induces some closed single-membrane vesi- cles and more DMVs (53, 54). Further features and evolutionary implications of these DMVs are reviewed below.

colo | In contrast to (+)RNA viruses forming spherule RCs, RNA replication by some <LATEX>\left( + \right) R N A</LATEX> viruses- including coronaviruses, picornaviruses, noroviruses, and hepaciviruses-is accompanied by for- mation of single- and double-membrane vesicles or tubules lacking membrane openings to the cytosol (55). For coronaviruses, DMVs were recently established as the major sites of viral RNA synthesis (56), while for other viruses in this category the respective relevance of single- and double-membrane compartments for RNA replication remains less clear. Below we briefly review these results and their implications.

pk06 | 3.1. Coronaviruses
7wn9 | Coronaviruses and in particular the beta-coronaviruses are important human and animal pathogens. They include the causal agents of the prior severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) epidemics (57) and the current devastating COVID-19 pandemic. Coronaviruses have ~30-kb genomes, the largest known genomes among (+)RNA viruses (Figure <LATEX>\left. 2 b \right) .</LATEX> Over 70% of these genomes encode enormous, overlapping la and lab polyproteins that are essential for RNA replication and for coronaviruses' unusual discon- tinuous subgenomic mRNA transcription (58). These polyproteins are processed by two virus- encoded proteases into 16 individual nonstructural proteins (nsps) providing functions in RNA replication organelle formation (nsps 3, 4, and 6) plus enzymatic functions such as protease (nsp3 and nsp5), <LATEX>\mathrm { R d R p }</LATEX> (nsp12 and cofactors nsps 7 and 8), RNA capping (nsps 12, 14, and 16 and cofac- tor nsp10), helicase (nsp13), exonuclease (nsp14), and endonuclease (nsp15) (59). The structures of many nsPs have been solved (59), but how they collectively interact for RNA synthesis and export remains a question.
wcd0 | Proteins nsp3, 4, and 6 each have multiple membrane-association domains and induce a network of interconnected, endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-derived membrane rearrangements in- cluding complex convoluted membranes and hundreds of 200- to 300-nm DMVs (60-62) (Figure 3c). While viral RNA replication proteins are observed throughout this network, dsRNA is found only in DMVs (56, 63, 64). Moreover, autoradiography of actinomycin-D-resistant 3 H-uridine incorporation in coronavirus-infected cells identified DMVs as the dominant if not sole sites of coronavirus RNA synthesis (56). DMVs arise ~2 h postinfection. Their outer mem- branes are often interconnected through neck-like channels to other DMVs and to convoluted membranes (64). Convoluted membranes arise later than DMVs and, unlike DMVs, do not har- bor RNA. However, they abundantly immunolabel for coronavirus nsps and, analogous to similar flavivirus-induced structures, could be sites for replicase production, processing, and storage (64).
caos | A long-elusive path for the potential release of viral RNA products from DMV interiors was provided when cryo-EM tomography revealed a sixfold symmetrical pore that spans both DMV membranes and contains nsp3, the largest <LATEX>\left( > 1 , 9 0 0 \right.</LATEX> aa) coronavirus RNA replication factor (65) (Figure 4c). This coronavirus channel or crown parallels the crowns previously recognized on spherule RCs (Figure <LATEX>\left. 4 a , b \right)</LATEX> in being a ringed complex of viral RNA replication factors that gates cytosolic release of viral RNA products and may assist in guiding their synthesis. Both the cytosolic and luminal portions of this coronavirus crown appear to interact with other viral and cellular factors (65). Potential luminal interactions with other viral RNA synthesis factors could help to coordinate synthesis and release of RNA replication and transcription products. On the crown's cytosolic side, nsp3's ubiquitin-like N terminus interacts with viral RNA and nucleocapsid protein (66-69), greatly enhancing RNA replication, likely by facilitating RNA delivery to the RC (66, 67, 70). As addressed below, in later infection these same nsp3/nucleocapsid interactions may guide encapsidation of progeny genomic RNA.
