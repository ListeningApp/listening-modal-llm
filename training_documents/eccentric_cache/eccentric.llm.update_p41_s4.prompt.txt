You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

oq7c | In 2016, Wang et al. [203] conducted an experimental study on a three-story one-bay by one-bay EBF system with vertical links in which the links were constructed from conventional steel while other members were made from high strength steel, similar to the concept studied for EBFs with horizontal links by Lian et al. [39]. Although excellent cyclic performance was reported, significant out-of-plane deformation was observed at the conjunction of the vertical link and the braces (which was not laterally supported) leading to failure due to fracture in the link-to-beam connection at the first story.
z4mi | Although the current AISC Seismic Provisions [3] are intended for designing EBFs with horizontal links, the commentary on the code emphasizes the importance of lateral bracing at the intersection of a vertical link and braces, if inverted Y-braced EBFs are utilized.
hkft | 6.2. Tied Braced Frames and EBFs with Zipper Struts
jai3 | To prevent formation of a soft story mechanism in an EBF [16, 89, 90], Martini et al. [204] proposed a modified EBF configuration in 1990, known as the tied braced frame (TBF), in which the
p57i | link ends are vertically connected to each other over the entire height of the structure. Although a number of early studies indicated some advantages for using TBFs [143, 204], the nonlinear static and dynamic analyses of Popov et al. [141] in 1992 demonstrated that properly designed EBF systems can have well-distributed inelastic action throughout the building height without the need for ties. In a number of recent studies, however, unsatisfactory seismic behavior was reported, particularly for high- rise EBFs [109, 111]. As a result, design methodologies for TBFs were developed by Ghersi et al. [205] and Rossi [206] on the assumption that these systems are more prone to form a global collapse mechanism. Promising performance was reported by Rossi [206] for TBFs deigned according to the proposed methodology.
u5ug | In a similar approach, Zahrai et al. [207] proposed and numerically investigated the behavior of EBFs with zipper struts, which vertically connect the mid-points of shear links throughout the height. Results of the extensive pushover, cyclic loading, and time-history analyses revealed that the zipper struts not only help in having coincident yielding of the links but also increase the ductility and energy dissipation of the system.
i9k5 | 6.3. Replaceable Links
20z2 | Although the concept of replaceable links was previously mentioned in a number of studies (e.g. [24, 104, 187]), the first research specifically on EBFs with horizontal links that can be easily dismounted and replaced after an earthquake was conducted by Stratan and Dubina [27, 208] in the early 2000s. A link-to-beam connection with bolted end-plates, which were flush with the floor beam, was studied. Pinched behavior due to the end-plate bending and bolt thread stripping was observed in some cases and it was concluded that the link length ratio (p) should be limited to 0.8 to have proper cyclic behavior. Further numerical and experimental studies of Dubina et al. [209, 210] confirmed the applicability of the concept and demonstrated that dual EBFs have a notable re-centering capability which significantly facilitates the post-damage replacement. To further investigate this, a comprehensive full-scale test program, known as the DUAREM project [211, 212], was recently conducted at the European Laboratory for Structural Assessment (ELSA) of the Joint Research Centre (JRC) in Ispra, Italy in which a three-story three-bay to one-bay dual EBF system with end-plated
4cgs | replaceable links was tested pseudo-dynamically under three earthquake levels and link replacement was performed after each ground motion simulation. It was concluded that the dual EBF system with replaceable links is a promising lateral load resisting system that provides the desired seismic performance as well as an economic post-earthquake repair procedure.
htre | Two other replaceable shear link details were recently studied by Mansour et al. [34, 41] through isolated link tests as well as frame tests. The first detail was again a bolted end-plate link-to-beam connection; however, it had a link segment that was smaller than the floor beam, making it possible to use bolts above the top flange and below the bottom flange of the link. Excellent ductility and stable behavior was reported for this detail proving its ability for practical applications. Further numerical studies of Mago [213] in 2013, which are summarized in the HERA R4-145 report, confirmed the reliability of the connection. In a recent study by Dusicka and Lewis [35] on a similar replaceable link connection, the use of an additional pair of stiffeners was proposed to reduce the probability of flange fracture in the vicinity of the link-to-end-plate welds. These additional stiffeners were placed parallel to the link web and located in the first web panel (similar to the detail shown in Figure 7h). In addition to the numerical analyses, the detail was verified experimentally for the case of replaceable long links by Dusicka and Lewis [35].
da3c | Another detail developed by Mansour et al. [34, 41] for replaceable shear links (originally proposed by Balut and Gioncu [214] for MRFs) was a bolted web connection where two back-to-back channel sections, considered as the link segment, were bolted to the web of the floor beam. Although larger Yp max values were obtained compared to the tested end-plate connections, the bolted web connection experienced a pinched behavior due to the repeated cycles of bolt-slip, bolt bearing against the link web, and bolt hole ovalization. The larger rotation capacities of these links were attributed to the inelastic rotation of the connection itself which, in average, was about 16% of the total inelastic link rotation. Modified and reinforced details were proposed to overcome the pinched behavior observed for the web bolted connection. The replaceability of the damaged links was also studied in the frame tests.
890q | There are also a limited number of practical applications of replaceable links in New Zealand which are summarized by Fussel et al. [215], Ramsay et al. [216], and Gardiner et al. [217]. It is worth
jomo | noting that design guidelines for replaceable links are given in the specifications of New Zealand and Canada [17, 218].
06fi | 6.4. Use of EBFs or links in Reinforced Concrete Structures
hb4s | Providing a thorough review of this topic is out of the scope of this study; however, the main applications of EBF configurations in reinforced concrete (RC) structures are mentioned here for the sake of completeness. Steel eccentric braces with or without vertical links can be connected to existing RC frames for seismic rehabilitation. This concept was numerically and experimentally studied by Bouadi and Engelhardt [219], Ghobarah and Abou Elfath [220], Bouwkamp et al. [221], Perera et al. [222], D'Aniello [223], Mazzolani et al. [224], Pina et al. [225], Durucan and Dicleli [226], Özel and Güneyisi [227], Varum et al. [228], and Wang and Yu [229] in the past few decades. Steel links are also utilized as energy dissipating coupling beams between adjacent RC wall piers in hybrid coupled wall (HCW) systems. A comprehensive review of the research on the behavior, analysis, and design of these systems as well as particular topics such as link-to-wall connections can be found in El-Tawil et al. [230].
