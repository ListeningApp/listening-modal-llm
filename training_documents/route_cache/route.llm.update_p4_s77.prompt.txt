You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

877u | Further reaction capabilities have been studied using a series of structurally and functionally diverse azides 8b-i with variedly substituted 1-iodobutadiynes <LATEX>7 a , g - j</LATEX> (Scheme 4).
rzhj | Benzyl azides with donor <LATEX>8 b , c</LATEX> and acceptor groups 8f, alkyl azides <LATEX>8 d _ { \mathrm { j g j } }</LATEX> including azides with FG 8d,g, p-methoxypheny-
bfax | lazide 8h, and nitrotosylazide 8e were investigated in CuAAC with different iododiacetylenes. In all cases except nitro- tosylazide 8e, the reaction afforded 4-ethynyl-5-iodotriazoles from moderate to high yields. In the case of nitrotosylazide 8e, only starting materials were detected in the reaction mixture after 48 h even though 5 mol % catalyst was used. Synthesis employing either OH-substituted alkylazide 8g or iodobuta- diynes 7g,j required a higher catalyst loading (2-5 mol %). The scope of the reaction was also expanded to arylazide 8h, which required 5 mol % CuI(PPh3)3 for the full conversion giving 1-aryl-substituted triazole 9o.
f2y8 | On the next step, we evaluated a synthetic application of 4- ethynyl-5-iodotriazoles. Two types of reactions involving an iodine atom, which lead to 1,4,5-trisubstituted triazoles were explored, the Sonogashira-Hagihara87,88 and the Suzuki- Miyaura® couplings.
o7qm | It is important that both types of products, triazole-fused enediynes and 5-aryl-4-ethynyltriazoles, are of special im- portance because of possible further intramolecular cyclizations known for other types of benzene(heteroarene)-fused enediynes-95 and ortho-ethynylaryl-substituted arenes,96-100 leading to highly conjugated polyaromatic compounds. Among such systems, polycyclic fused 1,2,3-triazoles are of particular interest.101-103
d52l | We started with the synthesis of enediynes. Remarkably, a triple bond has been introduced into position 5 of a triazole ring mostly using the Sonogashira coupling, 101,104-106 yet several examples for the synthesis of 4-aryl-5-ethynyl-1,2,3- triazole using one-pot CuAAC/ethynylation have also been reported.107-113

nhsg | °C104 and Pd(PPh3)4/Cul/Et3N/toluene, 80 ℃1) were initially employed for coupling of iodotriazole 9b with 4-MeO- phenylacetylene 12a and 2-methylbuta-3-yn-2-ol 12b, respec- tively. Surprisingly, the reaction with alkynol 12b proceeded with a partial deiodination of iodotriazole 9b. A mixture of the desired enediyne 13b along with reduced 4-ethynyltriazole and a significant amount of the alkyne homocoupling byproduct was obtained. The reaction with 4-MeO-phenylacetylene 12a reached only ~60% conversion of starting iodide to enediyne.14 Switching to other conditions useful for the Sonogashira coupling in the synthesis of enediynes fused to hererocycles115- 115-117 gave either a poor conversion or mixture of target enediynes with the deiodinated starting triazole.114 Taking into account electron-withdrawing properties of a triple
hy0l | bond neighbor to iodine, we analyzed examples of the Sonogashira reaction for 5-iodotriazoles bearing an EWG at the C4 position reported earlier. The literature search revealed that low conversion and reductive deiodination are common problems for the Sonogashira coupling of 5-iodo-1,2,3- triazolecarboxylates, - 118 carboxamides, 119,120 nitriles, 121 and even 5-iodo-4-phenyl-triazoles.122 It is particularly remarkable that for 5-iodotriazoles with an EWG at N1 the Sonogashira reaction proceeded smoothly,123 while for triazole with bulky EDG (ferrocenyl) the yields also were low. 24 The best and the simplest solution was found by David Goyard et al., who carried out both the Sonogashira and the Suzuki coupling using K3PO4 as a base and Pd(PPh3)4 as a catalyst in THF.122
4jmz | These conditions also worked perfectly for the cross- coupling of 4-ethynyl-5-iodotriazoles with acetylenes, provid- ing unsymmetrically substituted enediynes <LATEX>1 3 a - g</LATEX> fused to 1,2,3-triazole ring in high yields (Scheme 5). These conditions proved to be FG tolerant, which allowed OH functions and substituted amino groups to be introduced into an enediyne system. Unsymmetrically substituted enediynes <LATEX>\mathrm { c h } \text { as } 1 3 e - g</LATEX> are of crucial importance because they could be used as starting compounds for the synthesis of macrocyclic triazole- fused enediynes by the Nicholas-type macrocyclization.116,125
b7cq | The Suzuki coupling of N-benzyliodotriazoles <LATEX>9 c , d , m</LATEX> proceeded in high yields also using <LATEX>\mathrm { P d } \left( \mathrm { P P h } _ { 3 } \right) _ { 4 }</LATEX> as a catalyst and K3PO4 as a base providing 5-aryl-4-ethynyltriazoles 15a-c in moderate to good yields (Scheme 6). In contrast with <LATEX>N -</LATEX> benzyl-substituted 5-iodotriazoles, the reaction of N-(4- methoxyphenyl) triazole 9o gave the coupling product 15d in a low yield because of a formation of an unidentified byproduct complex mixture. The possible reason for this exception could be a relatively easy 5-iodotriazole ring opening promoted by both N-aryl group and EWG (4-(chlorophenyl)- ethynyl) at <LATEX>C - 4</LATEX> of the triazole ring. Thus, the palladium- catalyzed denitrogenative indolization of N-aroylbenzotriazoles with internal alkynes has been reported previously.126
