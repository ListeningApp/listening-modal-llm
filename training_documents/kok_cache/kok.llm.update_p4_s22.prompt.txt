You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

dgcw | To assess the impact of <LATEX>\Gamma ^ { * } / C _ { c }</LATEX> on the Kok effect, <LATEX>C _ { c }</LATEX> has to be known. To that end, we estimated <LATEX>g _ { \mathrm { m } }</LATEX> using all data from com- bined gas exchange and Chl fluorescence measurements. <LATEX>g _ { \mathrm { m } }</LATEX> is known to vary with temperature (Bernacchi et al., 2002), but whether <LATEX>g _ { \mathrm { m } }</LATEX> varies with <LATEX>\widehat { C _ { i } \mathrm { o r } \mathrm { w i t } }</LATEX> <LATEX>I _ { \mathrm { i n c } }</LATEX> or <LATEX>O _ { 2 }</LATEX> is uncertain. Further- more, recent literature suggests the necessity to dissect mesophyll resistance into its components (Tholen et al., 2012) and to con- sider the intracellular arrangements of organelles (Yin & Struik, 2017; Ubierna et al., 2019; Yin et al., 2020). Here we consider three <LATEX>g _ { \mathrm { m } }</LATEX> modes: mode i assumes that <LATEX>g _ { m }</LATEX> varies only with temper- ature, but not with either <LATEX>C _ { i }</LATEX> or <LATEX>I _ { \mathrm { i n c } }</LATEX> or <LATEX>O _ { 2 }</LATEX> mode ii assumes that gm varies with all these factors; and mode iii is similar to mode ii but uses an additional factor <LATEX>m</LATEX> that lumps subresistance propor- tions and several intracellular properties of mesophyll organelles (Yin et al., 2020). For mode i, we estimated <LATEX>g _ { \mathrm { m } }</LATEX> by fitting, the NRH-A method based on the non-rectangular hyperbolic equa- tion for CO2-assimilation, described by Yin & Struik (2009) to all data (including A-C; curves). Like photosynthetic rate, <LATEX>g _ { m }</LATEX> has generally an optimum response to temperature (e.g. Bernacchi et al., 2002; Warren & Dreyer, 2006; but with caution, see von Caemmerer & Evans, 2015), and we assumed that this response followed a normal distribution function, with an optimum tem- perature of 30℃: <LATEX>g _ { m } = g _ { m 3 0 } \exp \left\{ - \left[ \left( T - 3 0 \right) / \Omega \right] ^ { 2 } \right\} ,</LATEX> which has a minimum number of parameters to estimate. We incorporated these relationships into the NRH-A method to fit parameter <LATEX>\Omega .</LATEX> For modes ii and iii, we used an equation described by Yin et al. (2009), <LATEX>g _ { m } = \delta \left( A + R _ { d } \right) / \left( C _ { c } - \Gamma ^ { * } \right) ,</LATEX> which can semi-empirically accommodate the response (if observed) of <LATEX>g _ { \mathrm { m } }</LATEX> to <LATEX>I _ { \mathrm { i n c } } ,</LATEX> <LATEX>C _ { i } ,</LATEX> <LATEX>O _ { 2 }</LATEX> and temperature. Here, it is the unitless coefficient <LATEX>\delta</LATEX> that is an explicit parameter to be estimated, and <LATEX>\delta</LATEX> represents the carboxylation resistance : mesophyll resistance ratio (Yin et al., 2020). For each mode, the simultaneously estimated parameters together with <LATEX>g _ { \mathrm { m } }</LATEX> or <LATEX>\delta</LATEX> were: the calibration factor(s) that converts Chl fluorescence-
gvwz | based PSII photochemical efficiency <LATEX>\left( \Phi _ { 2 } \right)</LATEX> into linear electron transport rate (/), with <LATEX>J = s I _ { \text { inc } } \Phi _ { 2 }</LATEX> (Yin et al., 2009); and Rubisco specificity at 25℃ <LATEX>\left( S _ { c / 0 2 5 } \right) .</LATEX> The values of <LATEX>S _ { c / \mathfrak{c} }</LATEX> for other tempera- tures were calculated from the relation <LATEX>\Gamma ^ { * } = 0 . 5 O / S _ { \mathrm { c l } _ { \mathrm { O } } }</LATEX> (where <LATEX>O</LATEX> is the concentration of oxygen; Farquhar et al., 1980; von Caem- merer, 2013) and the Arrhenius equation using <LATEX>2 4 4 6 0 J \mathrm { m o l } ^ { - 1 }</LATEX> of Bernacchi <LATEX>e t</LATEX> al. (2002) as the activation energy for <LATEX>\Gamma ^ { * }</LATEX> (using other activation-energy estimates (e.g. Walker et al., 2013; Yin et al., 2014) had little impact on our calculated <LATEX>\Gamma ^ { * } / C _ { \mathrm { c } }</LATEX> ratios). In view of the reasoning of Farquhar & Busch (2017), we used <LATEX>R _ { \mathrm { D 1 } }</LATEX> of each curve as input for the <LATEX>R a</LATEX> term of the model in fitting. The fitting procedures for three modes were implemented using the GAUSS method in PROC NLIN of SAS (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC, USA), and the SAS codes can be obtained upon request. The SAS output gave the fitted <LATEX>A</LATEX> for each measurement point, with which <LATEX>C _ { \mathrm { c } }</LATEX> was then solved from the model of Farquhar et al. (1980) as:
sk5m | <LATEX>C _ { c } = \Gamma ^ { * } \left[ J / 4 + 2 \left( A + R _ { d } \right) \right] / \left[ / 4 - \left( A + R _ { d } \right) \right] .</LATEX> Results

877u | We consider all possible scenarios in interpreting the often-said 'progressive' inhibition of respiration by light, and examine, based on Eqn 1, the consequence of these scenarios on the shape of <LATEX>A - I _ { a b }</LATEX> curves within a range of the low irradiances (Fig. 3).
