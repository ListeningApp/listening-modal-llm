You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

qvnu | As of my last knowledge update in September 2021, Pakistan has implemented several legal measures to address hate speech and its impact on society. It's important to note that legal frameworks can evolve, so I recommend checking with up-to-date sources to get the most current information. Here are some of the key legal measures that were in place or under consideration:
kggw | 1. Pakistan Penal Code (PPC):
xrd1 | The Pakistan Penal Code contains several provisions that can be used to address hate speech and incitement to violence. Sections 153A, 295A, 298, and 505 deal with offenses related to promoting enmity between different groups on the grounds of religion, race, ethnicity, or language, and deliberate acts intended to outrage religious feelings. These provisions criminalize hate speech that incites violence or promotes hostility. Pakistan Penal Code (PPC): The Pakistan Penal Code has been in place since its enactment in 1860 during British rule. The specific sections related to hate speech, such as Sections 153A, 295A, 298, and 505, have been part of the code since its inception.
5746 | 2. Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (PECA) 2016:
7toz | PECA, enacted in 2016, includes provisions aimed at regulating online activities and combatting cybercrimes, including hate speech and incitement. Section 10 of PECA deals with offenses related to glorification of an offense and hate speech. Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (PECA) 2016: The Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act was enacted by the Pakistani government on August 11, 2016. It outlines various offenses related to cybercrime, including provisions to address hate speech and online harassment.
j346 | 3. Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) 1997:
v8uq | Certain forms of hate speech that incite violence or promote terrorism can also be dealt with under the Anti-Terrorism Act. This law provides mechanisms for identifying and prosecuting individuals or groups that engage in hate speech that is linked to terrorism or extremist activities. Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) 1997: The Anti-Terrorism Act was enacted in 1997 as a response to terrorism and extremism. It provides legal mechanisms to combat terrorism-related offenses, which can include hate speech that incites violence or promotes extremism.
x972 | 4. Defamation Laws:
cwrw | While defamation laws primarily focus on protecting an individual's reputation, they can also be used to address hate speech that targets an individual or a group based on their characteristics, beliefs, or identity.
4i0e | 5. Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (PEMRA):
h2l3 | PEMRA is responsible for regulating electronic media, including television and radio broadcasts. It has the authority to take action against content that promotes hate speech, violence, or incitement on electronic media platforms. PEMRA was established in 2002, and its regulatory role over electronic media, including addressing hate speech on television and radio broadcasts, has been ongoing since its inception.
dfzb | 6. Cybercrime Reporting Portals:
u6ty | Government agencies and bodies such as the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) provide online portals where citizens can report instances of hate speech and cybercrimes. These platforms allow individuals to report offensive content for investigation and potential legal action.
awvu | 7. National Action Plan (NAP) Against Terrorism:
on9b | The National Action Plan includes provisions for countering hate speech and extremism. While not solely focused on legal measures, it encompasses various strategies to address radicalization and hate speech through education, awareness campaigns, and the promotion of tolerance.
a8ge | It's important to note that the effectiveness of these legal measures can vary based on factors such as enforcement, societal attitudes, and evolving challenges presented by digital communication. In recent years, concerns have been raised about potential misuse of these laws for silencing dissent or curbing freedom of expression. Balancing the need to combat hate speech while preserving democratic values remains a challenge.
