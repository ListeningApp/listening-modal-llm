        "content": "320g | Two hundred eighty-two Anne Cutler\ntp8g | In German, the same result appeared when ERPs were recorded as listeners made decisions about correctly stressed versus mis-stressed words: KAnal instead of kaNAL produced a deviant electrophysiological response, while kaNU instead of KAnu did not.\ngxfd | The suggestion from these cross-linguistic comparisons is that mis-stressing is more harmful in other stress languages than in English. In English, deviant stress sometimes seems to have no effect at all. Thus, Slowiaczek presented listeners with a sentence context and a stress pattern and asked them to judge a target word for acceptability; she found that the stress pattern information was often ignored, in that listeners responded \"yes\" to words which were semantically acceptable in the context but did not have the target stress pattern.\ns2v1 | A cross-splicing study by Fear, Cutler, and Butterfield suggested that listeners pay more attention to the distinction between full and reduced vowels than to stress distinctions among full syllables. Listeners in this study heard tokens of words such as audience, auditorium, audition, addition, in which the initial vowels had been exchanged between words; they rated cross-splicings among any of the first three of these as insignificantly different from the original, unspliced tokens. Lower ratings were received only by cross-splicings involving an exchange between the initial vowel of addition (which is reduced) and the initial vowel of any of the other three words. Especially the vowels in stressed syllables seem to be important to listeners. Bond compared the disruptive effects on word recognition of several types of segmental distortion; most disruptive was distortion of vowels in stressed syllables. The number of features involved in disruption of a stressed vowel is irrelevant; any replacement of such a vowel is harmful. Likewise, mispronunciations in stressed syllables inhibit phantom word recognitions resulting from the combination of dichotically presented input.\njkp9 | Eleven point four. Conclusion\nz8tt | Unsurprisingly, given the distribution of psycholinguistic laboratories across the world, a majority of the research concerning the use of stress information in spoken-word recognition has been carried out in English. However, the role of lexical stress in word recognition may not be the same in English and in other free-stress languages. The evidence certainly suggests that stress cues play a role in the initial activation of lexical forms in those languages where it contributes significant information to word identification; Dutch, German, and Spanish all appear to be included in this category. English is less clearly a good member of the category; English listeners can use stress information in activation if given the opportunity, but the opportunity in fact arises less often in word discrimination in English than in the other languages studied. Furthermore, several experimental demonstrations of better use of English stress information by nonnative than by native speakers now exist. Thus the language in which most psycholinguistic research is conducted unfortunately turns out to be rather unrepresentative in the role its word prosody plays in word recognition.\n9g22 | Recommendations for future research are therefore obvious. More laboratory investigations of the role of stress in word recognition in other languages with\n41fx | lexical stress are needed. The application of new techniques to study lexical processing on line is also recommended. But it is not only in spoken-word recognition that the predominance of research on English has skewed the picture of lexical stress perception. The fact that most early studies were carried out in a language with free stress, i.e., in which stress can fall at different positions in different words, also determined expectations in later research. Stress is certainly the same across all stress languages in that it always refers to a distinction between those syllables which may express accentual prominence and those which may not; but its manifestations are different in free- versus fixed-stress languages. In English and similar languages, stressed syllables and unstressed syllables differ acoustically, and much research effort focused on the perceptual consequences of this. But in fixed-stress languages, as Section eleven point two described, such intrinsic acoustic differences between stressed and unstressed syllables are not necessarily to be expected. There are at least as many fixed- as free-stress languages in the world. In fixed-stress languages, too, far more perceptual research is needed. In all cases, effects due to intrinsic characteristics of stressed versus unstressed syllables must be distinguished from effects which arise from differences in the applicability of intonational prominence.\n7um8 | of accent in Finnish.
