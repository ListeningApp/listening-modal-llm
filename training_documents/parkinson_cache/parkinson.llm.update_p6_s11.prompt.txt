You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.

These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

o1qp | One of the few preclinical studies characterizing DNAJC6 reveals that auxilin down- regulation leads to progressive dopaminergic neuronal loss and motor disabilities in Drosophila. Furthermore, loss of auxilin exacerbates a-synuclein overexpression and paraquat (an environmental toxin)-mediated dopaminergic loss, thus aggravating previously established phenotypes in fly models of PD (Song et al. 2017). Interestingly, the brains (deep
jrik | cerebellar nuclei) of adult homozygous auxilin knockout (KO) mice revealed an increased number of CCVs and empty cages at the synapse. Similar defects were noted in primary cortical and hippocampal neurons accompanied by defective SV endocytosis (Yim et al. 2010). Also, impairment was not immediately detrimental to the neurons, which may explain the post-developmental onset of PD symptoms and slow disease progression. Evaluating whether similar disruptions occur in nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons and how it mediates pathogenesis will prove crucial in understanding the role of auxilin and the E-L system in PD. An initial step towards this suggest that LRRK2 phosphorylates auxilin, attenuating auxilin'ss normal function in human iPSC derived dopaminergic neurons. The study further revealed that phosphorylation of auxilin by overexpressing LRRK2 leads to accumulation of oxidized dopamine and a-synuclein overexpression, pathological hallmarks of PD (Nguyen & Krainc 2018). Whether loss-of-function mutations in auxilin independently exert pathology through the same mechanisms is unknown. However, this newfound link between LRRK2 and auxilin points to the crucial and widespread involvement of E-L system in PD pathogenesis.
xv78 | GAK: GAK is another DNAJC family protein (DNAJC26/Auxilin 2), homologous (~50%) to auxilin but expressed throughout the body (Lemmon 2001). In a meta-analysis of PD GWAS across 13, 708 patients and 95, 282 controls (Nalls et al. 2014), GAK was identified as a risk gene for PD which was confirmed in another recent largescale study (Chang et al. 2017) (Table 1). However, GAK's role in PD is still contentious due to presence of mutations in TMEM175 in a nearby independent locus, which shares the same promoter as that of GAK. What adds credence is that, like auxilin, GAK functions in clathrin un-coating by recruiting Hsc70 to CCVs (Lemmon 2001) (Figure 1C). Results show that GAK overexpression can partially compensate for loss of auxilin, which is also noted to upregulate naturally in auxilin-KO mice (Yim et al. 2010). Another similarity between auxilin and GAK has been noted in their interaction with LRRK2 (Jinn et al. 2017; Nguyen & Krainc 2018). Brain-specific loss of GAK and ubiquitous KO of GAK are both lethal (postnatal and embryonic, respectively) (Lee et al. 2008a). The inability of auxilin to compensate for GAK in these mice suggests another unique role for GAK in neurons, perhaps a significant one in dopaminergic neurons. Further TMEM175 deficiency is noted to cause PD-like a-synuclein aggregation, along with impairment of lysosomal and mitochondrial function (Jinn et al. 2017). Clarity on the role of GAK will prove to be crucial not only in establishing its involvement in PD but also in consolidating CME as the prime target in PD pathogenesis.
sdks | RME-8: Receptor mediated endocytosis 8 (RME-8) or DNAJC13 is another DNAJC family co-chaperone and principally functions in regulating retromer and clathrin un-coating dynamics on endosomes (Gorenberg & Chandra 2017) (Figure 1C). RME-8 mutations (p.N855S) in autosomal-dominant PD (PARK21) was noted first in a Dutch-German- Russian family of Mennonite origin, with multiple incidences (Table 1) (Vilarino-Guell et al. 2014; Gustavsson et al. 2015). Post-mortem brains of PD patients with RME-8 mutations revealed strong immunoreactivity for Lewy bodies in the substantia nigra, along with brain areas implicated in non-motor symptoms of PD. Nigral Lewy bodies were also found to be co-localized with RME-8 (Vilarino-Guell et al. 2014). Unlike other DNAJC proteins

521q | implicated in PD, in vitro studies have revealed that, the RME-8 mutation confers toxic gain- of-function, leading to endolysosomal cargo trafficking deficits (Norris et al. 2017). The RME-8 mutation is also predicted to affect overall endosomal trafficking, even in the soma and postsynaptic compartment (Vilarino-Guell et al. 2014), unlike the synapse-specific dysfunction predicted for auxilin. Recently, the link between RME-8 and PD has been muddied by an independent analysis of the same Mennonite family which did not find RME-8 mutations. Instead, all the affected individuals were identified to carry mutations in TMEM230 (Deng et al. 2016), which also functions in E-L system, perhaps at synapses. Hence, further studies are warranted to confirm the genetic link between RME-8 and PD. Still, evaluating the RME-8 mediated E-L system dysfunction might provide valuable insights in understanding PD.
