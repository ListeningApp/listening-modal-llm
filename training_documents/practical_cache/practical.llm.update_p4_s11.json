For infants younger than thirty days, this result dropped to fifty percent. This compromises the ability of MR cholecystopancreatography to exclude the diagnosis of biliary atresia at the optimal time for surgery.\nnv42 | Hepatobiliary scintigraphy\nxags | Hepatobiliary scintigraphy uses Technetium ninety-nine m-labelled iminodiacetic acid derivatives as a radiotracer. Patient preparation for imaging should include phenobarbital to activate liver excretory enzymes and increase bile flow for a minimum of three to five days before the hepatobiliary imaging study. Scintigraphy can exclude biliary atresia by demonstrating transit of radiotracer into the bowel. Cholescintigraphic images should be acquired at multiple times up to twenty-four hours.\njc47 | A meta-analysis by Kianifar et al. included eighty-one studies reporting a sensitivity of ninety-nine point three percent, a specificity of seventy-five point one percent, a positive likelihood ratio of three point one nine, a negative likelihood ratio of zero point zero seven, and a diagnostic odds ratio of sixty point one. The negative predictive value was high, about one hundred percent, but the positive predictive value was lower and false-positive results occurred in some patients with severe medical cholestasis. In hepatobiliary scintigraphy studies, renal or urinary excretion of the tracer could be confused with transit of radiotracer into the bowel and lead to a false-negative result.\nko3c | Percutaneous cholecysto-cholangiography\nxek3 | Seven percutaneous cholecysto-cholangiography studies were identified for initial review. Four were identified as\nbbpr | relevant. Percutaneous cholecysto-cholangiography is a US-guided technique performed under general anaesthesia or sedation with local anaesthesia. A twenty-two to twenty-five-gauge needle is used to puncture the gallbladder through the liver parenchyma and inject a nonionic contrast medium to obtain a cholangiogram. Antibiotic prophylaxis is usually given. Bile aspiration, when the gallbladder is distended enough, allows for sampling of bile for biochemical studies in suspected genetic cholestasis. The decision to perform a percutaneous cholecysto-cholangiography is informed by case-by-case discussion. If the gallbladder is visible, one may try to puncture it, while acknowledging the risk involved. Lee et al. reported no complications related to percutaneous cholecysto-cholangiography and obtained a technical success in eighteen of twenty-two procedures. Percutaneous cholecysto-cholangiography has a spatial resolution higher than MR cholecystopancreatography and allows observation of the direct progression of the iodine in the biliary tract. It is useful to confirm or rule out biliary atresia in difficult cases. The absence of retrograde filling of contrast in the intrahepatic bile ducts is highly suggestive of biliary atresia. In some cases of biliary atresia, there is a very thin and irregular opacification of the intrahepatic bile ducts and no opacification of the duodenum. In non-biliary atresia cholestasis, opacification of intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts and duodenum is always seen. Some typical patterns may allow differential diagnosis, such as in neonatal sclerosing cholangitis.

Hepatobiliary scintigraphy with an eight by five matrix, two minutes per image with the first eighty minutes after injection of ninety-nine Technetium-mebrofenin, shows retention of tracer within the liver parenchyma and no visible gallbladder or excretion of tracer into the intestine.

Zhou et al. proposed percutaneous cholecysto-cholangiography by using contrast-enhanced US in infants suspected of having biliary atresia with equivocal US findings and a gallbladder longer than one point five centimeters. This is an interesting pilot study in which biliary atresia was diagnosed in four patients and excluded in five patients without procedural-related complications. However, further studies are necessary to evaluate the diagnostic performance and limits of this technique. It is noteworthy that the technique can be performed only when a gallbladder lumen is accessible.\nbqfb | Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography\nwwdt | Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was performed to evaluate the patency of the biliary tree in the diagnosis of biliary atresia in some tertiary referral centres. Full delineation of the biliary system excludes biliary atresia. Another sign includes the absence or presence of bile at the site of the papilla. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography requires specific infant endoscopy equipment not available at many centres; it is usually performed under general anaesthesia. The endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography sensitivity ranges between eighty-six percent and one hundred percent, with the specificity seventy-nine to ninety-four percent, positive predictive value eighty-eight to ninety-six percent and negative predictive value one hundred percent.\nmn1r | Percutaneous liver biopsy\n```",
