You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

1mvw | Public opinion polls and covert colonialism in British Hong Kong
6d4s | Abstract
mqah | This article examines colonial statecraft and state-society relations in a pivotal period for Hong Kong. Using historical methods and archival evidence, it overcomes the limitations in existing research, which is often theoretically driven and reliant on published sources. The article reveals that the Hong Kong masses were made structurally invisible by the Movement of Opinion Direction (MOOD), a polling exercise introduced by the reformist colonial state. The public were unaware that their views were disseminated to policymakers and that they affected policy formulation: this was covert colonialism. The article investigates confidential MOOD reports generated by the Home Affairs Department from 1975 to 1980, demonstrating why and how the colonial administration constructed public opinion. By disclosing what these secret files reveal about changing public attitudes towards the colonial government, the United Kingdom and the People's Republic of China (PRC), the article also provides new insights into public receptions of the state's reforms and potential threats to the colonial regime in the 1970s.
xxr8 | From the 1980s, there has been considerable polling of public opinion in Hong Kong, undertaken for example for the Hong Kong Transition Project and the Hong Kong University Public Opinion Programme. Prior to the 1960s, the colonial state in Hong Kong did not consult the public directly. Ambrose King described the administrative sys- tem as a 'synarchy': 'a joint administration shared by both British rulers and non-British,
rl4j | predominantly Chinese leaders'.1 There were few channels for the public to raise their grievances. The Urban Council was the only institution with democratically elected mem- bers. Nonetheless, only two of 10 were elected councilors and its franchise remained extremely limited. Although the franchise was slightly widened in 1965, its authority was rarely extended. This was mainly because of the colonial government's reluctance to introduce a 'significantly more democratic local government'. Senior civil servants firmly believed in the efficiency of a centralized administration and were concerned that an increasingly democratic local government would lead the Chinese government to believe that Hong Kong was 'moving down the path to independence'.2 As a result, a strong sense of 'alienation' was felt by Hong Kong society.3 The Star Ferry Riots in 1966 first 'revealed the existence of considerable social discontent' in the colony.4 A communication gap between the state and society was evident.5 It was then when the colonial government started recognizing that 'an unreformed law and order' was 'unsustainable' and 'new forms of legitimation' were required.6 Nonetheless, no regular opinion polls were con- ducted at this point. Opinions of the public were only gauged on an ad hoc basis in response to the riots by the Commission of Inquiry, the Secretary of Chinese Affairs, and the police force.7 The leftist-inspired riots in 1967 represented a new ""test" or a "ques- tion" of legitimacy' for the colonial government.8 To prevent future upheavals, the state reformed.9 The introduction of the City District Officer Scheme in 1968 widened channels of political participation without introducing democratization or delegating further execu- tive power to the Urban Council.10 It signified a departure from the colonial government's ruling strategies. The scheme was 'a multifunctional political structure'.11 Ten City District Offices were set up to provide policymakers with intelligence about public opin- ion, to explain the state's policies, to answer public enquiries, and to manage district affairs. This reform sought to incorporate the lower strata of society into the administra- tive authority. City District Officers observed the people of Hong Kong in their everyday lives and surveyed them collectively via District Monthly Meetings and Study Groups, which were new devices 'geared primarily to reach local leaders'; Town Talk, a new con- fidential official publication, was oriented towards ordinary people.12
vz32 | The City District Officer Scheme has not been thoroughly explored. Most of the schol- arship so far touches on it briefly and is theoretically driven. Steve Tsang, John Carroll, and Ian Scott, for example, have provided a short institutional history of the scheme, mainly focusing on the background in which it was introduced and its functions.13 King's article published in 1975 is the most recent article with a detailed account of the scheme. King's work mainly relies on published sources and small-scale oral interviews: it is impressionistic. His article does not show how the colonial state constructed and moni- tored public opinion using the Movement of Opinion Direction (MOOD), a significant innovation, and state-funded public opinion polling before the 1980s.
ncb0 | The 1970s was an important period for Hong Kong. It was an age of rising affluence, political consciousness, and policy initiatives. A detailed and longitudinal view of state- society relations in the 1970s is vital because these years were precursors to political and social changes in the 1980s and beyond. Using historical methods, this study exam- ines MOOD, a bureaucratic instrument, which was produced by the Home Affairs Department to monitor shifts in public sentiments, complementing the City District Officer Scheme and other longer-established indirect mechanisms to gauge public
8mp0 | attitudes. The department started producing confidential MOOD reports in 1975 and the last issue of MOOD accessible at the Hong Kong Public Record Office was printed in 1980: this is the range covered by this article. This article demonstrates how the state, by observing and surveying ordinary people, constructed public opinion. It argues that by using MOOD, the bureaucracy was making the Hong Kong masses structurally invisible. Although high-ranked officers were fully aware of MOOD, which was embed- ded in the City District Officer programme, its presence was concealed from the public. People therefore unconsciously took part in policy formulation: this was covert coloni- alism. Deploying relatively sophisticated sampling techniques, MOOD informed colo- nial bureaucrats about popular responses to its reforms.
