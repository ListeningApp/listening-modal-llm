You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

r5hm | 2. Sticks
o949 | VCs can wield a number of sticks to compel the class of common shareholders to vote for the trade sale. However, these sticks cannot prevent a lawsuit and may in fact increase the likelihood of one.
yc87 | a. Cross-Voting
onea | To eliminate common shareholders' ability to block a trade sale, VCs can either partially convert their shares into common stock or exercise warrants to buy common stock so as to acquire a sufficient amount of common stock to achieve the necessary approval threshold. Consider the transactions in Orban v. Field,58 a Delaware case involving a common-shareholder lawsuit against a VC-controlled board. Office Mart, a Delaware corporation, arranged to be acquired by Staples in a merger that provided no payout to its common shareholders.59 The charter allowed preferred shareholders to vote alongside common shareholders on an as-converted basis (as if their stock had been
jxk6 | Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2221033
fugp | CARROTS AND STICKS
znlx | converted into common shares), and the preferred shareholders had enough votes to ensure shareholder approval of the transaction as required by corporate law.60 However, for accounting reasons, Staples insisted that at least 90% of Office Mart's common shares be voted in favor of the transaction.61 Common shareholders, led by Office Mart's founder and former CEO George Orban, refused to back the deal, demanding $4 million in exchange for their votes.62
yf7f | Office Mart's board refused to provide a carve-out to common.63 Instead, the board arranged a series of transactions that, in essence, assisted the VCs in converting a portion of their preferred stock into common, thereby diluting the original common position down to less than 10% of the class.64 The VCs, now holding over 90% of the common stock, voted their common stock in favor of the merger, which allowed the transaction to go forward and wiped out the original common shareholders. The maneuver cost the VCs nothing; although the partial conversion into common reduced the VCs' aggregate liquidation preferences, it still left them with enough liquidation preferences to absorb all of the merger consideration. Orban sued, arguing that Office Mart's board had violated its fiduciary duties to common shareholders. The Delaware Chancery ruled in favor of the board, concluding that the "common stockholders had no legal right to a portion of the merger consideration under Delaware law or the corporate charter"65 and noting that "[t]here is no claim" that the challenged transaction "was not in the best interests of the corporation."66
lhgm | b. Vote Buying
9pr0 | VCs can also overcome common-shareholder opposition by buying the votes of shareholders, such as executives, who already own a large block of common stock. For instance, assume that three executives of a startup collectively hold 55% of the common stock and that a trade sale cannot occur without approval by 50% of the common shareholders. Rather than providing a carve-out to all common shareholders, the VCs could simply award each of these three individuals a lucrative cash bonus or other payment in connection with a trade sale in exchange (implicitly) for voting their common shares in favor of the transaction. Vote buying via payments to executives can thus kill two birds-executive opposition to the trade sale and

kd51 | common-shareholder opposition to the trade sale-with one stone.
15ob | Alternatively, a VC-controlled board can issue (additional) common shares to certain executives or employees who expect to gain from the board's proposed transaction and will thus vote their common shares in favor of the transaction.67 Although vote buying in some or all of these cases may violate the board's duty to refrain from improperly tampering with the shareholder vote,68 it is very difficult to prove that the purpose of a particular payment or equity issuance to executives or employees is to buy votes.
zxxt | C. Carrots vs. Sticks
0pqj | We have seen that VCs have at their disposal both carrots and sticks to induce entrepreneurial teams to cooperate in trade sales. Carrots tend to involve out-of-pocket costs. For example, carve-outs to common come solely at the VCs' expense.69 But many sticks, such as threats to terminate or blacklist a founder or other executives, do not involve any cash outlay.70
rmbb | However, sticks can give rise to substantial indirect costs. First, although litigation is unlikely in any given case, the use of sticks may well increase the risk of litigation, which, should it occur, can be very costly in terms of VCs' time and reputation.71 Second, VCs may be deterred from "misbehaving"
mkac | Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2221033
phvu | CARROTS AND STICKS
hgvv | because of reputational considerations.72 As websites like TheFunded.com make the world smaller and more transparent, and serial entrepreneurs play a more important role in startups, the reputational costs to VCs who bully entrepreneurial teams with sticks are likely to become higher. Thus, both carrots and sticks can be costly to VCs.
dlt6 | IV RESEARCH SAMPLE
jsgc | A. Sample Population
5m4j | We study the use of carrots and sticks in trade sales of VC-backed startups using a hand-collected data set of VC-backed Silicon Valley firms. This section describes the data-collection process and provides descriptive statistics for the firms in our sample.
0ksn | 1. Data Gathering
r5il | The data used for this project were collected in 2005-2007 as part of a study supported by the Kaufmann Foundation and the University of California, Berkeley. We obtained from VentureReporter.net a list of VC-financed companies located in California that were sold in trade sales in either 2003 or 2004. We filtered out all firms except those located in and around San Francisco, San Jose, and Oakland (broadly defined as "Silicon Valley"),73 leaving a population of 193 firms.
tarp | For each firm, we next sought to locate and obtain data from one or more persons knowledgeable about the firm's life-including the circumstances surrounding its sale. We identified the current business addresses for the founders and executives-all of whom we call "entrepreneurs" for convenience-of 141 of the 193 companies. We mailed letters asking entrepreneurs from each firm to provide us with data, promising to keep confidential the identity of the entrepreneur and the startup firm.
7orp | Entrepreneurs from 57 of the 141 firms agreed to provide us with data-a response rate of 40.4%. The information obtained, supplemented by publicly filed corporate charters, covered each firm's entire life span. Among the data gathered were the state of incorporation; cash-flow rights and control rights negotiated in each VC financing round; the identities and backgrounds of the CEO and directors; and the circumstances and terms of the sale,

m9d6 | including amounts paid to management and various classes of shareholders. .
v2z1 | From the original set of 57 firms, we removed seven for lack of adequate data, leaving us with 50 firms. In most of these sales (42 out of 50), the VCs exited as preferred shareholders. In the remaining eight firms, the VCs converted into common stock in connection with the sale, giving up their liquidation preferences.
sqwj | 2. Selection Issues
awzg | Because our sample is limited to Silicon Valley firms sold in 2003 or 2004, one must be somewhat cautious about extrapolating from our firms to VC-backed firms generally. Silicon Valley is a close-knit community with its own norms and ways of doing business.74 Our sample firms were sold several years after the tech bubble collapsed, a period in which VCs lost considerable amounts of money.75 These losses may have heightened the conflicts between VCs and entrepreneurial teams around exit events. The use of carrots and sticks within our sample firms could thus be a function of the post-bubble time period and factors unique to Silicon Valley, limiting the generalizability of our results.76
oh59 | B. Sample Description
atpb | Our sample firms are "high-tech" businesses, primarily in the biotech, software, telecommunications, and internet sectors (Panel A of Table 1). The concentration of IT-related businesses is representative of VC-financed firms generally.77 At the time of sale, the firms had received an average of $42 million in VC funding and had been operating for an average of
nj8u | Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2221033
iztk | CARROTS AND STICKS
06cl | approximately five years. The mean sale price is $55 million. Panel B of Table 1 provides information on the amount invested, financing rounds, years of operation, and sale price.
lnru | INSERT TABLE 1 HERE
easn | C. VCs' Ex Ante Cash and Control Rights
w35f | We now turn to describe, for each of the firms in our sample, (1) the VCs' cash-flow rights; (2) the entrepreneurial team's board seats and shareholder-voting rights; and (3) the identity of the CEO at the time of sale.
g9eh | 1. VCs' Cash-Flow Rights
6r18 | Across all 50 firms, VCs' aggregate liquidation preferences at the time of sale are, on average, $47 million. In the first round of financing, the liquidation preference usually equals the amount invested (a "1x preference"), while the liquidation preference in subsequent rounds is more likely to be a higher multiple (i.e., 2x or 3x) of the amount invested (Panel C).78 At sale, aggregate liquidation preferences are on average somewhat greater than the amount invested (Panel B).
iein | When VCs retain their preferred stock rather than converting to common stock, the allocation of the sale proceeds depends on the relationship between liquidation preferences and the sale price. If liquidation preferences exceed the sale price and contractual priority is fully respected, common shareholders get nothing. Liquidation preferences exceed the sale price in 31 of the 42 firms in which VCs exit as preferred shareholders (Panel D). Absent a carrot, common shareholders as a class have little incentive to approve a merger when their equity is underwater. In eight firms, it was in the VCs' interest to convert to common stock rather than maintain their liquidation preferences, meaning that the sale proceeds were allocated pro rata among all common shareholders (the original common shareholders and the converting VCs).
ver7 | 2. Power of the Entrepreneurial Team
wavr | This section describes the extent of the entrepreneurial teams' blocking power-their board seats and corporate-law rights-in our sample firms. The data are summarized in Table 2.
l8tf | a. Board Seats
530t | Recall that board approval is required for a trade sale. Thus, the entrepreneurial team may be able to impede a sale through its influence on the

mfau | board. We divide directors into three categories: (1) VC appointed, (2) common-shareholder appointed, and (3) independent (outside). If a particular outside director had been selected exclusively by either the VCs or the common shareholders, we designate this person as a VC or common-shareholder director, regardless of how contracting documents label the board seat.79
cwmr | Panel A reports the allocation of board seats. At the time of sale, 56.5% of all directors were appointed by the VCs, and 22.8% were appointed by the common shareholders. Panel B shows that the VCs controlled the board in 29 of the 50 firms (58%). In our sample, common shareholders rarely controlled the board at the time of the sale (three of the 50 firms). However, in 21 of the 50 firms, the combination of independent directors and common shareholders could have blocked a sale.
cia8 | ADD TABLE 2 HERE
l3mx | b. Shareholder Rights
e7qf | All our companies were incorporated in either California or Delaware at the time of their sales, consistent with findings that most VC-backed firms incorporate either in their home state or in Delaware.80 Panel C shows that 35 out of 50 firms were incorporated in Delaware at the time of the sale. As we explain below, California law may give the entrepreneurial team somewhat more power vis-à-vis VCs through both voting rights and the threat of fiduciary litigation.
lx02 | (1) Voting rights. California and Delaware provide different voting rights for shareholders. In Delaware, mergers typically need to be approved by only the holders of a majority of all of the firm's outstanding stock, both preferred and common.81 We find that at the time of sale, VCs almost always have sufficient voting power to dictate the outcome of a shareholder-wide vote.82 California, on the other hand, requires a separate vote for each class of shareholders.83 Thus, when the VCs remain preferred shareholders, common shareholders of firms domiciled in California can more easily impede a sale they oppose.
oa6t | Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2221033
29z1 | CARROTS AND STICKS
ue8g | But it is not that simple. California purports to subject "quasi- California" corporations (corporations doing business in California but incorporated elsewhere) to the requirement of separate class votes.84 While California's legal ability to impose this requirement on firms incorporated elsewhere is contested, many (but not all) Delaware-incorporated companies located in California are advised by lawyers to hold separate class votes. In our sample, all but one Delaware-incorporated firm held a separate class vote for the common shareholders.
swx4 | Thus, as a practical matter, incorporation in California rather than in Delaware may not give common shareholders much more power through voting rights. Nevertheless, common shareholders' ability to impede a transaction is still likely to be somewhat greater in a California-incorporated firm, where a separate class vote is indisputably mandatory.85
zci3 | (2) Fiduciary litigation. During the years in which our sample firms were sold, Delaware law appeared to permit a VC-controlled board to make decisions that favor preferred shareholders at the expense of the common shareholders unless the common shareholders could show that the decision was not in the "best interests of the corporation."86 In contrast, California law generally affords stronger protection to minority shareholders, including common shareholders in firms with VC-controlled boards.87 Thus, directors of California-domiciled firms may have believed they faced greater risk of liability for harming common shareholders.88

0nw6 | 3. Founders' Position in the Firm
rmyq | The entrepreneurial team is likely to have a greater incentive to block a trade sale if the founder is still the CEO. First, a founder-CEO is likely to own more common stock than a replacement CEO; everything else equal, he or she will thus face a greater loss of option value if the firm is sold. Second, a founder-CEO may derive greater nonfinancial benefits from the business and thus may have additional incentive to keep the firm independent.
sf1m | The entrepreneurial team may also have greater ability to impede a sale if the founder is still the CEO. A founder-CEO is likely to have substantially more common stock than a hired CEO, giving him more shareholder-blocking power. Compared to a hired CEO, the founder-CEO is also likely to have longer and deeper relationships with other directors and common shareholders. As a result, the founder-CEO is likely to have influence over directors and other common shareholders, increasing the likelihood that directors will resist the trade sale and further increasing the likelihood that common shareholders will vote against the transaction.
27at | To reduce resistance to a trade sale, a firm's VC investors may use their control over the board of directors to replace the CEO before the planned exit. In our 50-firm sample, 29 of the founders (58%) were replaced as CEOs before the firm was sold. However, as we will discuss shortly, none of these replacements appeared to be made to overcome resistance to a trade sale.
