You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

ma93 | Control and manipulation of the virtual environment VR offers the ability to control and manipulate features of the environment that can be used to test and assess rele- vant variables, such as eliciting paranoia in social situ- ations18,31,32 or examining responses to cues within the environment. 12,20,21 Experimental control is a cornerstone of psychological research, enabling direct comparison between conditions to determine causal relationships between vari- ables. Strong methodological rigor can be achieved in VR through careful manipulation of variables across condi- tions in virtual environments.11 For example, Veling et al31 randomized participants with psychosis, siblings, and health controls to conditions with varying levels of social stress within a virtual environment. They found a dose-response relationship between social stress and paranoia, which was associated with psychosis liability, supporting the theory that social stress may account for the relationship between the environment and psychosis. Another example comes from Freeman et al33 who examined experiences of paranoia and perceptions of social rank within a virtual underground train. Participants were placed in two conditions: one where they were taller than others on the train and another where they were shorter. Findings showed that under the condition
c6hh | where they were shorter, participants had a more negative view of themselves relative to others and greater levels of paranoia. The differences in paranoia were fully mediated by social comparison, suggesting that negative views of the self, relative to others, may drive feelings of mistrust.
y7ea | Another capability of VR is that individuals are able to interact with objects within the system, rather than simply observing or imag- ining different scenarios. This not only enhances ecological validity, as interaction is inherent to the real world, but also allows researchers to examine behaviors of individuals within the virtual environment and their impact by manip- ulating different contingencies.34 Previously, this type of research was only possible using actors or "confederates" who performed certain roles within situations, which was costly and limited in ecological validity. Furthermore, the controlled nature of the experience enables greater repro- ducibility relative to field studies where the environment is constantly changing. These capabilities have important implications for social psychology,35 but also for identifying differences characteristic of mental disorders.5 For example, previous studies have demonstrated that exposure of each participant to the same virtual scenario can allow controlled examination of the determinants of paranoid ideation. 18,33,36,37 As such, the enhanced environmental control and interac- tivity of VR allows for standardization of otherwise dynamic variables, ensuring a consistent assessment experience, both over time and across individuals.
nav4 | Personalization and tailoring
gem8 | Because virtual environments are computer-generated or recorded, it is also possible to program tailored VR expe- riences that match individual needs, abilities, or prefer- ences (eg, slowing down a sequence, using text or audio instructions, minimizing distraction). Rizzo et al38 devel- oped a VR-based exposure therapy for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) that enabled the therapist to customize various features of a combat scenario most relevant to the trauma experienced by soldiers. Since effective treatment of PTSD requires exposure to cues of highly idiosyncratic experiences, customization of the virtual environment is an important feature. Such customization also has important
e8nr | utility for assessment purposes, though very little research has examined this to date. For example, functional analysis involves the examination of how symptoms change in rela- tion to different triggers and responses.39 VR could be used to examine changes in symptoms across different situations and in relation to certain cues, for example visual, auditory, and olfactory, allowing precise insight into the determinants of relevant clinical events. Gatti et al40 describe a VR protocol whereby clinicians were able to customize the virtual envi- ronment with personally relevant cues to alcohol craving and behaviors for the purposes of clinical formulation. The ability to perform psychiatric assessment via personalized tests and tasks meaningful to the individual and their situ- ation is powerful but is currently understudied within VR.
k78w | Real-time, automated data capture
g9du | The benefits of using technology for automatic data capture has been well recognized.41 Mobile apps for tracking symp- toms and other clinically relevant information over time42 has been a major area of progress in digital mental health, with findings suggesting that they are feasible and accept- able to individuals.43,44 Researchers are starting to consider how data collected from devices such as smartphone apps and VR might be clinically informative. Patterns in data collected from technology devices, such as movement, speech, and geolocation, have been associated with changes in symptoms45 and may even be used to predict relapse among people with psychosis.42
f682 | It is possible to capture data automatically from users during VR experiences. Eye-tracking software can be integrated with VR,30 capturing a source of data commonly used to identify markers of psychiatric disorders and cognition.46 It is also possible to measure behaviors within the virtual environment, such as decisions about how to navigate and interact with different objects and agents.25 Capturing the temporal relationship between variables in real time (ie, how thoughts, emotions, and behaviors unfold in relation to changes in the environment), makes it possible to test hypothesized processes and causal interactions. Further- more, physiological measures commonly used as objective indicators of psychological states, such as heart rate and galvanic skin response, can be recorded and synced with virtual content or even eye gaze. Mühlberger et al47 devel- oped a VR-delivered behavioral avoidance test (VR-BAT) to assess fear in specific phobia while automatically collecting heart rate, skin conductance, subjective rating of discom-
li1k | fort, and stimulus-approach distance. Results indicated that the physiological measures were good predictors of fear intensity. Others have begun to investigate integrating more sophisticated biosensors, such as wireless electroencepha- lography (EEG), with VR to assess psychologically relevant constructs such as emotional state, with the aim to feed the data back to clinicians for enhanced decision making48 or even within VR itself as biofeedback.49
pbea | Increasing engagement
ccpt | Another benefit of delivering clinical evaluation via VR is the potential to enhance an individual's engagement with the test or assessment. Traditional testing procedures undertaken in mental health can be lengthy, repetitive, and/ or laborious, which may impact individual performance, especially for measures of attention or memory. Therefore, replacing traditional assessment with more engaging, mean- ingful, or enjoyable methods has substantial appeal. This is particularly important given that symptoms such as poor concentration and lack of motivation are common across mental health conditions.50 This application of VR may also be of benefit in young people experiencing mental ill-health, a population where digital technologies are common and their use for mental health is promising. 51
0fpw | VR may enhance engagement with clinical evaluations through the immersive, realistic, enjoyable environments enabled by the technology.52,53 The term "presence" has been used in VR research to refer to the subjective experience of being in a place or environment, even when one is physi- cally situated in another.1 The feeling of presence is influ- enced by the degree of immersion, defined as the extent to which the system generates sensory stimulation consistent with sensorimotor experience (eg, images are updated as the head moves). Sense of presence has traditionally been linked to an individual's level of engagement54 and moti- vation.55 As such, high rates of presence and immersion reported within investigations of clinical uses of VR point to the ability of the technology to enhance engagement with clinical evaluation.56-58 However, it is currently difficult to create VR environments with a high level of realism, which can create a strong aversion to the experience.59
dqn8 | VR could further increase engagement with clinical evalua- tion by adding elements of digital games to the assessments, a process known as "gamification."60 Incorporating features of games, such as rewards and feedback, within VR may
