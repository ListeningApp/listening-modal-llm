        "content": "0i6j | DNAm networks relate to individual and species traits\n87cq | We used signed W-G-C-N-A, an unsupervised analysis, to cluster CpGs with similar methylation dynamics across samples into comethylation modules. We then summarized their methylation profiles as \"module eigengenes.\" The respective eigengenes of these modules were used to identify their potential correlations with various traits within and across mammalian species.\n0qs3 | Our data analysis proceeded in two sequential phases. First, we developed several comethylation networks using data from eleven thousand ninety-nine DNA samples from one hundred seventy-four species (discovery dataset finalized March twenty twenty-one). A eutherian network, network one was formed from fourteen thousand seven hundred five conserved CpGs using this dataset. Later, we generated a second dataset of four thousand three hundred fifty-seven samples from thirty tissues of two hundred forty mammalian species (one hundred seventy-four new species and sixty-six that are represented in the discovery set), which were not used to define modules and were used as an independent validation set. All eutherian modules were present in the independent validation dataset according to module preservation statistics, validating the presence of these modules, cor K-M-E greater than zero point four three, P is less than ten to the negative twenty-second power, median cor K-M-E equals zero point eight four. These modules were designated with colors according to W-G-C-N-A convention. The smallest module, lavenderblush three, consisted of thirty-three CpGs and the largest, turquoise, had one thousand eight hundred sixty-four CpGs.\nz8f7 | To characterize the fifty-five modules with respect to species characteristics, such as maximum life span and average adult weight, module eigengenes were calculated in all samples, discovery and validation set combined, three hundred thirty-one eutherian species. Because information on taxonomic order, tissues, maximum life span, age, sex and adult weight of each species was available,\n7w7j | we were able to assess whether any of the module eigengenes correlated with these traits. Of the fifty-five modules, thirty were found to be correlated with at least one trait. Specifically, fifteen modules were related to taxonomic orders such as primates, rodents, or carnivores. Ten modules related to tissue type, two to sex, one to age, seven to maximum life span, and four to average adult species weight. Some modules were related to multiple characteristics. In the following sections, we mainly focus on the modules that relate to mammalian maximum life span, adult weight, and age. Other modules related to taxonomic order, tissue type, and sex are described in the supplementary materials. We performed two analyses to ascertain whether these eutherian modules are also applicable to marsupials and monotremes. Using the discovery dataset, we first trained a network, network two in both eutherians and marsupials based on only seven thousand nine hundred fifty-six probes that are mappable to both. The color bands under the hierarchical tree reveal that all the network one modules were also preserved in network two. Second, we selected CpGs in network one modules that were also mapped to marsupials or monotremes and confirmed that their eigengene relationships to primary traits were retained in these mammalian clades. For example, the magenta module, which is related to blood in eutherians, was also found to be so in monotremes, which confirms that the network one modules can indeed be applied to other mammalian clades by selecting probes that are also mapped to those clades.\n51vd | A functional enrichment study, accounting for the mammalian array background, revealed that the genes neighboring to module CpGs are implicated in many biological processes including development, immune function, metabolism, reproduction, stem cell biology, stress responses, aging, and various signaling pathways.\nbaj1 | Relationship with protein-protein interactions\nn1wo | We investigated whether the proteins encoded by cognate genes, closest to respective CpGs, within modules are known to mutually interact or predicted to do so by S-T-R-I-N-G protein-protein interaction networks, which integrate known and predicted protein associations from greater than fourteen thousand organisms. A permutation test analysis evaluating the global cluster coefficient of each module showed that fourteen modules are significantly enriched, P is less than point zero zero one, for genes encoding mutually interacting proteins. Overall, these results suggest that comethylation relationships can be reflected at the protein level for a subset of modules.\n5bq3 | Modules related to maximum life span\nezla | To adjust for potential confounders, we used four regression modeling approaches to iden-\nrsbu | tify modules that are associated with the log-transformed maximum life span, dependent variable: (i) a univariate regression model with a covariate that was the module eigengene, averaged per species; (ii) a phylogenetic regression model with a covariate that was again the module eigengene, averaged per species; (iii) a multivariate linear regression model that included the module eigengene, sex, tissue, and relative age as covariates; and (iv) model approach (i) applied to specific tissue types.\nmagd | The marginal analysis identified four modules: magenta, black, midnightblue, and tan, that related significantly to maximum life span, the absolute value of the Pearson correlation exceeded R equals zero point six, Student's T test P is less than one times ten to the negative thirty-third power. The CpGs underlying the implicated modules exhibit the sample patterns, as can be seen from corresponding heatmaps. Phylogenetic regression also identified associations of the same modules. Our fourth modeling approach, i.e., the tissue-stratified marginal analysis, indicates that the relationship of modules to maximum life span is often tissue specific. For example, the magenta and midnightblue modules relate to maximum life span in lung and liver. By contrast, the black module relates to maximum life span only in skin, and the tan module exhibited a weak relationship to life span in the tissue-specific analysis.",
