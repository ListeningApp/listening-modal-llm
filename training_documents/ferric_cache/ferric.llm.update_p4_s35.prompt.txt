You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.

These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

b780 | 2 (Figure S16). The addition of catalase or superoxide dismutase (SOD) did not significantly affect the accumulation of product in single-turnover experiments, ruling out that product was formed via a H2O2 shunt pathway or from the reaction of released superoxide to the ferrous enzyme (Figure 4B). Quantitation of the product revealed a highly efficient process, resulting in 0.68 ± 0.12 molar equivalents of 2 per enzyme, while <LATEX>0 . 1 \pm 0 . 0 2</LATEX> equivalents of <LATEX>H _ { 2 } O</LATEX> per enzyme was also produced (Figure 4B), accounting for nearly all <LATEX>\left( \sim 9 0 \right)</LATEX> of the <LATEX>O _ { 2 }</LATEX> and redox equivalents provided during the experiment. We were unable to observe any product in single-turnover experiments when 3 was used as the substrate, and H2O2 quantitation indicated significantly more H2O2 was generated, consistent with the autooxidation behavior shown in stopped-flow experiments (Figure S17).
ccmb | Evidence for HAT by a CYP Ferric Superoxide. To further probe the nature of the AspB-oxy reaction with the native substrate, we compared the rate of decay of the intermediate under single turnover conditions in stopped-flow experiments in <LATEX>H _ { 2 } O</LATEX> and D2O. As both the DKP and indole N- <LATEX>H</LATEX> protons are exchangeable in solvent, we preincubated the E:S complex in deuterated buffer to achieve deuteration at both sites. We observed a normal solvent kinetic isotope effect <LATEX>\left( k _ { \mathrm { H } } / k _ { \mathrm { D } } \right)</LATEX> of <LATEX>2 . 6 \pm 0 . 3</LATEX> (Figure 5A, Table S6), in stark contrast to
ma93 | the inverse KSIE observed when using surrogate redox partners. This implies a change in the rate-limiting step under single turnover conditions and strongly implicates the AspB-oxy species for affecting the N-H(D) cleavage. For comparison, we performed the same experiments with 3 to determine if a KSIE is observed in autoxidation, since it has been suggested that hydrogen bonding may also play a role in the stability of the oxy complex.36,41 However, only minor KSIEs for both phases for autoxidation were observed (KH/kp = 1.3 ± 0.2 and 1.4 ± 0.2 for the first and second decay phases, respectively) (Table S7). N-H abstraction by AspB-oxy would provide a proton and electron to form the ferric hydroperoxo complex. Due to the highly transient nature of this intermediate, which has only be observed in CYPs at cryogenic temperatures using cryoradiolysis and calibrated thermal annealing, we were unsurprisingly unable to observe this species in stopped-flow experiments. However, to examine the
c6hh | role of the subsequent steps involved in downstream dimerization, we replaced the conserved threonine residue at position 244 with an alanine (T244A), which has been rigorously examined in CYPs to be crucial for maintaining correct protonation of the distal oxygen for efficient O-O bond scission to form CYP-I (Figure 5B).24,43 CYPs that use a ferric peroxo-anion remain functional when the analogous mutation is made.44 Compared to wild-type (WT) AspB, the rate of product formation under multiple turnover conditions is 30- fold slower in T244A (Figure 5C). Consistent with its role in proton-mediated heterolysis, the T244A mutant displays less than 3% coupling of NADPH to the product as compared to 62% in WT (Figure 5D). Furthermore, we were unable to observe any appreciable product formation in single-turnover assays with T244A AspB. This suggests a mechanism by which the conserved threonine in CYP-dimerases retains its canonical role for CYP-I formation and is critical in dimerization steps that occur after initial oxidation.
y7ea | Generalization of a Superoxide-Mechanism to Other CYP DKP Dimerases. Utilizing the enzyme function initiative (EFI) suite of tools, we compared the I-helix sequences of 48 CDPS-associated CYPs (Figure S18). The alcohol residue is highly conserved in these putative CYP-dimerases (typically a Ser), while the acid is replaced with aliphatic residues (typically Val or Ile). This suggests that ferric superoxide reactivity may not be limited to just AspB. To test whether the potential commonality of this mechanism to other types of DKP linkages, we evaluated the metabolic profile of NzeB, which shares ~98% sequence identity to AspB. Using the surrogate redox system, NzeB was found to convert cWP to a mixture of C-C and C-N-linked dimers as previously reported (Figure 6A).18,19 To investigate whether C-C bond formation also
nav4 | proceeds via a ferric superoxide complex, we repeated single turnover experiments with NzeB. Provision of one reducing equivalent and O2 was sufficient to generate the same ensemble of products as those formed under multiple turnover conditions with surrogate redox partners (Figure 6B, Figure S19).
gem8 | DISCUSSION
e8nr | Steady-state analysis of product formation by AspB has revealed a significant inverse kinetic solvent isotope effect, implicating the use of an intermediate prior to CYP-I for the initiation of substrate dimerization. The competent formation of aspergilazine A under conditions when a second electron is omitted suggests that only a single reducing equivalent from a
k78w | redox partner is needed for catalysis to occur. Further support for the reactive nature of a ferric superoxide complex is provided through examination of the single-turnover KSIE of oxy-AspB decay, which reverts to a normal (i.e., kH/kp >1) value due to the suppression of available proton-linked uncoupling pathways.
