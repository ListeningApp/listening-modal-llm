You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

06yq | Microdosing with psychedelics to self-medicate for ADHD symptoms in adults: A naturalistic study

8r5j | ABSTRACT
2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

fqbt | It is impossible to spend time with virtually any religious, philosophical and esotericist group, or even to read its literature, without seeing that a large number of the people involved, perhaps through no fault of their own, and because of ignorance of the problems, are using these formats for sociological or psychological purposes of a narrow kind. It is not that their spiritual life is right in these groups. It is that their social life is inadequate.
rkbk | 'As above, so below'. Just as in ordinary worldly considerations there can be inefficiency or confusion as to aims, so there may be in approaching higher knowledge. You may be able, initially, to pursue higher aims through lower mechanisms and theories, but you cannot pursue them by indulging short-term personal interests.
u1bd | You must follow your personality interests somewhere else. In an advanced society there are more institutions catering for such out- lets than anyone could possibly need. Make sure that your profes- sional, commercial, social, psychological and family needs are ful- filled in the society to which you belong. The rest of you is the part which can be communicated with by means of the specialised techniques available to those who have a comprehensive and legitimate traditional learning: and who have the means of safe- guarding it.
q22z | This is what you have to study first of all. Most people are
l8vb | 260
jrb6 | trying to effect something else, no matter what they imagine that they are doing. Fortunately, it is not hard to recognise this if enough sincere effort is expended.
ptaj | In ordinary life, if you think that your family is largely a commercial proposition, people will point out that you are mis- guided. If you thought that your profession was mainly for social purposes, people would soon put you right. It is time that you were correctly informed in this field as well. You must know, or find out, the difference between meeting to learn and experience something, and meeting in order to be emotionally stimulated or intellectually tested or socially reassured.
nusy | There is no harm at all in a social ingredient in a human relationship: far from it. But when this gets out of balance, and a human contact becomes an excuse for a social contact, you are not going to learn, no matter what materials you are working with. 'Due proportion' is a secret skill of the teacher.
gsnv | The repeated upsurge of apparently different schools of higher study in various epochs and cultures is due in large part to the need to rescue genuine traditional teachings from the automatism and social-psychological-entertainment functions which regularly and deeply invade and, for the most part, eventually possess them.
0mnu | Certain physical and mental exercises, as an example, are of extremely significant importance for the furthering of higher human functions. If these are practised by people who use things for emotional, social or callisthenic purposes, they will not operate on a higher level with such people. They become merely a means of getting rid of surplus energy, or of assuaging a sense of frustra- tion. The practitioners, however, regularly and almost invariably mistake their subjective experiences of them for 'something higher'.
3w0z | It is for this reason that legitimate traditional higher teachings are parsimonious with their materials and exercises. Nobody with a task to perform can possibly (if he knows about his task) do so in a manner which is not benefiting people on the level required.
uwfw | The foregoing information should be read and studied and understood as widely as possible. Without it there is little possi- bility of serving any group of people, anywhere, otherwise than socially or with shallow psychology, no matter what theories, systems or exercises are employed.
0caz | 261
4auz | Where there is ideology, conditioning and indoctrination, a mechanical element is introduced which drives out the factor of extradimensional reality perception which connects the higher functions of the mind with the higher reality.
6nou | Sufi experiences are designed to maintain a harmony with and nearness to this Reality, while mechanical systems effectively dis- tance people from it
xaqk | WHO GUARDS THE COAT
a1ou | Attar, in his Recitals of the Saints, tells a story of the great Sufi Habib Ajami, when he went to a river to wash, leaving his coat lying on the ground. Hasan of Basra was passing and saw it Thinking that someone should look after this property, he stood guard over it until Habib returned.
zae5 | Hasan then asked Habib whom he had left looking after the coat.
oa93 | 'In the care' said Habib, 'of him who gave you the task of looking after it!'
lcuj | This anecdote, intended to indicate the way in which affairs work out for Sufis, is often taken by raw imitators as something to copy, so that they test 'destiny' by abandoning things and neglect- ing duties: with results which correspond with their stage of ignorance.

uipb | Sorrow in 'Spiritual Enterprises'
bjno | Q: How is it that involving themselves in spiritual enterprises can cause so much sorrow and trouble to some people? Some be- come deranged, and worse characters than they ever were before ...
w2lh | A: First, remember that this tendency has been observed and commented upon by all religious and other systems. People are always being driven off their heads by something or other, however respectable the creed, and nobody has yet found any method of preventing this. People sorrow and go mad everywhere, and in everything.
qryo | Secondly, attempts are always made by those who are really aware of this psychological problem to cut down on the harmful effects, not of the processes, but of the state of mind of the sufferer upon whom the processes are grafted or applied.
d0c0 | It is for this reason that Sufi teachers have tried to ensure that certain of their disciples do not undertake various exercises. Some of them even insist that such people do not - for instance - perform the pilgrimage to Mecca, which is an obligation for all Moslems. For this reason the Sufis have been blamed for 'opposing that which is permitted or enjoined', by people who are too stupid to understand that, in Islam, the sick are not supposed to do things, even when enjoined, which might increase their infirmity.
c4id | The 'sorrow and trouble' to which you refer are due to an inner sickness. This sickness is one which is made worse by anything - even spiritual things - which approach it, because when a spritual element approaches certain forms of sickness, the ailment itself distorts the approaching element and misuses it. You can verify this for yourself, by noting how a perfectly salutary thing, employed in the wrong manner or at the wrong place, or with the wrong people, can cause damage.

5mai | STEPPING OFF THE FOURTEENTH FLOOR
pqyp | There were two news items in the British newspapers not long ago. In one of them, a man stepped off the fourteenth floor of a building because of his 'religious' faith, confident that 'God would save him'. He died. In the other case, it was assumed by spiritually- minded people that a man was possessed by devils. An attempt was made to 'exorcise' these demons, by a ritual taught by the Church. The attempted casting-out of the devils by a Priest of the Church of England was followed by the man murdering his own wife, within hours of the ceremony, by tearing out her eyes and tongue.
nev2 | Such things can happen when people mistake for a spiritual matter a medical one. This, in turn, happens when people imagine that their doctrine, not their experience, enables them to identify 'spiritual' matters. Dogma has these limitations: the newspapers are frequently to be seen featuring such tragedies as lead to 'sorrow in spiritual enterprises', generally because of this reason.
lo13 | It has often been observed by Sufis that people who try to follow spiritual paths without the primary training of disengaging their pride frequently encounter sorrow and worse.
1gm9 | 'People who try to mould the world's evil ways' says Hasan of Basra* - which to the Sufi includes one's own personality without doing it in correct sequence -'are ruined.'
94yd | People become deranged by following what they assume to be spiritual ways, by trying to do what is not only impossible but absurd.
ox3w | I would list the harping on the fear of death rather than equally upon its importance as a transition-phenomenon, and also the misguided search for 'security' of implanted obsession (often believed to be faith but in reality only dogmatism) as the two most frequent causes of the sorrow and trouble to which you refer.
2ai3 | There are two quatrains in Persian by the eminent Ustad Khalilullah Khalili, a great contemporary Sufi, on this. Just com- pare his emphases with the contextless ones which so many people imagine to be spirituality.

v86a | DEATH AND MOUNTAINS
exkc | In the first* he says:
j83u | 'I fear not death, for it is my helper ... It took my forefathers to their destination: This elegant and easy-paced conveyance of mine!
6vco | In the other, he speaks of conditioning, crystallised into stupefy- ing but useless rigidity, as a mountain, and the flexibility of the understanding Seeker as a bird: in an observation of the bird to the mountain:
rnzk | O Mountain! High and mighty, reaching into the skies. How you seem absorbed in self-regarding. Although only a small bird, yet I am free To dance on a flowerhead, while your feet are in chains .. .**

7wep | Shock-Teaching
70t5 | Q: Could you tell us a Sufi shock-teaching technique?
kwz0 | A: Sufi teaching techniques strongly feature the challenging statement, made in order to cause a multiple effect upon the hearer.
vool | Mansur Hallaj, notoriously, said: 'I am God!' for precisely this reason.
jwym | If someone in the West says, in slightly more contemporary language: 'Hitler was a great man!' the shock of this will cause the hearer to react, instantly .* In some people it will make them realise for the first time what it is like to hear such a statement, what the people who used to say this were like. It will also cause some to realise that, perhaps, the question as to Hitler's greatness or otherwise is irrelevant to their own situation. It will make some realise that they are obsessed by this 'greatness' or otherwise, revealing how their opinions can be triggered by the use of a phrase. In some it will show how almost any sequence of words can be used to 'programme' people and to cause 'belief or 'opposi- tion'.
umh8 | This is the technique sometimes used by Omar Khayyam and his school.
1zay | Unless this is understood, of course, Khayyam cannot be under- stood, because some academics take his words at their face value. When he says: 'Every violet is a beauty-mole from some former beloved', they must imagine that this is reincarnation or poetic imagery, when it is in fact 'shock'. The theory of reincarnation was a heresy in his culture.
ns7i | The Sufi literature is full of this kind of experiential teaching-
fztd | * Although Hitler died in 1945, almost universally regarded as a monster, the shock-effect of calling him 'great' had, for many people, worn off in a generation. A German teacher found that many young compatriots knew little about their former leader by 1977. Many of them, too, thought that he had in fact been a great man. Time (New York) 18 April, 1977, p. 13.

r5z1 | material. Its presence effectively filters out the superficial and the shallow.
j696 | People are conditioned to like certain remarks and to dislike others. This is almost always useful, until one gets to the point where hypocrisy takes advantage of the prevailing postures and enables people to manipulate situations and evade reality. Again, there are examples available in every culture in which people are not permitted by convention to say certain things which are true, because if they do they are regarded as immodest, boastful or hostile to others. This sort of preservation of the status quo may be good or it may be bad. Sometimes it produces 'tunnel vision *.
34d0 | In order to act upon such situations, or to point out the limita- tions of coercive custom, some of the greatest Sufis have not shrunk from risking the most extreme opprobrium. I do not think that their contribution in this respect has yet been equalled.
9ugn | SILENCE AND SPEECH
zvft | One good example is found in Hujwiri's Revelation of the Veiled (Nicholson's translation, 1911):
c1b3 | 'I have read in the Anecdotes that one day when Abu-Bakr Shibli [one of the most eminent of the ancient Sufis] was walking in the Karkh quarter of Baghdad he heard an impostor saying: "Silence is better than speech".
k969 | 'Shibli replied: "Thy silence is better than thy speech, but my speech is better than my silence, because thy speech is vanity and thy silence is an idle jest, whereas my silence is modesty and my speech is silence."
vt1d | Anyone who imagines that Shibli was acting in this way because he had a bad temper, or that he was impatient or straying beyond modesty is in need of such Sufi shock-teaching, since such an individual would not yet have learnt that there is a possibility that someone whom he regards (through conditioning) as out of order may in reality be uttering what is in fact an exact description of prevailing circumstances.
24sn | The main objection to supposedly immodest words is that they have a bad effect upon the person who speaks them, or teach
o0sh | 267
3max | observe.' to be 'immodest' and not humble. In the case of such a person as Shibli, his status was (and is) such that the former is not possible, and the latter interpretation could not occur: since Shibli was known to be wholly veracious.
sysw | This attitude may seem odd to people not accustomed to it. 'Oddness of appearance is not contradiction of fact' as the saying goes.
nbik | It is conditioning, as much as ignorance, which perpetuates the ignorance of humanity stressed by Khalili* when he speaks of the world and humanity's place in it:
sqoe | Performers and spectators of the arena are we Bewildered at our work and at the world's We, little playthings in the hand of Time: Made to dance each time its tune is played!
ok42 | *Khalilullah Khalili: (Persian) Quatrains, Baghdad: Al-Maarif Press, 1975,47/48.
a22o | Emotional Expectations
txc2 | Q: Why docs a Sufi group go on, sometimes for years, reading books, meeting and apparently not getting anything done, without any measurement of its progress, and without a sense of how things are going?
65aq | A: Such a group has to 'wear out' emotional expectations. It also has to provide circumstances in which the irrelevant and customary associations, characteristics brought in from other systems may be displayed and observed, so that everyone can see what is central and what is not. If the members of the group are not seeing these things, it is not a Sufic group at all. Much of its visible work is that of a 'preparatory group'. This does not mean that it might not be extremely important: for where else are you going to obtain this opportunity of living through and observing your reactions and those of others, outside of social groupings where the lessons are either obscured or twisted to provide super- ficial, tribal-type, conclusions?
i3ag | If you refer again to the published narratives which illustrate the coming-together of people, the effect of interchanges to show up unworthy or irrelevant behaviour or the uselessness of facile inter- pretation, you will find the material against which you can check the behaviour of people in such a group, if you are in one.
