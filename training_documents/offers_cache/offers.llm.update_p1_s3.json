We are gamblers - gambling our hard-earned money on labor, inventory, rent, marketing, etc., all with the hopes of a higher payout. Oftentimes, we lose. But, sometimes, we win and win big.\nue40 | However, there is a difference between gambling in business and gambling in a casino. In a casino, the odds are stacked against you. With skill, you can improve them, but never beat them. In contrast, in business, you can improve your skills to shift the odds in your favor. Simply stated, with enough skill, you can become the house.\ntq0f | After beginning a series of books on acquisition, it became apparent that I could not talk about any other topic without first addressing the offer: the starting point of any conversation to initiate a transaction with a customer. What you are literally providing them in exchange for their money. That's where it all begins.\n3z1s | This book is about how to make profitable offers. Specifically, how to reliably turn advertising dollars into enormous profits using a combination of pricing, value, guarantees, and naming strategies. I call the proper combination of these components: a Grand Slam Offer.\nune6 | I chose this term partially in homage to the above quote from Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and because, like a grand slam in baseball, a Grand Slam Offer is both very good and very rare. Additionally, to extend the baseball metaphor, it takes no more effort to make a Grand Slam Offer than to strike out. The difference is dictated by the skill of the marketer and how well he connects his offer with his audience's desires. In business you can have so-so offers: the singles and doubles that keep the game going, pay the bills, and keep the lights on. But, unlike baseball, where a grand slam scores a maximum of four runs, a Grand Slam Offer in the business world, can score you a thousand-fold pay off and result in a world where you never need to work again. It would be like connecting with the ball so well during one single at bat that you automatically win every World Series for the next hundred years.\neroy | It takes years of practice to make something as complicated as hitting a major league fastball into the bleachers look effortless. Your stance, vision, prediction, ball speed, bat speed, and hip placement all must be perfect. In marketing and customer acquisition (the process of getting new clients), there are just as many variables that must all align to truly knock it out of the park. But with enough practice and enough skill, you can turn the wild world of acquisition, which will throw curveballs at you every day, into a homerun derby, knocking offer after offer out of the stadium. To everyone else, your success will look unbelievable. But to you, it will feel like just another day at work. The greatest hitters of all time also have many strike outs, just as there are many failed offers in the track record of great marketers. We learn skills through failure and practice. We do this knowing that nine out of ten times we will be wrong. We still act boldly, hoping for that offer we connect with so well that it results in our big payoff.\nb09g | The good news is that in business, you only need to hit one Grand Slam Offer to retire forever. I have done this four or five times in my life. As for my track record, I have a thirty-six to one lifetime return on my advertising dollars over my business career. Consider this my lifetime batting average, if you will. That means for every one dollar I spend on advertising I get thirty-six dollars back, a thirty-six hundred percent return. That is my average over eight years. And I continue to improve.\npsuf | This book is my attempt to share that skill with you, with a specific focus on building Grand Slam Offers, so you can experience the same levels of success. It's also the first in a series of books meant to get entrepreneurs to financial freedom, in plain words, fuck you money. Subsequent books in this series will look more deeply at getting more customers, converting\nojfh | more prospects into clients, making those clients worth more, and other lessons I wish I had learned earlier scaling my businesses.\nqri0 | Pro Tip: Faster, deeper learning by reading and listening at the same time\nhbbb | Here's a life hack I discovered a long time ago .... If you listen to the audiobook while reading the ebook or physical book you will increase your reading speed and retain more information. The contents are being stored in more places in your brain. This is how I read most things worth reading. I've priced my products as cheap as the platforms will allow me to, so this isn't a ploy to make an extra ninety-nine cents - promise. If you want to give it a try, go ahead and grab the audio version and see for yourself. You might find it as valuable as I have as someone who struggles to stay focused. I took two days to talk this book out loud and record it. I figured I'd put this hack at the beginning of the book so you had a chance to do it if you found this first chapter valuable enough to earn your attention.\nuy56 | Section one: How we got here\nsy3k | The ugly truth\nido2 | Section two: Pricing\nuq3f | Section one: How we got here\nc006 | Section four: Enhancing\nyatc | Section two: Value offer\nny4k | After\ngqd8 | Section one: Execution\netr7 | How we got here\n3m6c | December twenty-four, twenty sixteen. Christmas Eve.\nh1un | The room was pitch black. My shoes stuck to a floor covered in dried soda and crushed bits of candy. My nostrils were full with the smell of stale popcorn. We had showed up too late to get good seats and ended up pressed near the front of the theater. Just a few rows in front of me, the movie's blazing projection occupied my entire field of view. In the reflected glow, I could see the outlines of Leila's family's faces. They may as well have been hypnotized.\nnljo | I envied them. They sat, entranced, soaking in their paid time off for Christmas. Must be nice.\nookx | Anybody else would have missed it but Leila, my girlfriend at the time, knew me too well. Anybody else would have thought I was watching the movie, but Leila could tell I was staring blankly at the screen, my eyes not tracking the movie. My face was pale. My cheekbones and jawline appeared gaunt. Weeks of chronic stress had killed my appetite.\n0h9f | What's wrong? she asked.\na5nf | I didn't answer.\nhtog | She rested her hand on mine to get my attention. I didn't react. Within moments, her fingers tightened around my wrist, and she looked at me, her eyes searching for mine. Your heart is racing, she whispered, concerned.\nd9zz | Without asking, she took my pulse.\neovv | It was one hundred beats per minute. Nearly twice what it should be for a fit twenty-seven-year-old male at rest in a cool, dark room.",
