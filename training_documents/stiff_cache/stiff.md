## STIFFNESS NONLINEARITY OF THREE SANDS

ABSTRACT: This paper presents the results of two hundred fifty-four drained triaxial compression tests. The results are analyzed with the aim of obtaining a phenomenological description of secant Young's modulus variation according to different test conditions. Using empirical fitting equations, the influences of different factors such as axial strain, vertical consolidation stress, consolidation stress ratio, and stress history on the secant Young's modulus under axisymmetric (triaxial) loading conditions at small and intermediate axial strains are singled out and presented. The main purpose of this paper is to identify the factors affecting the nonlinear secant stiffness of sand and to quantify their relevance at different levels of strain.

INTRODUCTION

Stiffness reduction with increasing strain and shear stress levels has been widely recognized in geotechnical engineering for the last half century. Moreover, more recently the improvement achieved in the reliable measurement of soil behavior at small strains (epsilon approximately ten to the negative five) and intermediate strains (ten to the negative five less than epsilon less than or equal to five times ten to the negative three) in the laboratory has highlighted the degree of nonlinearity exhibited by soil stiffness, emphasizing the paramount importance of this phenomenon for predicting the displacement of geotechnical constructions.

Based on the above, this paper is aimed at the purely phenomenological description of the secant Young's modulus (E sub sec) nonlinearity at small and intermediate strains, as inferred from a large number of drained triaxial compression tests performed on three sands.

All the triaxial tests were performed on specimens prepared by means of an air pluvial deposition subjected thereafter to both isotropic and anisotropic consolidation. Both the local axial strain and the local radial strain were measured in many tests. The results obtained have been analyzed with the aim of quantifying the relevance of the different factors that influence the E sub sec nonlinearity at small and intermediate strains of the three test sands.


## EXPERIMENTAL DATA

Test Sands

The soils used were Toyoura, Quiou, and Ticino sands. Toyoura sand has been widely used for laboratory stress-strain tests in Japan. Ticino sand has been used for Calibration Chamber and laboratory stress-strain tests in Italy since nineteen seventy-six. More recently, Quiou sand (a French sand) has also been used in Italian Calibration Chamber and stress-strain laboratory tests. Toyoura sand is a subangular, uniform, fine quartz sand that does not contain fines. Quiou sand is a subangular, well-graded, coarse to medium carbonate sand containing about two percent of fines. Quiou sand is a crushable material containing seventy-three percent in weight of shell fragments. Ticino sand is a medium to coarse, uniform, predominantly silica sand that does not contain fines. The main physical properties of these sands are shown in Table one.


## Sample Preparation

Specimens with seventy millimeters in diameter and one hundred forty millimeters in height were reconstituted by dry pluvial deposition method. Only for some tests on Ticino sand were smaller samples tested (i.e., forty and sixty millimeters in diameter). The ratio of height to diameter H over D of all specimens is two.

Toyoura sand specimens were reconstituted to a void ratio after consolidation e, ranging from zero point sixty-five to zero point eighty-nine. For Quiou sand specimens, the e sub c ranged between zero point seventy-nine and one point zero four, while for Ticino sand specimens the e sub e ranged between zero point fifty-eight and zero point eighty-eight.

All the relevant information concerning the triaxial tests performed is given in Table two.


## Triaxial Tests

Apparatus

The triaxial testing systems used for the tests, developed at ISMES (Istituto Sperimentale Modelli e Strutture, Italy) and the Technical University of Turin, are computer-controlled triaxial cells with internal tie rods. A load cell to measure the axial load without any piston friction is located inside the pressure chamber. In the triaxial apparatus developed at the Technical University of Turin, the loading ram is virtually frictionless. The axial strain was measured locally using high-resolution submergible LVDTs, and externally. The details of the test apparatuses were described.

Twenty-six tests on Toyoura sand and eight tests on Quiou sand were performed at the Technical University of Turin, while all the tests on the Ticino sand (one hundred eighty-four) and other tests on the Quiou sand (thirty-six) were performed at ISMES. The axial strain was only measured externally for the majority of the Ticino sand tests.

Test Procedures

Two sets of drained triaxial compression tests were performed at constant axial strain rate and lateral pressure with confining stress ranging between fifty and eight hundred kilopascals. The first set was performed on isotropic normally consolidated (N C) and overconsolidated (O C) specimens. The second set was performed on K zero (the condition of zero radial strain) N C and O C specimens. The K zero condition was obtained by adjusting the cell pressure as the axial stress increased in order to prevent radial displacement. The radial deformation was measured locally using two proximity transducers placed horizontally on the specimen. The adopted overconsolidation ratio ranged between one point two and eight. After the consolidation stage, a rest period of one to two hours was adopted before starting the shearing phase.

The shearing stage of triaxial tests was carried out in drained conditions, under a strain-controlled frame, at a constant rate of axial strain (about zero point zero one percent per minute). The radial pressure was kept constant.

The consolidation stress ratio, overconsolidation ratio, and effective vertical stress at the end of consolidation are also shown in Table two.


## Test Results

Typical results of the triaxial compression tests on Toyoura and Quiou sands are shown in Figures one and two. These figures show the secant Young's modulus E sub sec versus the axial strain, plotted in logarithmic scale, for four compression loading tests with almost the same void ratio (Toyoura sand: zero point seventy-seven to zero point eighty; Quiou sand: zero point eighty-seven to zero point eighty-nine) and the effective vertical consolidation stress (one hundred kilopascals) but subject to different consolidation stress ratios K sub c equals one and K sub c equals K sub zero and histories one is less than or equal to O C R less than or equal to three. In order to eliminate the effect of the difference of density on test results in these figures, the secant Young's modulus was normalized by dividing it by the following void ratio functions: Toyoura sand F of e equals open parenthesis two point one seven minus e close parenthesis squared divided by open parenthesis one plus e close parenthesis, while for Quiou sand F of e equals open parenthesis three point eight two minus e close parenthesis squared divided by open parenthesis one plus e close parenthesis.

In spite of a certain scatter observed at very small strain (E is less than or equal to five times ten to the negative five), it can be seen that the small strain secant Young's modulus E sub c of Toyoura sand is virtually the same for the four tests open bracket E sub zero divided by F of e approximately two hundred fifty megapascals, that is, it does not depend on the K e, the horizontal stress sigma sub b prime, or the O C R, being only a function of the axial consolidation stress. On the other hand, in the case of Quiou sand, the small strain secant Young's modulus of the O C specimens open bracket E sub zero divided by F of e approximately sixty to seventy M P a close bracket is higher than that of the N C specimens open bracket E sub zero divided by F of e approximately forty to fifty M P a close bracket. In other words, for a clean sand, such as Toyoura sand, the E sub c value is a function of the effective axial stress and is quite independent of the radial effective stress and the stress history. In the case of sand containing crushable material, such as Quiou sand, although E sub zero does not depend on the K sub c or the sigma sub h prime, it instead depends on the stress history.

On the other hand, at intermediate strain, it can be seen that the reduction of E sub sec in N C specimens occurs for epsilon sub a larger than zero point zero zero one percent. It can be also seen that the reduction of E sub sec in N C Quiou sand is much more pronounced than that observed for N C Toyoura sand; for example, E sub sec divided by E sub zero at epsilon sub a equals zero point zero one percent is about zero point five five in the N C Toyoura specimen and is about zero point four five in the N C Quiou specimen. In the case of O C specimens, the sudden reduction of E sub sec occurs for strain levels larger than about zero point zero five percent for both sands. This experimental fact indicates that the amount of plastic deformation decreased for axial strain by as much as zero point zero five percent, as a consequence of the mechanical overconsolidation. It is said that the linear threshold strain increases according to the overconsolidation history.


## STIFFNESS NONLINEARITY

Empirical Fitting Equation

In order to evaluate the effects of the confining pressure, the stress ratio at consolidation, and the overconsolidation history on the secant Young's modulus E subscript sec under small and intermediate strain levels, an empirical study was performed on a large number of triaxial compression test results on Toyoura, Quiou, and Ticino sands.

It has generally been recognized that the shear modulus of sand can be expressed by means of an empirical equation as a function of the void ratio, the confining pressure, and strain levels. For example, Iwasaki and Tatsuoka indicated that the shear modulus of clean sands obtained from resonant column and cyclic torsional tests can be expressed by

G subscript c q equals K left parenthesis gamma right parenthesis F left parenthesis e right parenthesis p superscript prime n left parenthesis gamma right parenthesis end equation one where G subscript e q equals equivalent shear modulus; K left parenthesis gamma right parenthesis equals material constant that depends on shear strain level; F left parenthesis e right parenthesis equals void ratio function; p superscript prime equals mean effective stress; and n left parenthesis gamma right parenthesis equals empirical exponent that depends on shear strain level.

According to Hardin and Blandford, it is also possible to express the dependence of the small strain shear modulus G subscript zero on the current state of a soil by means of the following relationship:

G subscript zero equals S subscript i j F left parenthesis e right parenthesis left parenthesis O C R right parenthesis superscript k p subscript a superscript left parenthesis one minus n subscript i minus n subscript j right parenthesis sigma subscript i superscript prime n subscript i sigma subscript i superscript prime n subscript j end equation two where Sij equals nondimensional material constant of given soil that also reflects its fabric; k equals empirical exponent that depends on plasticity index (PI) of soil; sigma subscript i and sigma subscript j superscript prime equals effective principal stresses acting on plane in which G subscript zero is measured; n semicolon and n subscript i equals empirical exponents; and p subscript a equals stress.

Moreover, Hardin and Blandford suggested that the Young's modulus for elastic compressive strain increments in a certain direction is a unique function of the normal stress in that direction. Lo Presti and others reported similar results for triaxial tests performed on clay and sand.

As mentioned before, it was indicated that the secant Young's modulus depends on the stress ratio and the stress history under consolidation. Moreover, its effects were different from sand to sand. Thus, to clarify the effects of the confining pressure, the stress ratio at consolidation and the overconsolidation history on the secant Young's modulus E subscript sc under wide strain levels, zero point zero zero one to one percent, an empirical study was performed on triaxial compression test results using the following equations:

E subscript scc left parenthesis IC right parenthesis equals S subscript r F left parenthesis e right parenthesis sigma subscript re superscript prime n p subscript a superscript left parenthesis one minus n right parenthesis end equation isotropic normally consolidated sand

Three E subscript sec left parenthesis K subscript zero right parenthesis equals a S subscript v F left parenthesis e right parenthesis sigma subscript w superscript prime prime p subscript a superscript left parenthesis one minus n right parenthesis left parenthesis K subscript zero normally consolidated sand right parenthesis end equation four axial strain level of isotropic normally consolidated sands; F left parenthesis e right parenthesis equals void ratio function left bracket dot F left parenthesis e right parenthesis equals left parenthesis two point one seven minus e right parenthesis squared divided by left parenthesis one plus e right parenthesis right bracket and F left parenthesis e right parenthesis equals left parenthesis three point eight two minus e right parenthesis squared divided by left parenthesis one plus e right parenthesis end bracket; sigma subscript w superscript prime equals effective axial stress at end of consolidation; n equals empirical exponent that depends on axial stress and axial strain level of isotropic normally consolidated sands; p subscript a equals reference stress; and a equals empirical constant that ampersand a equals one point zero depends on axial strain level of K subscript zero normally consolidated sands.

Figures three to five show the comparison of the secant modulus obtained from the test data and the empirical fitting equation for normally consolidated isotropic consolidated IC and K subscript zero consolidated K subscript zero C Toyoura, Quiou, and Ticino sands for three kinds of strain levels, respectively. Although a certain scatter is recognized, it can be seen that the empirical fitting equation that uses equations three and four above agrees well with the test data at small and intermediate strain levels and stress ratios for normally consolidated sands. Table three lists the parameter values of the empirical fitting equation for the three sands.

shows the stress dependency of the friction angle at failure for isotropic NC specimens. It has been found that the stress dependency of Quiou sand is larger than that of Toyoura and Ticino sands. In particular, the friction angle of Quiou sand decreases rapidly with an increase in the confining pressure. This is because the crushability of Quiou sand is higher than that of other sands. Therefore, the n-value of Quiou sand decreased for

Eight percent. Consolidation Stress Ratio

The secant modulus decrease with an increase in the strain level is more pronounced in K zero consolidated K zero C specimens than in isotropic consolidated IC specimens, as mentioned before.

It has been shown that the secant Young's modulus was significantly dependent on overconsolidation history. Fig. eleven shows the variations of normalized secant Young's modulus Esec/[S.F(e)o Wpa-"], with respect to OCR, as examined using a single logarithmic scale at several strain levels for IC Toyoura, Quiou and Ticino sand specimens. From this figure, it has been found that the effects of overconsolidation history on the secant Young's modulus for Quiou sand are larger than those for Toyoura and Ticino sands.

modulus for isotropic and K zero normally consolidated specimens were indicated by the Sy-value or a X Sy-value in three and four, respectively. Fig. thirteen shows the variation of the K zero-value after consolidation, due to the difference in the overconsolidation ratio.

It can be seen that the strain level at which the reduction of Esec in OC specimens occurs is larger than that in NC specimens. It can be also seen that the sudden reduction of Esec in OC specimens that occurs for &a is larger than about zero point zero five percent for all sands. In addition, it is found that the reduction tendency of Esec is relatively similar for isotropic and K zero OC specimens for the same OCR. This is because one the yield locus, the linear threshold strain, expanded because of the overconsolidation history; and two the K zero-value of the OC specimen increases with an increase in the overconsolidation ratio, as shown in Fig. thirteen.

Fig. fourteen shows the relationships of the secant modulus ratios E sec O C divided by E sec N C versus log epsilon a for isotropic and K zero consolidated Toyoura OCR equals three, Quiou OCR equals three, and Ticino OCR equals two, four sand specimens. It has been found that the effects of the overconsolidation history for Toyoura sand are negligibly small at small strain levels. The effects of the OC history on the secant modulus are greatest at E c, around point zero five to point one percent. The effects of the OC history are similar on Toyoura and Ticino sands. On the other hand, the effects of OC history on Quiou sand are much larger than for other sands. This can be seen because the soil particle crush of Quiou sand had significantly progressed because of the OC history and shearing.

It has also been found that the effects of OC history on K zero C specimens are larger than those on IC specimens. This is because one the secant Young's modulus of K zero specimens is smaller than that of the IC specimen, except that at small strain levels under the same vertical consolidation stress, as shown in Fig. twelve, and two the K zero-value increases with an increase in OCR, as shown in Fig. thirteen. Consequently, the effects of OC history on the secant Young's modulus of the K zero C specimen were larger than those of the IC specimens.


## CONCLUSIONS

This paper presents the analysis of a large number of drained triaxial compression tests, many of which were carried out with local strain measurement. The tests were performed on both isotropically and anisotropically consolidated specimens of three sands prepared by pluvial deposition in air and allow the following conclusions, all of which refer to the value of sand moduli at sigma w prime equals one hundred kilo Pascals: One. For all three sands, the secant Young's modulus normalized with respect to the consolidation void ratio exhibits very pronounced degradation with increasing strain.

Two. Nonlinearity starts to show when the axial strain exceeds approximately one times ten to the negative three and five times ten to the negative two percent for NC and OC with OCR equals three specimens, respectively.

Three. Below such a strain level, which corresponds to the linear threshold strain, the secant Young's modulus coincides with the initial tangent stiffness E zero, which depends only on the magnitude of sigma v prime being independent of sigma b prime. Four. For silica Ticino and Toyoura sands, the E c results were found to be independent of OCR, while in carbonatic Quiou sands it moderately influences the magnitude of the initial stiffness.

Five. Beyond the linear threshold strain, the reduction of E sec for normally consolidated specimens can be matched by the empirical fitting formulae.

Six. For isotropically consolidated specimens, the stress exponent n of sigma w prime increases gradually from a minimum value, zero point forty-three to zero point fifty-six, at very small epsilon a with the increase in the strain levels. In this respect, the irregular trend of n versus epsilon a, observed for Quiou sand, cannot be explained. However, it could be due to the pronounced grains' crushability.

Seven. The effect of overconsolidation on the secant modulus was found to be highly axial strain level dependent. As has been shown by many researchers, it is insignificant for silica sands at very small strain E subscript a equals one times ten to the negative three percent, increasing thereafter with an increase of the strain and reaching the maximum values at calligraphy E subscript a around zero point zero five to zero point one percent. The influence of OCR on the E subscript sec results are more pronounced for the anisotropically K zero-consolidated specimens than for those subjected to isotropical consolidation.

Overall, the phenomenological examination of the drained triaxial compression tests results gathered for three sands has shown that, in the strain range of zero point zero one to zero point one percent, the soil stiffness under axisymmetric loading conditions exhibits a highly pronounced nonlinearity and is strongly influenced by the test conditions, in particular, the consolidation stress ratio and OCR.

The data presented here provide evidence of the inadequacy of some existing quasilinear fitting equations (e.g., conventional hyperbola) to reproduce the variation of E subscript sec in the strain range of practical interest. Moreover, data presented in this paper can guide practitioners in selecting the equivalent stiffness that can be used for simple calculations using the formula of the theory of elasticity.
