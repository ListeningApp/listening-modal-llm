You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

gocl | All the optimal solutions of D4Ht4O12 correspond to the real crystals shown in Figs. 4(a), 4(b), 4(c), and 4(d). The cation D makes coordination polyhedra of antic- uboctahedron or cuboctahedron. Besides, we find that D3Ht6O15 has the optimal solution corresponding to the BaTi2O5 structure shown in Fig. 4(f). The optimal so- lution consists of 11 LGCs, but we find another optimal solution consiting of only 5 LGCs with the Cmmm sym- metry shown in Fig. 4(e).
ob1z | Our results indicate that De4Ht208 and DegHt4016 have only one optimal solution corresponding to the crys- tal structure of La2-zSr2 CuO4 as shown in Fig. 5 (a). The cation De makes coordination polyhedron of capped square antiprism. Besides, our calculations indicate that D1De2Ht2O7 and D2De4Ht4O14 also have a unique op- timal solution corresponding to the crystal structure of La2-zSr1+2 Cu2O7 which consists of three kinds of coor- dination polyhedra as shown in Fig. 5(b).
m4cb | In the pyrochlore-o structure found as one of the opti- mal solutions for Do4Hd4O14 and Uo4Hd4O14, one oxy- gen ion is placed in the center of the tetrahedron com- posed of large cations, and the distance of ionic bond
m61y | must be smaller than those of the other ionic bonds, and thereby a large cation makes coordination polyhedron of distorted cubic as shown in Fig. 5(c). In fact, our calcula- tions indicate that the pyrochlore-a structure is difficult to obtain without soft sphere, while both the Do4Hd4O14 and Uo4Hd4O14 have the optimal solution correspond- ing to the pyrochlore-o structure, which has the lowest number of LGCs with highest symmetry. Note that the interatomic distances can be as small as possible with-
u2ob | out attractive forces since the volume of the unit cell is minimized. The optimal solution consisting of the sec- ond lowest number of LGCs for the Uo4Hd4O14 is the layer-by-layer structure of cubics and octahedra with the P1 symmetry as shown in Fig. 5(d).
2gnm | The cubic coordination can also be realized by the cation Eo. Eo6O12 has the optimal solution correspond- ing to the zirconia structure shown in Fig. 5(e). The cation Eo can also make the coordination polyhedra of
emgw | square antiprism as shown in Fig. 5(f).
