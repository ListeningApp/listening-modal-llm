        "content": "y2qo | C mastigophora have a water content on ninety-five point eight percent which is almost identical to other species studied. Dead jellyfish decay quickly, two to three days, on tropical beaches, meaning that the organic carbon and nitrogen in their bodies indirectly derived from primary and secondary production offshore are made available in the nearshore coastal zone. Using our measurements of density of jellyfish in strandings, frequency of strandings and biomass of jellyfish, it can be calculated that this contribution was of the order of forty-four tonnes of carbon and eleven tonnes of nitrogen in twenty twelve. However, although we were able to provide some data on the biomass of stranded jellyfish that this is only a\n1piq | reflection of the total biomass as we do not know what percentage of the population is stranded at any one time. Other jellyfish species which undergo swarms have been shown to be important in delivering significant quantities of organic matter into coastal food webs.\n7fqw | Kramp, nineteen sixty-one, records C mastigophora as reaching four hundred millimeters in diameter, but our specimens were almost all less than half this size. There is no information on growth rates of C mastigophora, and it is not known if C mastigophora in Australian waters grow to the size stated by Kramp, nineteen sixty-one, whose records drew on studies in Malaysia. Extensive further study of the biology, especially growth and feeding and swarm size, along with better resolution of spatial and temporal occurrence of C mastigophora is needed to evaluate the ecological and socioeconomic significance of this phenomenon and whether the frequency or intensity of swarms has changed recently.",
