You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

The next table is the ANOVA table, which is also divided into two sections. The top half represents the effect of the covariate alone, whereas the bottom half represents the whole model (i.e., covariate and puppy therapy included). Notice at the bottom of the ANOVA table (the bit for model 2) that the entire model (love of puppies and the dummy variables) accounts for 31.92 units of variance <LATEX>\left( \mathrm { S S } _ { \mathrm { M } } \right) ,</LATEX> there are 110.97 units in total <LATEX>\left( \mathrm { S S } _ { \mathrm { T } } \right)</LATEX> and the unexplained variance <LATEX>\left( \mathrm { S S } _ { \mathrm { R } } \right)</LATEX> is 79.05.
mov9 | The interesting bit is the table of model coefficients (Output 13.2). The top half shows the effect when only the covariate is in the model, and the bottom half contains the whole model. The b-values for the dummy variables represent the difference between the means of the 15-minute group and the control group (Dummy 1) and the 30-minute group and the control group (Dummy <LATEX>\left. 2 \right) - \sec</LATEX> Section 12.2 for an explanation of why. The means of the 15-and 30-minute groups were 4.88 and 4.85 respectively, and the mean of the control group was 3.22. Therefore, the b-values for the two dummy variables should be roughly the same <LATEX>\left( 4 . 8 8 \quad - \quad 3 . 2 2 = 1 . 6 6 \right.</LATEX> for Dummy 1 and <LATEX>4 . 8 5 \quad - \quad 3 . 2 2 = 1 . 6 3</LATEX> for Dummy 2). The astute among you might notice that the <LATEX>b</LATEX> b-values in Output 13.2 are not only very different from each other (which shouldn't be the case because the 15-and 30-minute groups means are virtually the same), but also different from the values I've just calculated. Does this mean I've been lying to you for the past 50 pages about what the beta values represent? I'm evil, but I'm not that evil. The reason for this apparent anomaly is that with a covariate present, the b-values represent the differences between the means of each group and the control adjusted for the covariate(s). In this case, they represent the difference in the means of the puppy therapy groups adjusted for the love of puppies. Output 13.1
ks7m | These adjusted means come directly from the model. If we replace the b-values in equation (13.1) with the values in Output 13.2, our model becomes: Happiness; = 1.789+ 2.225Long; + 1.786Short; + 0.416Puppy_love; (13.2) Remember that Long and Short are dummy variables such that Long takes the value of 1 only for the 30-minute group, and Short takes a value of 1 only for the 15-minute group; in all other situations they have a value of 0. To get the adjusted means, we use this equation, but rather than replacing the covariate with an individual's score, we replace it with the mean value of the covariate from Table 13.2 (2.73) because we're interested in the predicted value for each group at the mean level of the covariate. For the control group, the dummy variables are both coded as 0, so we replace Long and Short in the model with 0. The adjusted mean will, therefore, be 2.925: Happiness Control =1.789+(2.225×0)+(1.786×0)+(0.416×XPuppy_love) =1.789+(0.416×2.73) (13.3) =2.925
w1w1 | For the 15-minute group, the dummy variable Short is 1 and Long is 0, so the adjusted mean is 4.71:
h8gv | <LATEX>\bar { \text { Happiness } } _ { 1 5 \text { mins } } = 1 . 7 8 9 + \left( 2 . 2 2 5 \times 0 \right) + \left( 1 . 7 8 6 \times 1 \right) + \left( 0 . 4 1 6 \times \bar { X } _ { \text { Puppy love } } \right)</LATEX> <LATEX>= 1 . 7 8 9 + 1 . 7 8 6 + \left( 0 . 4 1 6 \times 2 . 7 3 \right)</LATEX> (13.4)
kwkp | <LATEX>= 4 . 7 1</LATEX> For the 30-minute group, the dummy variable <LATEX>S h o r t \quad i s \quad 0</LATEX> and Long is 1, so the adjusted mean is 5.15:
yj0m | <LATEX>\widetilde { \mathrm { H a p p i n e s } } _ { 3 0 \mathrm { m i n s } } = 1 . 7 8 9 + \left( 2 . 2 2 5 \times 1 \right) + \left( 1 . 7 8 6 \times 0 \right) + \left( 0 . 4 1 6 \times \bar { X } _ { \text { Puppy love } } \right)</LATEX> <LATEX>= 1 . 7 8 9 + 2 . 2 2 5 + \left( 0 . 4 1 6 \times 2 . 7 3 \right)</LATEX> <LATEX>= 5 . 1 5</LATEX> (13.5)
ewfp | We can now see that the <LATEX>b</LATEX> b-values for the two dummy variables represent the differences between these adjusted means <LATEX>\left( 4 . 7 1 \quad - \quad 2 . 9 3 = 1 . 7 8 \right.</LATEX> for Dummy 1 and <LATEX>5 . 1 5 \quad - \quad 2 . 9 3 = 2 . 2 2</LATEX> for Dummy 2). These adjusted means are the average amount of happiness for each group at the mean level of love of puppies. Some people think of this kind of model (i.e., ANCOVA) as 'controlling' for the covariate, because it compares the predicted group means at the average value of the covariate, so the groups are being compared at a level of the covariate that is the same for each group. However, as we shall see, the 'controlling for the covariate' analogy is not a good one.
