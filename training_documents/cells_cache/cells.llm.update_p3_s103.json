In straight, non-branching regions of human arteries, viscous forces of blood flow predominate over inertial forces, leading to stable, unidirectional laminar flow, which delivers high-magnitude ULS to endothelial cells. Conversely, in curved and branching regions, inertial forces become more prominent, leading to disturbed, multidirectional oscillatory flow that delivers low-magnitude OSS to the endothelial cell surface. The terms 'stable flow' and 'disturbed flow' are typically used in in vivo studies, whereas most in vitro studies use ULS and OSS to describe the experimental flow conditions to which endothelial cells are exposed. To reduce potential confusion and simplify these interchangeable terms, we use stable flow or disturbed flow in this Review, whenever feasible.\n877u | three layers of artery wall are the intima (which contains endothelial cells), the media (with VSMCs) and the adventitia (which contains fibroblasts). c, Common sites of atherosclerosis development, with the associated prevalence of plaques in middle-aged adults reported in the AWHS and PESA studies and the shear stress level average and ranges, based on available literature. d, Time-averaged shear stress levels in the left carotid bifurcation in a healthy individual show that the lateral wall of the internal carotid, a common site of atherosclerosis development, experiences low and oscillating shear stress from disturbed flow. Panel d adapted from reference Elsevier.\nrzhj | The clinical significance of blood flow is that atherosclerosis preferentially develops in curved or branching vascular regions exposed to disturbed flow conditions in the presence of additional risk factors such as hypercholesterolaemia and diabetes. For example, atherosclerotic plaques form preferentially in the lateral wall of the internal carotid artery at the carotid bifurcation, the lesser curvature of the aortic arch, and the proximal portion of the left anterior descending coronary artery.\nbfax | Animal models of flow-induced atherosclerosis\nf2y8 | Clinical observations strongly suggest a correlation between disturbed flow and sites of atherogenesis, but whether disturbed flow directly causes atherosclerosis remained unknown until it was proven by\no7qm | Review article\nd52l | experimental studies in animal models. Studies using the partial carotid ligation and the shear stress-modifying constrictive carotid cuff mouse models directly demonstrated the effect of disturbed flow, or low flow, on atherosclerosis development. In the partial carotid ligation model, three of the four caudal branches of the left common carotid artery are surgically ligated without manipulating the left common carotid artery itself. The partial carotid ligation surgery induces disturbed flow in the left common carotid artery with characteristic low-magnitude OSS patterns. In mice or C57 black six mice overexpressing PCSK nine fed a high-fat diet to induce hypercholesterolaemia, the partial carotid ligation surgery causes rapid development of atherosclerosis in the entire length\nqlbb | of the left common carotid artery within two to three weeks. Importantly, in this mouse model, the contralateral right carotid artery continues to be exposed to stable flow and does not develop atherosclerotic plaques, serving as an ideal control in the same animal. The constrictive carotid cuff model involves the implantation of a shear stress-modifying cast over a portion of the right carotid artery, which exposes that portion of the right carotid artery to three different shear stress regimes that translate into atherosclerosis-inducing patterns in hypercholesterolaemic mice fed a Western diet: low-magnitude, stable flow in the region proximal to the cast, which induces the development of vulnerable\nnhsg | and low-magnitude oscillatory shear stress in the distal region of the cuff. In hypercholesterolaemic conditions, such as in mice fed a Western diet for eight weeks, the low-magnitude OSS induces atherosclerotic plaque development with a large lipid core in the carotid artery, as shown by haematoxylin and eosin staining.
