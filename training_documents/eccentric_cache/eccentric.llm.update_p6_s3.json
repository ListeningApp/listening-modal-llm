Nonetheless, reasons behind some of the unusually high overstrengths reported in the literature still remain unclear. For instance, Dusicka et al. observed overstrengths of about five point zero in their experiments on very short links constructed from low-yield-strength steel without web stiffeners. Such cases require further investigation.",
