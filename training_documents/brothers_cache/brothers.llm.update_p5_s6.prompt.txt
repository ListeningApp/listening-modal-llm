You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

6d4s | Due to the particular social organisation and hierarchical political structures of the highland cultures of Eritrea and Ethiopia,16 and the region's deep warring his- tory,17 the highland population of the two countries apparently has a remarkable capacity to reconcile after conflict, as their common destiny as pawns and victims of war also brings them together. Although people participate in the wars as sol- diers and supporters, they are also quick to blame it on political leaders who have fanned the animosity. In this manner, physical borders and boundaries of identity at a local level may be conceived differently from state borders and expressions of for- mal nationalism at inter-state level.18 As this article demonstrates, the local level border between Eritrea and Ethiopia has become increasingly more porous, while the inter-state border was rigidly defended. Likewise, shared experiences and com- mon interests among the borderland populations on both sides, started grassroots processes of reconnecting social and identity formations across the inflexible inter-state border. The focus of this article will thus be on observations of shared sentiments of people-to-people reconciliation and commonalities between the Tigrinya-speaking border populations of Eritrean and Ethiopia, contextualised by the nascent bilateral rapprochement. Before that however, a brief overview of the 'active' and 'cold' war will be presented, as well as the political peace
mqah | rapprochement taken by Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed after he came to power in April 2018. First, however, some comments on the methodological limitations to the study.
xxr8 | 'Balancing the border': methodological limitations
rl4j | This article is based on almost thirty years of research on Eritrean-Ethiopian rela- tions, starting with long-term anthropological fieldwork in a small village of high- land Eritrea at the tail-end of the liberation war (1991-3), field visits to Eritrea and Tigray in the interim-period of peace (1993-7), and long-term fieldwork in Tigray during the 1998-2000 war. Since then, I have conducted field visits and research work in Ethiopia several times a year, leading up to a 2017 research project with colleagues from Mekelle University on people-to-people reconciliation in the bor- derlands. I also carried out field work in the Ethiopian borderlands in Tigray between 2017 and 2019.
vz32 | Independent critical research is not permitted in Eritrea. Regrettably, I, as well as many other scholars on Eritrea, have been denied entry to the country since the 1998-2000 war. To address this imbalance in empirical data gathering, I have made field visits to Eritrean refugee camps in east Sudan and Tigray. I have also, over two decades, maintained close communication with Eritrean academics, polit- ical and human rights representatives, and other refugees in the diaspora. In add- ition, to canvas the greatest range of personal observations from those affected by the war, I made several field visits to the Ethiopian border town of Zalambessa and its environs. I also crossed the border to visit an Eritrean village caught between the Eritrean trenches and the Ethiopian border, but under military control by Ethiopian defence forces. Eritrean and Tigrayan respondents were generally selected ran- domly during these field visits. Some, however, were recommended by other Eritreans or Tigrayans.
ncb0 | Fieldwork in border zones may prove challenging as one traverses different polit- ical realms. When borderlands are militarised, political and security concerns potentially limit the researcher's operational capability. They may also restrict informants' willingness and ability to talk and comment on sensitive issues. My lon- gitudinal studies of Eritrean-Ethiopian relations, as well as my frequent field visits during almost three decades, however, mitigate these methodological limitations.
8mp0 | The 1998-2000 war
xjyk | The 1998-2000 Eritrean-Ethiopian war was ostensibly fought over a sliver of land, but its root causes were anchored in disputes over history, ideology, economy, and identity.19 Two sister movements - Eritrean People's Liberation Front (EPLF) and Tigrayan People's Liberation Front (TPLF) - toppled the Derg military junta in
mt0f | Ethiopia in May 1991. Whilst EPLF formed an independent government in liber- ated Eritrea, TPLF, through its coalition party, Ethiopian Peoples' Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF), assumed power in Addis Ababa. The close relationship demonstrated on the battlefields in northern Ethiopia during the 1970s and 198os soon soured, however, as economic and political competition turned into a hege- monic struggle for dominance in the Horn of Africa.2º Small-scale border disputes erupted in the mid-199os, as the trust between the two leaderships began to wane. The introduction of the new Eritrean currency in October 1997 and subsequent for- malisation of trade between the two countries, put focus for the first time on where the actual border should be demarcated on the ground, as customs and immigra- tion facilities needed to be established.
awab | In early May 1998, a small border skirmish in Badme, a Western plains village in Ethiopian-administered territory close to the Sudanese border, rapidly escalated into a full-scale bilateral war, as Eritrean forces penetrated deep into areas previously con- trolled by Ethiopia. The Eritrean surprise attack led to the remobilisation of the TPLF's guerrilla army by the regional government to defend Tigrayan inhabitants and territory, as well as the federal army to defend the motherland and its sovereignty.21
ixcc | As the conflict escalated the international community scrambled to negotiate the conflict. It soon became clear, however, that both Ethiopia and Eritrea knew this con- flict would be settled on the battlefield, and not around the negotiation table. Ethiopian counter-offensives, first to retake Badme in March 1999, and later in May 2000 on the Tsorona, Zalambessa and Assab fronts, led to devastating losses. The entrenched Eritrean positions were attacked head on by waves of Ethiopian foot sol- diers. Tens of thousands of young men perished on the plains of Badme and hillsides of Tsorona. When the Ethiopian military command leadership later assessed the ter- rible details and losses on the Tsorona front, they reportedly all broke down crying.22
8p6h | During the spring offensive of 2000, Ethiopia managed finally to break through the Eritrean defence lines on the Western and Central front lines. The Eritrean gov- ernment ordered a strategic retreat. At the same time they communicated accept- ance of a negotiated settlement and cease fire agreement.23 Although parts of the Ethiopian military and political leadership wanted to continue the offensive towards Asmara, Prime Minister Meles Zenawi ordered a halt in military opera- tions and indicated a willingness to negotiate. Total Ethiopian losses amounted to close to 100,000 killed and 200,000 wounded, while Eritrea officially lost 19,000. My personal communications with former high ranking members of the Eritrean armed forces indicates that the number might be twice as high.24
