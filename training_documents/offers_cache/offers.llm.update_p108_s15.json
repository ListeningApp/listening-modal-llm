        "content": "6561 | Obviously the less frequently you kick off new customers, the more powerful this is. For example, if you only start clients two times a year, people will be very inclined to sign up, especially as the date approaches. Even starting new clients every other week can confer this urgency nudge.\n2hrf | What if I lose sales by turning business away?\nmpyx | Just like guarantees, there is always a fear that you will make less money by employing this strategy. We are afraid that we will lose sales we would have otherwise made. Every experienced marketer on the planet will tell you - it is a fear, and it is unfounded. The biggest sales on a week long campaign or launch happen in the last four hours of the last day (up to fifty to sixty percent). That means that the last three percent of the time allotted creates fifty to sixty percent of the sales ... that's completely illogical, but also unmistakably human. So, just like a guarantee, you will make more money from the many people who decided to take action than people who actually missed out because in reality, those people were never going to buy (heck, they didn't even buy when they had their fee to the fire,\nqlzy | so why would they without?) Good to remember.\nsa6v | What to do if you just started a cohort and someone wants to buy ....\ngneb | You have two options: one) you can offer them a speedy personalized onboarding to get them up to speed as a \"bonus\" for signing up today and still get them in. Or, my preference, two) You can explain to them that since the next group starts in a little, they will have the advantage of having more time to review the materials, talk to their employees (for B to B products) or family members ( for B to C products). On top of that, they can have a more extended payment plan that you can only make available to them since the start date is so far out . . . an advantage that most clients do not get. In the end, remember, you always have the advantage because you are the one who calls the shots.\n1oqy | Two) Rolling Seasonal Urgency\nopno | In a digital setting, having actual sign up date countdowns is very useful. But make sure they are real. If they aren't, you'll lose credibility and just look like every other wannabe marketer. This is very common with internet businesses that use \"launch\" models. I personally love having the dates that I am running a promotion through on my landing pages and in my copy. I want it to be visible everywhere. The nice thing is that you can always fire up another ad campaign and a new landing page with new dates and be right as rain. You will see your conversions go through the roof, and it takes maybe five minutes of editing - well worth the time investment.\n0ahx | Example: Our New Year Promotion ends January thirtieth! Next Month: Our Valentines Lovers Promo Ends February thirtieth! Next Month: Our Sexy By Spring Special Ends March thirty-first! Next Month: Our Fools in Love April Promo Ends April thirtieth!\nx5cc | The actual promotion may be the same, but naming it something different \"by season\" gives you a \"real\" differentiator that gives you a start and a finish. Deadlines drive decisions. By simply having these, you can point to them and let human beings push themselves over the edge so as not to miss out.\nc7cg | Three) Pricing or Bonus-Based Urgency\nfiyl | This is another way of creating urgency using your actual offer or promotion/pricing structure as the thing they could miss out on (kind of brilliant!). It allows businesses that sell clients year round to still use urgency. For example, \"Yes, let's get you started today so you can take advantage of the discount you came in for. I'm not sure how long we will be running it as we change them every four weeks or so, and this is one of the better ones we have run in a while.\"\nyz7j | This creates some fear of missing out on the promotion (or discount or bonuses), rather than your actual service. It would be a lie to say that if you own a roofing business you won't service them if they buy after the date. But, if you talk specifically about the promotion you can often elicit the same urgency on buying in the prospect while maintaining your integrity - win-win. You can interchange a pricing promotion, discount, or added bonuses like free install or free onboarding or an extra workshop (valued at one thousand dollars) if they buy now. These are all things you can swap around your core offer to create urgency.\nwsee | Four) Exploding Opportunity\nilgr | On occasion you will be exposing the prospect to an arbitrage opportunity. The opportunity itself has a ticking time clock, as all great opportunities do. Every second someone delays, they miss out on disproportionate gains.\nhrx3 | Example: If I was explaining an arbitrage opportunity between buying products on E bay and selling them on A mazon, this market inefficiency would over time correct itself. The sooner someone acts the better it will be for them. This could be true for selling someone on the opportunity of trading cryptocurrencies, buying a stock, getting into a new platform to advertise before competitors jump on the bandwagon. Highly competitive job environments often get job offers that are \"exploding offers\" everyday they wait to take the job, their pay or bonuses decrease. This forces prospects to make fast decisions rather than try and \"wait it out\" to see if they get a better offer.\nna9n | All of these examples show opportunities that decay with time, so if you find yourself in front of an opportunity like this, make sure to emphasize it!\n8k3d | Summary Points\nagug | Adding a deadline and incorporating one or multiple forms of urgency will get more people to take action than would otherwise. I have employed all four of these methods with great effectiveness. I suggest you do the same. Next up ....

They are so powerful that they earned an entire chapter. In this chapter, I'm going to cover: what to offer, how to pick them, how to value them, how to present them, how to price them.\ns7uq | The main point I want you to take away from this is that a single offer is less valuable than the same offer broken into its component parts and stacked as bonuses (see image). The entirety of our offer we came up with at the end of the last section. This section is about how to present those pieces in what order. For example, I may in fact do lots of things in my service, but until I enumerate them, they are unknown. This is why every infomercial of all time continues on with \"but wait .... there's more!\"\nl11a | They would not use these techniques unless they were effective, as every second of air time costs money and must be justified with R O I. You'll also notice that if you watch those old infomercials, they would sell one knife for thirty-eight dollars and ninety-five cents then include thirty-seven other knives, sharpeners, pans, and guarantees to beat the prospect into submission. They establish the price, then they expand upon it until you feel it's such a good deal it would be stupid to pass it up.\nllit | The reason this works is we are increasing the prospect's price-to-value discrepancy by increasing the value delivered instead of cutting the price. We anchor the price we tell them to the core offer. Then with each increasingly valuable bonus, that discrepancy grows wider and wider until it's too big to bear and we snap the rubber band in their mind that is holding their wallet in their pocket.\nmf1f | We are now going to present that \"stack\" of deliverables that we assembled earlier in a way that makes them irresistible.",
