You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

b7cq | The figures provided by Willoughby, which were based on the information from the interrogated Chinese POWs, systematically decreased the size of the opposing force. This was accomplished by a selective use of the available data. On October 29, for example, many reports based on POW interrogations indicated that a massive PLA crossing of the Yalu had taken place. Nevertheless, Willoughby's assessment cited only one report and estimated that "only token forces from the Fortieth Army Headquarters and from each of its divisions entered Korea on 20 October."> Later, 4 while admitting that elements of four Chinese armies were in Korea, he counted the specific units of the captured soldiers but not their parent units. Thus, when visiting the X Corps in November he estimated that "probably only a battalion of volunteers of each division identified was actually in Korea."146 Justin Haynes rightly concluded: "Due to this method of analysis Willoughby accounted for only one third of Chinese Communist troops inside North Korea at that time."14 In fact, on the eve of the Second CPVF Campaign, Willoughby accounted for less than a fifth of the Chinese power. 148

qecd | In order to prevent challenges to his estimates Willoughby, strove to monopolize the estimates of the CPVF OB. Upon learning that CIA officers were participating in the interrogations of the Chinese POWs and reporting their findings to Washington, he began denying them access to the captured CPVF soldiers."4" <LATEX>H e</LATEX> also threatened to close down a CIA shop in Tokyo after learning that it had reported, based on information from Taiwanese intelligence, that the Chinese army had crossed the Yalu.15 As a result, the CIA estimates of the Chinese threat had to rely onWilloughby's reports. The same was true with the Joint Chiefs of Staff: 90 percent of their intelligence was based on Willoughby's reports.151 Consequently, the Far East Command evaluation of Chinese intervention capabilities and intentions "seem to have been the determining factor in shaping the future course of U.N. military action" in the war.152
1o7p | Following the end of the first Chinese campaign, the JCS considered three possible courses of action: hold the present line; resume the advancement to the Yalu; or withdraw to a better line of defense. In light of the lack of 4 clarity about the extent of Chinese threat, the JCS preferred the first option. Attempting to occupy the rest of North Korea was considered too risky and withdrawal was deemed morally and politically problematic.153 155 Nonetheless, under pressure from MacArthur and the JCS concern about an emerging State Department plan to create a buffer zone along the Yalu, the JCS gave the general reluctant approval to resume the offensive. Willoughby's underestimation of the Chinese force in Korea, as well as his assessment that the weakened CPVF was withdrawing northward, which was based on a Chinese deception to lure MacArthur to resume his offensive, significantly influenced this decision. Obviously, the prize of ending the war by Christmas outweighed a more cautious policy.154
cp13 | On the eve of the "home-by-Christmas offensive," the Eighth Army held 96 POWs, who testified that six Chinese armies (18 divisions) were in Korea. A day later, when the Eighth Army started its advancement, FEC G-2 provided its estimation of the enemy forces-82,799 North Korean and from 40,000 to 70,935 Chinese soldiers. Willoughby also assessed that the Chinese forces lacked ammunition reserves and stated, "Constant United Nations pressure along the entire line during the past few weeks should make it perfectly clear to the Reds that this drain on fire power is certainly not apt to be decreased but increased."15 <LATEX>1 5 5</LATEX> This optimism proved to be completely wrong. The Chinese were aware that the Americans underestimated their capabilities and intentions and planned to use this to achieve another surprise. By this stage, they had accumulated 380,000 soldiers in Korea (309,065 more than Willoughby's precise estimate indicated) and prepared for a counterattack.156 4
bgre | The systematic underestimation of the magnitude of the Chinese forces in Korea had a dramatic impact on the way the war developed. At the strategic level, the failure to realize that Beijing had already committed significant forces to Korea led to the mistaken conclusion that the relatively small number of Chinese forces in Korea was merely a means to save face after the public intervention threats. Hence, giving MacArthur the green light to renew the offensive was not seen as too risky. As the Army Chief of Staff, Gen. J. Lawton Collins, concluded, an American offensive "might well provide an out for the Chinese Communists to withdraw into Manchuria without loss of face." At the operational level, Willoughby's assessment that most of the Chinese army had not crossed the Yalu but remained in Manchuria made the option of reaching the Yalu more feasible and less perilous. The commanders of both the Eighth Army and the X Corps estimated that the enemy forces they were to confront "would fight only a delaying defensive action."158 This had a devastating effect on force deployment when the UN offensive was launched. In the case of the X Corps, for example, it "led to an ill-advised thinning out of American forces" when they started their offensive on November 27.15" And at the tactical level, Willoughby's gross underestimation of the magnitude of the Chinese threat left the forces at the front completely unaware of the enemy who confronted them, and completely unprepared when the full blow fell on them.

ukth | On November 25, a day after the beginning of MacArthur's offensive into what Halberstam defined as "the largest ambush in the era of modern warfare,"16 the Chinese counteroffensive was launched. It lasted until December 24 and delivered the United States one of the greatest defeats in its history. Under difficult weather conditions, and against a highly capable enemy, the surprised Eighth Army and X Corps had to withdraw to south of the 38th parallel. According to Chinese accounts, by the end of the Second Campaign, the UN losses amounted to 36,000 casualties and POWs, of which 24,000 were Americans. The CPV losses were 30,700. The war turned into a Chinese-US confrontation, and instead of ending in 1950, it lasted for another two-and-a-half years and took the lives of many more.
kpvt | p. 159 c. Explaining the intelligence failure
jie2 | A gross intelligence failure following an earlier one is the exception rather than the rule, as demonstrated by the other two dyads in this study. Our hypothesis has been that a second failure in a row will not result from insufficient information about the looming threat but, at least partially, emerge as the product of ineffective learning process after the first fiasco on the part of critical decision-makers. The American failure of November 1950 supports this hypothesis.
d0ik | Broadly speaking, the fundamental sin of the American estimation process, especially in the FEC, was that of hubris. MacArthur's successful landing in Inchon and the fast collapse of the KPA eroded the impact of the more painful events of the war's first months. This success, moreover, increased the American belief in its military superiority against any Asian opponent, and nurtured the cult of MacArthur's omnipotent leadership.
0x0s | The lack of an effective learning process was manifested in other forms as well. A major cause for the failure to provide a timely warning in June 1950 was the mistaken perception of the Communist bloc as a monolithic one. By this logic, a local North Korean military initiative was unlikely as long as the USSR was not ready for a global conflict. Five months later, the belief in a monolithic Communist world remained. For example, in the terminology of the FEC G-2 priority requirements, China was not defined as an independent entity but as "Soviet satellite China." As in the past, this belief was supported by military considerations, primarily the assumption that the PLA's inferiority in firepower and air power made an all-out Chinese intervention unlikely "without material assistance by Soviet naval and air-power." Since such a move by the Soviets would mean World War III, the probability of a massive Chinese intervention was low. The fact that a rather similar conception had proved wrong five months earlier had little impact on this estimate.
4exe | p. 160
0myz | p. 161 i. The state level
xh3i | A large percentage of the studies of the American intelligence failure in November 1950 focus on the processes in Washington that led to authorizing MacArthur to cross the 38th parallel. Richard Neustadt emphasized that the unification of Korea had become the prime war goal despite being ranked very low on President Truman's order of priorities. 14 Irving Janis, who regarded the crossing into North Korea as "the 4 Truman administration's Bay of Pigs," convincingly used his groupthink hypothesis to explain how sober and experienced policymakers "could succumb to the 'intoxication of success,' indulge in 'wishful thinking,' and collectively take enormous risks in a state of 'euphoria and optimism.' "15 Others emphasized the dominance of MacArthur's wishful estimation, which reflected Willoughby's underestimation of the Chinese threat." 166 Another explanation involved the influence of the hawkish group, primarily John Allison, Dean Rusk, and John Foster Dulles (a.k.a., the "Acheson group") in the State Department's discussions and the insufficient impact of Soviet and Chinese affairs' experts, such as George Kennan, "Chip" Bohlen, and George Butler. The military urge, particularly after the humiliating retreat in the first stage of the war, to exploit success and advance into North Korea proved irresistible, and public opinion supporting escalation and the atmosphere of Mccarthyism in the country at the time contributed to this outcome as well. Some explanations focus less on the atmosphere in which the decision was made and more on the role of the mistaken perception of the Communist world as monolithic, or on the American tendency toward mirror-imaging when asserting the Chinese war intentions. 168

kg3t | This study does not focus on the decision-making processes in the JCS, the State Department, or the White House, but on the more significant failure, the one attributed mainly to FEC G-2, to warn of an incoming massive Chinese counteroffensive prior to MacArthur's "home by Christmas offensive." This failure is, indeed, striking in light of Beijing's public and diplomatic warnings, repeated reports from POWs that the PLA had crossed the Yalu, and the military confrontations of October 25 through November 8, which proved that a massive Chinese intervention had already taken place without any earlier intelligence warning. It was this unrealistic and overly optimistic estimate that convinced Washington's policymakers to approve MacArthur's renewed offensive to the Yalu. And it was this estimate, which proved to be a major mistake, which facilitated the strategic military fiasco and the loss of so many additional American lives.
lvae | The issue at stake
o9sc | In contrast to the situation prior to the beginning of the war, when the Korean Peninsula ranked low in American intelligence priorities, the issue of Chinese intervention was considered critical and was ranked accordingly. Section 2 in the presidential directive of September 27 allowed MacArthur to cross the 38th parallel provided that by this entry there was "no entry into North Korea by major Soviet or Chinese Communist forces, no announcements of intended entry, nor a threat to counter our operations militarily." Although a latter directive expanded his room for maneuverability, the closer his forces advanced to the Yalu, the more critical the Chinese reaction became.
121u | The importance of the Chinese factor was manifested in the FEC G-2 intelligence requirements priority list. On October 5, when the UN forces started crossing the 38th parallel, the possibility that the Chinese would send reinforcements to the KPA forces ranked the highest."" Although it dropped to the second and the third ranks in the week that followed, President Truman's concern about Chinese intervention during his meeting with MacArthur brought the issue back to the top in the aftermath of the Wake Island conference. "Strangely enough" as Appleman put it, the Chinese factor dropped to second place on October 25, the day the CPVF launched its First Campaign.170
zh03 | The CPVF campaign constituted a clear answer to the question of whether China intended to intervene independently or not. But the command G-2's miscalculation of the CPVF OB led the JCS and the White

mqah | House to misperceive the motivation behind it. The Chinese factor continued to loom large in November and hindered the political and military approval for the UN advance to the Yalu. When the approval was given, it was not because of disregard of the Chinese threat but because of a mistaken intelligence estimation of its magnitude.
xxr8 | The quality of the intelligence information
rl4j | The quality of the intelligence information on the coming Chinese intervention was uneven. Sigint and Humint had provided a reasonable coverage of the PLA deployment in Manchuria in the months that preceded its crossing 4 of the Yalu. As Willoughby's sharp critic noted, FEC G-2 "accurately identified the massive Chinese build up in Manchuria, [and] recognized that PLA forces may have been committed in Korea by mid-October."1" The failure was in identifying the massive CPVF crossing into Korea. One FEC G- 2 report typically illustrates both success and the failure: The success was the reporting of the October 19 warning, from a source in Hong Kong, that 400,000 PLA troops were ready to cross the Yalu, reported by the FEC G-2 on October 20. With it came the failure: the report also indicated that reconnaissance flights revealed no indications of a massive Chinese military crossing into North Korea." By this point, thousands of Chinese soldiers had already crossed the Yalu. Aerial photography failed to identify them because the flights took place during daytime over main roads, while the Chinese forces crossed at night using back roads and trails. Sigint was not much better. It provided indications of the concentration of forces in Manchuria but-due to a combination of effective Chinese radio security and ineffective American Sigint collection-failed to provide indications for the CPVF massive crossing and deployment in Korea. Ineffective learning from the Sigint failure to provide information on the KPA's deployment five months earlier played a significant role here as well.

ncb0 | The poor quality of intelligence collection on the CPVF deployment can account for the American surprise in the First Chinese Campaign. But it cannot explain the surprise of the Second Campaign of late November. As Appleman argued, "It is obvious that the FEC was in possession of a great amount of intelligence concerning the Chinese and their relations to the Korean War.""Haynes was even sharper, arguing, "By the end of the first week of November 1950, the FEC G-2 had enough data to identify the Chinese order of battle in Korea and should have been able to determine that the Chinese Communists had fully committed to entering the Korean War."174 Indeed, the battles that took place during the First Campaign and the reports provided by POW interrogations sufficed to warrant a conclusion that the CPVF OB in Korea was far larger than Willoughby's estimates indicated.
