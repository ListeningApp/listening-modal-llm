Niche partitioning among fruit pigeons - four key niche dimensions: Fruit Size: Larger species feed mostly on larger fruits (large beaks can handle these)\nxd5o | Bird Size and Weight: Body size positively correlated to preferred fruit sizes eaten\n3gny | Thickness of Branches: Body size positively correlated with branch thickness\nws73 | Position on Branches: Small species foraging on outer branches and twigs due to lower weight.\nvyos | Summary - Animal Ecology Experimental Methods\nw4hq | One. Three Animal Ecology Experimental Methods\nghbe | · Laboratory: small animals, simple principles, strong controls\n1lkf | · Field Experiments: small-medium sized, advanced set-up, limited control\nuobn | · Natural Experiments: any size of animal, large sample size, poor controls\n3194 | Two. Seven Major Ways to demonstrate competitive interactions\nr22o | · Competitive Exclusion: Yeast and grain beetle competition for space\nnupw | · Niche shift: Dietary shift between two salmonids (allopatry-sympatry)\n37xs | · Ecological release: Barnacle competition for space (Displacement)\nhoi0 | · Density compensation: Rodent-ant competition for seed (Displacement) · Contiguous allopatry: Chipmunk habitat occupation (allopatry-sympatry)\ntffb | · Character displacement: Food partitioning - Fruit pigeons, mud snails\newwt | · Predator-mediated co-existence: Starfish predation (Displacement)\n2tj1 | Summary - Animal Ecology Experimental Methods\nnbhq | Three.

The Explanatory Concept for competition: Fundamental versus Realised Niche\n9zmh | Lecture Three: The Basis of the Ecological Niche Concept\nmi3g | One. Definitions of important terminologies in Ecological Niche Concept\nntjg | · Habitat component: Grinnell\n86at | · Trophic component: Elton\nbpd2 | · Multi-dimensional: Hutchinson\nhkd8 | · Abiotic-biotic multidimensional: Begon-Krebs-Ricklefs\nsptg | Two. Overview of perception of niche dimensionality\n2k40 | · Niche dimensions: Biotic and abiotic components interacting\nkrk7 | · Graphical depiction: One-, two-, three-, multi-dimensional visualization\n4tyc | · Dimensional interaction: Dimensions can be unrelated or inter-dependent\n2mjl | Lecture Three: The Basis of the Ecological Niche Concept\n6d9q | Three. Comparison of two niches types and the eco-potential of a species\nwsc1 | · Eco-potential: Genotype determined/ limited maximum potential\nor3l | · Fundamental: Optimum niche, phenotype limited by environmental factors\nfbyc | · Realised: Limited by biotic interactions: competition, predation, parasitism\nvceo | Four. Foraging Niche concept and fitness of animals\nkd78 | · Fitness: Population size, reproductive and survivorship rates\n896u | · Utilization and Response Curves: Bell-shaped, normal distribution, idealized\no0si | · Three Levels: Trophic (what-), Spatial (where-), Temporal (when) to eat\n1fx8 | · According to Joseph Grinnel, an American ecologist, Ecological Niche is defined it as \"The ultimate distributional unit of a species\"\ntfms | · Grinnel implied that niches do not overlap, but are disjunct. Species display their fundamental niches; hence there is no apparent competition among them.\npfv5 | · Charles S. Elton, a British ecologist, went further by using a more functional view concept, and defined Ecological niche as: \"The trophic position of a species in the biotic environment\".\n8gxa | · Elton viewed the niche as a simplistic subdivision within the traditional trophic grouping as herbivores, carnivores etc., i.e. the mere feeding habits or dietary trait of a species.\nfsvi | · George Evelyn Hutchinson, after thirty years, proposed the most comprehensive concept to date\n068d | \"The n-dimensional hypervolume or hyperspace of a species\"\nysz7 | · The Hutchinsonian concept implies the total range of environmental variables to which a species must be adapted, and under which a species population lives and reproduces indefinitely.\nk5db | · The Hutchinsonian concept therefore involves both habitat and functional aspects\n7jzh | · The environmental variables include physical, chemical and biotic parameters\nvm00 | · These variables can be viewed as a gradient along which species utilize with different intensities, and each gradient is considered as an n-dimensional space. Adding up all these forms the niche hyperspace\n62qe | · The niche can be viewed as an n-sided flexible ball that can take any form in an n-dimensional coordinate system and represents the responses of the species population to all environmental variables.\nypz9 | · In multidimensional geometry with n-number of axes, the niche of an organism is graphically depicted, when all relevant environmental variables are included and these are independent of each other\nmpml | · Begon et al.: \"The limits, for all important environmental features, within which all individuals of a species can survive, grow and reproduce\"\nimnm | · Krebs: \"The role or profession of an organism in the environment; its activities and relationships in the community\"\n8na8 | · A very broad definition comprising all biotic interactions (competition, mutualism etc)\nul2a | · Ricklefs: Formal Definition - \"The ranges of many conditions and resource qualities within which the organism or species persists\" (i.e. perceived as the multi-dimensional space)\n4eaf | · Informal Definition - \"The ecological role of a species in the community\"\n4b6k | · Polechová & Storch: \"Ecological niche indicates the position of a species within an ecosystem, describing both the range of conditions necessary for persistence of species, and its ecological role in the ecosystem.\nhxiu | · The diversity of definitions illustrates to what extent the niche is perceived as a species or community property: Is the niche created by the species itself, or by its surroundings?\n1ylw | · Or as a dynamic mutual interaction? Let us examine an example - The Beaver\nwaqw | The Niche Concept - Dynamics\nnf6a | · The Beaver (Castor Canadensis, C. fiber) creates dams by felling trees across fast-flowing rivers, hence creating a new environment of stagnant water in which they build their nests.\n5g96 | · Hence beavers create their own habitat which is conducive both for itself and for many other organisms - i.e. beavers impact their habitat by virtue of a specialised niche of dam building.\n```",
