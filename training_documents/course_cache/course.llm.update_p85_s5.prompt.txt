You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

xs3r | Lecture 7 - Foraging Theory
ffuj | What is Optimal Foraging Theory, OPT?
h7f6 | . It is a behavioral ecology model that helps predict how an animal behaves when searching for food
t74k | Aim of the Optimal Foraging Theory
qdn7 | · To predict the foraging strategy of a forager/predator to be expected under specified condition
dib4 | O Important terminologies
yvqj | . Ideal Free Distribution theory - theory which makes a case of uniform distribution of food for predators such that there is no need for foragers to switch foraging patches.
vz2f | · Functional response - deals with a predator's intake rate in response to variation in prey distribution and densities
wyu0 | · Aggregate response - explains how predators are distributed in response to prey availability
s8xw | · Total response = Functional response + Aggregate response
afv1 | Assumptions inherent in Optimal Foraging Theory
fwf1 | 1. The foraging behaviour that is exhibited by present-day animals is the one that has been favoured by natural selection in the past but almost enhances an animal's fitness at present
3wck | 2. High fitness is achieved by a high net rate of energy intake (i.e. gross energy intake minus the energetic costs of obtaining that energy)
jq2u | 3. Experimental animals are observed in an environment to which their foraging behaviour is suited
9zf9 | Scenarios which unjustify the OFT
clwo | 1. Other aspects of the organism's behaviour may influence fitness more than optimal foraging does. E.g. premium on avoidance of predators coercing animals to forage at places and at times associated with lower predation risk trading off efficiency in food gathering.
aki1 | 2. Variation in the efficiencies of energy gathering process exploiting different dietary constituents (e.g. nitrogen) by many consumers (herbivores and omnivores) creating the need for consumers to forage on a mixed and balanced diet.
vf5h | Theoreticians & Mathematicians
l51p | . OFT makes predictions about foraging behaviour based on mathematical models
s9zz | · Important Question
x97k | · Is it necessary for a real forager to be equally omniscient and mathematical, if it is to adopt the appropriate , optimal strategy?
qwix | Theoreticians are omniscient mathematicians - the foragers need not be
6lnq | · The answer is NO, because
nxb1 | . Theory says that if a forager that in some way manages to do the right thing in the right circumstances, then this forager
kwpw | 1. Will be favoured by natural selection
usfa | 2. Possible inheritance of newly acquired abilities by future generations
dnjr | 3. Abilities spread, in evolutionary time, throughout the population
qser | Parameterizing the OFT 1
8gam | · Foraging entails predators expending time and energy in obtaining food (MacArthur & Pianka, 1966)
z4db | · Intake rates of a predator is dependent on the searching (encounter rate) and handling (i.e. pursuing, subduing and consuming it) times of prey
lw7l | · Generalists pursue (and may then subdue and consume) a large proportion of the prey types they encounter
2exi | · Specialists continue searching except when they encounter prey of their specifically preferred type
16py | Parameterizing the OFT 2
m4ov | · Specialists will only pursue profitable prey items, but may expend a great deal of time and energy searching for them
9uqd | · Generalists will spend relatively little time searching but they will pursue both more or less profitable types of prey
8szx | · An optimal forager should therefore balance the pros and cons so as to maximise its overall rate of energy intake
iwdc | Parameterizing the OFT 3
4vks | · Given that a predator already includes a certain number of profitable items in its diet, should it expand its diet (and thereby decrease its search time) by including the next most profitable item as well?
uyaf | · The next most profitable prey item for an optimal forager
d1qh | Ei hi
nyqt | Profitability =
7odd | where E; is the energy content of the next most profitable ith prey item and h; its handling time
0le2 | · In addition, E / h is the average profitability of the 'present' diet (i.e. one that includes all prey types that are more profitable that i, but does not include prey type i itself), and
5dw0 | · s is the average search time for the present diet
i4yq | Parameterizing the OFT 4
fj3g | · If a predator does pursue a prey item of type i, then its expected rate of energy intake is E;/h;
zuua | · If it ignores this prey item, whilst pursuing all those that are more profitable, then it can expect to search further. The total expected rate of energy intake
elwn | E (5 +h)
jnqv | where E is the average energy content, s is the average search time and h is the average handling time for the present diet
unp3 | Parameterizing the OFT 4
v8vk | . The most profitable, optimal strategy for a predator will be to pursue the ith item if, and only if
sr40 | Ei / hi > Ē / (5 + h)
5zjj | . The optimal diet model leads to a number of predictions
f56l | 1. Predators with shorter handling times than search times should be generalists, because the short times taken to handle prey items already found would allow them to commence searching for another prey.
ar2z | 2. Predators with longer handling times than search times should be specialists because once a prey has been seen and began to be handled (include pursuit), the predator cannot go in for another food. Therefore, such predators should go in for the most profitable prey. 12
yad0 | Parameterizing the OFT 5
3g38 | 3. Predators should have broader diets in unproductive environments (where prey items are relatively rare and s is relatively large) than in a productive environment (where s is smaller)
vtbo | 4. Predators should ignore insufficiently profitable food types irrespective of their abundance
q8pa | 5. Provides a context for understanding the narrow specialization of predators that live in intimate association with their prey. Since their whole lifestyle and life cycle are finely tuned to those of their prey, handling time is low.
uc9x | · Two studies of optimal diet choice that show a clear but limited
zy7o | correspondence with the predictions of the optimal diet model. Diets are more specialised at high prey densities; but more low profitability items are included than predicted by the theory
