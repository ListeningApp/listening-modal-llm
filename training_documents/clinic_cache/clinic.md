SYSTEMATIC REVIEW

Prevalence of stable and successfully treated periodontitis subjects and incidence of subsequent tooth loss within supportive periodontal care: A systematic review with meta-analyses


## Abstract

Aim: To identify (i) the prevalence of meeting the endpoints of 'stable periodontitis' (probing pocket depth less than or equal to four millimeters, bleeding on probing less than ten, no bleeding on probing at four millimeter sites), 'endpoints of therapy' (no probing pocket depth greater than four millimeters with bleeding on probing, no probing pocket depth greater than or equal to six millimeters, 'controlled periodontitis' (less than or equal to four sites with probing pocket depth greater than or equal to five millimeters, 'probing pocket depth less than five millimeters' and probing pocket depth less than six millimeters at the start of supportive periodontal care) and (ii) the incidence of tooth loss in relation to not meeting these endpoints within a minimum of five years of supportive periodontal care.

Materials and Methods: Systematic electronic and manual searches were conducted to identify studies where subjects, upon completion of active periodontal therapy, entered into supportive periodontal care. Duplicate screening was performed to find relevant articles. Corresponding authors were contacted to confirm inclusion and retrieve required clinical data for further analyses to assess the prevalence of reaching endpoints and incidence of subsequent tooth loss, if available, within at least five years of supportive periodontal care. Meta- analyses were carried out to evaluate risk ratios for tooth loss in relation to not reaching the various endpoints.

Results: Fifteen studies including twelve thousand eight hundred eighty-four patients and three hundred twenty-three thousand one hundred eleven teeth were retrieved. Achievement of endpoints at baseline supportive periodontal care was rare (one point three five percent, eleven point zero zero percent and thirty-four point six two percent, respectively, for 'stable periodontitis', 'endpoints of therapy' and 'controlled periodontitis'). Less than a third of the one thousand one hundred ninety subjects with five years of supportive periodontal care data lost teeth-a total of three point one four percent of all teeth were lost. Statistically significant associations with tooth loss, at the subject-level, were found for not achieving 'controlled periodontitis' (relative risk equals two point five seven) , probing pocket depth less than five millimeters (relative risk equals one point five nine) and probing pocket depth less than six millimeters (relative risk equals one point nine eight). Conclusions: An overwhelming majority of subjects and teeth do not achieve the proposed endpoints for periodontal stability, yet most periodontal patients preserve most of their teeth during an average of ten to thirteen years in supportive periodontal care.


## Clinical Relevance

Scientific rationale for study: The risk of tooth loss is determined by clinical periodontal parameters as established in the literature. Composite measures have been established to determine when it is appropriate to end active periodontal therapy.

Principal findings: Only a small proportion of subjects reach currently defined endpoints of periodontal therapy, although tooth loss presents as a rare event in treated periodontitis. Practical implications: The findings are novel and can have a significant impact on clinical practice, policy and research. It may be necessary to revisit the clinical endpoints of periodontal therapy to better reflect the risk of tooth loss during supportive periodontal care.


## One INTRODUCTION |

Defining periodontal health at the subject- and tooth-level is pivotal in establishing acceptable therapeutic endpoints and to evaluate individualized risk for periodontal disease progression. A successfully treated 'stable periodontitis' subject, as per the World Workshop Classification twenty seventeen, is defined as one with probing pocket depth (PPD) less than or equal to four millimeters, no bleeding on probing (BoP) at four millimeter sites and bleeding on probing in less than ten percent sites. The European Federation of Periodontology (EFP) composed S three treatment guideline-a four-step approach-to treat stages one to three periodontitis. Clinical guidelines for periodontal treatment should consider tangible outcomes-tooth survival and re-treatment. Based on evidence for disease progression, EFP's S three treatment guideline proposed 'endpoints of therapy' for a patient to enter supportive periodontal care (SPC)-no probing pocket depth greater than four millimeters with bleeding on probing and no probing pocket depth greater than or equal to six millimeters. A 'treat-to-target' approach has also been proposed. 'Controlled periodontitis', defined as having less than or equal to four sites with probing pocket depth greater than or equal to five millimeters, incorporates the effects of different periodontal treatments.

Guidance may present us with an ideal scenario where unless the endpoints are met, a subject should not enter into supportive periodontal care. Yet, the evidence is unclear whether this is the reality within clinical practice. The aim of this systematic review is to assess the prevalence of treated periodontitis subjects who have met the following definitions:

· 'Stable periodontitis'

· 'Endpoints of therapy'

· 'Controlled periodontitis'

.

probing pocket depth less than five millimeters.

probing pocket depth less than six millimeters. With tooth loss being the final sequela of periodontitis, the proposed endpoints should be based on whether their unachievement results in increased tooth loss. Therefore, the relationships between the aforementioned endpoints and subsequent tooth loss during a minimum of five years of supportive periodontal care were also assessed, leading to the following focused questions:

. Focused question one: What is the prevalence of periodontitis in subjects who, at the start of supportive periodontal care, meet the aforementioned endpoints?

· Focused question two: What is the incidence of periodontitis- related (when reported) or non-specific tooth loss among treated adult periodontitis subjects, using each of the above definitions, who have been in supportive periodontal care for a minimum of five years?


## Two MATERIALS AND METHODS |

Two point one Protocol development and registration |

A systematic review protocol was prepared according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidance. Details of the protocol were registered on PROSPERO on sixteenth February twenty twenty-two. Amendments were made to the original protocol to expand the number of endpoints assessed.


## Two point two Eligibility criteria |

Two point two point one PICOS components

Population: Adult human subjects with periodontitis (excluding as a manifestation of systemic or necrotizing disease), who have completed active periodontal therapy (APT). Studies with inclusion/exclusion criteria that would affect the outcome of this systematic review (i.e., prevalence of reaching endpoints) were excluded.

Intervention: APT encompasses many interventions ranging from behavioral changes to surgical interventions. Studies including a minimum of subgingival non-surgical periodontal therapy (NSPT) as part of their APT were selected (focused question one).

Comparison: Not applicable.

Outcome measures: The primary outcomes were defined as follows:

FQ-one assesses the prevalence of subjects who achieved the aforementioned endpoints at the end of APT/start of SPC.

FQ-two was the incidence of tooth loss (periodontitis-related when available) for treated subjects who had been in SPC for a minimum of five years and its association with various endpoints.

Study design: Randomized controlled trials, cohort (prospective/retrospective), case-control and cross-sectional studies published from twenty seventeen were included. Cross-sectional studies were included if the original retrospective data from the study could be obtained. Studies selected for FQ-one with a minimum SPC follow-up of five years were used to answer FQ-two.


## Two point three Literature search

A search strategy was formulated with an experienced librarian using a combination of MeSH and free-text terms, with no language restrictions. Electronic database searches included Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and OpenGrey from twenty seventeen to eighteenth February twenty twenty-two. This was complemented by a manual search of the Journal of Dental Research, the Journal of Clinical Periodontology, the Journal of Periodontology and the Journal of Periodontal Research from twenty seventeen to eighteenth February twenty twenty-two. Reference lists of the included articles and relevant reviews were manually searched. Editors of the above-named journals were contacted about any articles in press that fit the inclusion criteria.


## Two point four Screening and study inclusion

Study selection was based on a two-step approach: (i) screening of titles and abstracts and (ii) full-text analysis, with reasons for exclusion. Full texts were obtained for those studies selected by at least one reviewer. Both steps were performed in duplicate by two independent reviewers. Disagreements were resolved by consensus. An arbitrator was consulted if the disagreement could not be resolved. Where studies showed duplication of the subject sample or database, the first published study with all the required data or relevant multi-centre study were selected. Inter-observer agreement at both stages was assessed via the Cohen's kappa statistic. The corresponding authors were contacted to confirm inclusion, as individual patient data are rarely reported.


## Two point five Data collection

Two point five point one Data extraction

Data were extracted from journal articles based on the general study and population characteristics. Subject-, tooth- and site-level data for periodontal parameters, P-P-D plus or minus BoP, were extracted from individual six-point pocket charts or datasets, sent by the journal article authors, by one reviewer. Alternatively, the authors completed a summary data collection form if they opted to do their own reanalysis. Depending on availability, data were for subjects accounted for in the sample size of the selected journal article or the whole database on which the journal article was based. Data were entered into tables stratified by study design on

Microsoft Excel. Data consistency, completeness and sequence generation were reviewed by the second reviewer. Any disagreements were resolved by consensus. An arbitrator was consulted if the disagreement could not be resolved.


## Two point five point two RoB assessment

Quality assessment was carried out by one reviewer and reviewed independently by another reviewer. Included studies were assessed using Cochrane Risk of Bias, RoB, Two Tool for RCTs, the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for cohort and case-control studies, and the AXIS tool for cross-sectional studies. Disagreements were resolved by consensus. An arbitrator was consulted if it could not be resolved.


## Two point six. Data analyses

The data were used to assess the prevalence of achieving the aforementioned endpoints at the subject-level and, when possible, tooth level. Although 'stable periodontitis' defines a case at the subject-level, the composite measures defining the endpoint P P D less than or equal to four millimeters and P P D equals four millimeters plus BoP were used at the tooth level to identify the teeth responsible for not meeting the endpoint. The number of diseased teeth per patient, as per WWC twenty seventeen, was calculated using the total number of 'unstable' teeth divided by the total number of (i) subjects and (ii) 'unstable' subjects.

Incidence of tooth loss within a minimum duration of five years of SPC was recorded at the subject- and tooth-level in relation to the various endpoints. The number of teeth lost per patient per SPC year was calculated using the total number of teeth lost divided by the total number of subjects with tooth loss data divided by the weighted average SPC years.

Authors of journal articles were contacted if any queries arose from the data. Where data were unavailable for a subject, the corresponding subject was eliminated from the analyses.

Meta-analyses were performed using 'RStudio' application and R core software to determine the association between the incidence of tooth loss during SPC, as a summary risk ratio, and the unsuccessful achievement of various endpoints. Studies answering FQ-2 with zero subjects or teeth within one of the arms (successful or unsuccessful in meeting endpoints) were not included in the meta-analyses, as two arms were required for the calculation of relative risk. The zero count was inflated to zero point five to avoid computational errors for studies where no events (tooth loss) were observed in one or both arms. Sub-analyses of studies following conventional APT, as per EFP's S three treatment guideline, or those reporting periodontitis-related tooth loss were performed to explore possible causes of heterogeneity among study results. Relative risks, their ratios and the corresponding ninety-five percent confidence intervals were calculated as effect sizes. With treatment outcome affected by subject-, tooth- and treatment-related factors, a random effects model was deemed appropriate to calculate the average distribution of mean effects, based on clinical and statistical reasoning. The Paule-Mandel method was chosen to

Ten zero point five. Non-applicable calculate the mean effect. Knapp-Hartung adjustments were used to calculate the confidence interval around the pooled effect.

The extent and impact of inter-study heterogeneity was assessed by inspecting the forest plots and by calculating the tau squared absolute heterogeneity and the I squared statistics relative heterogeneity, respectively. I squared defined the proportion of total variability in the result explained by heterogeneity, and not chance. We considered arbitrarily I squared greater than seventy-five percent to represent considerable heterogeneity.

Meta-analytical positive predictive values (a subject/tooth not meeting an endpoint and experiencing tooth loss) and negative predictive values (a subject/tooth meeting the endpoint and not experiencing tooth loss) were estimated at the subject and tooth level using pooled sensitivity and specificity for tooth loss across studies. For the meta-analytical pooling of the sensitivity and specificity, the bivariate approach was used as an improvement and extension of the traditional summary receiver operating characteristic approach and the mada function in R.


## RESULTS

Three point one. Study selection

The initial search generated one thousand six hundred eighty-two articles from all databases combined, nine from manual search and one via editorial contact.

Following screening of titles and abstracts, two hundred thirty articles qualified for full-text screening. The Cohen's kappa value for inter-reviewer agreement was zero point nine three at first stage of screening and zero point nine two at the second stage. Corresponding authors of the sixty-two articles considered potentially suitable for inclusion were contacted for confirmation that all requested data were available. Individual patient data were available for nine studies and summaries of the requested data were made available via completed contingency tables for a further six studies. There were no important issues in checking individual patient data integrity.


## Three point one point one. Focused question one

A total of fifteen studies were included in the qualitative and quantitative analyses. They included three randomized controlled trials both test and control groups were considered in the analyses, ten cohort one prospective and nine retrospective and two cross-sectional studies.

The publication year ranged from twenty seventeen to twenty twenty-two. Eleven studies were undertaken in Europe, two in China and one each in the Dominican Republic and United States. Eight studies were based in university hospitals and seven studies in private practice. A total of twelve thousand eight hundred eighty-four subjects were included. Of these, twelve thousand five hundred sixty-three subjects from eleven studies had complete site-level data (inclusive of BoP). Three

studies did not follow conventional APT: one RCT included NSPT and laser only, and two retrospective cohort studies included only NSPT.


## Three point one point two Focused question two

A total of twelve studies including one thousand one hundred ninety subjects had a minimum of five years of follow-up in SPC and were included in the qualitative and quantitative analyses. Eight studies including eight hundred sixty-nine subjects had complete site-level data and so were used in the analyses assessing the relationships between 'stable periodontitis' and 'endpoints of therapy' and subsequent tooth loss. Ten studies followed conventional APT. Five studies reported on periodontitis-related tooth loss, and so this data were used when available. Studies without two arms were subsequently not included in the corresponding meta-analyses when analyzing the WWC twenty seventeen and PPD greater than or equal to six millimeters.


## Three point one point three Prevalence of stable and successfully treated periodontitis subjects at the start of SPC

Table two and Supplemental Material S four display the prevalence data of each of the fifteen studies at the subject and tooth level for achieving the endpoints.


## Subject-level data

Of twelve thousand five hundred sixty-three subjects who had complete site-level data, one point three five percent (n equals one hundred sixty-nine) fulfilled the criteria of 'stable periodontitis' and eleven percent met the 'endpoints of therapy'. 'Controlled periodontitis' was achieved in thirty-four point six two percent (n equals four thousand four hundred sixty) of the twelve thousand eight hundred eighty-four subjects, while PPD is less than five millimeters and PPD is less than six millimeters were achieved in six point seven percent (n equals eight hundred sixty-three) and thirty point four five percent (n equals three thousand nine hundred twenty-three) of subjects, respectively. Achievement of endpoints varied greatly across studies. The prevalence of reaching each of the five subject-level endpoints increased when studies following conventional APT were analyzed (nine point four three percent fulfilled the criteria of 'stable periodontitis', twenty-seven point six percent met the 'endpoints of therapy', fifty-two point four two percent achieved 'controlled periodontitis', while twenty-one point zero eight percent and forty-nine point seven six percent achieved PPD is less than five millimeters and PPD is less than six millimeters, respectively).


## Tooth-level data

Of three hundred twenty-three thousand one hundred eleven teeth, three hundred fourteen thousand nine hundred sixty-three teeth had complete site-level data. A total of fifty-four point six nine percent and seventy-three point five five percent of teeth met the composite measures described in 'stable periodontitis' and 'endpoints of therapy', respectively, and sixty-eight point five two percent and eighty-seven point three two percent of all included teeth had P P D is less than five millimeters and PPD is less than six millimeters, respectively. Maxillary molars achieved tooth-level endpoints least frequently (twenty-four point one eight percent and forty-seven point two zero percent, respectively, for 'stable periodontitis' and 'endpoints of therapy'), closely followed by mandibular molars. As per WWC twenty seventeen, there were eleven point three six and eleven point five one 'diseased' teeth per patient after APT among all twelve thousand five hundred sixty-three subjects and twelve thousand three hundred ninety-four 'unstable' subjects, respectively. This reduced to four point seven nine and five point two nine 'diseased' teeth in all seven hundred thirty-two subjects and six hundred sixty-three 'unstable' subjects, respectively, from studies following conventional APT.


## Three point one point four Tooth loss at five years according to endpoints at the start of SPC

Figures two and three display subject- and tooth-level meta-analyses of not achieving the various endpoints and tooth loss. Table three outlines the statistical analyses.


## Subject-level data

Table four shows that less than a third, thirty point twenty-five percent, of all subjects lost their teeth during an average SPC period of nine point eight eight years. Unsuccessful achievement of 'controlled periodontitis' R R equals two point five seven; P equals point zero zero three zero, P P D less than five millimeters R R equals one point five nine; P equals point zero one six zero and P P D less than six millimeters R R equals one point nine eight; P equals point zero two seven five were associated with tooth loss. Unsuccessful attainment of 'stable periodontitis' P equals point one two two one and 'endpoints of therapy' P equals point zero eight eight six failed to reach statistical significance for association with tooth loss. PPVs and NPVs of the five subject-level endpoints ranged between five point one percent 'controlled periodontitis' and P P D less than six millimeters and twenty point six percent 'stable periodontitis' and between ninety-seven point eight percent 'controlled periodontitis' and ninety-nine point nine percent 'stable periodontitis', respectively. Studies following conventional APT showed statistically significant associations for not achieving 'controlled periodontitis' R R equals two point seven eight, P equals point zero zero six eight and PPD less than five millimeters R R equals one point seven zero, P equals point zero one seven nine over an average SPC period of twelve point seven five years. Supplemental Material S six reports results relative to studies reporting periodontitis-related tooth loss. Heterogeneity in subject-level studies and analyses varied from unimportant to substantial but did not seem to affect the direction of effects but affected only the precision with which the summary effect was calculated. Contour-enhanced funnel plots showed small sample bias among all meta-analyses. Studies showing statistically significant results were most frequently found in analyses of 'controlled periodontitis' and ‘PPD less than six millimeters'.


## Tooth-level data

Of twenty-nine thousand eight hundred nine teeth in subjects who were in SPC during an average period of nine point eight eight years, three point one four percent, nine hundred thirty-six, were extracted for all reasons. Non-achievement of all endpoints at the tooth level was statistically significant and associated with an increased risk of tooth loss 'stable periodontitis' R R equals ten point three three; P less than point zero zero zero one; 'endpoints of therapy' R R equals sixteen point three four; P equals point zero zero one; P P D less than five millimeters R R equals nine point six six; P less than point zero zero zero one; PPD less than six millimeters R R equals ten point eight seven; P less than point zero zero zero one. The results remained largely unchanged in sub-analyses of studies following conventional APT and those reporting periodontitis-related tooth loss.

Positive predictive values and negative predictive values of the four tooth-level endpoints ranged between twelve point eight percent (probing pocket depth less than six millimeters) and fifteen point one percent ('stable periodontitis') and between twenty-nine point three percent ('probing pocket depth less than six millimeters') and eighty-eight point two percent ('stable periodontitis'), respectively. The total number of teeth lost per patient per year of supportive periodontal care was zero point zero eight (all studies: average of nine point eight eight supportive periodontal care years) and zero point zero six (conventional anti-plaque therapy studies: average of twelve point seven five supportive periodontal care years). Heterogeneity in the tooth-level studies and analyses varied from unimportant to considerably higher compared to the subject-level findings but did not affect the direction of effects (i.e., lack of periodontal stability led to tooth loss) and only affected the precision with which the summary effect was calculated.


## Three point two. Risk of bias assessment

Supplemental Material S ten reports the risk of bias assessments for randomized controlled trials, cohort and cross-sectional studies. Risk of bias for cohort studies ranged from five to six stars, with the item 'comparability' always scored as zero. Randomized controlled trials showed low risk of bias or some concerns due to missing data in follow-up studies.


## Four. Discussion

This systematic review confirms that very few periodontitis cases achieve the proposed endpoints following steps one, two, and three of periodontal therapy. In studies following conventional anti-plaque therapy, nine point four three percent of subjects achieved 'stable periodontitis' and twenty-seven point six percent achieved the desirable 'endpoints of therapy'. Our data showed that fifty-four point two percent of subjects achieved 'controlled periodontitis', coinciding with a multi-centre study where approximately fifty percent of the population was within the limits of 'controlled periodontitis'. The prevalence of achieving and sustaining these endpoints is likely to be reduced further with increased time of supportive periodontal care and reduced operator experience. Therefore, the reality of successfully achieving or sustaining these endpoints in general dental practice is likely to be limited further.

An average of eleven point three six teeth per patient were considered 'diseased' after anti-plaque therapy. This result needs to be interpreted in light of the proven efficacy of steps one and two of periodontal therapy, which show an overall proportion of seventy-four percent of 'pocket closure' (probing pocket depth less than or equal to four millimeters and an absence of bleeding on probing), bearing in mind that the efficiency of non-surgical periodontal therapy is reduced in areas of difficult access, such as furcations or deep pockets.

Analyzing long-term outcomes showed that twenty-nine point zero five percent of 'unstable' subjects, as per World Workshop on the Classification of Periodontal and Peri-Implant Diseases and Conditions two thousand seventeen and following conventional anti-plaque therapy, experienced tooth loss during a mean observation period of twelve point seven five years. Yet, only eight point four nine percent of teeth responsible for an 'unstable' diagnosis were extracted. The lack of a statistically significant association of tooth loss at the subject level (relative risk equals one point three six; P equals zero point two zero seven two) within this data supports that an 'unstable' periodontitis subject does not increase the risk for periodontitis-related tooth loss among subjects strongly compliant with supportive periodontal care. Consideration of this endpoint may be important when planning treatment at the tooth level, for example, utilizing a 'stable' abutment tooth where our data highlight a relative risk equals ten point two seven for tooth loss if the tooth is 'unstable'.

Although approximately one third (thirty-four point three four percent) of the subjects not meeting the 'endpoints of therapy' lost teeth during supportive periodontal care after conventional anti-plaque therapy, similarly, statistical significance was reached only at the tooth level (relative risk equals fourteen point eight six; P equals zero point zero one five one). This may be due to bleeding on probing, a variable of these composite endpoints, which has been found to be a useful predictor of periodontal progression and subsequent tooth loss only at the tooth level. Yet, the effect of smoking on masking the predictive ability of bleeding on probing cannot be excluded. Less than twenty percent of subjects within this dataset were current smokers.

'Controlled periodontitis' was the most frequently achieved endpoint (fifty-two point four two percent) among studies following conventional anti-plaque therapy. At the subject level, it has a relative risk of two point seven eight (P equals zero point zero zero six eight) of tooth loss during supportive periodontal care when not achieved, which is similar to the findings reported elsewhere. Unlike other subject-level endpoints, this endpoint considers multiple residual sites, which is relevant, as subject- and tooth-level factors can affect the treatment response, particularly in relation to specific tooth types. All endpoints showed low positive predictive values and high negative predictive values at the subject level, supporting existing literature.

The number of teeth lost per subject per year of supportive periodontal care varied between zero point zero six and zero point zero eight, corroborating that a small number of teeth are lost in a small proportion of the population. Optimal adherence to long-term supportive periodontal care has been shown to effectively reduce the progression of periodontitis and tooth loss, particularly in private practice and university-based hospitals. This is supported by our data at the subject and tooth level, respectively, where the highest incidence of tooth loss was reported in studies where less than ten percent of subjects adhered to the recommended supportive periodontal care regime and where supportive periodontal care regimes were executed by the subjects' general dental practices. With maxillary molar teeth being the most frequently lost teeth within supportive periodontal care, this raises the question whether endpoints should be individualized to the tooth type, as their complex anatomy may affect 'pocket closure'.

This systematic review has many strengths including analyses of very large amount of clinical data from several settings and countries reflecting global periodontal practices, which increases its external validity and power. Limitations are evident, such as potential selection bias due to exclusion of studies, cases with no available data and restriction to studies published from twenty seventeen. Most included studies were retrospective cohort studies. Information and residual confounding bias cannot be excluded because of the unavailability of some of the required data. Multi-level and meta-regression analyses were not performed, as not all required data were available. Therefore, the low tooth loss rate may not be generalizable for all periodontitis patients. Including different stages of periodontitis and APT protocols may affect the discriminative power of the study. Study selection was limited to those published after twenty seventeen, as they better reflect current practice globally, particularly since official endpoints were proposed by the WWC twenty seventeen. IPD analyses are resource-intensive and we felt a five-year restriction, which still included twelve thousand eight hundred eighty-four subjects, would be pragmatic.

Further research is required to assess the different endpoints and their accuracy when predicting tooth loss, oral-health-related quality of life and the systemic impact of periodontitis, which collectively form the true endpoints of periodontitis.

Overall, the data collected from twelve thousand eight hundred eighty-four periodontitis subjects and presented here demonstrate the following:

An overwhelming majority of subjects and teeth do not successfully achieve 'stability' or meet the recommended 'endpoints of therapy' of current guidelines following APT. This suggests that either periodontal treatment still has a long way to go before being considered efficacious or the currently proposed endpoints are not realistic. We, with a certain degree of optimism based on the relatively low tooth loss during SPC, would like to believe in the latter.

Certain surrogate endpoints may be more relevant at the tooth level than at the subject level. Endpoints should be specific to the tooth type if more personalized treatment approaches are required.

The present findings apply to patients compliant with SPC. Yet, non-compliant patients represent a major proportion of treated patients. The generalizability of the results may depend on the extent, stage and grade of periodontitis.

Periodontally involved teeth can be well maintained when compliant with SPC. Rethinking endpoint selection may resolve any controversy surrounding periodontal treatment efficacy, particularly in relation to five-year tooth survival rates, and prevent unnecessary overtreatment. Furthermore, as healthcare moves towards personalized medicine and the paradigm surrounding pathogenesis of periodontitis has shifted to consider the individual's host immune-inflammatory response, it may be justified to consider individualized endpoints acknowledging the patients' demographic, systemic and lifestyle factors.
