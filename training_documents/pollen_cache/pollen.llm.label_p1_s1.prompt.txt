You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

8r5j | 6. Why Is Pollination Worth Studying?
2taz | The flowering plants (angiosperms) account for about one in six of all described species on earth and provide the most obvious visual feature of life on this planet. In the terrestrial environment, their interactions with other living organisms are dominant factors in com- munity structure and function; they underpin all nutri- ent and energy cycles by providing food for a vast range of animal herbivores, and the majority of them use animal pollinators to achieve reproduction. Most of the routine "work" of a plant is carried out by roots and leaves, but it is the flowers that take on the crucial role of reproduction.
o3ya | A flower is usually hermaphrodite, with both male and female roles. Hence it is essentially a structure that produces and dispenses the male gametophytes (pollen), organizes the receipt of incoming pollen from another plant onto its own receptive surfaces on the stigma, and then appropriately guides the pollen's genetic material to the female ovules. The flower also protects the delicate male and female tissues (stamens and pistils) and has a role in controlling the balance between inbreeding and outbreeding, hence influenc- ing the genetic structure and ultimately the evolution-
r5il | ary trajectory of the plant. But the plant itself is im- mobile, so that incoming pollen has to be borne on some motile carrier, sometimes wind or water but much more commonly on a visiting animal. To quote one source (Rothrock 1867), "among plants, the nup- tials cannot be celebrated without the intervention of a third party to act as a marriage priest"! A pictorial overview of the stages is shown in figure 1.1, covering the processes of pollination that are the focus of this book.
5gui | A flower also serves to protect the pollen as it ger- minates and as the male nucleus locates the egg and then to protect the ovules as they are fertilized and be- gin their development into mature seeds. However, these later events (germination of the pollen and fer- tilization of the ovule) are technically not part of pol- lination, and they are covered here only as needed to understand the characteristics and effects of pollen transfer.
82qc | Since flowers bring about and control plant repro- duction, they are central to much of what goes on in the terrestrial world, and pollination is a key mutual- ism between two kingdoms of organisms, perhaps the most basic type of exchange of sex for food; the plant gains reproductive success, and the animal-usually- gains a food reward as it visits the plant. But the visitor does not "want" to be a good pollinator and has to be manipulated by the plant to move on and to carry pol- len to another plant. In practice, only about 1% of all pollen successfully reaches a stigma (Harder 2000).
ls7d | Nevertheless, pollination by animals (biotic polli- nation) is both more common (Renner 1998) and usu- ally more effective than alternative modes of abiotic pollen movements using wind or water, and animal pollination is usually also associated with more rapid speciation of plants (Dodd et al. 1999; K. Kay et al.
tzt3 | 4 · Chapter 1
t8vv | 2006). Discussion of animal pollination therefore dominates this book, and around 90% of all flowering plants are animal pollinated (Linder 1998; Renner 1998). Furthermore, plants are, of course, the founda- tion of all food chains on the planet, and their efficient pollination by animals to generate further generations is vital to ensure food supplies for animals. Natural ecosystems therefore depend on pollinator diversity to maintain overall biodiversity. That dependence natu- rally extends to humans and their agricultural systems too; about one-third of all the food we eat relies di- rectly on animal pollination of our food crops (and the carnivorous proportion of our diet has some further in- direct dependence on animal pollination of forage crops). Pollination and factors that contribute to the maintenance of pollination services are vital compo- nents to take into account in terms of the future health of the planet and the food security and sustainability of the human populations it supports.
qvnu | Beyond its practical significance, the flower-animal mutualism has been a focus of attention for naturalists and ecologists for at least two hundred years and pro- vides almost ideal arenas for understanding some of the fundamental aspects of biology, from evolution and ecology to behavior and reproduction. It is per- haps more amenable than any other area to providing insights into the balance and interaction of ecological and evolutionary effects (Mitchell et al. 2009). Flow- ers are complex structures, and their complexity admi-

xrd1 | rably reveals the actions, both historical and contem- porary, of the selective agents (mainly, but not solely, the pollinators) that we know have shaped them. These factors make floral biology an ideal resource for un- derstanding biological adaptation at all levels, in con- trast with many other systems, where there are multi- ple and often uncertain selective agents.
5746 | In this first chapter, some of these central themes are introduced to set the scene for more specialist chapters; it should be apparent from the outset that while each chapter might stand alone for some pur- poses, it cannot be taken in isolation from this whole picture.
7toz | 1. Which Animals Visit Flowers?
j346 | At least 130,000 species of animal, and probably up to 300,000, are regular flower visitors and potential pol- linators (Buchmann and Nabhan 1996; Kearns et al. 1998). There are at least 25,000 species of bees in this total, all of them obligate flower visitors and often the most important pollinators in a given habitat.
v8uq | There are currently about 260,000 species of angio- sperms (P. Soltis and Soltis 2004; former higher esti- mates were confounded by many duplicated namings), and it has been traditional to link particular kinds of flowers to particular groups of pollinators. About 500 genera contain species that are bird pollinated, about
x972 | 250 genera contain bat-pollinated species, and about 875 genera predominantly use abiotic pollination; the remainder contain mostly insect-pollinated species, with a very small number of oddities using other kinds of animals (Renner and Ricklefs 1995).
cwrw | The patterns of animal flower visitors differ region- ally. In central Europe, flower visitors over a hundred years ago were recorded as 47% hymenopterans (mainly bees), 26% flies, 15% beetles, and 10% but- terflies and moths; only 2% were insects outside these four orders (Knuth 1898). But in tropical Central America, the frequencies would be very different, with bird and bat pollination entering the picture and fewer fly visitors, while in high-latitude habitats the verte- brate pollinators are absent and flies tend to be more dominant. Some of these patterns will be discussed in chapter 27.
4i0e | 2. Why Do Animals Visit Flowers?
h2l3 | The majority of flower visitors go there simply for food, feeding on sugary nectar and sometimes also on the pollen itself. Chapters 7 and 8 will therefore deal in detail with these commodities, and chapter 9 will cov- er a few more unusual foodstuffs and rewards that can be gathered from flowers; chapter 10 will take an eco- nomic view of all these food-related interactions, in terms of costs and benefits to each participant. Major themes in other chapters include the ways that flower feeders can improve their efficiency: learning recogni- tion cues to select between flowers intra- and interspe- cifically, learning handling procedures, learning to avoid emptied flowers, and avoiding some of the haz- ards of competing with other visitors.
dfzb | Flowers are also sometimes visited just as a conve- nient habitat, often simply because they offer an equa- ble sheltered microclimate for a small animal to rest in, a place that is somewhat protected against bad weather, predators, or parasitoids. Or flowers may of- fer a reliable meeting site for mates or hosts or prey, or for females an oviposition site providing shelter for eggs and larvae. More rarely they are used as a warm- ing-up site by insects in cold climates, usually because the flowers trap some incoming solar radiation, which enhances their own ovule development, but occasion- ally because a few flowers can achieve some metabolic thermogenesis that warms their own tissues (chapter 9 will provide more details on this topic).

awvu | 3. How Do Flowers Encourage Animal Visitors?
on9b | Many plant attributes contribute to attraction of visi- tors: J. Thomson (1983) usefully groups these as plant presentation. Some of these attributes are readily ap- parent to visitors, and these may be features of indi- vidual flowers (e.g., color, shape, scent, reward avail- ability, or time of flowering) or features of whole plants or groups of plants (e.g., flower density, flower num- ber, flower height, or spatial pattern). The more readily apparent plant presentation traits can be divided into attractants (advertising signals), dealt with mainly in chapters 5 and 6, which discuss visual and olfactory signals, and rewards (usually foodstuffs), dealt with in chapters 7-9. Aspects of the timing and spacing of flowers, and how these might be affected by competi- tion between different flowering plants, are given more in-depth treatments in chapters 21 and 22.
a8ge | Other floral attributes are more cryptic to the visitor and may only determine the reproductive success of the plant in the longer term; these might include pollen amounts, ovule numbers, the genetic structure of the plant population, the presence and type of incompat- ibility system, etc.
h27a | It is generally in the plant's interest to support and even improve its visitors' efficiency, encouraging them to go to more flowers of the same species (so ensuring that only conspecific pollen is taken and received) and to go to flowers with fresh pollen available and/or with receptive stigmas for pollen to be deposited upon. Many flowers therefore add signals of status to their repertoire, via color change, odor change, or even shape change. Visitors are thereby directed away from flowers that are too young or too old or already polli- nated. Instead they will tend to concentrate their ef- forts on those (fewer) flowers per plant that are most in need of visitation, thus also being encouraged to move around between separate plants more often and to en- sure outcrossing rather than selfing. Reasons for fa- voring breeding by outcrossing (i.e., with other plants) are covered more fully in chapter 3.
pdjh | 4. What Makes a Visitor into a Good Pollinator?
xmgs | In many ways this is the crucial theme running through this book. It relates to what is probably the major
bd9h | 6 . Chapter 1
m047 | current debate in pollination ecology, that is, to what extent pollination it is a generalist process and to what extent it is a specialist one. Pollination has in the past nearly always been categorized in terms of syndromes, with particular groups of flowers recognized as hav- ing particular sets of characteristics (of color and scent, shape, timing, reward, etc.) that suit them to be visited by particular kinds of animals; and it is im- plicit in this approach that these suites have often been arrived at and selected for by convergent evolution in plant families that are unrelated. Thus most authors have used terms such as ornithophily to describe the bird pollination syndrome, or psychophily for the butterfly pollination syndrome. Flower characteristics would be listed that fit each syndrome, and an unfa- miliar flower's probable pollinators could therefore be predicted. Flowers in each category were seen as hav- ing a degree of specialization that suited them to their particular visitors, with some syndromes being more specialized than others. Nearly all earlier works on pollination were organized around this theme of syn- dromes, and it served as a useful structure for under- standing animal-flower interactions for nearly two centuries. Without knowing this background it would be nearly impossible to follow the current debates that are a major focus for pollination ecologists, and it would also be very difficult to structure the informa- tion on flower attractants and flower rewards in chap- ters 5-9. This book thus retains a syndrome-based ap- proach throughout its early chapters and explicitly considers the evidence in support of a syndrome ap- proach in chapter 11; then it unashamedly covers each of the syndromes in turn in chapters 12-19, providing all the core materials on which later criticisms might be based.
gy8c | The criticisms and debates focus around the reality of syndromes and how far they have been overplayed in the previous literature, perhaps blinkering or bias- ing our perceptions. Many authors now regard flower pollination as a much more generalized phenomenon, where most flowers get many different kinds of visi- tors and have not been and are not being heavily se- lected to specialize for the needs of one particular "best" visitor. This approach is specifically addressed in chapter 20. It will be a major argument there that the issue has been clouded by an as yet insufficient dis- tinction between flower visitors and pollinators. So what does make a visitor into a good pollinator?
y4mj | Physical Factors
vpgq | Any animal that is to be an effective pollinator must have the ability to passively pick up pollen as its body moves past the anthers of a flower that it visits and carry that pollen to another flower. Normally this will be aided by the animal being a good physical fit in terms of size and shape, so that in alighting on the flower surface, or when inserting its tongue or beak of appropriate length, some specific part of its body touches the anther. Additionally pollen pickup and car- riage will be aided if the animal has appropriate sur- face structures; pollen adheres well to feathers, fur, and hairy or scaly surfaces in insects but does not get transported well on shiny or waxy surfaces (and may even be damaged by certain surface secretions). Hence a small shiny beetle taking some nectar by crawling into the lower surface of a large tubular corolla where the anthers are in the corolla roof may well be a regu- lar visitor to that flower but is unlikely to be an effec- tive mover of its pollen; in effect, it is acting as a "cheat" as far as the flower is concerned and may be termed an illegitimate visitor.
ousl | Behavioral Factors
m4ju | Different animals land on and forage at flowers in very different fashions. There are many aspects of behavior that will affect whether a given animal is going to be a good pollinator. Pollinators will seldom have a com- plete perception of all the aspects of plant presentation mentioned above, but they will respond to at least some of them in ways that are useful to the plant:
