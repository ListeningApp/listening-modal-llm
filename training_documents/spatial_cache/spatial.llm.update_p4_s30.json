A large positive Z sub i implies that large values of x sub j (values above the mean x) are within d of point i. A large negative Z sub i, means that small values of x sub j are within d of point i.\nl6t9 | A special feature of this statistic is that the pattern of data points is neutralized when the expectation is that all x values are the same. This is illustrated for the case when data point densities are high in the vicinity of point i, and d is just large enough to contain the area of the clustered points. Theoretical G sub i of d values are high because W sub i is high. However, only if the observed x sub j values in the vicinity of point i differ systematically from the mean is there the opportunity to identify significant spatial concentration of the sum of x sub js. That is, as data points become more clustered in the vicinity of point i, the expectation of G sub i of d rises, neutralizing the effect of the dense cluster of x sub j values.\n1ujy | In addition to its above meaning, the value of d can be interpreted as a distance that incorporates specified cells in a lattice. It is to be expected that neighboring G sub i will be correlated if d includes neighbors. To examine this issue, consider a regular lattice. When n is large, the denominator of each G sub i is almost constant so it follows that correlation G sub i, G sub j equals proportion of neighbors that i and j have in common.\nqzor | EXAMPLE ONE\na0by | Consider the rook's case. Cell i has no common neighbors with its four immediate neighbors, but two with its immediate diagonal neighbors. The numbers of common neighbors are as illustrated below:\nu1ky | All the other cells have no common neighbors with i. Thus, the G-indices for the four diagonal neighbors have correlations of about zero point five with G sub i, four others have correlations of about zero point two five and the rest are virtually uncorrelated.\nhtm9 | For more highly connected lattices (such as the queen's case) the array of nonzero correlations stretches further, but the maximum correlation between any pair of G-indices remains about zero point five.\n8hul | EXAMPLE TWO\n87vz | X bar equals m. N equals fifty. A is greater than or equal to zero.\nym66 | B is greater than or equal to zero. Put\nl0a3 | A equals m times one plus c, B equals m times one minus c, zero is less than or equal to c is less than or equal to one. Using this example, the G sub i and G sub i star statistics are compared in the following table.\nu8nw | Eight plus eight c divided by forty-nine minus c, five point three zero star.\nl2v9 | Nine plus nine c divided by fifty.
