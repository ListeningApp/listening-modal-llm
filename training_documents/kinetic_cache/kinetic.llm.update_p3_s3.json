Here, chi O X and chi sub Red, are the mole fractions of O X and Red, respectively, which are defined as the ratios between the concentration of the ith form and the total concentration.\n8p6h | chi sub O X sub i equals fraction left bracket O X sub i right bracket, left bracket O X sub tot right bracket, equals fraction left bracket O X sub i right bracket, summation sub j, left bracket O X sub j right bracket (five a)\npmgl | chi sub Red sub i equals fraction left bracket Red sub i right bracket, left bracket Red sub tot right bracket, equals fraction left bracket Red sub i right bracket, summation sub j, left bracket Red sub j right bracket (five b)\n90no | Under the equilibrium assumption for the P T and complex formation steps, we can explicitly express chi O X and chi sub Red for each form as a function of p H using the corresponding equilibrium constants (i.e., K sub a,Ox, K sub a,Red, K sub one, K sub two, and K sub w in this example) as parameters. Moreover, the reactions in Figure one form a complete thermodynamic cycle, and therefore the standard potentials E sub i sup circle are related to each other through the same equilibrium constants. Under the equilibrium approximation, we can show that for any two channels i,\njt0y | j, E sub app, i sup o equals E sub app j sup o, for all i, j (six).\nqb7o | Thus, for a multichannel P C E T reaction system such as the one in Figure one, there will be only one unique apparent potential. The full derivations and expressions associated with equations four to six are provided in the Supporting Information.\noae5 | curves show the cases of including only the sequential or only the concerted pathways in Figure one. For all three cases, the curve has the expected shape. For the sequential-only case, when pH is less than p K a,Ox, E app equals E E T one; at intermediate pH, E app decreases linearly as pH increases with a slope of fifty-nine mV per pH unit; when pH is greater than p K a,Red, E app equals E E T two. For the concerted- only case, E app has the same behavior, but the upper and lower bounds become E g P T one and E g P T two, and the transition points become negative pK one and pK two plus pK w respectively. The slope at intermediate pH is still fifty-nine mV per pH unit. When both mechanisms are considered, the resulting curve can be seen as connecting pieces of the two black curves. The plateau value at low pH is the lower potential of E L T one versus E L P T one with a turning point at the larger value of negative pK one versus p K a,Ox. The plateau value at high pH is the higher potential of E L T two versus E P T two with a turning point at the lower value of pK two plus pK w versus p K a,Red.\ns0fl | Next, we move on to the derivation of the apparent rate constants. Here, we assume that each form of the reduced or oxidized species is not distinguished in kinetics experiments, and only the total reduction or oxidation rate is measured. Although some forms may be distinguishable because they have distinct spectra, formulating the equations in this manner provides a general approach for kinetic analysis.\n43ia | For an electrochemical reaction, E T occurs between the main redox species undergoing P C E T and the electrode.
