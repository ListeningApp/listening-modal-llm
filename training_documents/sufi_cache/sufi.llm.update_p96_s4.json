        "content": "etg9 | Second, if you read published literature by people working in the spiritual field from the supply-and-demand analysis point of view, you might be amazed to find that in general neither the questioner nor the spiritual man seems to be aware that they are engaged upon 'commercial type' transactions.\n6hid | Third, discussions with professional people, such as doctors and lawyers, shows that they get the same kind of questions, structurally supply-and-demand questions, from their clients; and, indeed, the whole range of annoyances and subjectivities of which I have been speaking. This is so well understood by real teachers in the East that it is summed up in the joke: 'So-and-so went to a certain teacher for conversation, but all he got was illumination!'\nzzuq | Q: Are your books designed, then, to 'fill in' gaps in possible behaviour-patterns in people approaching Sufism?\njpjk | A: On the general level, they all carry this design, and the result of asking interested people to read them carefully has been to establish and maintain, successfully, a basis of holding a viewpoint which would otherwise need monastic circumstances to reveal and develop.\nyf5l | Q: What other activities do you employ, in addition to your books?\n8255 | A: An enormous range. But these activities, many of which, though traditional among Sufis, would be unrecognisable as spiritual by narrowly conditioned people, are experienced following the grouping of the books, and in specific measure: 'prescribed', as it were, for the needs of the people. Thus they are not susceptible to descriptions like listing them, or writing about them.\nqi7r | KNOWLEDGE AS ACTION\n82oh | People who deal with spiritual matters as if they were commercial questions, people who seek behaviour-patterns as in the second question, the query about activities, are all, I think, due to enquiries based on the desire for action. To the degree to which this is true, we should note what Sheikh Ibrahim Gazur-i-Ilahi says about the matter of knowledge and action: how action cannot take place without knowledge.\n9md9 | He stresses that 'People argue about whether knowledge or action should come first. But they are the same. Worthwhile action is in fact knowledge in operation. Right action stems from right knowledge. Right knowledge is acquired through the teacher.'\nkq4f | AN INFURIATING BOOK\n80g9 | One of the few instances where we can quote the operation of a non-book as an instrument, yet bridge the area of literature, is in the case of The Book of the Book. This tale, which I published in the form of a book, tells how people become disappointed by books, and how they can learn from them what is and is not in them. Critics were furious because the story was so short, as they assumed that a book must be of a certain length. This fury overtook them before they had read the contents, which described their behaviour and showed how inadequate it was. This gave us-and many other people as well- published evidence of the mentality of literary people and literal thinkers which they would never have admitted to if directly challenged. We let them do it for us. This shows how a book can be used to create a situation.\nxhxa | The Effect of Tales and Narratives\nog5n | Q: You have published several hundred tales and narratives, mostly from the Middle East, illustrative of situations which often show strengths and weaknesses in people. Why do you export this material from other cultures, instead of producing it in current terms, and what effect is it having on the Western world, if it is not simply promoting 'Eastern Wisdom'?\ns71g | A: This material is well developed as an instructional medium in the East; so it would not be good sense to attempt to improve on or substitute for something which is tested and effective. Take it the other way around: people in the East do not usually try to invent radio for themselves just because it was invented in, and imported from, the West.\ntow7 | The effect which our material is having in the Western world is already extensively written about by people in the West who say that they find it useful, and I must refer you on this point to these people.\n6zau | Another reason why we have not been using material from the West is that until recently we have not had a home-grown product, sufficient material of this kind, to recycle.\ny2an | Even if we had been able to collect it, its reception, due to established patterns of disdain for narrative instruction, would not have given it a fair chance. Only after indicating its usage, vitality and durability in certain cultures which have found it useful could we induce people elsewhere to look for the local product and- above all - make use of it.\nmxje | We have had to re-open the question of the possible value of tales, stories, jokes and narrative, and hold this door open in the face of a long-standing Western convention that such material is only of entertainment value. What has happened is that the equivalent of a technological infrastructure, or a basic literacy in this field, is being established in the West.\nwnjc | But you should not assume, merely because you are living and\n9xjk | studying in the West, that (a) this material is intended only for the West: because it has also had a phenomenal success in the East; or that (b) people in the East have not had to go through a similar retrieval and refamiliarisation process to enable them to reclaim the non-entertainment content in these artefacts of their own cultures.\na2nf | Indeed, in the East as in the West there are still many people who are unable to adjust to the restoration of extra and educational dimensions in the material. It is fair to say that whereas in general the West has only recently acquired the time, energy, flexibility and variety of curiosity to examine the materials in the manner intended by its original producers, so - again in general - the East has tended to have forgotten the attributions, depth, content and structures in which it was traditionally presented.\n5hd2 | Sections of both communities have been coming to a fresh understanding of the materials; sections of each remain, largely for reasons of personal insecurity and attachment to over-simplified ideologies, uninterested or hostile.\n1bgz | It is further worth noting that much of Western religion and tradition is thoroughly saturated with Eastern tales and stories, many of them, according to Sufis, originally tales of inner meaning, now taken as literal truth or only analogy. And tales and stories are almost the only cultural phenomenon which are found as the property of all peoples of the world, not belonging, strictly speaking, to anyone.\nd0xl | OPPOSITION TO ARABI\n57d4 | Ibn Arabi taught through what was apparently love-poetry, and people became bitterly hostile towards him. This behaviour of theirs was due to their inability to understand the projection which he was using, not to the reality of their imaginings. But their suppositions about him and his work were firmly believed by them to represent the truth, to be factual in nature. In his case, he was able to teach them further by providing a commentary which satisfied them and caused them to hail him as a great mystic. But in so doing, since they had not arrived at this understanding through inward and personal perception, they were cut off from\nbyue | the benefits of the material's actual use within themselves. They were only intellectually and emotionally satisfied. Their perception of him was limited to a reassurance that his ideas did not conflict with their own ingrained beliefs.\nicgi | It is this mentality of what is in fact superficial assessment which causes the poverty of potential understanding in people who seek only explanation and not perceptions.\ngtjt | Stories of the Miraculous\n6yhe | Q: Are the 'miraculous' stories of the doings of Sufis literally true, or are they designed to illustrate structures equivalent to what may happen, or are they intended to make people credulous or to 'think in a new way?'",
