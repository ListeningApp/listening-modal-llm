You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,

82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

s2g2 | In this meta-study, for each SNV, we integrated the data by considering a TF bound to SNV in different cell types or a cell type and different TFs bound to the same SNV. Surprisingly, ASB identification through data aggregation had better sensitivity than standard ChIP-Seq peak calling at the level of individual data sets. Particularly, in GTRD, the ChIP-Seq peak calls were gathered from four different tools (MACS, SISSRs, GEM, and PICS), but only 85-90% of significant ASBs were detected within peak calls (199,819 of 233,290 and 324,890 of 351,965 for TF-centric and cell type-centric aggregation), suggesting that up to 15% of ASBs could be lost if the ASB calling was restricted to the peak calls only.
q1q2 | Each particular ASB can either be a "driver" directly altering TF-binding affinity, or a "passenger" with differential binding resulting from differential chromatin accessibility (in turn, caused by some neighboring SNVs), or a protein-protein interaction with the causal TF. In terms of machine learning, we expected the TF ASBs to provide an easier prediction target since they could be mostly determined by the sequence motif of the respective TF. However, as found, the percentage of "passenger" ASBs is rather large (e.g., 24,662 out of 27,233 CTCF ASBs lack significant CTCF motif hits), and the TF-specific models showed a limited ASB prediction quality. Further surprise came from cell type-specific models which displayed a notably higher performance. We interpret these data as follows: the cell type ASBs are easier to predict by learning a small set of cell type-specific master reg- ulators, while passenger TF-level ASBs are very diverse, as coming from data aggregation of many different cell types with varying cell type-specific features such as key TFs.
cb7r | ASB events should be distinguished from other sources of allelic imbalance such as aneuploidy and local CNVs, which can imitate ASB by varying the allelic dosage. Commonly used cell types are often aneuploid: K562 and MCF7 cells are triploid on average, and 59 of 121 cell types overlapping between ADASTRA and COSMIC also have median copy number above 2. The ADASTRA pipeline, to our knowledge, includes the first control-free approach to

hd35 | reconstruct the genomic map of BAD directly from SNP calls and to use this map as a baseline for detecting genuine allelic imbal- ance. Despite a multitude of available software for ASB calling, there has been no approach suitable for the uniform analysis of diverse existing data. Thus, when developing ADASTRA, the intention was to be able to process and include most of the data including non-replicated experiments, data sets lacking genomic input controls, or with the controls sequenced at low coverage, at the expense of general sensitivity achieved at particular data sets. Further on, such a pipeline might be applicable to other sequen- cing data that allow allele specificity, e.g., analyses of allele-specific expression or chromatin accessibility. With matched cell types, BAD-corrected data on allele-specific chromatin accessibility will also allow for better classification of driver and passenger ASBs and better application of machine learning techniques.
2zpk | Our collection of ASB events per se is also useful for other research areas involving TF-DNA interactions. First, ASBs pro- vide unique in vivo data on differential TF binding and can be used for testing the predictive power of computational models for precise recognition of TF-binding sites33. Second, the TF binding not only affects transcript abundance, but also affects RNA splicing, localization, and stability54,55. Thus, ASBs may affect other levels of gene expression, particularly, the mRNA post- transcriptional modification: out of 65 RNAe-QTLs reported in56, 4 are listed as ASBs in ADASTRA.
epu7 | Last but not least, ADASTRA reports hundreds of TF- switching ASBs, where alternative alleles are preferably bound by different TFs. This possibility has been discussed previously57 but, to our knowledge, we are first to report the genome-wide inventory of such events. Importantly, the respective SNVs exhibit the highest enrichment with phenotype associations. Probably these sites serve varying and allele-dependent molecular circuits. A particularly interesting example is rs28372852 located in the G elongation factor mitochondrial 1 (GFM1) gene pro- moter. According to ADASTRA, rs28372852 serves as the Alt- ASB of CREB1 and Ref-ASB of MXI1, and in both cases, the allelic imbalance is concordant with the respective binding motifs. Also, according to GTEx41, GFM1 is the target of rs28372852 eQTL. According to UniProt48, CREB1 is a transcriptional acti- vator, while MXI1 is a transcriptional repressor, suggesting that ASB can directly switch the gene expression activity. At the same time, UniProt reports four amino acid substitutions in GFM1 that are associated with combined oxidative phosphorylation defi- ciency. Interestingly, according to ClinVar37, this SNP is benign in regard to combined oxidative phosphorylation deficiency; and in this case we speculate that ASB data might facilitate reevalu- ating the variants' functional roles and pathogenic potential. We believe that further analysis of TF-switching ASBs in the scope of metabolic and regulatory pathway alterations will provide valu- able insights into molecular mechanisms underlying particular normal and pathologic traits.

0bqy | Variant calling from GTRD alignments. We used 7669 premade short read alignments against hg38 genome assembly produced with bowtie258 and stored in the GTRD17 database. PICARD was used for deduplication, followed by GATK base quality recalibration. Next, the variants were called with GATK Haplotype- Caller, with dbSNP26 (common variant set of the build 151) for annotation. The

y7ea | duplications) will exhibit allelic imbalance (e.g., in a tetraploid region with 2:2 ratio of allelic reads at SNPs, de novo mutations will likely exhibit the ratio of 1:3) and may lead to false-positive ASB calls.
nav4 | Accounting for BAD. The observed distribution of ChIP-Seq allelic read counts on heterozygous SNVs significantly depends on aneuploidy and the CNV profile of the cells (Fig. 6a, b). The modes of distribution correspond to the most represented copy number, e.g., the distribution is bimodal for mostly triploid K562 cells, Fig. 6b. However, the mixture of two Binomial distributions poorly approximates the data, showing a significant overdispersion. To systematically reduce the over- dispersion from local CNVs and aneuploidy, we reconstructed the genome-wide BAD maps from read counts at the heterozygous variants (see below). The dis- tributions of the allelic read counts at SNVs segregated by BAD show a notably reduced overdispersion (Fig. 6c, d).
gem8 | BAD calling with Bayesian changepoint identification. To construct genome- wide BAD maps from filtered heterozygous SNV calls, we developed a novel algorithm, the BAD caller by Bayesian changepoint identification (BABACHI).
e8nr | At the first stage, BABACHI divides the chromosomes into smaller sub- chromosome regions by detecting centromeric regions, long deletions, loss of heterozygosity regions, and other regions depleted of SNVs. At this stage, only the distances between neighboring SNVs are taken into account and long gaps are marked.

T h e</LATEX> optimal changepoints are the experimental distribution of allelic read counts at the SNVs, given a region- specific (yet unknown) BAD persist in each region enclosed between neighboring changepoints.

g9du | BAD of each segment is selected from the discrete set {1, 4/3, 3/2, 2, 5/2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, considering that the total copy number of a particular genomic region rarely exceeds 7. The prior distribution of BAD is assumed to be <LATEX>a</LATEX> discrete uniform, with the support being the same discrete set as above (non-informative prior). Details and mathematical substantiation of the algorithm are provided in the Supplementary Methods.
f682 | Practical BAD calling with the ADASTRA pipeline. To provide better genome coverage and robust BAD estimates, we merged the sets of variant calls from ChIP- Seq data sets produced in the same laboratory for the same cell type and in the same series (i.e., sharing either ENCODE biosample or GEO GSE ID). Different SNVs at the same genome position (either originating from different data sets or with different alternative alleles) were considered as independent observations. For each data set, chromosomes with < 100 SNVs were excluded from BAD calling and further analysis.
li1k | To assess the reliability of the BAD maps, for each BAD, we separately estimated ROC and PRC. Here we considered the BAD maps as binary classifiers of according to BAD, with COSMIC CNV data as the ground truth. To plot a

The paired-end reads of MCF7 deep genome sequencing (SRA accession SRR8652105) were aligned to hg38 genome assembly using bowtie2 with default settings. Overall, 28,278,026 (2.5%) of a total of 1,136,666,560 paired reads were marked as duplicates, 112,323,925 (9.9%) were filtered by GATK filter by mapping quality ≥ 10, leaving 996,064,609 reads for SNP calling. A total of 3,969,250 SNPs was reported by GATK HaplotypeCaller, among which 1,427,492 SNPs were annotated as hetero- zygous, passed the basic ADASTRA filter (≥5 reads on each allele), and were used to produce the independent reference MCF7 BAD map with BABACHI69.
