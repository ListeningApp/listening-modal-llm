You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

olce | where N is the number of phonemes in t, ti is the i-th phoneme token of t, ti is the i-th predicted phoneme token, and CE(.) is the cross-entropy loss function.
erx1 | Since this alignment is not necessarily monotonic, we use a simple L-1 loss Lmono that forces the soft attention alignment to be close to its non-differentiable monotonic version:
b3bt | Lmono = Ex,t [|@align - @hard|1] , (4) where aalign = A(x, t) is the attention alignment and @hard is the monotonic hard alignment obtained through dynamic programming algorithms (see Appendix A-A for details).
0w8m | (b) Duration and prosody prediction
vcu3 | Adversarial objectives. We employ two adversarial loss functions, the original cross-entropy loss function Lady for adversarial training and the additional feature-matching loss [43] Lfm, to improve the sound quality of the reconstructed mel-spectrogram:
hjzj | Lady = Ex,t [log D(x) + log (1 - D(x))] ,
j79f | 1 l=1 T NĮ | D'(x) - D'(x)|1| , (6)
6tbv | Lfm = Ex,t
xb13 | where & is the reconstructed mel-spectrogram by G, T is the total number of layers in D and D' denotes the output feature map of l-th layer with Nį number of features. The feature matching loss can be seen as a reconstruction loss of hidden layer features of real and generated speech as judged by the discriminator.
cxqi | First stage full objectives. Our full objective functions in the first stage can be summarized as follows with hyperparameters As25, Amono, dadv and Afm:
qfmx | min max Lmel + As25 Ls2s + Amono {mono
rut3 | G,A,E,F,T D
m3cp | + Xadv Lady + Afm Lfm
mq4s | 2) Second Stage Objectives:
95el | Duration prediction. We employ the L-1 loss to train our duration predictor
a0a5 | Ldur = Ed [||d - dpred ||1]
gocl | where d is the ground truth duration obtained by summing Calign along the mel frame axis. dpred = L(R(htext, s)) is the predicted duration under the style vector s.
ob1z | Prosody prediction. We train our prosody predictor via a unique data augmentation scheme. Since the duration predictor is trained separately from other modules (using only [dur), the duration predictions it produces may not always be optimal or compatible with the prosody predictor. To make the prosody predictor more robust to these potentially suboptimal duration predictions, we augment the data to introduce prosody invariance over the duration.
m4cb | More specifically, instead of using the ground truth alignment, pitch, and energy of the original mel-spectrogram, we first apply a 1-D bilinear interpolation to stretch or compress the mel- spectrogram in time to obtain the augmented sample ã. As a result, the speech speed changes, yet the pitch and energy curves remain consistent. Accordingly, the prosody predictor learns to maintain pitch and energy prediction invariance, regardless of the duration of speech. This approach helps mitigate issues with unnatural prosody when the predicted duration is incorrect.
m61y | We use Lf0 and Ln, which are F0 and energy reconstruction loss, respectively:
u2ob | Co = Epa [IlPa - Pp (S (htext, S) . @ align )|] (9)
2gnm | Ln = Ex |na - Pn (S (htext, S) . @align ) |] (10)
emgw | where pz, nz and @align are the pitch, energy and alignment of & E X the augmented dataset. Pp denotes the pitch output from the prosody predictor, and Pn denotes the energy output.
xaqt | Decoder reconstruction. Lastly, we aim to ensure that the predicted pitch and energy can be effectively used by the decoder. Given that the mel-spectrogram is stretched or compressed during data augmentation, using them as the ground truth may lead to unwanted artifacts in the predicted prosody. Instead, we train the prosody predictor to produce pitch and energy predictions that can effectively reconstruct the decoder's outputs
5rcb | Lde = Eã,t | - G (htext · ãalign, s, p, î)|] , (11) where & = G (htext . @align, s, p, |x||) is the reconstruction of ã € Ñ, p = Pp (S (htext, S) · "align) the predicted pitch and ^ = Pn (S (htext, S) · Õalign) the predicted energy.

8qb6 | III. EXPERIMENTS
wkbn | A. Datasets
ftfg | We conducted experiments on three datasets. We trained a single-speaker model on the LJSpeech dataset [44]. The LJSpeech dataset consists of 13,100 short audio clips with a total duration of approximately 24 hours. We used the same split as VITS where the training set contains 12,500 samples, the validation set 100 samples and the test set 500 samples. We also trained a multi-speaker model on the LibriTTS dataset [45]. The LibriTTS train-clean-460 subset consists of approximately
7xi5 | 245 hours of audio from 1,151 speakers. We removed utterances with a duration longer than 30 seconds and shorter than one second. We randomly split the train-clean-460 subset into a training (98%), a validation (1%), and a test (1%) set and use the test set for evaluation following [32]. We also used the VCTK [46] dataset to show that our model is capable of zero-shot speaker adaptation. We used the same training and test speaker split as in [47] for VCTK, where 88 speakers were used for training and the rest 20 were used for testing.
w8r5 | In addition, we trained a multi-speaker model on the emotional speech dataset (ESD) [48] to demonstrate the capacity to synthesize speech with diverse prosodic patterns. ESD consists of 10 Chinese and 10 English speakers reading the same 400 short sentences in five different emotions. We trained our model on 10 English speakers with all five emotions. We
ybik | upsampled training audios to 24 kHz to match the LibriTTS dataset. We converted text sequences into phoneme sequences using an open-source tool 1. We extracted mel-spectrograms with a FFT size of 2048, hop size of 300, and window length of 1200 in 80 mel bins using TorchAudio [49].
gii5 | B. Training
q5eu | For both stages, we trained all models for 200 epochs using the AdamW optimizer [50] with 31 = 0, 32 = 0.99, weight decay 1 = 10-4, learning rate y = 10-4 and batch size of 64 samples. We set s2s = 0.2, dadv = 1, mono = 5, 1fm = 0.2, Adur = 1, 40 = 0.1, and An = 1. This setting of hyperparameters makes sure that all loss values are on the same scale and that the training is not sensitive to these hyperparameters. The scale factor ranges from 0.75 to 1.25 for data augmentation. We randomly divided the mel-spectrograms into segments of the shortest length in the batch. The training was conducted on a single NVIDIA A40 GPU.
