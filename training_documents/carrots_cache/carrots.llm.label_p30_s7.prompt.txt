You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

06yq | Microdosing with psychedelics to self-medicate for ADHD symptoms in adults: A naturalistic study
dpv6 | ARTICLE INFO
8r5j | ABSTRACT
2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

iwl8 | 4. Vote Buying
mfpn | Vote buying reportedly occurred in one firm (Firm 49) in our sample. The firm was California-domiciled, and there were no drag-along rights. The founder reported that the VC-controlled board paid the CEO and other employees to exercise underwater options to acquire and vote common stock in favor of a trade sale for about $80 million. In addition to this stick, the VCs used a carrot: they provided a $4 million carve-out to common shareholders. The founder sued the VCs, alleging vote buying and improprieties associated with a presale financing round. The case was settled for an undisclosed amount.
un1f | Of course, implicit and essentially undetectable vote buying might be occurring through management bonuses because of the considerable overlap between shareholders and executives. Thus, we cannot rule out the possibility that vote buying was occurring in other firms in our sample.

b7uf | CARROTS AND STICKS
f22p | 2013]
uyz7 | CONCLUSION
nhoe | Trade sales by VCs are actually much more common than IPOs and, in the aggregate, are likely to be just as financially important to VCs. However, unlike IPOs, trade sales do not trigger the intense public-disclosure requirements of the securities laws. As a result, we know relatively little about them.
umd6 | In this Article, we seek to shed light on how VCs arrange to sell startups in trade sales. In particular, we investigate how VCs induce the founder, other executives, and common shareholders to go along with a trade sale that they might otherwise have an incentive to resist.
in6i | We identify the types of bribes (carrots) and coercive tools (sticks) that VCs might use to induce a reluctant entrepreneurial team to support, or at least not impede, a trade sale. We then investigate the use of carrots and sticks using a hand-collected database of 50 VC-backed Silicon Valley firms sold to acquirers in 2003 and 2004. We find, in our sample, a relatively heavy reliance on carrots. Carrots are used in 45% of the firms, with carrots averaging 9% of deal value in these firms. We also find some use of sticks, such as threats to blacklist founders who refuse to cooperate and attempts to undermine common shareholders' voting rights. But the overt use of these sticks is relatively infrequent.
r7cj | Our study makes three contributions. First, it sheds light on an important but underexplored aspect of corporate governance in private, VC-backed firms. In particular, it highlights the potentially conflicting interests of the different players in VC-backed firms around trade-sale exits and shows that VCs frequently must overcome potential opposition to these sales by founders, executives, and common shareholders.
jstv | Second, our study provides further evidence that managers of target firms can extract value by holding up a sale of the firm. Research has documented the frequent use of side payments to induce executives to participate in the sale of publicly traded firms. We show that such carrots are used not only in public firms with dispersed ownership but also in closely held private firms.
25jv | Third, our study provides some evidence on whether venture capitalists are constrained from abusing their power in startups. Although venture capitalists have considerable power in startups, the relatively infrequent overt use of sticks in our sample provides support for the view that reputational or other nonlegal considerations constrain misbehavior by Silicon Valley venture capitalists. We hope that our work is useful to practitioners and academics seeking to better understand the corporate governance of VC-backed firms.

09pd | TABLE 1: DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS AND LIQUIDATION PREFERENCES
qqgr | This table provides descriptive statistics for our 50 sample firms. Panel A reports industry classification for each firm as provided by www.linksv.com. Panel B reports the mean and median period of operation, number of financing rounds, amount invested, and sale price. Panel B also shows the aggregate liquidation preferences ("LPs") of VC investors at the time of sale. Panel C shows the preferences given in each round of financing. The first column lists, for reach round, the number of firms granting 1x LPs. The second column lists, for reach round, the number of firms granting LPs between 1x and 2x. The third column lists, for each round, the number of firms granting LPs greater than 2x. The final column lists financing rounds where the LPs of earlier investors are waived or reduced (a "recap" financing). Panel D shows, at the time of sale, the relationship between aggregate LPs and the sale price.

enfm | TABLE 2: CONTROL RIGHTS
rsb5 | This table reports the distribution of corporate governance rights in our sample firms. Panel A reports the mean and median board representation for (1) common shareholders, (2) VCs, and (3) independent (outside) directors. Panel B shows board control at the time of sale. If the VCs (or common shareholders) control a majority of the board seats, we classify the VCs (or common shareholders) as having "Control." If the board has an even number of seats and the VCs (or common stockholders) appoint exactly half the directors, we treat this as "Blocking." "Shared Control" means that the VCs and the common shareholders each appoint fewer than 50% of the directors, with outside directors providing the tie-breaking vote. Panel C shows the state of incorporation at the time of sale.

btbo | TABLE 3: CARROTS
nhed | This table describes the frequency and magnitude of common carve-outs and management bonuses in our sample firms. Panel A provides summary statistics for all sample firms. Panel B reports summary statistics only for those firms that provided a common carve-out and/or a management bonus. Data are presented in millions of dollars and as a percentage of the sale price. The included summary statistics are mean, dollar- weighted mean (DW Mean), standard deviation (SD), minimum, and maximum. DW Mean is weighted by the firm's sale price.

ti6n | This figure shows, for each firm, the distribution of exit proceeds among VCs, common stockholders, and senior management. Each bar represents a firm's total sale price (in millions of dollars). The sale price is divided into four components: (i) the amount actually paid to VCs (in black); (ii) the contractual entitlement of the original common stockholders (in white); (iii) the carve-out given to the original common stockholders (in dark grey), and (iv) non-retention bonuses paid to senior management in connection with the sale (in light grey). For ease of presentation, all firms with a sale price of more than $100 million are normalized to a sale price of $100 million.
