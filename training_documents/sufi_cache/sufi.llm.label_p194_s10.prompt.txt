You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

06yq | Microdosing with psychedelics to self-medicate for ADHD symptoms in adults: A naturalistic study

8r5j | ABSTRACT
2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

in7g | A Bridge and its Use
1sn7 | IT will seem improbable, yet it is no exaggeration to say that people ignore, are unaware of or even sneer at materials which could be their only hope of escaping from circular thinking.
bcxr | I have learned more from people, things and ideas which are by many considered irrelevant, slight or even worthless, than from much more advertised and crudely emphasized materials.
0dtd | People who cannot or will not approach these sources of know- ledge may accept them when they have been put in a manner which they are prepared to accept. This indicates the serious limitation on learning imposed by so many people's refusal to look at anything which seems to them to be unsuitable, judged from its outward face.
rnxf | But this is only the first part of a process. You can 'popularise' or make palatable, but at some point you must direct attention to the original thing.
s6hr | If we have to act as a bridge, we must fulfil the function of a bridge, which is to conduct from one side of something to another side.
p6cq | DIMENSIONS OF A FOOT
99rc | I remember the case of one person who was able to understand this, and hence to become sensitive to the existence and operation of a Sufi school imperceptible to others, by simply digesting the statement of Rumi, in Fihi ma Fihi:
n6d5 | 'I am a shoemaker, with much leather. But I do the cutting and the stitching according to the dimensions of the foot'

zp0n | Deterioration of Studies
f9ca | Q: How do studies deteriorate?
yidf | A: People look for new teachings, or the revelation of concealed ancient ones, when their problem rightly may be that they cannot see the presence of the teaching in the materials abundantly available to them, ancient and otherwise.
ysbk | They cannot see these teachings because they have chosen to blind themselves to the intention of a teaching-technique. They have 'superficialised' their own heritage of materials. Here is an example:
1cv5 | Many people are impressed by the example that if they look at something for half a minute, they will find their attention wander- ing. Instead of looking at this as an indication of fact, complete in itself, they do two unnecessarily shallow things; they
cst3 | 1. Try to look at things for long periods in the hope that they will be able to develop attention capacity. They never achieve it, however, when they try in this manner, because the description of the deficiency does not of course, contain the technique;
w2ec | 2. Immediately assume that the person who drew their atten- tion to their lack of attention is able to supply them with the method or system whereby they can remedy the situation. They seldom seem to imagine that, if a man says, 'This door is splintered' he does not necessarily know how to mend it.
ov01 | These people have lost the versatility of thinking which was the hallmark of ancient teaching. They have 'idolatrised' ideas, by making omniscience resident in illustration. This is exactly what a totemist does. The modern man does not, however, recognise himself as a totemist, perhaps because he does not live in a tropical jungle.
bovo | THE REAL POOR
atnz | The great Sheikh Abdullah Ansar of Herat said that the really
85ak | 203
gk8u | poor are those who are not independent of poverty: those who really care whether they are poor or not poor. Similarly, attachment to secondary concepts causes studies to deteriorate - for when this is the rule, the container is mistaken for the content. There has never been any lack of people who imagine that the physical absence of something is poverty, and that the ownership of material objects is riches. The question of attitude is absent.
dyg8 | You ask how studies deteriorate. One of the causes is the sheer weight of numbers of deluded or superficial people who demand 'deep studies' or 'spiritual knowledge'. They create a supply-and- demand situation which can cause so much imitation of teaching and learning that the imitation is taken for the real.
qoea | INDIANS PROHIBITED
ed2n | In a story current in India, an Indian student in the United States heard that a countryman of his was teaching Hindu spirituality to the people of the West, and was well established there, although he still lived near Delhi for most of the year. When he went home on a vacation, the student sought out the great guru and respect- fully sought to become a disciple.
3xp7 | 'I'm sorry,' said the chief assistant guru at the Ashram: 'we don't take Indians here - only Europeans or Americans.'
2hce | The young Hindu was aghast. I thought that the days of colonialist discrimination were over!' he gasped. 'You mean that you won't accept me as a disciple, here in my own country?'
12p5 | My dear chap', said the great guru himself, coming to the ashram gate, 'the facts are the other way round: have you ever actually seen any of the terrible people who want to drink deep of Indian spirituality? I am trying to protect my countrymen from them.'
s4t5 | 204
7ojm | Community and Human Growth
x0cv | Q: How does human growth take place in a community, and what are the dangers of operating in a randomly-collected group?
d5cm | A: Take certain kinds of organisation and the beliefs about them which are commonly held. Then examine another attitude towards them, in order to learn something.
cojo | A certain society is called Freemasons. It is ritualistic, is thought to have 'secrets', and is named after a vocation. People believe that Masonry grew up because of the comradeship of masons and their desire to monopolise certain building knowledge and even to regulate the supply of labour.
lsvc | Now look at apprenticeship in Europe, Africa and Asia, applied in a wide variety of crafts. Again, there are initiation and other ceremonies. There is a certain relationship, including a contract, between the master and pupil.
lfgp | Now recall to your mind the special ritualism and connection contained in the institution of kingship. And the rumours and beliefs of special developments or binding force between members of families, clans and other collections of people.
y6yk | What these all have in common is the belief that certain extra- ordinary perceptions can be developed by means of a certain kind of human association (call it the alchemist and his assistants, the carpet-making fraternity, one of a hundred others) whether or not the individual entering into the association is at first aware of this extra element. In other words, the verbalised form of teaching, even of introduction to higher (or inner) learning, is only one possible approach.
477w | It is, however, not enough that there should be a collection of people with an aim of working in unison or towards an objective: even though without this, the enterprise is absurd.
u0zj | Aspiration and desire are not enough: and the leadership must understand this as well.
lfp7 | 205
afyz | THE MULLA AND THE DROUGHT
mpnc | The conception is illustrated in this Nasrudin tale:
um9m | One day Mulla Nasrudin saw a schoolmaster leading a group of his pupils towards a mosque.
q90z | The Mulla asked:
0w4e | 'What is the purpose of this activity, Learned One?'
0nu4 | 'There is a drought,' said the teacher, 'and we are hoping that the cries of the innocent will move the Heavens.'
0x8p | 'Cries, innocent or guilty,' said Nasrudin, 'can have no such effect without knowledge.'
a8ov | 'How can you prove such a dangerous statement?' spluttered the affronted pedagogue.
32hh | 'Easily,' said Nasrudin, 'because if supplications were enough: intentions led by apparent necessity, there would not be a school- teacher left on earth. Children yearn for their abolition.
0ow0 | 'So, even if the children's heart cries could have you banished, it would be the prayers of the people of knowledge alone, who under- stand your function, which still sustain you among us.'
y0lw | In addition to the enterprise on hand, there must be a correct selection of the particular team. This selection must be effected by a teacher. But, once these conditions are fulfilled, there is no further need of one single word from any of the vocabularies of metaphysics or philosophy, esotericism as we know them.
8a9n | It is for such reasons as these that spiritual teachers have traditionally followed secular jobs or been administrators or skilled in many crafts: they are teaching through a variety of methods. Only their spoken teaching, or their gymnastic or prayer teachings, however, are recognised as teaching of a higher kind by external thinkers. As a result most of what they have been doing is not recorded or regarded as extraneous or irrelevant.
kyih | Just as the random collections of people and tension, anxiety, reward and punishment and the application of dogmas and fixed techniques produce conditioned people and rigid or mechanical institutions so - in the 'organic' field of what we call evolutionary philosophy - the community with the right elements (people, time and place for example) comes into living being and grows in a
zvx5 | 206
aok4 | special manner undreamt of by the stilted formal thinker and the wild emotionalist alike.
omvu | The foregoing explains how, if we pause to think for a moment, metaphysical teachers have operated systems which, far from being limited to the simple techniques and doctrines attributed to them, have necessarily consisted of an amazingly comprehen- sive design.
e271 | Only parts of this design have the tenacity to remain in ordinary transmission. Like driftwood, they are continually thrown up, or used again and again, long after their real use (as parts of their original ship) has vanished.
lmdg | It therefore becomes seemingly paradoxical (though only because people approach things from a consistently naive view-point) that many of the essential parts of higher knowledge would never be recognised as such by those types who tend to regard themselves as students of metaphysics.
5gqf | A 'tall, tired, tinker, totally tattered, trying to tinker a tenpenny tin teakettle' is just as likely to be a spiritual teacher as the saint with the halo drawn by some pious but unregenerate individual.
yg2b | He is far more likely to have something worthwhile to com- municate, certainly, than the metaphysician who regards him as a tinker alone because he is not familiar with the terminology of this ritual or that.
kftl | Unless this lesson is learnt, in one manner or another-and it has many forms - study and practice alike, formal or otherwise, are bankrupt except for the purpose of keeping people occupied: whatever they may think, or may be told, that they are doing.
wulb | It is interesting to note how traditional warnings against random groupings actually work out to be justified when one observes them. Saadi said, in a famous passage, that one dog will pollute a whole pool of rosewater. But as near as we can get to describing what happens in a randomly-collected study group is the fact that differing demands of the members from the group prevent its members - individually and collectively - from understanding and concentrating upon important and quite subtle concepts which need much attention and few distractions.
le9r | Husri, quoted by Hujwiri, says: 'The Sufi's existence is devoid of non-existence, and his non-existence lacks existence.' Such an
34uj | 207
u3ij | idea needs concentration. Even a single individual finds it hard to hold it in the mind, mainly because of himself being so filled with thoughts and ideas. With a group it is even more difficult.
x0aw | SPECIAL HARMONY
rx1a | The group must be able to develop a perception of the meaning of the following condition, again from Hujwiri: 'The condition of mortality of the Sufi should be in abeyance, and his sensations should vanish, and his relationship with anything should cease, so that the secret of his existence may emerge, and his separate parts be unified with his essence, his real self, and that he should persist in being.'
agnr | In practice, let alone in theory, groups of people are not usually interested in arriving at such states, even though they may imagine themselves to be mystics or esotericists.
t1o7 | There are many people going around, nowadays they can easily be found, who have tried to live in randomly-collected groups, and have failed. They then look for other groups, or try to further their spiritual or psychological development in some other way.
2830 | It is, however, easy to see why they have failed: they have not been prepared to prepare for such an experience. They either felt that they were ready for the experience; or else that membership of such a group would give them what they needed.
q9nf | Such an attitude is quite understandable, and exists in any situation where there is a shortfall of information, however much goodwill there may be. They have perhaps forgotten the second line of the proverb:
5q5q | Put your dough into the oven when it is hot:
4cbq | After making sure that it is in fact dough.
33ef | 208
xfue | The Value of Question and Answer Sessions
pmnr | Q: Can you say something about the special needs of 'Time, Place and People', and the value of question-and-answer sessions and their limitations?
7ce8 | A: If you place great reliance upon the technique of group- meetings with question-and-answer periods, you may make pro- gress, but at a certain point it will stop.
qrtv | This is because any teaching which does not use all kinds of procedures (exercises, study-tasks, theory and practice and so on) in due proportion will inevitably arrive at a point where some people have obtained as much as they can from each procedure and thereafter will go 'downhill' as far as their development is concerned.
a7z0 | Neither can this question of due proportion be understood by people (teachers or pupils) who are not on a stabilized higher level of consciousness. There is no intuition, no delegation of authority, no painstaking research, no seniority in years, no other factor, which can substitute for the knowledge of what procedure to apply, with whom, in what manner, unless that special attunement is there.
7dsi | To carry on in defiance of this fact produces social or imitative- academic groupings. They can call themselves what they like: they will not progress except socially.
iax1 | The same is true of bodies of people stabilised upon the per- formance of ritual, commemorative procedures or stereotyped phraseology, however hallowed by tradition.
61w7 | The existence of so many bodies of teaching, in so many cultures and epochs, with so many different outward forms is a manifesta- tion of original groups which were tailored for the community of that place, that time, that teacher.
nllv | Of all human activities the one involving studies beyond ordin-
bsru | 209
7ylr | ary perceptions must above all be projected in accordance with time, place and people: the last includes the direction of the effort, as is well illustrated by this story:
s7xm | IF YOUR HANDS ARE FULL
5bgk | Terribly afraid one dark night, Mulla Nasrudin travelled with a sword in one hand and a dagger in the other. He had been told that these were a sure means of protection.
85iv | On the way he was met by a robber, who took his donkey and saddlebags full of valuable books.
k7w0 | The next day, as he was bemoaning his fate in the teahouse, someone asked:
737f | 'But why did you let him get away with your possessions, Mulla? Did you not have the means to deter him?'
j541 | 'IF my hands had not been full' said the Mulla, 'it would have been a different story.'
z4rd | The use of the story, of course, is to indicate that people may have a transmitted formula ('weapons are a defence') without the ability to understand how to employ it.
0ivu | Like Nasrudin, they go through the motions, merely carrying the instruments . . .
oxnd | The unusual tenacity of replication of mere form which is to be observed in religious transmission is evidence of human determina- tion, not of effective content.
44ku | The ancient Chinese, Babylonian and Egyptian civilisations, as social examples, for instance, endured for thousands of years not because they were especially good and true and necessary: but because they were promoted and maintained by determined men and women, and because there was in addition a quota of inertia in them which prevented laudable change. They did not develop beyond a certain stage.
