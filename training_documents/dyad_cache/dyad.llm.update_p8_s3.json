        "content": "p1l0 | The issue at stake\n1i8b | Relatively speaking, postwar Korea was terra incognita for American Far Eastern policy. Japan had been well-known since the time of Commander Perry's visit there in the mid-nineteenth century. Its conversion under MacArthur into a peaceful democratic state attracted much attention. Americans thought of rural life in China in terms of Pearl Buck's books, primarily the Good Earth, which also became a major film; these images of course involved wild distortions but many Americans were unaware of the misrepresentations. Extensive American resources, including more than two billion dollars in aid, were invested in Chiang Kai-shek's struggle to win the civil war in China. The Philippines had been an American colony since eighteen ninety-eight, and the independent government that was established there after the Japanese occupation received US aid in its war against the Hukbalahap rebellion.\n5sfj | In contrast, the Korean Peninsula that was occupied by Japan in nineteen oh five had received very little attention in US policy. The summit meetings of Cairo, Yalta, and Potsdam included only vague references to the future of Korea. Its occupation was left to the Soviets, who committed themselves to enter the war against Japan three months after the end of the war in Europe, primarily because Korea was considered to be a secondary target that did not justify the shedding of American blood. According to some reports, secretary of state Edward Stettinius had asked where Korea was during a meeting in nineteen forty-five. And following Japan's surrender, the separation of the Korean Peninsula along the thirty-eighth parallel into two temporary occupation zones had been improvised within hours by two relatively junior officers on a National Geographic map.\nvk4h | The remote role of Korea in American strategy during the war had undergone no change in the postwar years, when a tight order of priorities had to be built because of scarce military resources and new global commitments. Popular pressures to bring American soldiers home and the need to get the American economy back to peacetime production led to a fast demobilization process in nineteen forty-five to forty-six and deep budgetary cuts. The twelve-million-soldier army of nineteen forty-five had shrunk to one million five hundred sixty-six thousand soldiers by June nineteen forty-seven, and defense expenditures dropped from thirty-seven point five percent of the G D P in nineteen forty-five to three point eight percent in nineteen forty-seven. On the eve of the Korean War, the US Army forces in the Far East Command were made up of four tactical divisions and one regimental combat team, altogether amounting to fewer than one hundred ten thousand soldiers.\nnsm3 | The combination of strained resources, global commitments, and a strategic thinking that assigned no prime role to South Korea predetermined its fate. In May nineteen forty-seven, secretary of war Robert Patterson urged the evacuation of American forces from Korea for reasons of both the tight military budget and the relatively strategic insignificance of the peninsula. In September nineteen forty-seven, the Joint Chiefs of Staff favored such an evacuation because \"the United States had little strategic interest\" in Korea and because in case of a general war, \"our present forces in Korea would be a military liability.\" In June nineteen forty-nine, when the withdrawal of the American forces from Korea was to be completed, the Army chief of staff, General Omar Bradley, raised doubts about the policy, but the consensus in the Joint Chiefs of Staff reaffirmed it:\njdfw | From the strategic viewpoint the position of the Joint Chiefs of Staff regarding Korea, summarized briefly, is that Korea is of little strategic value to the United States and that any commitment to United States use of military force in Korea would be ill-advised and impracticable in view of the potentialities of the over-all world situation and of our heavy international obligations as compared with our current military strength.\nuc9r | Besides Bradley, there were others in the administration who tended to regard the Korean Peninsula as a strategically important asset. The C I A assessed that a Communist takeover of South Korea \"would seriously diminish US prestige and adversely affect US security interest in the Far East.\" In addition to this political, economic and psychological damage, having Soviet bases in South Korea would allow the Soviets to launch \"air, airborne, or amphibious attacks on Japan, Formosa and the Ryukyus, or submarine forays against shipping in Japanese waters.\" MacArthur himself was not too resolved on this issue. On the one hand, he said in private talks that he did not want to get involved in the \"messy\" Korean situation and estimated that in case of a serious challenge, the R O K would have to be abandoned. On the other, he told President Rhee during a visit to Seoul in August nineteen forty-eight that \"I would defend Korea as I would my own country, just as I would California.\" But this commitment was no more than a gesture. Most soldiers in the Far East believed that \"[t]here are only three things the troops in Japan are afraid of: Gonorrhea, diarrhea and Korea.\"\nl0ap | The political leadership accepted the position of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. In April nineteen forty-eight, President Truman stated that military action in Korea would not be considered a \"casus belli\" for the United States. And secretary of state Dean G. Acheson's famous speech at the National Press Club on January twelfth, nineteen fifty, in which he defined the American \"defensive perimeter\" in the Pacific as a line running through Japan, the Ryukyus, and the Philippines, left South Korea and Formosa out of a US military guarantee. This may have influenced Stalin to approve the North Korean planned invasion. The administration's temporary failure to pass a sixty million dollar Korean aid bill in Congress in January nineteen fifty, and public declarations such as the one given by Senator Tom Connally, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who expressed in May concern about a Soviet occupation of Korea and Formosa, increased the impression that the administration was ready to accept the loss of these allies.\nx815 | In the last months before the invasion, some efforts were made to limit this impression. Prominent among them was a special visit of roving ambassador (and later secretary of state) John Foster Dulles to Korea two weeks before fighting commenced. But altogether, its low ranking in the US strategic calculus between nineteen forty-five and nineteen fifty meant that the Korean Peninsula received inadequate attention when it came to intelligence collection and estimation. The result was a poor level of intelligence collection, low quality of intelligence estimation concerning the looming threat and its nature, and lack of attention at the top decision-making level to the possibility that the next threat to United States' global interests would come in the Far East rather than Europe. At least part of this difference in the assessments of relative importance of Europe and Asia may have resulted from elements of racism within American leadership.\nepbj | As had been the case with Pearl Harbor, the source of the failure to provide high-quality warning against the K P A's offensive and its impact was insufficient intelligence information. But in December nineteen forty-one, this intelligence gap had involved a specific issue: the fact that Pearl Harbor was the target of the Japanese attack. In June nineteen fifty, the gap was far wider: insufficient information about the K P A preparations for war and, even more important, no information at all about Kim's invasion intentions and Stalin's and Mao's reluctant acceptance of the move. In this sense, the mistaken American estimation of the North Korean threat was rooted in a wider misconception of the real nature of the Communist threat.\nnmn2 | This misconception received a clear expression about two months before the war, in the first draft of NCS- sixty-eight. In essence, it regarded US nuclear capability as sufficient to deter the U S S R until nineteen fifty-four, when the Soviet",
