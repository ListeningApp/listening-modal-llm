Consider Sambasivan et al.'s intermediated interaction and email systems: At the systems level, there is a single person who is authenticated and accessing their email data. At the interface level, the person who is sending and receiving those emails interacts via the intermediary, not with the technology itself. At the design level, the concepts of authentication and access codify the one-to-one correspondence between human user and user account, omitting the possibility of other configurations. At the ideological level, we might be interested in accounting both for the intermediary user and for the person on whose behalf the intermediary is functioning. However, those two subject positions are absent at other representational levels (systems, interface, design process). Similar disconnects\n41fx | across levels of representation occur in the other cases mentioned above.\n7um8 | Delegates\nuow2 | One potential approach to addressing indirections involves delegates, a representation of one person (inter)acting on behalf of another. Delegates can be represented at the design process level, at the interface level, at the systems level, or at some combination thereof. Some technologies already enable such functionality. For example, enterprise software often explicitly grants permission for administrative assistants to schedule meetings for, or to respond to email correspondence on behalf of, their supervisors. Similarly, GMail users can allow other accounts to act as their delegates. At the systems level, most Unix-based operating systems provide a command called su (an abbreviation for \"substitute user\" or \"switch user\"), allowing one user to execute commands as if she or he were logged in as a different user. Interestingly, these extant cases each have slightly different implementations. At the systems level, su actually changes who is logged in; the interface represents that Alice is acting on behalf of Bob, the system represents the actions taken simply as Bob's actions. In the case of GMail, delegates record that certain actions are performed by Alice on behalf of Bob. The latter is probably closer to what would be required to implement delegation and resolve breakdowns across representational levels.\niat7 | Thus, while delegation strategies do exist in some cases, the diversity of their implementations and implications encumbers our ability to learn from the similarities and differences among how different technologies captures these inter-personal relationships. Seeing these diverse cases through the lens of post-userism allows us to consider both what they have in common and what designers for one case might learn from other instances of indirection. For the time being, it is not surprising that simply sharing credentials remains a common strategy albeit one that works around a system that does not adequately support indirection.\nywwr | Transience\n0i6j | In some cases, an individual can sustain multiple, repeated interactions with a system, even though the system does not maintain a persistent representation of that individual. Contrast Craigslist with Ebay or Match.com: Despite the design assumption that a given individual would post multiple ads, the service historically omitted user accounts that would link these individual interactions. And while the service has subsequently added user accounts that allow authors \"to post, edit, delete, and repost more easily\", when viewed by others, these posts remain unlinked and self-contained, resulting in what Brubaker\n87cq | Interactive Design Methodologies\n0qs3 | has called \"single use identities.\" Users of Reddit similarly have an established practice of creating single-use \"throw-away\" accounts, often to post material an individual does not want associated with her or his primary account. At the design level, Reddit explicitly condones this practice, despite eschewing a representation of the practice at either the interface or the systems level. Similar situations can arise with ambient displays and information kiosks. In the absence of an identification system, such as RFID badges, individual instances of interaction are not represented within the system as pertaining to a single persistent identity. To wit, the systems representation makes no distinct between different interactions by a single individual and single interactions by different individuals. While it does not necessarily introduce problems here, failing to account for transience in such situations can limit our designs.\nz8f7 | These systems exist and function (to varying degrees of efficacy) without requiring that people who inhabit the user subject position be tied to a fixed or persistent representation. Thus, both in the design process and in technical implementation, it can be difficult to account for such recurring interactions due to the transient nature of their representation.\n7w7j | Flexibility\n51vd | One strategy here involves adding flexibility to the representational constraints imposed at the interface and systems levels. Authenticated users are often presumed, but are not also necessary. If the central entity being represented is a user, what elements of that representation could be relaxed? Must everyone have a birthdate? A name? A list of friends? A set of access permissions?\nbaj1 | Facebook memorial profiles offer an example of flexibility in representations of a user. They maintain some aspects of a typical user representation while forgoing others. For example, memorial pages have a profile photos and a list of friends, but no one can log into a memorialized account. Instead, it is managed by another account denoted as the legacy contact. Adding flexibility to the representational constraints helps account for some of the subject positions involved (e.g., mourners).\nn1wo | When the user is not presumed (or required) to be a persistent subject position, other design foci come to the foreground, such as activities and communication. Returning to Craigslist, the representations are post-centric rather than user-centric, focusing the design around possible interactions with posts rather than among users. This strategy does not imply that one needs less knowledge or understanding of users. Rather, it suggests that designers consider representing certain subject positions primarily (if not exclusively) in terms of their relationship to an\n5bq3 | interaction, even if this requires a more fluid approach to what constitutes a user.\nezla | Multiplicity\nrsbu | A single individual may, while interacting with a computation system, inhabit multiple subject positions, either one at a time or simultaneously. In some ways, multiplicity offers an inverse to transience. Transience involves one-off interactions, where the design does not disambiguate between multiple interactions by a single person and a single interaction by each of several people. Multiplicity involves individual people creating multiple representations of themselves, satisfying the system requirements of user representations while simultaneously enacting different facets of their identities.\nmagd | For example, a single individual may maintain multiple user accounts for, say, a given social media site. Motivations for doing so can vary from separating professional and personal contacts, to distinguishing between actions as an individual versus actions on behalf of an organization, to negotiating gender identity transitions. Repair work offers another example: A given individual may simultaneously act as, say, both smartphone user and repair technician, even though these are generally represented as two distinct subject positions.\ntb74 | Fluidity\n8l69 | One strategy to approaching a multiplicity of subject positions is to design for fluidity. As an example, Facebook does not first encode you as a parent and then allow you to take parental actions. Instead, you simply do parental things. Sociologically speaking, the status of parent is not one that you can assume strictly through your own choice. It is one that is granted because of the ways that others interact with you. Similar statements could be made about being, say, a cat lover, a librarian, a gamer, a politician, etc. Despite the fluidity with which they are defined and bestowed, these kinds of subject positions often receive rigorous, strict codification within the design process, interface, and systems representations. Designing for fluidity may help account for, if not completely resolve, breakdowns that arise from a multiplicity of subject positions.\n1jyv | To take the strategy of fluidity a step farther, what if social media sites, or authentication systems in general, could forgo the assumption of a one-to-one correspondence between human users and user accounts? Alternative kinds of representations-at the systems, interface, or design process levels-that give up \"user\" as the central entity may facilitate better accounting for fluidity among subject positions.\nolce | Absence\n```",
