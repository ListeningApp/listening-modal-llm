You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

1pjs | 11 Lexical Stress
o2kr | Stress is accentuation of syllables within words, or of words within sentences. This chapter deals with the first of these phenomena: lexical, or word stress. In lexical-stress languages, the syllables of any polysyllabic word are not created equal. Some syllables may serve as the locus of accentual prominence; others may not. Perceptually, this results in a distinction in salience between the syl- lables within a word. Thus syllable has initial stress: SYLlable. Syllabic is stressed on the second syllable: sylLABic (upper case denotes a stressed syllable).
v6sk | Although the term stress is properly an abstraction, speech perception deals with physical realities, and so, as Section 11.1 describes, research on stress per- ception has largely been concerned with the acoustic characteristics of stressed versus unstressed syllables, and how listeners exploit the acoustic information to make decisions about where stress occurs. Differences across languages in the realization and function of stress have important perceptual consequences; this issue is considered in Section 11.2. Only in some languages is stress a potential contributor to spoken-word recognition; the empirical evidence on this question is surveyed in Section 11.3.
1wj6 | 11.1 Acoustic Realization and Perceptual Apprehension of Stress
936l | 11.1.1 The scope of this survey
06yq | Like speech perception research in general, research on the perception of stress came of age when it became possible not only to measure the acoustic properties of speech signals, but to manipulate them. This was in the middle of the twentieth century.
dpv6 | The research described in this section concerns word stress in free-stress lan- guages, although the manifestation of stress in free- versus fixed-stress languages has not always been kept apart in the literature (Section 11.2, below, will address this distinction). Also it has not always been the case that word stress has been kept apart from phrase and sentence stress, especially in earlier literature; however,
8r5j | Lexical Stress 265
2taz | prominence within the utterance more properly belongs in the domain of intona- tion research (see Vaissière, this volume).
o3ya | In words, stressed syllables very often differ from unstressed syllables in nature - phonological systems assign stress to heavier syllables but not to lighter syllables, for instance. But stressed syllables also differ from unstressed syllables in their acoustic realization. Figure 11.1 shows spectrograms of the utterance say the word pervert again, spoken by a male speaker of American English. In the top spectrogram the verb reading (perVERT) is shown, in the bottom spectrogram the noun reading (PERvert); although the syllables have the same segmental structure in each reading, the acoustic realization is clearly different.
r5il | Speech perception research paid great attention to acoustic realization. The measurements and manipulations concerned the suprasegmental parameters of speech: that is, those dimensions within which any speech signal must be realized (Lehiste, 1970), but which in principle can vary independently while the segmental identity of a syllable remains constant. In practice this involved three acoustic dimensions: the durational patterning of the utterance, the fundamental frequency (F0) of the voice, and the signal amplitude. Perceptually these corres- pond to utterance timing, pitch, and loudness.
5gui | 11.1.2 Multiply determined stress judgments
82qc | Fry (1955, 1958) conducted a systematic study of word stress in English minimal noun/verb pairs such as OBject - obJECT. Fry measured the duration and peak amplitude of each vowel, and found almost non-overlapping distributions for the stressed versus unstressed versions of comparable syllables, with the stressed syllables being longer and with higher amplitude than the unstressed. He then synthesized versions of the same words, varying these two parameters inde- pendently in 5 steps each, and varying FO in 16 steps. Listeners' judgments of which syllable bore stress in the resulting synthetic words showed more effect of the durational manipulation than of the amplitude manipulation; change in F0 had an all-or-none effect, such that a syllable with a noticeably higher peak F0, or a clear F0 movement, was always judged to be stressed. The function of stressed syllables in stress languages is to serve as possible locations for accentual promin- ence within utterance intonation contours, and this result suggests that listeners are highly sensitive to where intonational prominence is realized; wherever this occurs, the location is judged to be a stressed syllable. Fry (1958) thus cautiously concluded that this F0 effect may be strongest for stress perception, with the effect of duration also being significant, but that of amplitude negligible. However, he also pointed out that vowel quality needed to be investigated, and he undertook this task in a subsequent study (Fry, 1965), in which shifts of the vowel formant ratios (e.g., for object, stepwise from [D] to [a] in the first syllable or from [e] to [I] in the second) were compared to durational and amplitude manipulations. The suprasegmental factors here proved more closely related to stress judgments than this type of vowel change.
ls7d | If subjective impressions suggested that stressed syllables were louder than unstressed, this impression was quickly disconfirmed even by some of the earliest studies. Mol and Uhlenbeck (1956) reversed the amplitude relationship of stressed

Each figure consists of three display panels: above, a broad-band spectrogram; in the middle, a waveform display; and below, a narrow-band spectrogram. Vertical lines indicate onset and offset of pervert. The figure is modeled on a figure presented by Lehiste and Peterson (1959, p. 434).

qvnu | versus unstressed syllables while leaving other parameters unchanged, and found that the reversal did not affect perceived stress; Bolinger (1958) added amplitude to pitch accents realized in synthesized sentences, and found that listeners' naturalness judgments if anything favored accents with less added amplitude. Ladefoged, Draper, and Whitteridge, introducing their pioneering 1958 electro- myographic study of speech muscle activity, reported that "it is generally agreed" that stress has no single acoustic correlate (p. 9).
kggw | This was also the conclusion of studies by Lehiste and Peterson (1959), and Lieberman (1960). Lehiste and Peterson (on whose work Figure 11.1 is based) further drew attention to the non-independence of the acoustic parameters measured in stress studies and segmental factors - consonants and, especially, vowels can differ in intrinsic duration, amplitude, and pitch. Lieberman's study aimed to derive an algorithm for determining which of two syllables is stressed. Measurements of the three acoustic parameters in over 700 tokens of bisyllables (25 minimal pairs, produced in context by 16 speakers) showed that greater duration, higher average F0 and amplitude measures (higher peak, higher inte- gral of amplitude across the syllable, and greater amplitude ratio of one syllable to the other in a word) were all strongly correlated with stress. Where one measure was not in the predicted direction, there was almost always a trade-off because other correlates of stress were present (in no fewer than 97% of cases). Lieberman concluded that no single acoustic cue to stress is necessarily important, but that all cues may be evaluated together.
xrd1 | 11.1.3 In search of a unitary underlying factor
5746 | Should there be, no matter how complex the realization, some unitary underlying factor distinguishing stressed from unstressed syllables? The concept of articulatory effort figures in this role in many early studies (e.g. Fonagy, 1958, 1966; Ladefoged et al., 1958; Lehiste & Peterson, 1959; Van Katwijk, 1974). The latter two papers propose an explicitly perceptual account: "perception of linguistic stress is based upon judgements of the physiological effort involved in producing vowels" (Lehiste & Peterson, 1959, p. 428); "the perceptual effect [is] a pitch contour which could have been produced with an increment of subglottal pressure" (Van Katwijk, 1974, p. 66).
7toz | How could a notion like articulatory effort be tested? Lindblom (1963) con- sidered that his measurements of Swedish vowel formant frequencies, which suggested invariant vowel targets attained to a greater or lesser extent as a function only of vowel duration, implied that vowel reduction should not be explained in terms of lesser articulatory effort: only timing patterns determined whether or not a vowel would be reduced. Van Katwijk's (1974) measurements of subglottal pressure found little evidence of stress-related pressure increase.
j346 | Harder still to assess was the proposal that listener judgments of stress depended on perceived effort. However a relevant contribution was made in the work of Isačenko and Schädlich (1966; followed up by Bleakley, 1973); in German utter- ances, stressed syllables could be signaled by any F0 obtrusion from the overall contour, so that a stressed syllable could be either higher or lower in pitch than its neighbors. Listeners rated both types of obtrusion as stress, which argued
v8uq | 268 Anne Cutler
x972 | against commitment to greater perceived articulatory effort, and instead con- firmed sensitivity to location of intonational prominence. Morton and Jassem (1965) found a similar result with English listeners judging synthesized nonsense bisyllables.
cwrw | 11.1.4 Reducing the complexity?
4i0e | As the technology for manipulating speech signals improved, the complexity underlying stress perception was further confirmed. Nakatani and Aston (1978) used linear predictive coding techniques to manipulate orthogonally the natural duration, amplitude, and F0 attributes of bisyllables with initial or final stress, and found, as had others before them, that all exercised effects on stress judgments, although the effect of amplitude variation was weakest. In general, the effects were additive, except that durational variation lost its effect in sentence-final position, and F0 lost its effect when the word in question was deaccented in the intonation contour because it followed a contrastive accent (for comparable findings see Huss, 1975, 1978). Nakatani and Aston also reported speaker differ- ences in the realization of stress contrasts (see also Howell, 1993). Other studies showed that differences between stressed and unstressed syllables in the three standard acoustic parameters were maintained across speech rates (Gay, 1978; McClean & Tiffany, 1973), while experiments in languages with fixed-position stress, or in languages with other phonological effects interacting with the stress system, further complicated the picture (see Section 11.2 below).
h2l3 | Attempts were made to develop perceptual measures that might facilitate greater comparability across studies. Gussenhoven and Blom (1978) proposed a "language- neutral test" based on paired judgments of perceived contrast between isolated vowels. Taylor and Wales (1987) proposed a contrast ratio:
dfzb | (stressed - unstressed) /(stressed + unstressed)
u6ty | which, they reported, for the three standard acoustic dimensions predicted judgments of perceived stress far more effectively than other ratios (such as the most commonly used subtraction ratio, i.e., the simple difference in any of the parameters between stressed and unstressed syllables, or the ratio stressed/ unstressed, i.e., the division of one set of values by the other).
awvu | More recent research has tried to disentangle the complexity and multiple deter- mination of stress perception by considering potential confounds. For instance, might stress judgments be complicated by the possibility that word stress place- ment can shift (so that English thirteen is stressed on the second syllable in the number thirteen, but on the first in thirteen numbers)? However, the undoubted shift in perceptual prominence in many such contrasting phrases does not result from a simple reversal of relative placement of a word's syllables on acoustic dimensions (see, e.g., Cooper & Eady, 1986; Shattuck-Hufnagel, Ostendorf, & Ross, 1994; Van Heuven, 1987). Likewise, measurements revealed little support for the notion of durational compensation within stress groups in English, such that segments of syllables might be longer in, say, a two-syllable foot (save it) than in a four-syllable foot (savoring it); segment durations are longer in syllables

a8ge | with primary stress than in syllables with secondary stress, and longer in turn in the latter than in unstressed syllables, such that syllable duration can be fully predicted given knowledge of the segments and stress pattern of the word (Crystal & House, 1988, 1990).
h27a | 11.1.5 Summary
pdjh | Research on stress perception continues both within and outside the speech per- ception literature. For example, it has long been of interest to speech engineers whether the use of stress-related information in the signal could improve the performance of automatic speech recognizers (see, e.g., Lea, 1977; Marshall & Nye, 1983; Waibel, 1988, for English; van Kuijk & Boves, 1999, for Dutch), and some successful implementations have been reported (e.g., Kiriakos & O'Shaughnessy, 1989; Sholicar & Fallside, 1988).
xmgs | Over nearly 50 years, however, perceptual studies have elaborated but not fundamentally altered the early claims concerning the suprasegmental dimen- sions involved. Syllables are perceived to be stressed if they exhibit F0 excursion (Fry, 1958), whereby the timing of the F0 movement within the syllable can be crucial for determining stress perception (Thorsen, 1982, for Danish), and some types of F0 movement may require more excursion than others (Hermes & Rump, 1994, for Dutch F0 rise versus rise-fall). Greater syllable duration is likewise associated with perceived stress (Fry, 1955). These two factors are the most strongly related and the least controversial.
bd9h | More controversial is the common finding that amplitude manipulations only weakly affect stress perception (despite psychoacoustic research showing that quite small changes in this dimension are indeed perceptible; Sorin, 1981). Turk and Sawusch (1996) found listeners' perception of duration and amplitude variation to be non-orthogonal; importantly, they observed effects of irrelevant durational variation on judgments of loudness to be greater than effects of ampli- tude variation on judgments of relative length. This, they argued, provided a rationale for why prominence judgments should be based on duration, or on duration and amplitude together, but not on the latter alone.
