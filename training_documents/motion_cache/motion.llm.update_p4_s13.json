The unit vectors Ã®, j, and k in the rendezvous literature are generally referred to as V-bar, H-bar, and R-bar, respectively. Note that the LVLH frame is defined with respect to the Moon, because the target is supposed to fly on lunar orbits, and vehicles incoming from the Moon surface or lower and higher orbits are expected to approach the target (as, for instance, is envisaged in the HLEPP).\n9bz4 | With reference to Figure two, the chaser position with respect to the Moon is given by:\nyfv2 | Eleven\npujl | re equals r plus p\n3rqe | where p is the relative position of the chaser with respect to the target. The time derivative of Equation eleven in the inertial frame is:\nnsi3 | Twelve\nnil3 | where wi is the angular velocity of L (i.e., of the target) with respect to I. Further derivation of Equation twelve in I yields:\n68a1 | Thirteen\nseik | Noting that wiL equals wiL, and introducing Equations nine and ten in Equation thirteen, we obtain the nonlinear equations of relative motion in the LVLH frame:\noq7c | negative plus one minus mu norm r plus re m r plus re m three norm r plus p plus re m r plus p plus re m\nz4mi | mu norm r plus p eleven three r plus p r\nhkft | Fourteen\njai3 | The angular velocity of the LVLH frame with respect to the inertial frame can be computed by composition of angular velocity vectors:\np57i | Fifteen\nu5ug | wi equals wl m plus wm i\ni9k5 | where wi m and wm i are the angular velocities of L with respect to M, and of M with respect to I, respectively.\n20z2 | The LVLH angular acceleration with respect to I is given by: wilL equals wimL plus wm iL equals wi m plus wm iM minus wl m cross wm i\n4cgs | Sixteen\nhtre | Equation fourteen, along with Equations fifteen and sixteen, composes a set of nonlinear equations with time-varying parameters:\nda3c | One r, wl m, and wl m which depend on the target motion around the Moon\n890q | Two re m, wm i, and w m i, characteristics of the Earth-Moon system orbital motion\njomo | Equation fourteen exactly describes the relative motion in the LVLH frame in the restricted three-body problem, providing that no orbital perturbations act on the spacecraft (e.g., solar radiation pressure). The consideration of the restricted three-body problem provides the option to model the primary bodies in either an elliptic or circular orbit around each other, depending on the three-body system considered.\n06fi | In the following, the expressions of wl m and wl m are derived, in order to complete the nonlinear description of the relative dynamics in the LVLH frame.\nhb4s | B. LVLH Angular Velocity and Acceleration\ncqq2 | We now look for an analytical expression of the LVLH frame angular velocity and acceleration vectors with respect to the Moon frame, which exploits only kinematics relationships. To this end, the same considerations adopted in are here used to find an expression for wi m. The angular acceleration wi m is then obtained by differentiation.\n1ews | Consider the time derivatives of the LVLH frame unit vectors as seen in M:\nafyn | M ; LAM equals wl m cross one, kM equals wi m cross E\n8sye | Left vector multiplication of the previous expressions by the relative unit vector gives:\nr04h | IM equals x wl m cross equals wl m minus wl m\norpr | which can be summed up obtaining:\nk36m | Seventeen\nwnuz | The time derivative of the unit vector k is:\nsy14 | Eighteen\nghss | Noting that r equals negative rk and e equals negative rk, we can write:\n3s61 | r equals negative r dot k equals negative r dot k plus wl m cross r dot k equals negative r dot plus wl m dot r cross equals negative r M dot k Nineteen\ns3rm | Substitution of Equation nineteen into Equation eighteen gives:\npqxb | AM equals negative M plus two M equals negative M D\n08qc | Twenty\nhdj2 | Note that eM dot j equals zero since the target velocity as seen in M is perpendicular to H, by definition of the specific angular momentum. For the unit vector j we have the following time derivative:\na57g | LIM equals negative L H M minus H H\ng8m3 | Twenty-one\na9av | According to the definition of j, we have that H equals negative H j. Hence, Equation twenty-one simplifies as follows:\n73l3 | Twenty-two",
