        "content": "2ttg | Although the city of San Diego has a large and active downtown, San Diego County is not a monocentric region. One would not expect housing prices to trend upward from the city center to the suburbs in a uniform way. One would expect, however, that since the data are for reasonably small sections of the metropolitan area, that there would be distinct spatial autocorrelation tendencies. High positive I values are expected. G of d values are dependent on the tendencies for high values or low values to group. If the low cost areas dominate, the G of d value is negative. In this case, G of d is a refinement of the knowledge gained from\nhis3 | I. Table five shows that there are strong positive values for Z of I for distances of four miles and greater. Z of G also shows highly significant values at four miles and beyond, but here the association is negative, that is, low values near low values are much more influential than are the high values near high values. Moran's I clearly indicates that there is significant spatial autocorrelation, but, without knowledge of G of d, one might conclude that at this scale of analysis, in general, high income districts are significantly associated with one another.\nm50z | By looking at the results of the G sub i of d statistics analysis for d equal to five, the individual district pattern is unmistakable. The Z of G sub i star of five values shown in Table six\nme84 | and Figure four provide evidence that two coastal districts are positively associated at the point zero five level of significance while eight central and south central districts are negatively associated at the point zero five level. There is a strong tendency for the negative values to be higher. It is for this reason that the Z of G values given above are so decidedly negative. The districts with high values along the coast have fewer near neighbors with similar values than do the central city lower value districts. The\no56m | Arthur Getis and J. K. Ord \nslz6 | cluster of districts with negative Z of G sub i star values dominates the pattern. The adjusted Bonferroni cutoff is about three point two seven, but again is overly conservative.\n90k5 | CONCLUSIONS\n9m8s | The G statistics provide researchers with a straightforward way to assess the degree of spatial association at various levels of spatial refinement in an entire sample or in relation to a single observation. When used in conjunction with Moran's I or some other measure of spatial autocorrelation, they enable us to deepen our understanding of spatial series. One of the G statistics' useful features, that of neutralizing the spatial distribution of the data points, allows for the development of hypotheses where the pattern of data points will not bias results.\n893y | When G statistics are contrasted with Moran's I, it becomes clear that the two statistics measure different things. Fortunately, both statistics are evaluated using normal theory so that a set of standard normal variates taken from tests using each type of statistic are easily compared and evaluated.",
