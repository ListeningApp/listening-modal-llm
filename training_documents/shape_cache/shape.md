## Assessing the female figure identification technique's reliability as a body shape classification system

This paper demonstrates the effects of slight differences in measurement definitions on resultant body shape classification. Ergonomic researchers consider the Female Figure Identification Technique a 'gold standard' body shape classification system to describe variation in a population's three dimensional profile. Nevertheless, researchers use FFIT without a scientific basis or considering their ergonomic suitability. This paper rigorously evaluates FFIT, focussing on ergonomics, garment construction, and scientific research applications. Through analysing one thousand six hundred seventy-nine three dimensional body scans, we assess the level of agreement between the FFIT's body shape classification when measurements placed following FFIT's or SizeUK's guidance. We establish how different interpretations of FFIT's measurement placement cause the same body to be categorised into different shapes - in up to forty percent of cases. FFIT omits shoulder measurements that have little relationship to body shape yet are vital in garment construction. Using FFIT with different datasets and definitions, therefore, leads to inconsistent conclusions about shape differences.

## Introduction

Despite garment construction practices ignoring current body shape classifications, body shape underpins how ergonomists, practitioners, and researchers understand the human form. An increasing number of clothing ergonomics academics are embracing the Female Figure Identification Technique developed by Simmons, Istook, and Devarajan. In using the FFIT, clothing ergonomics academics assume its suitability for scientific research,

including nationality-based body shape comparisons, body shape based health estimations, and consumer's perceptions of their body's shape. Body shape is also essential for online fashion retail's virtual fit and garment size prediction tools. For these scientific and retail applications to be reliable, their underpinning body shape classification system must be indisputable. An indisputable system is when assessment categorises a person into the same shape every time. Consistent categorisation requires dependable definition with a system like FFIT, something which is problematic when the system and its definition need careful analysis to understand.

Given FFIT's prevalence and influence within body shape research for apparel, researchers may assume Simmons, Istook, and Devarajan developed a system that consistently defines body shape. The FFIT, developed using a TC2 body scanner, uses six girth measurements - bust, waist, hip, high-hip, stomach, and abdomen - which is an advance on more traditional two dimensional width-based classifications. Width-based analysis was necessary in the FFIT development because of limitations of knowledge, but they made a clear advancement in circumferential definitions – relating shape more clearly to clothing; The FFIT then defines nine body shapes among American women (hourglass, bottom hourglass, top hourglass, spoon, rectangle, diamond, oval, triangle, and inverted triangle; see Figure one) which is again an advance on traditional systems. The mathematical descriptors of body shapes that the FFIT proposed were based on logic: developed from literature, experts' tacit knowledge in apparel design, and visual analysis of the segmental proportions in the female body's bust-to-hips zone - excluding the shoulder-to-bust zone. However, the FFIT only provides general guidelines on how a practitioner should take its six measurements. The practitioner also needs familiarity with the TC2 scanner because FFIT is grounded in the TC2 scanner's software definitions. Furthermore, practitioners need careful reading of FFIT's supporting texts to ensure consistency of measurements used. Those reporting on using FFIT apply common names for measurements with multiple definitions (e.g. waist), potentially leading to significantly different measurements and then different shapes.

Careful analysis of FFIT shows it uses measurement definitions different from those used in significant European body scanning surveys, particularly the United Kingdom National Sizing Survey: SizeUK. The SizeUK survey is the United Kingdom's first national survey of the population since the nineteen fifies, capturing three-dimensional shapes of the population, using the same three dimensional body scanners as FFIT instead of tape measures. SizeUK's goal was to support United Kingdom retailers to amend their size charts and provide a data source for scientific research, including medical, health, transport, and product design. SizeUK provides a database of anthropometric measurements for industry's use, and it not a body shape classification system. Nevertheless, Size UK influences how industry understands human measurements and their placements. Ergonomists and researchers may combine SizeUK's measurement definitions with the FFIT's body classification process. Combining measurement definitions is clear in Yim Lee et al.'s work, showing brief consideration is given to consistency of measurement definition or capture device.

The FFIT defines the hip in TC2 software as the largest circumference in the crotch-to-waist region. Size UK, in contrast, uses the buttock prominence to define the hip. Both the FFIT and Size UK, however, use the nomenclature hip to classify their measurement. This highlights the complexities of using scanning technologies and varied measurement definitions, complicated further as some standards related to scanning.

Standards provide foundational support for research comparing measurements. Nevertheless, ISO seven two five zero does not have a hip circumference definition. Without a hip circumference definition, ISO seven two five zero has little applicability to the FFIT, and this paper, as the FFIT relies upon the hip.

While the FFIT and SizeUK use a three dimensional body scanning system by TC2, the lack of standardisation in methods meant three vital measurements were incompatible at the hip-girth, the waist, and the seat. Without standardisation of definition, the same tool leads to a practitioner taking a different measurement placement than the FFIT intended. SizeUK, however, uses TC2's seat measurement for its hip. TC2's seat measurement corresponds to the Hip definition of International Organisation of Standardisation: the body's horizontal girth measured at the hip - the greatest projection at the body's back; see Figure two.

The FFIT's waist measurement is set as Small of the Back plus six point three five centimeter, while SizeUK situates the waist as Small of the Back plus four point zero centimeter. These slight differences are problematic as the narrowing of the female form towards the rib cage can locate a much smaller circumference outside where a practitioner may designate the waist region. Altering hip and waist measurement placement significantly changes the measurements' size. Suppose a practitioner uses alternative definitions of measurements within an FFIT body classification exercise. In that case, the impact of different measurement placement on body shape classification is uncertain, yet potentially damaging to the FFIT's between-studies comparisons.

The FFIT's body shape classification's applicability to extensive anthropometric surveys, including SizeUK, is potentially low yet untested. Rejecting the FFIT based on poor applicability with the anthropometric surveys that influences how industry understands human measurements is radical. Meticulous examin- ation is, therefore, essential.

Three-D Body Scanning - following accepted I S O standards - takes measurements following different placement definitions than FFIT - loosely - dictates. Simmons, Istook, and Devarajan name the bust, waist, hip, stomach, and abdomen when developing FFIT, but omits replicable measurement definitions. Sokolowski and Bettencourt even state, ‘Simmons, Istook, and Devarajan did not provide detailed descriptions of where on the scan these measurements were taken'. Instead, Simmons, Istook, and Devarajan primarily used the measurements programmed into the T C two anthropometric software - as their later work with Yim Lee describes. Unless a researcher seeking to use FFIT has the same T C two software, they must choose measurement within the stated regions, as Figure two shows.

The FFIT's definitions are potentially incompatible with the way Three-D Body Scanning's anthropometric software defines measurements as standard. This incompatibility may have serious consequences given the FFIT's common application to Three-D Body Scanning data. The FFIT used a hip measurement definition that allows the hip circumference to occur anywhere in a given zone (see Figure two), including above the seat. Hips cannot, anatomically, occur above the seat. This may be why SizeUK used the Seat in place of the Hip. The standard Three-D body scanning posture requires participants to keep their feet at least two hundred millimeters apart: 'standing position A' according to I S O twenty sixty eighty-five. Three-D Body Scanners require standing position A

(Figure three) to identify crotch and thigh geometry more accurately.

Nevertheless, 'standing position A' has a problem. Its wide feet position causes the largest circumference between crotch and waist to move, occurring at a position different from the hip level defined in I S O eight five five nine dash one. A person's measurements, therefore, change if the practitioner uses manual or Three-D Body Scanning measurement methods.

Practitioners are placing measurements on different parts of the body by using different measurement methods. If the different measurement methods can place the same body into a different shape classification, the impact may be severe. Two surveys - both using the FFIT shape classification tool but using different measurement methods - may reach conclusions about inter-group body shape differences that do not exist in reality. Researchers in these hypothetical studies may assume they classify bodies in the same way. This is because FFIT is not explicit on where to place measurements. FFIT also relies on measurements existing within zones (see Figure two) instead of precise placements. Even the most meticulous practitioners may, therefore, be measuring bodies at different locations without knowing it.

If this is true, then the FFIT - or any research that utilizes the FFIT - cannot be authoritative because of the FFIT's propensity for error caused by the effects of slight differences in measurement definitions. The published FFIT research does not, arguably, communicate the need for measurement definition standards to an adequate level. This is important because consistent results rely on practitioners applying consistent measurement definitions.

Additionally, the FFIT only classifies a person's lower-torso region instead of the entire body, despite research using the FFIT for this purpose. In defining the body, the FFIT only uses six circumferences in the region from the bust to the hip. The restricted body form consideration limits how the FFIT might inform pattern construction because it excludes measurements in the critical upper-body control zone/the shoulders' anchor area. Unlike earlier body classification systems - for example, Rasband - the FFIT's shape sorting formulae excludes shoulder anthropometry. Shoulder measurement's exclusion is surprising as they are essential for clothing design and construction. The FFIT's suitability for garment construction, and apparel-related purposes, is unsubstantiated.

FFIT defines the bust in line with I S O definitions. However, as Figure two shows, the waist and hip are defined as occurring within zones. Within these zones, measurements can fall into regions that they would not naturally occur within. For example, the hip can occur anywhere from the crotch to the waist, including above the seat. For all definitions, this can never be classified as the hip as the seat (a circumference at maximum buttock projection) should be the upper limit. Because FFIT omits clear measurement definitions, differently defined measurements sharing the same name are likely to be applied to the published shape calculations; as with Sokolowski and Bettencourt.

While the FFIT may have specific measurements, these measurements are unavailable - and unreplicable - to the broader ergonomic field. The measurement extract is specific to T C two's Scanner software and hardware. As measurements are used interchangeably by name,

two practitioners will likely use such alternative measurements - such as SizeUK - while attempting to replicate FFIT. Sokolowski and Bettencourt even modifies FFIT to address the underlying assumptions about measurement placement that cannot work on women over size fourteen. However, these placement assumptions are invisible to third-party practitioners who do not run studies 'hacking' the algorithm. If using alternative measurements reclassifies bodies into different shapes, then FFIT is unauthoritative outside of its original application because of unreplicable measurement definitions. In such a situation, ergonomists who attempt to use the FFIT system in their work may not, therefore, be able to compare their work to others - but they are unaware of these underlying issues.

We aim to assess the FFIT's suitability as a body classification system for scientific research and garment construction purposes, considering how slight changes in measurement definitions may affect shape classifications. We use FFIT as the case by which to explore how body shape systems may provide unreliable when used more broadly than specified systems and measurements extractions. In pursuing this aim, we consider the following hypotheses:

One. Calculating the FFIT using alternative measurement definitions causes the same human shape to be categorized as alternative body shapes, with a low - below fifty percent - agreement between measurement definition groups.

Two. Waist measurements decrease by a statistically significant amount - X equals zero point zero five - when taken at SizeUK's region of SoB plus four point zero centimeters compared to the FFIT's region of SoB plus six point three five centimeters: with a large effect size.

Three. Waist heights increase by a statistically significant amount - X X equals zero point zero five - when taken at SizeUK's region of SoB plus six point three five centimeters compared to the FFIT's region of SoB plus four point zero centimeters: with a large effect size.

Four. A person's FFIT Body Shape classification can be predicted from shoulder measurements that the FFIT excludes - Shoulder-to-Shoulder (Horizontal), Shoulder-to-Shoulder (Calliper), and Shoulder Girth (Full) - through a statistically significant regression model; X equals point zero five.

In investigating our hypotheses, we analyse one thousand six hundred seventy-nine UK females' FFIT shape classification - and necessary measurements - through Kappa Measure of Agreement, T-test, Multinomial Logistic Regression, and ANOVA statistical tests.


## Materials and methods

Study population

One thousand six hundred seventy-nine females participated in this study, obtained through convenience sampling. We achieved this by posting flyers and adverts on social media, inviting members of the public to attend open scanning sessions between twenty eleven to twenty sixteen in Manchester, Nottingham, and London.

Our sampling frame required participants to be female, over eighteen years old, have no physical or cognitive disabilities, and not be pregnant during data capture. These measures ensure ethical compliance and reduce the sample's independent variables. We only sampled females because the FFIT body shape classification system relates explicitly to the female body. We gained participant consent before data collection, with full prior approval of the study by Manchester Metropolitan University's ethics committee. Personal identifiable data was collected, kept separately, and de-identified within the working data set.


## Sample size

To achieve a power of pi is greater than or equal to zero point eight, we calculated the minimum sample size as one thousand four hundred forty-eight participants using G Power. We calculated our sample size for a one-way between-groups ANOVA with a small sample size. We used these parameters because an ANOVA has the greatest sample requirements of all our study's tests; Effect Size

F equals zero point one, alpha equals zero point zero five, one minus beta equals zero point eight, eight groups. We sampled one thousand six hundred seventy-nine participants, exceeding our minimum sample size by two hundred thirty-one participants.


## Sample demographics

The study's sample were females aged eighteen to eighty-four years, mean equals thirty-one point five, standard deviation equals fourteen point five, of body mass thirty-four point zero to one hundred sixty point three kilograms, mean equals sixty-five point three, standard deviation equals fifteen point zero, and height one hundred thirty-three point five to one hundred eighty-eight point nine centimeters mean equals one hundred fifty-four point six, standard deviation equals six point six. Participant ethnicity was mainly White, but also included Black one hundred fifty-four, Asian sixty, Chinese forty-four, Mixed White and Black thirty, Other Mixed Background twenty-eight, Mixed White and Asian twelve, and other or not stated twenty-one. All participants were UK females.


## Data collection procedure

Before participants attended scan sessions, they were provided with guidelines regarding the body scanning requirements concerning underwear, jewellery, and hair. All participants were asked to use non-padded and non-compression underwear to avoid any distortion of their natural body shape. The research ethics prohibits scanning anybody without underwear and excludes any inspection because of privacy issues. To ensure underwear, jewellery, or hair did not distort body shapes, the research team visually inspected each subjects' collected (processed) scan data. Visual inspection ensured all landmark points and measurements were in locations according to the anatomy and surface, considering measurement standards for clothing. Scan data that provided inaccurate measurements of the participant was removed.

We used TC Two’s KX-sixteen body-scanner to collect participant's body scan data, with all participants adopting the standard scanning posture as different standing postures significantly alters waist and hip placement. The standard scanning posture is 'standing position A prime' according to International Standards Organization twenty sixty eighty-five; see Figure three that aligns with Gill, Hayes, and Parker's scanning protocol. We used the anonymised body scan data for measurement extraction and analysis.

The Small of Back, or SoB, is vital in developing the TC two software's Measurement Extraction Protocol, as the software cannot locate the waist without some points of reference. The SoB is defined as the deepest point of the spinal curve at the tangential change, closer to the buttocks, differing from traditional manual landmarking. The SoB represents the starting point for waist measurements and is key to how shape would be defined and, therefore, should be fully understood. Plus numbers, for example, plus six point three five centimeters, give the distance above the SoB; defining the upper limit for the region within which a scanner can find the smallest waist circumference. SizeUK allows an upper limit of plus four centimeters and the FFIT plus six point three five centimeters from the SoB; see Table one.


## Equipment suitability

The TC two body scanner's suitability, reliability, and validity within clothing science research has been demonstrated by multiple authors. Notably, the TC two scanner provides a greater depth and volume of data than traditional methods. As body scanning captures points, lengths, surface, shape, and volume, while tape measures - for example - only capture length.

Out of FFIT's nine body shapes, we used Yim Lee et al.'s algorithm for FFIT's seven body shapes in our automatic shape sorting programme; see Table two. We categorized participants into body shape using Visual Basic. We selected Yim Lee et al.'s algorithm as it is the same algorithm Simmons, Istook, and Devarajan used in FFIT's development. We accept that our excluded shapes, diamond and oval, would be categorized into 'other' shapes because of limitations in defining the abdomen and stomach - as Yim Lee et al. accepted. Yim Lee et al. even considered another category - 'Shape not known' - to filter unclassified shapes from the extracted measurements, as we use in Table two; see Box one in Appendix Table A one.

To investigate alternative body measurement definitions' influence on the FFIT's body shape classification, we considered three sets of measurement definitions: DS one, DS two, and DS three.

Definition Set one, or DS one, includes the bust, waist, hip, and high hip measurements, the same as the FFIT measurement definitions.

Definition Set two, or DS two, includes the bust, waist, and high hip measurements, the same as the FFIT definitions. The FFIT's Hip measurement definition is, however, replaced with the SizeUK Hip measurement definition with TC two's Seat Girth measurement, presented in Table one. For DS two, only the hip's definition is different. We maintain the other three measurements to see how changing only one measurement definition in four alters the body shape classification.

Definition Set three, or DS three, includes the bust, waist, high-hip, and seat, in place of the hip, girth measurements, the same as the SizeUK measurement definition, presented in Table one. The bust measurement and its parameter settings in the TC two Measurement Extraction Protocol are the same for the FFIT and SizeUK; see Table one. For DS three, all measurement definitions are as per the SizeUK sizing survey.


## Waist measurement parameters' selection

This study's two waist measurement parameters are: SizeUK's SoB plus four centimeters region and the FFIT's SoB plus six point three five centimeters region.


## Shoulder measurements' parameters' selection

The three shoulder measurement parameters we used to represent shoulder anthropometrics were: shoulder-to-shoulder, horizontal, shoulder-to-shoulder, caliper, and shoulder girth. We selected these three parameters to capture the shoulder's shape,

allowing shoulders to relate to the other shape classification measurements.

While higher complexities of shoulder anthropometrics - such as pitch, slope length, and front-to-back depth - may associate with FFIT body shape, we focused on key measurements traditionally used in garment construction. Using traditional measurements retains consistency with the FFIT's measurements and current practice. It was essential to select measurements that - like the other FFIT dimensions - could define the shape and provide a context within current pattern cutting practices.


## Data handling

Manchester Metropolitan University held the study's data within a database of UK scan data following the Data Protection Act. A practitioner - with fifteen years' experience - extracted participant data from the database before inspecting all scans to ensure the data's reliability and validity. Before conducting statistical analysis - i.e. Multinomial Logistic Regression, t-tests, or ANOVA -, we followed procedures to check for violation of Normality, Linearity, and Homoscedasticity assumptions. We found no serious violations, allowing us to proceed with data analysis.


## Statistical analysis

We undertook all statistical analysis with Statistical Package for the Social Sciences, with initial screening in Excel. Significance for all tests was determined at the P less than or equal to point zero five level. We interpret effect sizes and power requirements in line with Cohen's widely accepted benchmarks.


## Alternative measurement definitions

We used Kappa Measure of Agreements to gauge the level of agreement between the FFIT categorical classifications under DS one, DS two, and DS three measurement definitions, investigating hypothesis one. High agreement indicates high stability in the classification. Table two shows how many participants fit each of the FFIT's body shapes, according to differential measurement definitions. We selected the hourglass body as the reference shape because it was the most common in DS one, FFIT's 'standard' interpretation.

Alternative waist definition's measurement impact We used T-Tests to investigate the differences between alternative waist measurement definitions. Ttest one - Association of Waist - investigates hypothesis two: the difference in waist measurements taken at the S o B plus four point zero centimeters and S o B plus six point three five centimeters regions. T-test two - Association of Waist Height - investigates hypothesis three: the difference in waist heights taken at the S o B plus four point zero centimeters and S o B plus six point three five centimeters regions.


## Shoulder measurement's predictive capability

We used Multinomial Logistic Regression to predict the FFIT body shape classification from shoulder measurements, investigating hypothesis four. Our model's dependent variable is the FFIT body shape classification. Our factors are shoulder-to-shoulder (horizontal), shoulder-to-shoulder (calliper), and shoulder girth (full). We used Hosmer-Lemeshow tests for each pair of shoulder measurements to assess Goodness of Fit to the multinomial logistic regression's model, using the same variables.

We used ANOVA to investigate whether the FFIT's categorical variables associate with alternative shoulder measurements (scale variables). Our ANOVA test's variable is Shoulder-to-Shoulder (Horizontal), with groupings: the FFIT body shape classification. We investigate Shoulder-to-Shoulder (Horizontal) with ANOVA because it is the most potent predictor of the FFIT's body shape classification according to our multinomial logistic regression model. As multiple comparisons in post hoc analysis increase the risk of Type One errors, we apply a Bonferroni adjustment to p zero point zero zero seven, mitigating Type One errors' risk.


## Post hoc power analysis

We conducted post hoc power analysis for parametric statistics - in conjunction with calculating sample size based on power calculations - to mitigate Type Two errors caused by underpowered samples. We used our statistical analysis' results - i.e. mean difference, standard deviation, and significance - with sample size as inputs for post hoc power analysis with G*Power. All post hoc power analysis tests showed adequate power Pi is greater than point eight under commonly accepted power guidelines.


## Results and analysis

Comparison of body shape classifications following the FFIT and SizeUK definitions

Investigating hypothesis one, a Kappa Measurement Of Agreement test revealed negligible agreement between the FFIT categorical classifications under different measurement definitions: DS1 and DS2

K (N equals one six seven nine) equals zero point three six nine, p is less than zero point zero one, DS1 and DS3 K (N equals one six seven nine) equals zero point four one zero, p is less than zero point zero one, and DS2 and DS3 K (N equals one six seven nine) equals zero point three five six, p is less than zero point zero one. Table three presents the inter-shape agreement for DS1, DS2, and DS3. Between twenty-one point nine percent and thirty-nine point six percent of participants are categorized into different body shapes, measured by disagreement between measurement definitions in Table three.

While rectangle, inverted triangle, and top hourglass show a high level of shape classification agreement under different measurement definitions, hourglass, triangle, bottom hourglass, and spoon show low shape-classification agreement; below fifty percent.

We, therefore, accept Hypothesis one.


## Association of waist measurement placement

Investigating Hypothesis two, a paired-sample t-test revealed waist measurements significantly decrease when taken within Size UK's S o B plus four point zero centimeters region M equals seventy-nine point three nine, S D equals twelve point six four compared to being taken within the FFIT's S o B plus six point three five centimeters region (FFIT) M equals seventy-eight point one three, S D equals twelve point six four, t equals thirty-two point zero three, p is less than zero point zero one (two-tailed). The t-test achieved one minus beta error probability equals one point zero, Effect size D Z equals zero point eight: satisfying our statistical power requirements. The mean decrease was one point two six centimeters, with a ninety-five percent confidence interval ranging from negative one point three three centimeters to negative one point one eight centimeters. The eta-squared statistic (zero point three eight) indicates a large effect size.

Seventy point three percent of participants had a waist circumference smaller within the FFIT's S o B plus six point three five centimeters region than those whose smallest waist circumference lay within Size UK's S o B plus four point zero centimeters region. Waist measurements are, therefore, smaller when the 3D body scanner searched for the narrowest point within a larger waist region starting from the S o B.

We, therefore, accept Hypothesis two.


## Association of waist height

Investigating hypothesis three, a paired-sample t-test of the waist's height taken at the Size UK's S o B plus four point zero centimeters region and the F F I T S O B plus six point three five centimeters region revealed a statistically significant increase in waist location height from defining the region within S O B plus four point zero centimeters M equals one hundred four point six six, S D equals five point six two to S O B plus six point three five centimeters M equals one hundred three point four four, S D equals five point five eight, T one six seven eight equals negative forty-six point four one, P is less than point zero zero zero five (two-tailed). The t-test achieved Power one minus beta error probability equals one point zero, Effect size D Z equals one point zero, satisfying our statistical power requirements. The mean increase in waist location height was one point two two centimeters, with a ninety-five percent confidence interval ranging from one point six seven to one point two seven centimeters. The eta-squared statistic (zero point five six) indicates a large effect size. Our results show that seventy-one point nine percent of participants had a higher waist height location when measured within the FFIT's S O B plus six point three five centimeters region. The large number of participants with their smallest waist existing above SizeUK's S O B plus four point zero centimeters region illustrates the need to consider measurement placement and its impact on shape definitions.

We, therefore, accept Hypothesis three.


## Shoulder measurement's influence

Investigating hypothesis four, we added shoulder measurements to a Multinomial Logistic Regression model alpha equals zero point zero five containing only the intercept. Adding shoulder measurements significantly improved the fit between model and data: x squared eighteen, N equals one thousand six hundred seventy nine equals three hundred twenty-two point three eight six, Nagelkerke R squared equals zero point one eight, P is less than zero point zero one. Shoulder-to-Shoulder measurements - Horizontal and Calliper - made significant contributions to the model, as Table four shows. Shoulder girth (full) did not, however, significantly contribute to the model. We confirmed Horizontal and Calliper shoulder measurements' Goodness of Fit through Hosmer-Lemeshow tests for each pair of groups, with both tests reporting

P is greater than zero point zero five. Considering parameter estimates, the Horizontal and Calliper shoulder measurements' predictor has six parameters: one for each of the FFIT body shape classifications, excluding the hourglass shape that acted as the reference group. To interpret the differences between predictors, Table five shows the parameter estimate and lists each shoulder measurement, standardized to: M equals zero, S D equals one.

Shoulder-to-Shoulder (Horizontal) is the most powerful predictor for body shape classification compared to the hourglass shape. Bottom Hourglass prediction is, however, the exception.

To improve the model's predictive power, we culled Shoulder-to-Shoulder (Calliper) from the model because of its insignificant association with the FFIT Body Shape Classification. The resulting model was statistically significant x squared sixteen, N equals one thousand six hundred seventy nine equals two hundred seventy-seven point two six five, Nagelkerke R squared equals zero point one six, P is less than zero point zero one, correctly classifying thirty-seven point two percent of all participants FFIT Body Shape. Despite the significant result, the model cannot correctly predict: Inverted Triangle, Triangle, Top Hourglass, or Spoon shapes, as Table six shows. Hourglass was the only shape with a high level of predictive capability: correctly identified in sixty-three point two percent of cases. Shoulder-to-Shoulder (Horizontal) may, therefore, be a further factor in defining body shape. Systems like FFIT could include this measurement.

We, therefore, reject hypothesis four.

A one-way between-groups analysis of variance explored the FFIT body shape's association with shoulder-to-shoulder (horizontal) measurements. There was a statistically significant difference at the P is less than zero point zero five level for shoulder measurements for the FFIT's seven body shapes; F left six, eighty-eight point eight seven right equals forty-one point six five eight, P is less than zero point zero one. The squared was zero point one six, indicating a large effect size. The A N O V A test achieved left one minus beta right error probability equals one point zero, Effect size F equals zero point four one, satisfying our statistical power requirements. Table seven presents the post hoc pairwise comparisons using the Tukey H S D test, with a Bonferroni adjustment of

P equals zero point zero zero seven. Despite the A N O V A's statistically significant result, there is little difference between shoulder-to-shoulder (horizontal) and the FFIT Body Shapes. While Top Hourglass has a significantly different shoulder measurement than every other body shape, other body shapes have at least one insignificant difference. Figure five visualizes the confidence intervals, revealing the significant overlap between shoulder measurements and body shapes. Therefore, we cannot imply a person's shoulder-to-shoulder (horizontal) measurement with confidence from the FFIT body shape alone.


## Discussion Unauthoritative body shape classification

We show that the FFIT Body shape classification system is unauthoritative because slight differences in measurement placement definition leads to different shape classifications of the same body: in up to thirty-nine point six percent of cases. Something likely to occur because of variabilities in scanner definition and a lack of clarity regarding measurement definitions that hold the same nomenclature. This paper, therefore, highlights a limitation in the current body shape calculation methodologies, stemming from applying inconsistent measurement definitions in the FFIT. The results verify the FFIT may classify a single person in up to three different body shapes depending on the measurement definitions associated with the named measurement. With a vague definition of body shape between sources, multiple shape interpretations occur depending on where on the body the measurement is placed, highlighted within Table one.

Hourglass and rectangle are the dominant body shapes within our sample, as Table three shows. However, the shape classification transforms with the alteration in measurement definitions; see Table three and Figure four. The FFIT's waist, for example, is higher in the waist region than SizeUK's waist, as defined by the SizeUK Measurement Extraction Protocol. The mismatch in measurement definitions emphasizes high specificity's importance in the way ergonomists and garment construction practitioners take measurements to extract the repeatable and accurate measurements that drive shape classification.

Significantly smaller waist measurements in the FFIT causes alternative body shape classifications. These arose when the three D body scanner searched for the narrowest point within the FFIT's broader waist region of six point three five centimeters. The difficulty here is the three D body scanner's propensity to place the waist at the ribcage's base, a measurement smaller than the actual waist. The actual waist should occur in the waist region's soft tissue. Furthermore, as Sokolowski and Bettencourt note, the FFIT assumes the waist region is smaller than the bust and hip. Sokolowski and Bettencourt show that the FFIT's categorization as Yim Lee et al.'s formulate incorrectly categorizes plus-sized women often because the waist circumferences were larger than either bust or hip.

In summary, ergonomists and garment construction practitioners require a non-equivocal and repeatable set of measurement placement definitions to produce a stable and repeatable body shape classification system. The FFIT does not adhere to this, using flawed Hip and Waist definitions that can place measurements in inappropriate regions. If the FFIT instead uses an anatomically correct Hip definition as SizeUK's Measurement Extraction Protocol uses - it will raise a question about the mathematical descriptors' accuracy, presented in Table A one in Appendix. The mathematical descriptors were, after all, developed using information from literature, experts' tacit knowledge in apparel design and fit, and the visual analysis of segmental proportions that exist in the female body's bust-to-hips zone. Ergonomists, garment construction practitioners, and researchers cannot, therefore, consider the FFIT as accurate or appropriate enough for scientific or cultural discussion, a forum requiring non-equivocal categorization.


## The need for shoulder anthropometrics

Our results show two shoulder measurements differentiate between the FFIT body shape classifications Shoulder-to-Shoulder (Horizontal) and Shoulder-to-Shoulder (Caliper). While the FFIT shapes may have an eminent power in predicting horizontal shoulder widths, the remaining measurements only show small to medium effect sizes. These close associations show limited power relative to the higher complexities of shoulder anthropometrics such as pitch, slope length, and front-to-back depth. Multiple interpretations of the FFIT definitions confound this, as Figure four outlines. Including shoulder measurements within a more advanced future body shape classification system may lead to more effective and stable shape outcomes that align to newer I S O standards. This outcome is expected yet previously unproven. FFIT has a limited applicability in defining more complex body morphology than 'typical' female form as Sokolowski and Bettencourt's evolution of FFIT to include plus-sized women proves. Existing knowledge of anthropometric inter-relationships and how alternative Body Shape algorithms utilize different body measurements indicates the need for a study addressing body shape that is consistent. However, we show Shoulder-to-Shoulder (horizontal) measurements have a large effect size differentiating body shape classification. It is surprising that FFIT excludes the Shoulder-to-Shoulder (horizontal) measurement given its importance in industrial ergonomics and garment construction and use systems that predate FFIT. Measurement selection is, after all, mutually exclusive to anthropometric measurement extraction technology. Through using the FFIT, ergonomists, academics, and garment construction practitioners have a deficiency in how they consider bodies.


## Industrial implications

Our finding's implications are vital because clothing academics and ergonomics researchers are using the FFIT as the theoretical basis of their body shape analysis. Nevertheless, this paper proves that the FFIT's measurement definition and classification methodologies are limited as the FFIT uses Hip and Waist definitions that deviate from measurements defined in standards and in product development. The FFIT provides a foundational approach to body shape classification by key circumferences. Nevertheless, FFIT is prone to variability in application, where two practitioners can classify the same body into different shapes. We support this through replacing the FFIT's Hip definition with an anatomically correct Hip definition - as the SizeUK Measurement Extraction Protocol uses, producing different body shape classifications while still within the FFIT's loose measurement definitions. Practitioners' use of FFIT is not necessarily flawed if the same measurement definitions are used within comparisons. Instead, problems arise when a practitioner unknowingly uses different measurements in their work to that of the research they are comparing their results against. Nevertheless, few publications utilizing FFIT provide sufficient specificity to allow practitioners to avoid such potential error. Ergonomists, academics, and garment construction practitioners must give further critical consideration to the reliability and suitability of all comparative research reliant upon body shape - especially the FFIT - within their work.

This paper shows that a person's shoulder-to-shoulder (horizontal) measurement cannot be inferred from the FFIT body shape alone. As shoulders are one of the critical measurement zones for some upper-body clothing, FFIT cannot describe a body's form that is entirely suitable to garment selection, as with fashion retail's virtual fit/garment size prediction tools. There is, therefore, a need to develop more complex body shape identification systems that include shoulder measurement and addresses the needs for standardization to avoid classification changes because of small discrepancies in measurement location.


## Conclusion

We set out to assess the stability of FFIT's body classification system for ergonomists, garment construction practitioners, and scientific researchers. In these fields, practitioners often classify measurements by name, meaning definitions can be challenging to ascertain. In pursuing this aim, we prove that slight differences in measurement placement definition lead to different shape classifications of the same body. Because two practitioners can use two different sets of measurements sharing the same name, but with slight differences in definitions within the FFIT's tool, the FFIT body shape classification can lead to inconsistent conclusions. FFIT can reduce, or remove, this inconsistency by publishing their measurement placement definitions in a non-equivocal and replicable format.

Relating body shape to garment construction, horizontal shoulder measurements - one of the critical measurement zones for some upper-body clothing - only exhibits a medium association with body shape classifications.

A higher level of association with the torso measurements used to establish body shape by FFIT would have provided an opportunity to use the FFIT system to predict the torso's broader morphology, including the shoulder region. This indicates a need for any reliable and authoritative body classification system to include a wider variety of shoulder anthropometry.

The FFIT applied without consistent use of the same definitions is limited. Further research is needed to achieve a reliable and appropriate body classification system for scientific research or garment construction. The results provide a detailed examination of the variable approaches to defining body measurement and how these affect results. It highlights the need for researchers from all fields to work together to agree on more standardized approaches to anthropometric and ergonomic practices.

Our finding's mean clothing ergonomics academics and garment construction practitioners must question the authority of their practice that depends upon systems that have loose measurement definitions - like FFIT. They must seek to ensure measurement definitions are consistent, even when names are the same. We must, therefore, rethink and build on the last decade of progress in nationality-based body shape comparisons, body shape-based health estimations, and consumer self-perception that have drawn from the FFIT. Systems like FFIT would benefit from defining measurements by averaging over regions, reducing the influence of localized changes. Such systems could lead to more stable body shape classification systems. Researchers may have exposed between-study differences in body shape classification, but the researchers' interpretation of the FFIT's measurement placement may drive the differences, instead of genuine population body shape differences.

Ergonomics academics and garment construction practitioners need a more reliable and repeatable body classification system than currently exists. Including shoulder anthropometrics into a new body classification system should, if produced through rigorous empirical methods, create a system with direct application in clothing's development and construction processes. Then, maybe even online fashion retail's virtual try-on systems can meaningfully utilize body shape and three D Body Scanning.


## Limitations and further research

This paper raises important questions about how ergonomists, garment construction practitioners, and researchers categorizes body forms and how the field must consider body shape in the future.

While we prove that slight differences in measurement placement definition lead to different shape classifications of the same body, our investigation is limited to the FFIT and its relevant measurements. Exploring a more comprehensive range of body categorization systems with a broader range of alternative measurement definitions will determine the generalizability of our findings outside of the FFIT.

Our research does not develop a new - more appropriate - body shape classification system. We, instead, set out clear arguments for any development in body shape classification to include unequivocal measurement definitions, apply to garment's construction practices, and include the body's additional regions aligning to contemporary ISO standards. Our work with FFIT has inspired the need for empirical investigation to define those shapes' measurements, algorithm, and classification needs. To propose a system without such rigor would be inappropriate.

Future classification systems must provide a higher degree of specificity with a lower degree of alternative interpretation for measurement location and collection compared to the FFIT. Such work must use sophisticated computational analysis that may have been unavailable to Simmons, Istook, and Devarajan - who used elementary logic. Our results have begun this process by showing such a new body shape classification system should include shoulder circumferences. Nevertheless, more complex additional measurements than the FFIT, and this paper, considers - such as pitch, slope length, and front-to-back depth - may lead to more appropriate body classifications for ergonomists, garment construction practitioners, and researchers to work with a higher level of precision. Other body anthropology, such as the breast, should be included as body classification has, historically, focused on the female form.
