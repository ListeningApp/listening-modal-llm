You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

b8hf | Chapter 1 WHY POLLINATION IS INTERESTING
hntf | The flowering plants (angiosperms) account for about one in six of all described species on earth and provide the most obvious visual feature of life on this planet. In the terrestrial environment, their interactions with other living organisms are dominant factors in com- munity structure and function; they underpin all nutri- ent and energy cycles by providing food for a vast range of animal herbivores, and the majority of them use animal pollinators to achieve reproduction. Most of the routine "work" of a plant is carried out by roots and leaves, but it is the flowers that take on the crucial role of reproduction.
99fo | A flower is usually hermaphrodite, with both male and female roles. Hence it is essentially a structure that produces and dispenses the male gametophytes (pollen), organizes the receipt of incoming pollen from another plant onto its own receptive surfaces on the stigma, and then appropriately guides the pollen's genetic material to the female ovules. The flower also protects the delicate male and female tissues (stamens and pistils) and has a role in controlling the balance between inbreeding and outbreeding, hence influenc- ing the genetic structure and ultimately the evolution-
y5r7 | ary trajectory of the plant. But the plant itself is im- mobile, so that incoming pollen has to be borne on some motile carrier, sometimes wind or water but much more commonly on a visiting animal. To quote one source (Rothrock 1867), "among plants, the nup- tials cannot be celebrated without the intervention of a third party to act as a marriage priest"! A pictorial overview of the stages is shown in figure 1.1, covering the processes of pollination that are the focus of this book.
lrry | A flower also serves to protect the pollen as it ger- minates and as the male nucleus locates the egg and then to protect the ovules as they are fertilized and be- gin their development into mature seeds. However, these later events (germination of the pollen and fer- tilization of the ovule) are technically not part of pol- lination, and they are covered here only as needed to understand the characteristics and effects of pollen transfer.
hvhm | Since flowers bring about and control plant repro- duction, they are central to much of what goes on in the terrestrial world, and pollination is a key mutual- ism between two kingdoms of organisms, perhaps the most basic type of exchange of sex for food; the plant gains reproductive success, and the animal-usually- gains a food reward as it visits the plant. But the visitor does not "want" to be a good pollinator and has to be manipulated by the plant to move on and to carry pol- len to another plant. In practice, only about 1% of all pollen successfully reaches a stigma (Harder 2000).
863b | Nevertheless, pollination by animals (biotic polli- nation) is both more common (Renner 1998) and usu- ally more effective than alternative modes of abiotic pollen movements using wind or water, and animal pollination is usually also associated with more rapid speciation of plants (Dodd et al. 1999; K. Kay et al.
fj24 | 2006). Discussion of animal pollination therefore dominates this book, and around 90% of all flowering plants are animal pollinated (Linder 1998; Renner 1998). Furthermore, plants are, of course, the founda- tion of all food chains on the planet, and their efficient pollination by animals to generate further generations is vital to ensure food supplies for animals. Natural ecosystems therefore depend on pollinator diversity to maintain overall biodiversity. That dependence natu- rally extends to humans and their agricultural systems too; about one-third of all the food we eat relies di- rectly on animal pollination of our food crops (and the carnivorous proportion of our diet has some further in- direct dependence on animal pollination of forage crops). Pollination and factors that contribute to the maintenance of pollination services are vital compo- nents to take into account in terms of the future health of the planet and the food security and sustainability of the human populations it supports.
uz3c | Beyond its practical significance, the flower-animal mutualism has been a focus of attention for naturalists and ecologists for at least two hundred years and pro- vides almost ideal arenas for understanding some of the fundamental aspects of biology, from evolution and ecology to behavior and reproduction. It is per- haps more amenable than any other area to providing insights into the balance and interaction of ecological and evolutionary effects (Mitchell et al. 2009). Flow- ers are complex structures, and their complexity admi-
d5bi | rably reveals the actions, both historical and contem- porary, of the selective agents (mainly, but not solely, the pollinators) that we know have shaped them. These factors make floral biology an ideal resource for un- derstanding biological adaptation at all levels, in con- trast with many other systems, where there are multi- ple and often uncertain selective agents.
ba4l | In this first chapter, some of these central themes are introduced to set the scene for more specialist chapters; it should be apparent from the outset that while each chapter might stand alone for some pur- poses, it cannot be taken in isolation from this whole picture.
ffx8 | 1. Which Animals Visit Flowers?
s6su | At least 130,000 species of animal, and probably up to 300,000, are regular flower visitors and potential pol- linators (Buchmann and Nabhan 1996; Kearns et al. 1998). There are at least 25,000 species of bees in this total, all of them obligate flower visitors and often the most important pollinators in a given habitat.
y219 | There are currently about 260,000 species of angio- sperms (P. Soltis and Soltis 2004; former higher esti- mates were confounded by many duplicated namings), and it has been traditional to link particular kinds of flowers to particular groups of pollinators. About 500 genera contain species that are bird pollinated, about
06ht | 250 genera contain bat-pollinated species, and about 875 genera predominantly use abiotic pollination; the remainder contain mostly insect-pollinated species, with a very small number of oddities using other kinds of animals (Renner and Ricklefs 1995).
v3r2 | The patterns of animal flower visitors differ region- ally. In central Europe, flower visitors over a hundred years ago were recorded as 47% hymenopterans (mainly bees), 26% flies, 15% beetles, and 10% but- terflies and moths; only 2% were insects outside these four orders (Knuth 1898). But in tropical Central America, the frequencies would be very different, with bird and bat pollination entering the picture and fewer fly visitors, while in high-latitude habitats the verte- brate pollinators are absent and flies tend to be more dominant. Some of these patterns will be discussed in chapter 27.
nv42 | 2. Why Do Animals Visit Flowers?
xags | The majority of flower visitors go there simply for food, feeding on sugary nectar and sometimes also on the pollen itself. Chapters 7 and 8 will therefore deal in detail with these commodities, and chapter 9 will cov- er a few more unusual foodstuffs and rewards that can be gathered from flowers; chapter 10 will take an eco- nomic view of all these food-related interactions, in terms of costs and benefits to each participant. Major themes in other chapters include the ways that flower feeders can improve their efficiency: learning recogni- tion cues to select between flowers intra- and interspe- cifically, learning handling procedures, learning to avoid emptied flowers, and avoiding some of the haz- ards of competing with other visitors.
