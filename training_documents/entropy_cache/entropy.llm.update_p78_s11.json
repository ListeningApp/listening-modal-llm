A more precise statement is that the partition function counts states weighted by their accessibility: exp of negative beta E semi-colon. States whose energy is low compared to kT are highly accessible, or probable, because exp of negative beta E semi-colon is close to one if E is less than kT. States of high energy are more inaccessible, or improbable, since exp of negative beta E semi-colon is close to zero if E is much greater than kT.\n```",
