        "content": "3w3y | The following lemma covers the case when the inactive set termination condition is satisfied, that is, I(Xk, zero k) equals empty set or (seven c) holds. In this case, we expect the inactive set step to be small and so we analyse the decrease due to the active set portion of the step, using the fact that at least one of the active set termination conditions (seven a) or (seven b) must be unsatisfied. Lemma B. four (Sufficient Decrease: Active Set Case). Suppose that f satisfies Assumption three point one. Let X k plus one equals P (X k plus O k Pk) be the update computed at iteration k of Algorithm one, where a k satisfies the line search criterion (eleven). Suppose that at least one of the active set termination conditions, (seven a) or (seven b), is not satisfied. If I(X k, zero k) equals empty set, then\n3ejg | f (X k plus one) minus f (X k) is less than negative p min section one half (one minus p)\nehdq | , twenty-one minus L g min one, two eighty-two\nmahz | However, if I(X k, zero k) does not equal empty set and (seven c) is satisfied, we have\nba46 | f (X k plus one) minus f (X k) is less than negative p min a. min twenty-one minus zero zero min\nbjmu | min one, five min one, five percent two eighty-two one half\nw8jo | twenty\nn4g6 | Inexact Newton-type Methods for Optimisation with Nonnegativity Constraints\nxrzh | Proof. Since alpha k satisfies the line search criterion we have\nb5m5 | f (x k plus one) minus f (x k) is less than or equal to rho g k upper A, P left (x k upper A plus alpha k p k upper A) minus x k upper A plus alpha k rho g k upper I, p k upper I is less than or equal to rho g k upper A, P left (x k upper A plus alpha k p k upper A) minus x k upper A, where we apply g k upper I, p k upper I is less than or equal to zero. From here the proof proceeds similarly to Lemma C. three. Indeed, if (seven a) or (seven b) are unsatisfied, (thirty-six) gives\nwu5k | f (x k plus one) minus f (x k) is less than negative rho min left {one half, alpha k min left one, epsilon k squared divided by two delta k squared right} right} epsilon k squared,\nn462 | and it only remains to apply a bound on alpha k. If I left (x k, delta k right) equals empty set, we use (twenty-seven) to obtain\n7tg4 | f (x k plus one) minus f (x k) is less than negative rho min left {one half, two (one minus rho) divided by L g} min left one, epsilon k squared divided by two delta k squared right} right} epsilon k squared. Otherwise, we have I left (x k, delta k right) does not equal empty set. In this case, we must lower bound delta k divided by norm p k upper I in (twenty-six). We therefore use (twenty) with varrho equals varsigma, section (twenty-two), as well as the fact that (seven c) is unsatisfied to obtain\n5kya | min left varrho , one right norm p k upper I is less than or equal to norm g k is less than or equal to epsilon k squared implies delta k min left one, varrho right over epsilon k squared is less than or equal to delta k divided by norm p k upper I. We now apply this bound to (twenty-six) and combine with (twenty-eight) to get\n7muy | f (x k plus one) minus f (x k) is less than negative rho min left one half, min left {two (one minus rho) divided by L g , delta k over epsilon k squared right} min left one, varrho right min left one, epsilon k squared divided by two delta k squared right} right} epsilon k squared.
