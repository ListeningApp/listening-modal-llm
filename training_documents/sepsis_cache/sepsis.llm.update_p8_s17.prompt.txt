You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

hd35 | The risk of hypothermia and the survival benefit of fever in patients with sepsis are well described (2-8, 45). A meta-analysis of observational studies cited a pooled estimate of a 47% mortality in hypothermic patients with sepsis versus 22% mortality in those with fever (6). While the control group mortality in our trial was high, it tracks closely with the mortality observed in prior cohorts of afebrile critically ill sepsis patients (2-5). Perhaps more compelling, participants allocated to therapeutic hyperthermia experienced a mortality that was more closely aligned with expected mortality in fe- brile sepsis patients (2-6). Studies of antipyretic therapy in sepsis have demonstrated little benefit (46, 47). A single trial of external cooling in febrile sepsis patients showed reduced vasopressor doses and lower early mortality in febrile patients cooled to normo- thermia (48), but these findings were not replicated in a subsequent randomized trial (49). The inflammatory cascade, cytokine expression, and transcription factors in febrile sepsis patients are likely different from afe- brile sepsis patients, and having experienced fever may confer benefit to immunocompetent sepsis patients that cannot be undone with cooling.
2zpk | The mechanism through which therapeutic hyper- thermia may have affected clinical outcomes in this study is unclear. Previous data have demonstrated that, compared to afebrile patients with sepsis, febrile patients had a greater increase in monocyte HLA-DR early after sepsis diagnosis (9), suggesting a lower
epu7 | prevalence of sepsis-induced immunosuppression in patients with fever. Fever and therapeutic hyper- thermia, although, are fundamentally different condi- tions, and the relationship between fever and HLA-DR expression may be mediated via the inflammatory cascade involved in fever production rather than by heat itself. Notably, the survival curves in our study diverged around day 10, which indicates the effect of warming may be late. Given the breadth of immune changes caused by hyperthermia in animal and in vitro studies, immune-related mechanisms may have played in a role in the clinical outcomes seen in this study, despite our negative immune findings. Alternatively, therapeutic hyperthermia may benefit septic patients through nonimmune mechanisms, such as direct effects on microbial clearance, augmentation of an- tibiotic activity, or temperature-dependent changes in blood flow. Regardless, this is the first article that has supported the hypothesis that temperature plays a causal role in survival from life-threatening infection.
7od1 | Another interesting observation in this trial was that forced-air warming alone could effectively warm patients in a short time, even above 37℃. This finding suggests that the absence of fever was not an adaptive process associated with a change in set point. Rather, insufficient cytokine response or mitochondrial dys- function may have contributed to hypothermia, and when adequate heat was applied, substantive temper- ature elevations could be realized.
0bqy | Our observation should be confirmed in a mul- ticenter clinical trial powered for clinical outcomes. That trial should better elucidate the most effective temperature target, duration of treatment, and mech- anism of effect to fully understand how temperature management might be used in clinical practice. Better understanding the impact of temperature on sepsis physiology and the heterogeneity of treatment effects will be critical to defining the clinical application of sepsis warming.
b780 | This trial has several limitations. First, tempera- ture augmentation was modest, with over 25% of our warmed participants not achieving febrile-range hy- perthermia. Second, we used a warming technique that was limited in its ability to achieve very high temperatures. Future trials targeting higher tempera- tures may need to use technology able to transfer more heat. Third, our control group mortality was very high. Although prior studies of hypothermia in sepsis have
ccmb | observed similarly high mortality, our inclusion crite- ria intentionally selected a group of participants with high predicted mortality. Fourth, our primary outcome could not be measured in one participant who died or in any patients were immune suppressed. These eligi- bility criteria may limit generalizability if hyperthermia were ultimately found to be effective. Finally, our small sample size also makes type I error more likely, so fu- ture larger multicenter trials should be conducted to ensure balance on important covariates.
ma93 | In conclusion, induced hyperthermia did not im- prove early markers of immune function, but in our pilot randomized trial warming was associated with lower mortality. The pathway responsible for our find- ings is unclear. Future work should seek to confirm our clinical findings in an adequately powered multicenter clinical trial and to better understand mechanistic changes in sepsis physiology associated with temper- ature modulation.
