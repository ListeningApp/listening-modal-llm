        "content": "tfms | Alpha star equals negative zero point eight three five. (d) Comparing alpha star for all forcings.\npfv5 | The choice alpha star, namely the one that cancels the second order response rho two, performs quite well for the Feynman-Kac and divergence-free forcings, as seen in Figures three a and three c. It allows to extend the range of linearity for eta greater than one, an increase of over tenfold when compared to the original response curve for alpha equals zero. This allows for a variance reduction of a factor of order one thousand for the estimator (two point thirty-eight), as documented in Section four point five.\n8gxa | Figure three b illustrates the discussion of Section three point three about choosing the values of alpha allowing to stay longer in an approximate linear response. Although the value of the parameter alpha such that rho two of alpha equals zero is alpha star equals one point zero for the modified fluctuation-dissipation, we see that alpha star of zero point zero five equals zero point six three nine is a much more nicely behaved curve, staying within five percent\nfsvi | EXTENDING LINEAR RESPONSE WITH SYNTHETIC FORCINGS\n068d | relative error for a large eta regime. This is a consequence of the fact that although alpha star cancels rho two, it might significantly increase rho three and higher order terms.\nysz7 | Four point three. Overdamped Langevin dynamics - two-dimensional case. We now present the numerical results for overdamped Langevin dynamics in dimension two, defined on script capital X equals mathbb T squared, with the following periodic potential energy:\nk5db | V of q equals one half cosine of two pi q one plus cosine of two pi q two plus kappa cosine of two pi of q one minus q two, with kappa in mathbb R. The observable considered here is of the same form as (four point five), and reads\n7jzh | R of q equals a cosine of two pi q one plus b sine of two pi q one, times e to the power of beta V of q. For observables of this form, expressions (four point six) and (four point seven) can be generalized to higher dimensions to compute the normalization constants. As in Section four point two, this ensures that rho one equals rho two equals one when kappa equals zero. When kappa is nonzero but not too large, rho one and rho two are of order one, which is convenient to observe deviations from the linear regime.\nvm00 | For all numerical results presented here, we considered kappa equals zero point three and a constant nongradient forcing F equals one comma zero in mathbb R squared. The spatial domain mathbb T squared equals zero comma one squared was discretized using a regular product mesh of m q equals two hundred points per dimension.\n62qe | The results presented in Figure four correspond to response curves for each of the synthetic forcings discussed in Section three point two point two. Figure four a corresponds to the Feynman-Kac forcing (three point nine), with xi equals one comma zero in mathbb R squared. It is observed that this extra forcing is more effective in extending the linear regime when it is in the same direction as the physical perturbation F, hence our choice of xi. We generalize the exponential divergence-free vector field (four point eight) presented in Section four point two to higher dimensions as script capital L sub extra equals e to the power of V times the divergence operator, \n62qe | presented in Figure four c.\nypz9 | the results are qualitatively similar to those from Section four point two, apart from two main differences. First, we present a divergence-free vector field of the form gradient V transpose A gradient, with A the symplectic matrix given by (three point eleven), which has an underwhelming impact on increasing the linear regime as seen in Figure four d, even for alpha star of zero point zero five equals two point zero. It seems therefore not to be a good option to consider. Second, Figure four e shows that the Feynman-Kac forcing performs better than the exponential divergence-free field. On the other hand, the modified fluctuation-dissipation (three point eight) is once again underwhelming, as seen in Figure four b, with response curve for alpha star of zero point zero five equals zero point five nine once again performing better than alpha star equals one point three zero one. Note that the value alpha star of epsilon was not computed for the Feynman-Kac and the exponential divergence-free forcings, as alpha star sufficiently extends the regime of linear response for those cases.",
