Here we report positive and cautionary indicators for safe operations with hydrogen in underground pore storage systems based on a literature survey. The results are summarized in Table one.\nl6t9 | Three point one Biotic and abiotic reactions\n1ujy | Depleted fields and aquifers are composed of either sandstones or limestones. Sandstones consist primarily of stable, non-reactive silicate minerals, namely, quartz and feldspar that will not react with hydrogen at reservoir conditions. Major components in limestone reservoirs and mineral accessories in sandstones or in the caprock, however, may form reactions with hydrogen forming toxic gases such as hydrogen sulphide. Possible reactants include carbonate [CaCO3, MgCO3,\nqzor | (Ca, Mg) CO3], sulfate (CuSO4, CuSO4H2O), sulphide (S, FeS, FeS2, PbS, HgS, ZnS, Cu2S, CuFeS2, CS2), and oxide (Fe2O3, Fe3O4, FeO, MgO) minerals and reservoir gases such as CO, CO2, and hydrocarbons. However most of these reactions are insignificant at reservoir conditions, because hydrogen redox reactivity is kinetically limited due to its high bonding energy and thus most of the possible redox reactions remain insignificant at low temperature. However, experimental data demonstrates that hydrogen induced reduction of pyrite into pyrrhotite is likely to produce sulphide at reservoir conditions and that the pH of the media is a critical parameter controlling the extent of the reaction at low temperature. This is consistent with field observations in the town gas storage field in Beynes, France, where pyrite reduction is believed to be responsible for the observed rise in hydrogen sulphide within the reservoir. Although this represents a potential risk to underground hydrogen storage, the study also shows that pyrite reduction could be prevented at acidic reservoir conditions.\na0by | In contrast to abiotic reactions, the extent and impact of which is discussed in the literature, it is widely agreed that biotic processes may endanger hydrogen quality and/or lead to hydrogen consumption. Several classes of microorganisms present at reservoir conditions are known for consuming hydrogen, which are methanogens, hydrogenotrophic sulfate reducers, homoacetogens and hydrogenotrophic iron three-reducing bacteria. Possible implications might include the production of methane, acetic acid, and hydrogen sulphide in addition to hydrogen loss. A well-known example for such biotic hydrogen loss is the Czech underground storage facility Lobodice in which methanogens were shown to transform hydrogen and carbon dioxide to methane, resulting in significant hydrogen reduction from fifty-four volume percent input to thirty-seven volume percent output over a time period of seven months. Optimum conditions\nu1ky | where growth peaks and critical conditions beyond which no growth is possible were summarized for several classes of microorganisms showing that most bacteria favour moderate temperatures between twenty and forty degrees Celsius, salinity less than one hundred grams per liter and pH levels between six and seven point five.\nhtm9 | Three point two Petrophysical properties of prospective pore storage systems\n8hul | The petrophysical properties of prospective pore storage systems are important factors to consider when selecting a site for underground gas storage. It is noteworthy that the optimal porosity and intrinsic permeability values for rock formations utilized in gas storage may vary depending on the specific storage application and the type of gas being stored. For instance, high-pressure storage applications may necessitate higher permeability than low-pressure storage. Other factors such as effective stress state, temperature, and deformation state must also be considered when evaluating the suitability of a rock formation for underground storage.\n87vz | Technically in underground hydrogen storage operations, a rock with high porosity and permeability is more desirable for hydrogen storage because it allows for higher storage volumes as well as higher injection and withdrawal rates representing the unloading and loading cycles, respectively. Higher energy efficiencies tend to be expected for high intrinsic permeability rock types when hydrogen is injected into them. Furthermore, the hydraulic properties of the reservoir rock are a key factor influencing the interaction between fluid pressure and mechanical properties of the reservoir, known as hydro-mechanical coupling. The permeability controls the fluid flow and thus the temporal and spatial distribution of fluid pressure, which in turn affects the effective stress state of the reservoir and its mechanical properties. This interaction must be considered and studied in the design and operation of underground hydrogen storage systems, as it can change the security and efficiency of the storage process to a significant degree. Zones of high permeability can reduce the risk of high fluid-pressure transients in the reservoir and around the wells, and thus the risk of inelastic rock deformation. Local high-pressure zones can form within low-permeability rocks, leading to aftershocks and induced seismicity in worst-case scenarios. In addition, low-pressure zones in the reservoir and around the wells can lead to a decrease in the production rate.",
