        "content": "rrn2 | Part Two\nfoid | Now that we have become more familiar with attachment theory and trauma, we will use Part Two to become better acquainted with consensual nonmonogamy. This section will address what consensual nonmonogamy is, what attachment research has to say about nonmonogamy, why understanding attachment is particularly important for people practicing nonmonogamy, and how attachment ruptures and traumas can occur at multiple levels of the nested model of attachment and trauma when a person is nonmonogamous.\n152h | CHAPTER FOUR CONSENSUAL NONMONOGAMY\njvjk | WE ARE LIVING IN A TIME OF NOTABLE CHANGE. Since change is the only constant, we could probably say that about any time in history, but over the last several decades, multiple established beliefs and deeply rooted cultural and societal practices have shifted. This includes attitudes towards race, class, gender and sexuality. While these societal revisions are far from complete and there is still much room for improvement, over the past fifty years or so marginalized groups have received more access, acknowledgment, justice and rights than previously granted in Western history. These necessary changes have come from the courageous and sustained efforts of the oppressed. Many people, known and unknown, have sacrificed their personal safety, their own freedoms and even their lives for the collective.\ns2v8 | As lifestyles and biases previously invisible to the privileged have been exposed and deconstructed, choice has emerged. We have increased choice to pick what path in life we want to take, choice in how we identify ourselves and the choice of who and how we love. While transformations in constructs of race, class, gender and sexual orientation have thus far been in the vanguard of this societal change, monogamy has mostly stayed unchallenged as a social construct, with those who do not fit within its constraints finding themselves alienated from a profound social revolution. As Esther Perel points out, even the monolith of the family has evolved with the proliferation of alternatives to the nuclear family. The emergence of stepfamilies, blended families, sperm and egg donor families, single-parent families and surrogate families have expanded our acceptance of what a family can look like.\nm2uh | However, the romantic ideal of the monogamous couple has mostly stayed intact as the dominant model for love and relationships. Well, at least on the surface. The divorce rate in the US is at forty to fifty percent, and an estimated thirty to sixty percent of married men and twenty to fifty percent of married women in the United States admit to cheating on their partners. Perel reminds us that there is plenty of evidence\nerho | that the monogamous model doesn't necessarily work, with many people endorsing a proclaimed monogamy, while actually performing clandestine nonmonogamy. And yet, despite this substantial discrepancy between people espousing monogamy and actually practicing it, its stronghold on the romantic status quo is undeniable. Couple privilege and the bias of monogamy are still omnipresent in both contemporary American culture and at the global level. It is still predominantly believed that monogamy is not only the morally superior way to practice partnership, but also the one and only way to do so. This paradigm is so well-established that straying from it often entails the risk of familial and social estrangement, as well as an assortment of legal repercussions, imprisonment or even death.\nbpnq | However, consensual nonmonogamy (CNM) is on the rise. Books like Sex at Dawn and The Ethical Slut remind us that even though monogamy is a relatively new concept in human history, CNM as a legitimate relationship option and an unconcealed lifestyle choice is still fairly new to our modern times. For decades, even centuries, partaking in relationships with multiple partners was relegated to underground events and communities. The sexual revolution of the nineteen sixties brought CNM out of hiding, but awareness and acceptance of people practicing CNM was not instantaneous. Only in the last decade or two have we seen a substantial increase in the number of books published, academic research funded and media such as podcasts emerge with CNM as their focus. Today, we see CNM pop up in our newsfeeds, discussed in the media, portrayed on mainstream TV shows and offered as one of many relationship status options to choose from on dating apps and social media sites. Researcher Amy Moors found that there was a steady increase in the number of Google searches for terms related to polyamory and open relationships between two thousand six and two thousand fifteen. Additionally, and tellingly, the American Psychological Association has created the Task Force on Consensual Nonmonogamy to promote awareness and inclusivity around CNM and non-traditional relationships.\n3xla | CNM is unquestionably having its cultural moment, and it's not just a passing\nfs5q | trend. Distinct from cheating, where sexual or romantic relations with more than one person are deceitful, consensual nonmonogamy is an umbrella term for the practice of simultaneously having multiple sexual or romantic partners where everyone involved is aware of and consents to the relationship structure. People practicing CNM value transparency, consent, open and honest communication, personal responsibility, autonomy, compassion, sex positivity and freedom for themselves and others. Moreover, people practicing CNM typically embrace the following ideas and principles: love is not possessive or a finite resource; it is normal to be attracted to more than one person at the same time; there are multiple ways to practice love, sexual and intimate relationships; and jealousy is not something to be avoided or feared, but something that can be informative and worked through. Mystic Life, author of Spiritual Polyamory, states, \"This path requires owning jealousy as it arises, accepting others as they are, developing [one's] own sense of personal wholeness, and letting go of the belief that loving someone more means loving someone else less.\"\npse2 | Using two separate US Census samples, Haupert et al. found that over twenty percent of people in the United States admit to having participated in CNM at some point in their life, regardless of race, age, religion, class, political affiliation or level of education. Other researchers estimate that four to five percent of people in the US are currently engaged in a CNM relationship. That's over sixteen million people. When comparing people in monogamous relationships to people in consensually nonmonogamous relationships, researchers have found that CNM relationships have similar levels of commitment, longevity, satisfaction, passion and love as monogamous relationships do. Additionally, despite what people might presume, CNM relationships have also been found to have greater levels of trust and lower levels of jealousy than monogamous ones.\nrc6c | WHY NONMONOGAMY?\nbatl | Whenever I have an individual or a couple who are either already practicing CNM or about to begin their CNM journey in my office, one of my first questions is always",
