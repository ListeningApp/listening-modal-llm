  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

xags | 3.4. Connections
jc47 | In EBF systems, brace-to-beam and link-to-column connections attracted particular research attention due to the high level of demands on these joints. Gusset plate buckling at the brace-to-beam connection was observed in the full-scale tests of Roeder et al. [89] and Foutch [90]. Engelhardt and Popov [11, 64] proposed and tested modified gusseted and directly welded brace-to-beam connections. Satisfactory results were reported for all of the proposed connection details; however, the directly welded connections were found to be more advantageous in controlling LTB of the beam segment outside the link. Considering that the braces are expected to remain essentially elastic during severe loadings, most of the ductility requirements which are required for braces of special CBFs are not mandatory for EBF braces and their connections, based on the AISC Seismic Provisions [3].
ko3c | Tests by Hjelmstad and Popov [6, 7], and Malley and Popov [9, 18] in the 1980s suggested that fully welded link-to-column connections can exhibit satisfactory behavior during severe loading scenarios. In these tests short links with different combinations of complete joint penetration (CJP) groove welds and fillet welds for the flanges and the web were considered. In contrast, details with welded flanges and bolted web connections tested by Malley and Popov [9, 18] showed significant bolt slippage which led to premature flange fractures.
xek3 | Engelhardt and Popov [11, 64] investigated the behavior of link-to-column connections for the case of long links. Details employing CJP groove welds at the flanges and either a fully welded shear tab or a CJP groove weld at the link web (Figure 7a and b) were considered owing to their acceptable performances in previous tests on short links (e.g. [7, 9]). Premature link flange fracture was observed for these specimens at early stages of loading, and thus, modified details (e.g. Figure 7c and d) were proposed and tested by these researchers. Furthermore, a link-to-column connection with all-around fillet welds (Figure 7e) was also studied. Although some of the modified details sustained high rotations prior to failure (especially the cover plate (Figure 7d) and the all-around fillet weld (Figure 7e) details) due to the doubtful performance of the tested specimens as well as the observed brittle failure modes, it was concluded that the use of long links attached to a column should be avoided. Engelhardt and Popov [11, 64] also tested two short links which were connected to the web of an I- shaped column through continuity plates (Figure 7f). A similar detail was previously studied by
bbpr | Malley and Popov [9, 18] and acceptable results were reported with minor flaws compared to the link- to-column-flange connections. However, the tests of Engelhardt and Popov [11, 64] revealed that the link-to-column-web connection is prone to premature link flange fracture and should be avoided. Based on these studies, the 1992 AISC Seismic Provisions [91] limited the use of link-to-column connections to short links, recommending details such as Figure 7a and b.
5zyf | In the experiments of Tsai et al. [65] CJP groove welds at the flanges and fillet weld at the web were used to connect short links to box columns. Premature fractures at very low link rotations (sometimes less than 0.005 rad) were observed in the link flange welds. Although a number of modified details performed remarkably better, the observed fractures gave cause for concern.
9own | Ghobarah and Ramadan [20, 92] proposed an extended end-plate link-to-column connection (Figure 7g) in 1994. In this approach the link is shop-welded to the end-plate using all-around fillet welds and the end-plate is then field-bolted to the column flange. Although some of the specimens exhibited bolt or flange weld fractures, it was concluded that properly designed extended end-plate link-to-column connections would remain elastic during severe loadings and demonstrate a similar performance to that of a fully welded connection. In a recent study by Dusicka and Lewis [35] on end- plate link-to-column connections, different stiffening details were investigated to reduce the demand on link flanges in the vicinity of the link-to-end-plate welds, which was found to be a potential region for brittle failure [20, 31, 92]. These details included using an additional pair of stiffeners in the first web panel which were either parallel to the web and connected to the web or within a small distance from it (Figure 7h), or angled from the link end towards the web, or curved stiffeners made from round HSS. Promising results were reported based on FE analyses for the first detail with stiffeners parallel to the web which shifted the failure mode from the link flange fracture to fracturing of the web. The results were further confirmed through a number of experiments on long links. In 2016, Pirmoz et al. [93] numerically studied the behavior of extended end-plate link-to-column connections, with rib stiffeners, in contrast to the suggestion of Ghobarah and Ramadan [20, 92]. Although the study did not address issues such as low-cycle fatigue or material fracture, the promising performance of this link- to-column connection was demonstrated.
bqfb | An experimental study was undertaken by Tsai et al. [94] on the behavior of link-to-box column connections in 2000. In these tests, short links were connected to box columns using CJP groove welds at the flanges and either a fully welded shear tab or a CJP groove weld at the link web. Although some of the specimens used the improved weld access hole detail suggested by Mao et al. [95], premature fracture was observed in all connections at the link flange in the vicinity of the groove weld. The urgent need for research on this issue was emphasized. Consequently, an extensive study was initiated at the University of Texas at Austin in the early 2000s [26]. These tests along with those performed previously at the National Taiwan University by Tsai et al. [65, 94] were the first experiments on large-scale link-to-column connections with realistic details. Okazaki et al. [30] tested 12 welded link- to-column specimens considering short, intermediate, and long links with four different connection details using the old loading protocol of AISC 341-02 [68]. Pre-Northridge as well as other moment connections which adhered to the recommendations of FEMA 350 [96] were considered. Recently developed welded moment connections with free flange [97] (Figure 7i) and no access hole (Figure 7j) [98] details were also tested. Except one specimen, all of the tested connections failed due to abrupt fracture of the flange near the groove weld prior to developing the required level of plastic rotation. The performance was inferior for the pre-Northridge and FEMA 350 [96] details which only developed about half of the required Yp. Results proved that the connections which are suitable for MRFs may not necessarily perform well as link-to-column connections. It was concluded that link-to- column connections are prone to brittle failure regardless of the link length ratio and should therefore be avoided until a satisfactory detail is developed.
wwdt | In a subsequent study, Okazaki et al. [33] tested an additional 12 welded link-to-column specimens to investigate the effect of loading history and to study other details such as the all-around fillet weld detail (Figure 7e) and a new reinforced detail (Figure 7k) referred to as the supplemental web doubler connection. The test results seemed inconclusive as regards the effect of the loading protocol. On the other hand, excellent performance was reported for most of the specimens with the fillet welded and the newly proposed supplemental web doubler details. A summary of the experimental results for these two connections reported by Okazaki et al. [38] indicates their high potential for practical applications. Several design and welding details for the all-around fillet weld
mn1r | connection were also outlined by these researchers. A step-by-step design procedure for the supplemental web doubler connection was developed by Hong et al. [99] through a series of nonlinear FE analyses and substantiated by experiments [38].
5vqw | Two numerical studies were conducted recently to propose alternatives for reducing the demand in critical regions of welded link-to-column connections, i.e. at the link flanges in the vicinity of groove welds. Prinz and Richards [100] studied reduced web section links while Berman et al. [101] investigated reduced flange section links. The reduced web section links with perforated webs did not perform well in the simulations while the reduced flange section links were found to be a potential solution, pending testing required for further validation.
meyw | The AISC Seismic Provisions [3] do not require qualification testing for the link-to-column connection of a short link, provided that the connection is reinforced with haunches or other proper details which prevent yielding in the reinforced segment adjacent to the column (e.g. Figure 7l). Although this approach is found to be effective in MRF connections, no research is available at the time which proves the reliable performance of such a reinforced detail specifically in EBF link-to- column connections. The commentary on AISC 341-10 [3] mentions the promising performance of the supplemental web doubler detail proposed by Okazaki et al. [33]; however, it encourages designers to configure EBFs to avoid link-to-column connections entirely. The use of built-up box links in EBFs with link-to-column connections has not been studied explicitly nor addressed by the specifications.
2e62 | 4. Numerical Modeling of Links
75y3 | General FE techniques which model links using shell or solid elements can reasonably simulate the behavior of these members under monotonic and cyclic loadings (e.g. [13, 43, 48, 51, 53, 55, 61, 80, 84, 85, 93, 99-103]), specifically if the strength degradation related with low-cycle fatigue-induced fractures does not need to be captured. However, due to the complexity and computational burden of these methods they are not typically used for nonlinear time-history analysis, and instead, simplified approaches are utilized which model a link through a combination of line elements, nodal constraints,
s2g2 | springs, or plastic hinges. Although the detailed description and evaluation of the latter are out of the scope of this study, a brief outline of each method is provided here for the sake of completeness.
q1q2 | In 1977, Roeder and Popov [4] proposed a sandwich beam model for links where shear was resisted by the web and moment (through uniaxial stresses) by the flanges with bilinear responses. The method was intended to be used for modeling shear yielding links with small end moments. A very simple model was later proposed by Yang [104] in which the shear link behavior was simulated using a truss member with calibrated uniaxial strength. In 1983, a finite element model based on a stress resultant formulation was developed by Hjelmstad and Popov [6] which utilized a moment-shear yield surface. The method was not suitable for link modeling since strain hardening effects were not incorporated. A simplified approach was proposed in 1987 by Whittaker et al. [16] for short links where regular flexural elements with moment hinges were calibrated to exhibit moment capacities corresponding to the nominal shear strength of the link.
cb7r | Ricles and Popov [105, 106] developed an approach in which a link was represented by a linear elastic beam with a nonlinear zero-length hinge at each end. Although the numerical results obtained using this approach were fairly accurate, the calibration and programing of the method was quite complex [107].
68xu | A modeling procedure was developed by Ramadan and Ghobarah [107] on the basis of the theory proposed by Ricles and Popov [105, 106]; however, with simpler end hinges and the ability to be conveniently incorporated into regular analysis programs. The model was calibrated using the results of experiments conducted at the University of California at Berkeley in the 1980s on links constructed from A36 steel (e.g. [6, 15, 19]). The accuracy of the method was demonstrated through a comparison with test results. In 2003, Richards and Uang [67] modified the link model proposed by Ramadan and Ghobarah [107] in order to improve its accuracy in predicting the behavior of links constructed from A992 steel. The proposed element was later used in an extensive parametric study [66, 67].
hd35 | A simplified approach was recently used by Khandelwal et al. [108] in which the behavior of short links was simulated using a rectangular truss system with vertical rigid bars and elastic horizontal bars and a nonlinear diagonal spring.
2zpk | A three element link model consisting of a central beam element and concentrated hinges at the ends was introduced by Rossi and Lombardo [109] in 2007 and extensively used in the numerical studies of Bosco and her colleagues [110-113]. Although suitable for initial analysis, the model was not able to properly capture the cyclic response of links. For instance, non-zero stiffness values were provided by this model even at very large deformations [114]. To overcome these deficiencies, an enhanced model of this element was recently developed by Bosco et al. [114] in which the responses of flexural and shear hinges were defined using the uniaxial material model of Zona and Dall'Asta [115]. The model was separately calibrated for short and long links using a large body of test data [6, 11, 25, 26, 32]. The effectiveness of the approach was demonstrated for short, intermediate, and long links by comparing numerical and test results. It is worth noting that in all of the above-mentioned models the effects of axial force and strength degradation on the nonlinear behavior were neglected.
epu7 | In studies by Malakoutian et al. [116], O'Reilly and Sullivan [60], and Kanvinde et al. [84] the OpenSees [117] analysis platform was utilized where a beam-column element with distributed plasticity and additional independent nonlinear shear springs located at the element ends was used for link modeling. Various different material models were adopted in each of these studies. Moghaddasi B. and Zhang [118] used the beam element of OpenSees [117] with zero-length moment hinges at the ends as well as four parallel translational springs at each end for simulating the behavior of shear links. This method was also used in the numerical study of Dastmalchi [62].
7od1 | Other more sophisticated elements have been developed for modeling steel members with dominant shear yielding behavior, that are also applicable to EBF links. On the basis of the method proposed by Ricles and Popov [105, 106], Kazemi and Erfani [119, 120] developed a model with a combined shear-flexural inner hinge and two rigid beams on its sides. Numerical results were compared to the test data reported by Kasai and Popov [10] to demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed approach. An improved version of this model with an axial-shear-flexural hinge was recently developed by Kazemi and Hoseinzadeh Asl [121]. A mixed-formulation (or force-based) element was proposed by Saritas and Filippou [122] with independent displacement, stress, and strain fields, where the displacement field was based on Timoshenko's beam theory. As a result, shear locking was avoided and mesh refinement was deemed unnecessary. Since the axial-shear-flexural interaction was
