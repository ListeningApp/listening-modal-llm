        "content": "w8ia | Having solved the appropriate flow equations to obtain the dynamical effective potentials we can now solve one hundred eight. Given the dynamical effective potential V it only takes a couple of seconds to obtain the full trajectory of x from some initial position Ci equals Xi to the equilibrium position. For the polynomial potential we initialised the particle far away from the equilibrium position at x equals four. In Fig. nine we show how the average position of the particle changes with time using direct simulation of the Langevin equation four over fifty thousand runs, by numerically solving the\n4vej | F-P equation thirty-four and as calculated by the evolution in the dynamical effective potentials V given using the LPA and WFR methods at Y equals ten. All four trajectories agree to a very high precision.\n8ut1 | In Fig. ten we plot the evolution of x of t for the unequal LJ potential where the particle begins in the smaller well at x equals negative one point eight seven eight and moves towards its equilibrium position. We see as before that the WFR trajectory closely matches the simulated trajectory offering significant improvement over the LPA computation. Note that for this system it was impossible to get convergent numerics for the evolution of the F-P equation thirty-four. This ability of the fRG to capture the non-trivial evolution of average position is also shown in Fig. eleven for the x squared potential plus six bumps slash dips which is a much more complex potential landscape at three different temperatures. Here the LPA trajectory offers improvement over the x squared prediction by converging to the correct equilibrium position and including WFR more closely matches the true simulated trajectory. Lowering the temperature generically decreases the accuracy of the fRG results. It is noteworthy that the fRG is able to reasonably capture these difficult dynamics well in systems where the F-P solution is difficult to obtain.\n6o35 | It is important to note the time advantage offered by the fRG. Solving the fRG flow equations is comparable in computation time to direct simulation while solving the F-P equation thirty-four takes longer than both. However the latter two methods obtain solutions that are only valid for a single initial condition. A huge advantage of the fRG is that once the dynamical effective potential V is obtained it is trivial to solve the EEOM one hundred eight in a couple of seconds for any initial position whereas for both direct numerical simulation of four and solving the F-P equation thirty-four one has to start again from scratch.\n8r63 | C. Evolution of variance of x\nqze0 | For our accelerated trajectories we initialised the particles at the exact same point every time. This means that at t equals zero the probability distribution of the particles had zero variance Var of x equals zero. Using this as our initial\no3m2 | condition we solved numerically the EEOM for the variance one hundred sixteen, derived in appendix B. In Fig. twelve we show how the variance evolves with time for the polynomial potential for Y equals ten. We can see that the LPA closely matches the numerical and F- P evolution until t equals zero point five before departing slightly although it still tends towards the correct equilibrium distribution.\nkro9 | In Fig. thirteen we show how the variance evolves with time for an unequal LJ. As with the one-point function the F-P was unable to give sensible statistics however the LPA is able to very well match the early simulated trajectory even capturing the overshooting of the variance. The WFR on the other hand is better at capturing the late-time decay to equilibrium.\ni438 | Finally in Fig. fourteen we show how the variance evolves for the x squared plus six gaussian bumps slash dips potential at three different temperatures. As before, lowering the temperature decreases accuracy. In Fig. fourteen C the fRG once again clearly captures the overshooting which is a feature of the gaussian bumps' existence; the bare x squared evolution does not capture this behaviour and overall describes the evolution poorly, converging to the wrong equilibrium variance. Again as before the LPA much better describes the early evolution while WFR more accurately describes late time evolution.\nyr7b | D. Comparison with the spectral expansion\n60hk | The above results for the change in the relative performance of LPA plus WFR as temperature is lowered can be interpreted by resorting to the spectral expansion. In section II B we recalled how all observables can be computed in a standard way from the Schr√∂dinger-like, Fokker-Planck equation thirty-four using an expansion in eigenfunctions and eigenenergies. It is straightforward to show\n5djf | that - given our initial conditions considered above - the average position and the two-point function can be expressed as:\nhem5 | P of t equals Chi subscript e q plus the sum from n equals one to infinity of left bracket e to the negative E subscript n t e to the V of x subscript zero divided by Upsilon p subscript n of x subscript zero right bracket times the integral from negative infinity to positive infinity d x x e to the negative V of x divided by Upsilon p subscript n of x left bracket one hundred thirty-one.\nvfd9 | and",
