You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

d6r4 | . Appropriate levels of security can only be discussed in terms of the perceived Risk / Threat
9mrz | . There is no such thing as total elimination of Risk, the best we can aim for is 'As Low As Reasonably Practicable'
pk06 | . Major RM strategies include Avoid, Reduce, Share, Transfer, Retain
7wn9 | 3.2 Self-assessment exercises
wcd0 | Self-assessment 1: Choose an organisation, and outline some of the main functions and responsibilities of the Security Manager within that particular risk environment
caos | Self-assessment 2: Give an example of three situations where a change in the level of Risk Perception has caused a change in the level of security control (for example, being searched at a nightclub, having to show ID to get into an Embassy, having to wear a student ID card to get access to campus buildings).
qrvy | Self-assessment 3: Take one of the examples, and discuss whether, given the perceived level of threat, you think that they have got an appropriate balance between security and freedom, and why you think they have made that decision.
pn9j | Self-assessment 4: Give an example of each of the five security management strategies listed above, and show how the appropriate use of each can add to the overall security of an organisation or operation.
1pmc | 4 Risk Management
5z6q | For any security manager, whatever their role and whatever the size of operation that they are responsible for, there are three fundamental issues that they will be dealing with, and it is likely that the vast majority of their daily work can be clearly classified as belonging in one of those three categories:
yeoh | 1. 'What are the problems that I need to deal with?'
b8hf | 2. 'What should I do about it?'
hntf | 3. 'What do I do if something goes wrong?'
99fo | To put this into more technical terms, we are talking about Risk Assessment, Risk Control and finally Contingency Planning. This module introduces these three basic concepts, and shows how they act as the foundation for all security management operations.
y5r7 | 4.1 Three-Stage Risk Management System
lrry | Stage 1: Risk Assessment
hvhm | The purpose of the Risk Assessment is to take all of the thousands of possible or potential risks that might occur, and to give them some kind of comparative value. This will allow us to decide which of them is more serious, and which need to be actively managed. The truth is, that if we take any simple situation - walking from our home to the train station, or delivering a package from your warehouse to a client, for example - there are literally hundreds of possible scenarios that could be considered as risks, from the road being closed or the tube being disrupted, to a twisted ankle or being mugged, and even a major terrorist attack.
863b | As an example, a risk assessment carried out in a factory might identify realistic possible threats such as workers stealing goods; an electrical breakdown that would stop the production line; a hole in the fence; a phoned-in bomb threat; suspicious activity outside the main gate; a major terrorist attack somewhere nearby, but which would lead to the police putting a cordon around our factory so that no-one could get in, or a breakdown in the access control system.
fj24 | This is the first stage of a Risk Assessment, in that we have Identified Potential Threats. However, that is only the first part of the process, because we then need a way of putting them into some sort of order.
uz3c | The accepted way of doing this is to create a Risk Matrix, based on two measures: Likelihood (the likelihood of an event occurring) and Impact (the disruption that event would have on our operations if it did occur). Both of these measures can range from Low (unlikely, low impact) to High (very likely, high impact) See Figure 4 for two different versions of a risk matrix.
d5bi | Figure 4: Two forms of a Risk Matrix. By using this system, we can give different threats different values based on diffeent combinations of Likelihood and Impact.
ba4l | 10
ffx8 | Figure 5:Risk Zones Within the Risk Matrix
s6su | The Risk Matrix (see figure 5) has been divided into five distinct Risk Zones, based on the Likelihood / Impact values. Each of these areas would identify a different class of problems, which would require different forms of solutions.
y219 | 11
06ht | Figure 6: Characteristics of the Five Risk Zones
v3r2 | Each risk zone would identify a different class of problem, each of which would require a different approach in risk management
nv42 | Stage 2: Risk Control
xags | The purpose of Risk Control is to minimise the likelihood of any identified unwanted event occuring, and minimise the impact of any unwanted event that does occur.
jc47 | Once we have identified the risks and given them a Comparative Risk Value, we can then identify those risks that can be most easily managed through our security systems. For example, if we have identified that the lack of access control means that unauthorised people are walking around our premises, the introduction of a Reception Desk and / or an entry-phone system could be one way of solving that problem.
ko3c | In order to ensure that the most effective Risk Control measures are put in place, each identified threat should lead to the introduction of a specific Security Protocol / Procedure.
xek3 | For example, if you are working in a situation where the possibility of a parcel or letter bomb is considered greater than normal, this would be identified during the risk assessment process. As part of your risk control measures, you would then develop specific security protocols to maximise the likelihood of identifying a letter- bomb, and to minimise the effect if any letter bomb that might be sent. This might involve screening all incoming mail at a separate location away from the main offices. You might also have ensured that all mail-room and reception staff had undergone specific training to teach them how to identify suspicious packages and what to do if they were found. Reception staff would also need to undergo the training in case someone hand-delivered a suspicious package, either themselves or using one of the major logistical companies. If a suspicious package was found, you could then isolate the area whilst a specialist police team was called. As this was identified as a high-likelihood potential threat during your Risk Assessment , you should have developed good relationships with the police units, who would be aware of the threat and may well have taken part in joint-exercises with
bbpr | 12
5zyf | your staff to respond to a suspect package. All of these actions would be developed in response to the initial identification of a high-impact threat.
9own | There have been a number of examples of letter bombs in the UK, and a company might be targeted because it is working in the pharmaceutical industry, or it may be associated with political or national issues that increase the likelihood of attack. In 2007, a single person sent seven letter bombs in the UK to companies associated with DNA testing and various traffic organisations. The Animal Liberation Front have also used letter bombs, as have Arabic organisations targeting both Jewish and Israeli targets, as well as Arab-language newspapers in the UK.
bqfb | A security protocol is a set of guidelines outlining how a person should behave in the event that a specific incident was to occur. Figure 7 provides an example of a security protocol that could be used in the event that a delivery lorry arrived at the front gate, but without the appropriate paperwork.
wwdt | Figure 7: An Example of a Security Protocol
mn1r | This is an example of a Security Protocol if a delivery lorry arrives without the necessary paperwork. The reason it is important to log this in the Incident Book is that this will help identify if there is a pattern of behaviour, and one particular company is regularly sending drivers without the paperwork.
5vqw | The first two stages of any risk management programme, namely Risk Assessment and Risk Control, are designed to prevent an incident occuring. The third stage, Contingency Planning, prepares you to react and respond as effectively as possible when something does happen. In some American risk management models, the difference between the proactive Risk Assessment and Risk Control stages, and the reactive Contingency Planning stage is described as 'Left of Bang' and 'Right of Bang' (see figure 8).
meyw | 13
2e62 | Figure 8: Left of Bang / Right of Bang
75y3 | Stage 3: Contingency Planning
s2g2 | The purpose of Contingency Planning is to allow the security team to regain control of the situation, and return to to normal operational status, as quickly and effectively as possible.
q1q2 | Once an incident has occurred, it is clear that it will have a negative impact on the normal running of the operation, whether it is someone forgetting the key to the front gate, disruption of your normal supply chain, or a water-pipe bursting in the office above, and flooding your whole control room. (Thii s last example is exactly what happened at the main police control room just before the 2012 London Olympics .... ).
cb7r | Some of the issues involved in responding to a 'Right of Bang' situation will be covered in more detail in the Crisis Management module, but it is worthwhile noting that when something does go wrong, your response will almost certainly consist of a mixture of pre-planned options and responses that you create 'on the hoof'. As the nature of the problem becomes clearer, and you gather more information, the effectiveness of the pre-incident preparation will start to kick in. Effective crisis management is based on the ability to manage the transfer of information around a number of different stake-holders, make decisions under pressure, deploy teams and then receive information from them once they have assessed the situation for themselves. There is also the need to deal with Secondary Consequences, that is, the knock-on effects from the initial problem that will in themselves become problems for your incident management team.
68xu | The ability to respond effectively to an unexpected event is, in many ways, the ultimate test of a security manager's effectiveness.
hd35 | 4.2 Summary
2zpk | The role of the Risk Management procedure is to give the security manager the tools to create viable and realistic risk management programmes capable of responding to the thousands of potential incidents that could possibly occur. The truth is that the vast majority of a security manager's time is taken up dealing with the same few situations that occur on a recurring (and often daily) basis. An effective security management programme should be able to identify the predictable normal incidents that can be dealt with using Standard Operating Procedures, those that need a higher level of management input and decision-making, and those that can be classified as crisis and which could potentially impact significantly on the wider organisation and its activities.

g9du | 5 Creating a Safe Organisation
f682 | 'The purpose of security is to create safety, not respond to danger'.
li1k | One of the most effective ways of developing security management systems is to look at how other organisations manage their security programmes, and to learn from how they have managed to balance the various aspects that we have covered in previous sections. This section introduces two organisations that are widely accepted to have developed world class Best Practices for dealing with widely differing threat profiles: one is tasked with managing mass-access but low-threat amusement parks, whilst the other has developed its own security management practices in the face of international terrorism for over forty years. The principles that they have developed to create security management capability across their organisations will be of value for anyone involved in any aspect of security management.
pbea | 5.1 Total Security Management
ccpt | Although the 'Creation of a Safe Organisation' is the ultimate objective of any security manager, there are still many differing (and in some case, conflicting) ideas of how that can be achieved.
0fpw | One of the common models of security management has been 'Threat-Based Management' which was covered in the three-stage Risk Assessment - Risk Control - Contingency Planning model introduced in Section 1.2, which is based on the idea that if you identify all possible threats, and then develop methods ('protocols') to prevent them from happening, you will then have created a safe organisation. The problem is, of course, that you will never run out of possible threats, and the likelihood is that however many threats you think of, the world will throw a new one at you that you hadn't taken into consideration.
dqn8 | However, another method is to approach the problem from the other side, namely by concentrating on creating security as an integral part of the organisation, and then trusting that any potential problem that might become a threat to the organisation will be identified early enough to manage and deal with before it has the opportunity to escalate into an actual danger. One phrase used to describe this approach is 'Total Security Management'. Although TSM was originally coined to describe the management of vertical risk - that is, through the different levels of supply chain management, so that the end-user was not dependent on the effective management of the previous links in the supply chain that were outside of their control, it can be equally used to describe the total control of territory that comes under a security manager's responsibility. In this way, security management can be seen as a proactive measure designed to create safety, rather than a reactive system that responds to risks, threats and dangers only after they have been detected.
cop0 | There are two organisations that are widely recognised to have integrated best-practice security and risk management into every aspect of their wider management operations, one dealing with the issue of normal, daily low impact high-likelihood scenarios, and the other dealing with potentially more serious low-likelihood- high impact threats.
lhkq | The first is Disney World, which has created a self-contained Kingdom within which one of the main selling- points for potential visitors is its safety. Although Disney World is designed to deal with a massive amount of people with the freedom to choose to do a massive amount of different activities, the underlying management system is one based on total control of their territory, so that once you are inside Disney World you are actually experiencing a totally managed experience. The second organization is El Al, the Israeli national airline, which since the first political hijacking of a plane on 21st June 1967 of an El Al plane from Rome to Tel Aviv airport (following the end of the 6-Day War), has maintained security in its airports and planes across the world for 45 years. Despite a couple of notable exceptions, specifically the killing of 26 people in an attack on Lod Airport (now Ben Gurion) in 1972 by members of the Lebanese-trained Japan Red Army, El Al is still considered as perhaps the most effective security management system in the world, and its methodologies are widely accepted as setting the bench-mark for securing mass access public areas. Although Disney World and El Al are seemingly faced with radically different threats, the methods they have devised to manage them are remarkably similar.
