You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

dgcw | It is important to highlight that mammalian OET needs only a few replication cycles for ZGA to reprogram embryonic cells to pluripotency. This contrasts with the time and large number of replication cycles needed for artificial establishment of pluripo- tency in cultured cells [16]. In fact, it has been noted that the number of cell divisions is a key parameter driving epigenetic reprogramming to pluripotency [17]. As mentioned above, other animals (whose development is often deterministic) have multiple cleavages in a short time prior to ZGA while mouse zygotes undergo major ZGA after the first cleavage. Mammalian cell biochemistry is presumably not much different from that of invertebrates. Thus, the "a few days, a few cleavages" mode of OET in mammals appears to be a unique mode of the initiation of development. Only by better understanding the underlying molecular mechanisms can we hope for further improvement in our ability to reprogram cell-fate. Of importance are the replication-dependent and independent chro- matin changes in 1-cell and 2-cell mouse zygotes.
gvwz | 4. Chromatin dynamics during ZGA in mice
sk5m | While there is a complex relationship between chromatin struc- ture, transcription, and post-transcriptional processing, repro- gramming gene expression is a matter of the ability of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) to access promoters, which is based on chromatin structure and available transcription factors. Chromatin is extensively remodeled between the 1-cell and 2-cell stages (reviewed in [18-20]). Importantly, both parental genomes remain separated in female and male pronuclei that do not fuse in the 1- cell zygote. Instead of fusing, nuclear envelopes of pronuclei break down during the first cleavage and embryonic nuclei accommodat- ing both parental genomes form in 2-cell blastomeres. Reviewing
qws8 | in detail the contribution of chromatin to OET is beyond the scope of this work, which will focus just on two key aspects of chromatin structure: (i) the protamine/histone exchange after fertilization, (ii) dynamics of chromatin on the eve of ZGA.
877u | 4.1. Protamine/histone exchange
rzhj | In contrast to the maternal genome, which maintains nucleosome-based chromatin structure with global histone mod- ification patterns similar to those of somatic cells (reviewed in [18]), paternal chromatin undergoes major remodeling because the elementary protein component of the sperm chromatin are protamine molecules. Consequently, paternal histone mod- ifications are essentially erased together with the nucleosomal chromatin structure during spermatogenesis in a process of protamine/histone exchange (reviewed <LATEX>\left. \mathrm { i n } \left[ 2 1 , 2 2 \right] \right) .</LATEX> Importantly, <LATEX>1 - 1 0</LATEX> of histones are retained in the mouse and human sper- matozoa, respectively [23]. These residual histones carry specific modifications and thir retention does not appear random [23]. The H3K4me2 (active) mark was found in promoters of genes involved in spermatogenesis and cellular homeostasis, while the H3K27me3 (repressive) mark was associated with developmental promoters. It was proposed that residual histones contribute to paternal het- erochromatin formation in human zygotes [24]. However, other studies suggested that nucleosome retention is predominantly associated with gene deserts and not developmental promoters (summarized in [25]). Therefore, the significance of nucleosome retention for OET remains unclear.
bfax | Upon fertilization, protamine/histone exchange takes place in reverse in order with help from the histone chaperone HIRA to establish nucleosome chromatin structure of the paternal genome [26]. The consequence of the protamine/histone exchange is that the paternal genome initiates its journey at the beginning of development with "naïve" nucleosome chromatin structures. This correlates with the bulk of initial RNA synthesis in mouse zygotes which takes place in the male pronucleus (Fig. A).
f2y8 | 4.2. Chromatin dynamics
o7qm | Chromatin dynamics is a broadly used term covering changes of covalent modifications of DNA and histones as well as DNA acces- sibility and higher order chromatin organization into chromatin domains (topologically associating domains - TADs). Because this review focuses on transcriptional aspects of the genome activation, it will only highlight selected aspects of chromatin dynamics.
d52l | The most common covalent mammalian DNA modification is 5-methyl cytosine (5mC) (reviewed, for example in [27]). It is a classic epigenetic mark that does not alter DNA sequence, but can carry heritable information (for further reading see [28]). While there is an ongoing debate regarding causes and consequences of DNA methylation with respect to regulation of transcription [27], DNA methylation has been generally associated with transcrip- tional silencing and genome maintenance through repression of parasitic sequences.
qlbb | DNA methylation in the mammalian germline undergoes two reprogramming events, in which existing DNA methylation is largely eliminated (reviewed in [29]). In mouse zygotes, maternal and paternal genomes show two distinct demethylation patterns upon staining with a 5mC-recognizing antibody. The paternal genome rapidly loses 5mC signal (6-8 hours after fertilization) while the maternal genome gradually reduces methylation dur- ing cleavage-stage development [30,31]. The overall loss of DNA methylation is associated with reduction of repressive chromatin. The molecular mechanism of 5mC loss entails oxidation into 5- hydroxymethyl cytosine (5hmC) by TET dioxygenase and base excision repair (reviewed in [32]). Active paternal DNA demethy- lation in the zygote is found in many mammals, but is not entirely conserved [33-35] and is incomplete [36]. Apart from imprinted loci, which retain their parent-of-origin methylation pattern in imprinting control regions, intracisternal A-particle (IAP), an active murine endogenous retrovirus also remains methylated despite global demethylation [37].
