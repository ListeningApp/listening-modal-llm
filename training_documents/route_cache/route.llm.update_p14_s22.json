To our surprise, the presence of MeCN decreased the rate of cycloaddition, and after twenty-four hours, the ratio of triazole-diyne was found to be one to two point two. Only increasing the catalyst loading up to five mole percent CuI(PPh3)3 gave full conversion of iodide.\nnvfy | \nmror | Article\nzlxc | one-B-D-Ribofuranosyl-oneH-[one,two,three]triazole-four-carboxylic Acid Amide (ETCAR) and Its Analogues: Synthesis and Cytotoxic Properties.
