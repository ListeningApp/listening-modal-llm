        "content": "5vqw | Greater information dissemination about emerging practice activities and outcomes through electronic and other media could address the sense of isolation voiced by practitioners in this study. More frequent topic-specific articles in the professional literature could assist the profession in further understanding the new directions in practice and models of service delivery. While the AOTA SISs and associated quarterly newsletters address a breadth of practice areas, a specific SIS for emerging or community-based practices may allow therapists to more easily network and collaborate about issues specific to developing and delivering services in those practice settings.\nmeyw | Regulatory bodies and policy makers are in the position to facilitate or impede emerging practice and its future development through state practice acts that define and regulate the scope of occupational therapy practice. As such, members of regulatory boards, state professional associations, and agencies should be key participants in the decisions that will shape the future role of emerging practice.\n2e62 | Finally, the study results clearly articulated the need for the profession and its members to support and conduct timely research to document the efficacy of occupational therapy services in emerging practice. The research findings would add to the body of evidence\n75y3 | supporting the value and effectiveness of occupational therapy practice and services.\ns2g2 | STUDY LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE RESEARCH DIRECTIONS\nq1q2 | The results of the survey painted a general picture of the nature of emerging practice. However, the study included a number of limitations that potentially affected the validity and applicability of the data. The low response rate and the use of convenience and purposeful sampling techniques may influence the validity of the results. In addition, the decision by the researchers not to provide a definition of emerging practice may have introduced interpretation bias among the survey respondents. This was a preliminary and pilot study of emerging practice and consequently cannot be construed to reflect the opinions or beliefs of the larger professional body. Further study with a larger sample size is needed to ascertain the validity of the results.\ncb7r | In anticipation of the profession's one hundred year anniversary, the Centennial Vision articulates a vision and plan for occupational therapy's future. Emerging practice is an integral component of this future vision. As such, the results of this study highlight the need for ongoing dialogue and further investigation of emerging practice, its future role, and strategies to support the development and provision of occupational therapy services in these new and expanded settings. Last, evidence-based research is essential to substantiate the efficacy of emerging practice and the profession's evolving domain.",
