You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

htm9 | That Willoughby falsified intelligence in order to please MacArthur is supported by good evidence from the X Corps and the Eighth Army staff officers. Almond's deputy chief of staff, Colonel William J. McCaffrey, who had served under Almond as the chief of staff of the 92nd Division in WWII, believed that Willoughby "was more interested in staying in MacArthur's good graces than in rendering objective assessment of the available facts" and that this was particularly the case regarding the estimate of the magnitude of the Chinese threat. Almond's G-3, Jack Chiles, remembered: "MacArthur did not want the Chinese to enter the war in Korea. Anything MacArthur wanted, Willoughby produced intelligence for In this case, Willoughby falsified the intelligence reports He should have gone to jail."24 Almond's G-2, Colonel James H. Polk, wrote that "we had the dope but old CAW (Willoughby) bowed to the superior wisdom of his beloved boss and didn't fight him as a good staff officer should."205
8hul | In the Eighth Army, the situation was more complex. While Walker was not considered by MacArthur and his inner circle as "one of 'them,' " his G-2, Lieutenant Colonel James Tarkenton, had been nominated for his position by Willoughby, despite his lack of combat experience, and he owed Willoughby his loyalty. But Tarkenton had done a good job in the Pusan perimeter and won Walker's trust.200 Nevertheless, when it came to estimating the magnitude of the Chinese threat, Tarkenton followed Willoughby's methodology and estimates. This was not an innocent mistake. The Eighth Army's G-3, Colonel John Dabney, defined Tarkenton's estimates as "unduly influenced" and "colored" 4 by Willoughby's views. William Train, Dabney's senior planner who estimated the Chinese force as far greater than the official estimate, explained Tarkenton's motivation: "It was MacArthur's Command, not a US Army command, and if you crossed Willoughby it was not just a ticket out of there, it was probably a ticket straight out of your career."2Train did not mince words about Willoughby's behavior: "What he was doing in those days was fighting against the truth, trying to keep it from going from lower levels to higher ones where it would have to be acted on. "209

ym66 | The impact of the Bataan Gang mentality was not limited to intelligence estimates alone. Both Walker and Almond received the same intelligence reports, yet their effect on them was very different. Walker, an
l0a3 | experienced general, considered by Gen. Patton "the most eager to attack,"was aware of the lack of solid information concerning the enemy he faced. His G-2 estimated it at 27,000 CPVF and 23,000 KPA soldiers, altogether about 50,000 troops." Although the Eighth Army was more than 100,000 strong and enjoyed superior firepower and mobility, and despite pressure from MacArthur, Walker avoided pushing his 212
u8nw | commanders to move too fast and cautioned them of potential dangers.'
l2v9 | The commander of the X Corps, as a professional US Army study shows, acted differently: "General Almond and his staff had blindly followed the guidance of the supremely optimistic Far Eastern Command, which seemed to ignore or discount sign after sign of possible massive Chinese intervention. Almond directed his units to race to the Yalu without regard to their flanks or to the location of any enemy forces."213 Whether it was Almond's personal fault or his and his staff officers' is a matter of controversy. Post factum, his chief of staff wrote that the X Corps plan was "insane." Almond's deputy chief of staff explained it, "General Almond was not about to protest an order from Gen. MacArthur. After all, everyone said Inchon wouldn't work."214 Almond's Bataan Gang outlook made the X Corps offensive that started on November 27 "the most ill-advised and unfortunate operation of the Korean War."215 Others, who did not share Almond's

78r8 | p. 170 attitude, like Maj. Gen. Oliver P. Smith, the commander of the First 4 Marines Division, showed it. Almond ordered him to widely disperse his forces without considering the difficulties involved in occupying, under difficult weather conditions, a thousand square miles area of rugged mountains terrain, possibly defended by the Chinese army. Smith tried to resist the order as much as he could, and took precautionary measures to limit its potential damage.
320g | Almond had a reputation for being an aggressive commander but Marines commanders are known to be aggressive too and Smith was no exception. Nevertheless, he took into account the reality of the battlefield and thus saved his division from a disaster. Conspicuously, Almond's optimistic estimate did not change even after the Chinese counteroffensive had begun. On November 28, he told the officers of an isolated task force: "The enemy who is delaying you for the moment is nothing more than remnants of Chinese divisions fleeing north. We're still attacking and we're going all the way to the Yalu. Don't let a bunch of Chinese laundrymen stop you."2" This "Gung ho" manner was unusual by any professional standard, but Almond was not a standard officer. He was a typical product of the Bataan Gang mentality, an officer who's "greatest weakness as a commander in Korea was his conviction that MacArthur could do no wrong."217 In Halberstam's words, Almond "was MacArthur's boy, the true loyalist, headstrong and arrogant, determined to make the reality of the Korean battlefield fit the dreams of the commander in the Dai Ichi [Macarthur's headquarters in Tokyo]."218
tp8g | The Bataan Gang mentality penetrated also lower ranks. Maj. general John Coulter served under MacArthur in World War I, and MacArthur brought him to the Far East to command the US Seventh Division in 1948. After taking two more positions, he returned to the USA. When the war started, MacArthur brought him back to command the First Corps of the Eighth Army but actually to be his man in Walker's headquarters. Walker, who was not too impressed by Coulter's qualities as a battlefield commander, nominated him to command the IX Corps, which had only become operational in September. When the Chinese offensive of late November struck his forces, Coulter refused to grasp that a new reality thwarted MacArthur's intention to swiftly end the war. As Halberstam put it, his orders reflected "the vast distance that by then existed between the reality on the battlefield and the illusions that existed in Tokyo."2 4

s2v1 | Important as it was, the Bataan Gang mentality was not created in a vacuum, but according to the preferences of senior officers in the FEC. The intelligence failure of late November, moreover, was ripened in an atmosphere that was created by human beings. And to fully comprehend the sources of this failure, we have to understand certain aspects of the minds of the persons most responsible for this fiasco.
jkp9 | iii. The individual level
z8tt | Two prominent figures stand out in the process that led to the failure of November 1950. One is MacArthur, who inspired the Bataan Boys' mentality. He also exhibited groundless optimism concerning the magnitude of the Chinese threat and took unnecessary risks in pressuring his commanders to end the war by Christmas. The second is Willoughby, his G-2 beginning 1941 and the officer most closely identified with this fiasco.
9g22 | MacArthur: paranoia and narcissism

7um8 | Until his April 1951 dismissal, the Korean War was MacArthur's war. Summarizing its first six months, Blair concluded that it had not been fought well, and that MacArthur was responsible for the main mistakes,
uow2 | grossly underestimating the professionalism of the KPA; the inhumane piecemeal commitment of the untrained Eighth Army; the shift of X Corps after Inchon from hot pursuit to a meaningless amphibious landing at Wonsan; scandalously underestimating CCF strength and intentions; the foolish "race" to the Yalu in both the Eighth Army and the X Corps sectors. As a result 60,000 American soldiers and Marines and probably five times that number of ROK soldiers were dead, wounded, or missing. - 220
iat7 | The most critical mistakes ("scandalous" and "foolish") involved MacArthur's mistaken estimate of the magnitude of the Chinese threat in November. In part, it was the outcome of the Bataan Gang mentality that provided him with information and estimation please. But it was MacArthur, primarily his paranoia and narcissistic personality, who created this atmosphere, and we will elaborate on this subject. We will also present two additional patterns of behavior which he exhibited prior to the November fiasco: an overly optimistic estimate of the balance of forces before the outbreak of 4 war; and a drive, motivated by political and operational considerations, to end every confrontation as soon as possible.
ywwr | p. 172
0i6j | Although many biographies discuss the relationship between MacArthur's strategy and personality, only a few attempted to analyze his strategy as a function of his personality""" and none did it within the Korean War context. Manchester provides a good short description of this personality:
87cq | He was a great thundering paradox of man, noble and ignoble, inspiring and outrageous, arrogant and shy, the best of men and the worst of men, the most protean, most ridiculous, and most sublime. No more baffling, exasperating soldier ever wore a uniform. Flamboyant, imperious, and apocalyptic, he carried the plumage of a flamingo, could not acknowledge errors, and tried to cover up his mistakes with sly, childish tricks.222
0qs3 | Manchester specifically relates MacArthur's paranoia as a salient component of his psyche:
z8f7 | The General's paranoia never lay more than a fraction of a millimeter below the surface of his thoughts. "They" had conspired against his father, "they" had refused to decorate him after his Vera Cruz adventure, "they" had undercut him in France in 1918, "they" had forced him into retirement in 1937, "they" had refused to reinforce his defense of Corregidor and Bataan, "they" had sent an inferior B-17 to Cagayan, and "they" were waiting even now to thwart him again.223
7w7j | The prime suspect of MacArthur's envy and paranoia was George Marshall, who was the same age and had performed brilliantly as a staff officer under Pershing in WWI. Marshall was probably one of the "deskbound men who envied and resented" MacArthur as "a fighting officer."224 When MacArthur became chief of staff, p. 173 he exiled Marshal to run the Illinois 4 National Guard. No wonder then that during the war MacArthur, now serving under Marshall, who had become chief of staff in 1939, believed that Marshall and others plotted
51vd | against him. Sheer classic projection may have added to his belief, whereby he assumed that others would behave toward him as he would toward them if their situations were reversed. He even expressed the belief that the "Germany First" policy formulated by Roosevelt and Churchill was a conspiracy to deny him the resources he needed to win the war in the Pacific. In addition to Marshall, who was "working against him at all times," he also blamed the Supreme Allied Commander in Europe, Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower. The two had had a stormy relationship since Eisenhower ended his job as MacArthur's assistant in the Philippines in the late 1930s, and MacArthur blamed him for undermining his work and "stealing publicity." Gen. Robert Eichelberger, a corps commander under MacArthur, noted when describing this paranoid way of thinking that stealing "any publicity from MacArthur was like driving a dagger into his heart."225

n1wo | MacArthur's paranoia did not fade away after 1945. During the Korean War he was certain that the chief of staff, Omar Bradley, hated him since he had rejected Bradely as a senior commander when planning the invasion of Japan in 1945.22 And even his 1964 memoirs were colored by his paranoia. Twenty-two years after the decision to prevent the release of a statement he prepared on Japanese atrocities in the "Bataan Death March," he wrote, "Perhaps the Administration, which was committed to a Europe-first effort, feared American public opinions would demand a greater reaction against Japan."227
5bq3 | MacArthur's paranoia can be linked to his deep sense of family heritage, particularly his father's career." . 228 He was born into an aristocratic family. His father was the youngest colonel in the Union Army during the Civil War and occupied the Philippines in 1900. Afterward, however, despite being the highest ranking officer in the Army, his military career came to a dead end (for which his son blamed others). MacArthur's mother lived through his success-she spent four years in West Point watching over him during his studies in the military academy-and she "sent him out not merely to avenge the wrongs done to his father but to compete against him."229 L
ezla | p. 174
rsbu | Douglas MacArthur's need to be worthy of the heritage of his family and redeem his father's end of career constitutes a partial explanation for his narcissist personality: his grandiose sense of self-importance, conviction of his rightness, sensitivity to criticism and demand for admiration, tendency to get into power struggles, and his desire to take credit for himself and place blame on others.250 Narcissism in general, and paranoia in particular, explain his need to form a group of loyal and admiring officers-some of whom were highly talented-who would provide the recognition he so desperately craved, particularly during the difficult years in the Philippines and Australia. In November 1950, this mentality provided support that was needed to bridge the gap between his goal of ending the war by Christmas and the reality of the battlefield.
magd | In addition to narcissism and paranoia, other patterns help to understand MacArthur's conduct on the eve of the fiasco. One was his constant unrealistic optimism concerning the balance of forces prior to the breakout of war, and disregard of his Asian enemies. In 1939, he doubted if "an enemy could concentrate superior forces at any vital Philippine area" and estimated that a Japanese blockade would be "practically unfeasible without the tacit agreement of the other nations surrounding the Pacific." On the eve of the attack on Pearl Harbor, he was certain that war would not start before spring. When it started, he defined the Japanese blockade on the Philippines as a "paper blockade." When the Korean War started, he was contemptuous of the fighting capabilities of the KPA, and despite their initial military achievements did not change his mind, believing that if he could put the First Cav Division into Korea, "those fellows scuddle up to the Manchurian border so quick, you would see no more of them."232
