You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

v3r2 | According to Siles et al. [18], non-enhanced MR cholecystopancreatography visualization of the entire extrahe- patic bile duct system, including confluence of intrahepatic bile ducts, is possible but was only observed in 62.5% of neonates and infants younger that 3 months in a normal phys- iological state. For infants younger than 30 days, this result dropped to 50%. This compromises the ability of MR cholecystopancreatography to exclude the diagnosis of biliary atresia at the optimal time for surgery.
nv42 | Hepatobiliary scintigraphy
xags | Hepatobiliary scintigraphy uses Tc-99 m-labelled iminodiacetic acid derivatives as a radiotracer. Patient preparation for imaging should include phenobarbital to activate liver excretory en- zymes and increase bile flow for a minimum of 3-5 days before the hepatobiliary imaging study. Scintigraphy can exclude bil- iary atresia by demonstrating transit of radiotracer into the bow- el (Fig. 4). Cholescintigraphic images should be acquired at multiple times up to 24 h.
jc47 | A meta-analysis by Kianifar et al. [26] included 81 studies (age range: 4-180 days) reporting a sensitivity of 99.3% (range: 98.3-99.8%), a specificity of 75.1% (range: 72.2- 77.9%), a positive likelihood ratio of 3.19 (range: 2.47- 4.11), a negative likelihood ratio of 0.07 (range: 0.04-0.11) and a diagnostic odds ratio of 60.1 (range: <LATEX>\left. 3 1 . 6 - 1 1 4 . 3 \right) .</LATEX> The negative predictive value was high, about 100%, but the pos- itive predictive value was lower and false-positive results occured in some patients with severe medical cholestasis. In hepatobiliary scintigraphy studies, renal or urinary excretion of the tracer could be confused with transit of radiotracer into the bowel and lead to a false-negative result.
ko3c | Percutaneous cholecysto-cholangiography
xek3 | Seven percutaneous cholecysto-cholangiography studies were identified for initial review. Four [27-30] were identified as
bbpr | relevant. Percutaneous cholecysto-cholangiography is a US- guided technique performed under general anaesthesia or seda- tion with local anaesthesia. A 22- to 25-gauge needle is used to puncture the gallbladder through the liver parenchyma and in- ject a nonionic contrast medium to obtain a cholangiogram. Antibiotic prophylaxis is usually given. Bile aspiration, when the gallbladder is distended enough, allows for sampling of bile for biochemical studies in suspected genetic cholestasis. The decision to perform a percutaneous cholecysto- cholangiography is informed by case-by-case discussion. If the gallbladder is visible, one may try to puncture it, while acknowledging the risk involved. Lee et al. [28] reported no complications related to percutaneous cholecysto- cholangiography and obtained a technical success in 18 of 22 procedures (age range: 1-138 days, mean age: 49.7 days). Percutaneous cholecysto-cholangiography has a spatial resolu- tion higher than MR cholecystopancreatography and allows observation of the direct progression of the iodine in the biliary tract. It is useful to confirm or rule out biliary atresia in difficult cases. The absence of retrograde filling of contrast in the intrahepatic bile ducts is highly suggestive of biliary atresia. In some cases of biliary atresia, there is a very thin and irregular opacification of the intrahepatic bile ducts and no opacification of the duodenum. In non-biliary atresia cholestasis, opacification of intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts and duodenum is always seen. Some typical patterns may allow differential diagnosis, such as in neonatal sclerosing cholangitis (Fig. 5). Percutaneous cholecysto-cholangiography can
5zyf | determine the type of biliary atresia and gallbladder patency. Zhou et al. [27] proposed percutaneous cholecysto- cholangiography by using contrast-enhanced US in infants suspected of having biliary atresia with equivocal US findings and a gallbladder longer than 1.5 cm. This is an interesting pilot study in which biliary atresia was diagnosed in four patients and excluded in five patients without procedural-related complica- tions. However, further studies are necessary to evaluate the diagnostic performance and limits of this technique. It is note- worthy that the technique can be performed only when a gall- bladder lumen is accessible.
9own | Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography
bqfb | Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was per- formed to evaluate the patency of the biliary tree in the diagnosis of biliary atresia in some tertiary referral centres. Full delineation of the biliary system excludes biliary atre- sia. Another sign includes the absence or presence of bile at the site of the papilla. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography requires specific infant endos- copy equipment not available at many centres; it is usually performed under general anaesthesia. The endoscopic ret- rograde cholangiopancreatography sensitivity ranges be- tween 86% and 100%, with the specificity 79-94%, posi- tive predictive value 88-96% and negative predictive val- ue 100% (age range: 19-175 days) [31-34].
wwdt | Percutaneous liver biopsy
mn1r | Percutaneous liver biopsy is performed in most paediatric cen- tres during the diagnostic work-up of infants with cholestatic jaundice. The diagnosis is challenging because the histological features of many disorders causing infantile cholestasis overlap, evolve and vary with age. The diagnostic accuracy of liver biopsy for biliary atresia diagnosis is between 60% and 95% [10, 35-39]. We have analyzed studies with liver biopsy as the only method for diagnosis. The earliest histological changes of biliary atresia might be relatively nonspecific, and biopsies per- formed too early in the course of the disease might result in a false-negative result [8, 9]. In a meta-analysis performed by Wang et al. [40] including 38 papers, the sensitivities and spec- ificities of individual studies varied from 90% to 100% and from 84% to 100%, respectively (age range: 12-120 days). The percutaneous liver biopsy showed pooled sensitivity of 98% (95% confidence interval [CI] 96-99%), specificity of 93% (95% CI 89-95%), positive likelihood ratio of 12.09 (95% CI 8.28-17.63) and negative likelihood ratio of 0.03 (95% CI 0.02-0.06). The positive predictive value was 93.0% and the negative predictive value was 97.7%.
