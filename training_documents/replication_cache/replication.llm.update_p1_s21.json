A major target for understanding and controlling these viruses is their genome replication, which occurs in virus-induced membrane vesicles that organize replication steps and protect double-stranded RNA intermediates from innate immune recognition. The structure of these complexes has been greatly illuminated by recent cryo-electron microscope tomography studies with several viruses. One key finding in diverse systems is the organization of crucial viral RNA replication factors in multimeric rings or crowns that among other functions serve as exit channels gating release of progeny genomes to the cytosol for translation and encapsidation. Emerging results suggest that these crowns serve additional important purposes in replication complex assembly, function, and interaction with downstream processes such as encapsidation. The findings provide insights into viral function and evolution and new bases for understanding, controlling, and engineering positive-strand RNA viruses.\n7w7j | One. INTRODUCTION\n51vd | Positive-strand RNA viruses are one of the most numerous and devastating viral classes. Their members include severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus two, cause of the ongoing coronavirus disease twenty-nineteen pandemic, the tumor-inducing hepatitis C virus, paralytic poliovirus, lethal encephalitis and hemorrhagic fever viruses, and many other human, animal, and plant pathogens. In parallel, these viruses have demonstrated considerable potential for beneficial uses in medicine, biotechnology, and nanotechnology through their abilities to deliver, dramatically amplify, express, and evolve selected genes and RNA elements. The practical potential of such RNA pathways has become even more apparent with the recent successes of messenger RNA vaccines and increasingly numerous and powerful RNA-based tools for gene editing and regulation.\nbaj1 | Better understanding of replication and pathogenesis is crucial to positive RNA virus control, to predicting the emergence of future dangerous viral species and variants, and to improving engineered uses of viral derivatives and pathways. One essential target for understanding, controlling, and employing positive RNA viruses is their genome replication. Such RNA replication invariably uses most of the viral genome coding capacity-for example, greater than seventy percent of the SARS-CoV-2 genome-and thus is arguably the main job of the virus. This positive RNA virus genome replication proceeds solely through RNA intermediates, without any natural DNA forms. In eukaryotes, these processes occur in virus-induced, membrane-bounded mini-organelles that organize RNA replication steps and protect double-stranded RNA replication intermediates from innate immune recognition. Two classes of such RNA replication complexes are known. The first, designated spherules, are approximately fifty- to one hundred fifty-nanometer invaginations of an intracellular membrane, whose interior remains connected to the cytosol by a necked channel. The second class consists of approximately two hundred- to three hundred-nanometer double-membrane vesicles or DMVs, which lack any membranous opening to the cytosol.\nn1wo | Prior ultrastructural knowledge of positive RNA virus replication complexes had been limited to their membrane architecture. Recent application of cryo-electron microscopy and complementary approaches to a few pioneer systems has greatly advanced understanding of these complexes and their functions by revealing the location, organization, and interactions of viral RNA templates, RNA replication proteins, and other relevant viral and cellular factors. In this review we summarize these and other recent breakthroughs in positive RNA virus genome replication and their implications for viral function and control. Major findings include that, in addition to enzymatic roles in viral RNA synthesis, positive RNA virus replication proteins have key structural roles in replication complexes. For both spherule and double-membrane vesicle replication complexes, these viral proteins form ringed complexes or crowns that among other functions serve as cytosolic exit channels for progeny positive RNA products. As outlined below, such crowns appear to represent a crucial nexus for many infection steps, from initial recruitment of RNA replication factors and templates through successive RNA replication functions, post-translational maturation steps, encapsidation, and host innate immune interactions. Ongoing analysis of these crowns promises to provide further valuable insights regarding replication complex structure, operation, assembly, and evolution.\n5bq3 | Two. SPHERULE RNA REPLICATION COMPLEXES\nezla | Below we introduce some general replication complex principles and emerging specifics of replication complexes employing spherule invaginations as RNA replication compartments, using several of the best-characterized examples among the many positive RNA viruses that employ this style of replication complex.\nrsbu | Two point one. Nodaviruses\nmagd | Nodaviridae infect vertebrates or invertebrates including insects and nematodes. Their genomes and spherule replication complexes bear similarities to the plant-infecting Tombusviridae. The associated nodavirus-tombusvirus clade was recently substantially expanded by viruses discovered through large-scale sequencing. Nodaviruses encode a single, highly multifunctional RNA replication factor, protein A, approximately one thousand amino acids, that contains RNA methyltransferase/capping, membrane association, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and multiple self-interaction domains. Advanced sequence comparisons show that protein A embodies three of the four domains conserved across the RNA replication proteins of the large alphavirus superfamily. In keeping with such expanding parallels, findings on nodavirus RNA replication and replication complexes often have provided precedents relevant to many positive RNA viruses.\ntb74 | Flock house virus is a particularly well-studied nodavirus and an increasingly advanced model for positive RNA virus genome replication and other processes. While Flock house virus virions are\n8l69 | only infectious to insect cells, Flock house virus RNA replication, transcription, and virion assembly have been reproduced in all eukaryotic cells tested to date, including mammalian, plant, fungal, and nematode cells. Flock house virus thus provides a simple, well-characterized system for RNA-dependent RNA amplification in diverse cells, which as noted above could have many practical applications.\n1jyv | Two point one point one. Ultrastructure of nodavirus spherule RNA replication complexes. Nodavirus RNA replication occurs in spherular membrane invaginations on host mitochondria. Protein A is targeted to the outer mitochondrial membrane by an N-proximal\nolce | mitochondrial transmembrane domain and further interacts with that membrane through sequences in its Iceberg region. This nodavirus Iceberg region has parallels to alphavirus RNA replication proteins in predicted structure and in primary sequence position relative to flanking protein domains, and is defined as a relatively large conserved structural extension to the capping enzyme core, reminiscent of the submerged part of an iceberg. Protein A also recruits Flock house virus genomic RNA templates to the outer mitochondrial membrane by interaction of its RNA-dependent RNA polymerase domain with cis signals that in Flock house virus genomic RNA one reside in nucleotides sixty-eight to two hundred five. In a process closely linked to RNA synthesis from such templates, protein A then induces invagination of the characteristic approximately sixty- to seventy-nanometer spherule vesicles of its replication complexes.",
