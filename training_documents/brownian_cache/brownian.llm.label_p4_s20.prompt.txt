You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

xnth | <LATEX>\det \mathrm { M } = \int \mathcal{D} c \mathcal{D} \bar { c } \exp \left[ \int \mathrm { d } t \bar { c } \left( \partial _ { t } + V _ { , x x } \right) c \right]</LATEX> (20)
vafm | The determination of <LATEX>\det \mathrm { M }</LATEX> then requires appropriate boundary conditions for <LATEX>\bar { c }</LATEX> and c, which are
2zmw | <LATEX>c \left( t _ { \mathrm { i n } } \right) = 0 , \quad \bar { c } \left( t _ { \mathrm { f } } \right) = 0 .</LATEX> (21)
bf9k | Other choices are possible but lead to determinant val- ues that are different from (19), corresponding to non- causal boundary conditions for the stochastic problem. The boundary condition (21) is implied by the discretised form of the path integral, see [23]. Its appropriateness is verified by direct computation in Appendix <LATEX>\mathrm { C } .</LATEX> The dis- cretised path integral can also be consulted to infer that we must further impose
otkr | <LATEX>\widetilde { x } \left( t _ { \mathrm { f } } \right) = 0 .</LATEX> (22)
ibgs | Although introducing <LATEX>c</LATEX> and <LATEX>\bar { c }</LATEX> is not strictly necessary, it pays to keep the determinant expressed in this form since, as we see below, it allows us to conveniently ex- press hidden symmetries of the resulting action. Insert- ing equations (16) & (20) into (15) we obtain:
colo | (23)
d6r4 | <LATEX>\mathcal{P} \left( x _ { f } | x _ { i } \right) = \int \mathcal{D} \eta \mathcal{D} x \mathcal{D} \widetilde { x } \mathcal{D} c \mathcal{D} \bar { c }</LATEX> <LATEX>\exp \left[ \int \mathrm { d } t \left\{ - \frac { \eta ^ { 2 } } { 2 \Upsilon } + i \widetilde { x } \left( \dot { x } + V _ { , x } - \eta \right) \right. \right.</LATEX> <LATEX>\left. \left. + \bar { c } \left( \partial _ { t } + V _ { , x x } \right) c \right\} \right]</LATEX> We can now trivially perform the gaussian integral over <LATEX>\eta</LATEX> to obtain the path integral in terms of the Brownian Motion (BM) action
9mrz | <LATEX>\mathcal{S} _ { B M } \left( x , \widetilde { x } , \bar { c } , c \right) :</LATEX> <LATEX>\mathcal{P} \left( x _ { f } | x _ { i } \right) = \int \mathcal{D} x \mathcal{D} \widetilde { x } \mathcal{D} c \mathcal{D} \bar { c } \exp \left[ - \mathcal{S} _ { B M } \left( x , \widetilde { x } , \bar { c } , c \right) \right]</LATEX> <LATEX>\mathcal{S} _ { B M } \left( x , \widetilde { x } , \bar { c } , c \right) = \int d t \left[ \frac { \Upsilon } { 2 } \widetilde { x } ^ { 2 } - i \widetilde { x } \left( \dot { x } + V _ { , x } \right) \right.</LATEX> (24)
pk06 | <LATEX>\left. - \bar { c } \left( \partial _ { t } + V _ { , x x } \right) c \right]</LATEX> (25)
7wn9 | Computing this path integral, which henceforth shall be called the Brownian Path Integral (BPI), without resort- ing to some approximation is in general impossible an- alytically. Instead, we will be using numerical solutions to the fRG flow equations to compute it in the <LATEX>\mathrm { L P A } +</LATEX> WFR approximations.
wcd0 | Redefining our fields as :
caos | x(t) = Vr 6(t) V(x) = TW(y)
qrvy | õ = Vr 1 (φ-F) čc = ipp
pn9j | (26)
1pmc | we obtain
5z6q | SBM[y, F, p,p] = [W(Pf) - W(Pi)] + SsusY (27) where
yeoh | SsusY [p, È, p, p] = |dt 62 + F2 + iFW,6(6) - ip(Ot + W,44(y))p (28)
b8hf | Action (28) describes the dynamics of Euclidean, or imaginary time, Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics where p & p are the fermionic fields and y & F are the bosonic fields [16]. The same action also describes Brownian motion and the BM action is equivalent to the SUSY QM one up to a factor depending on the initial and final positions xi & xf; these terms can be simply taken outside the path integral as an exponential prefactor.
hntf | Variation of Ssusy with respect to F yields its "equa- tion of motion" F = - iW, which when substituted back into Ssusy yields the "on mass-shell" action
99fo | SOM (, P, P] = | dt 2 62 + {W., 2 - ip(0t + W,pp)p
y5r7 | (29)
lrry | We will keep working with the auxiliary field F and (28) as it allows for the symmetry transformations to take on a simpler form, linear in all fields.
hvhm | It is illuminating to express the above action in terms of the original dimensional variables and perform the in- tegration over p and p, leading to the alternative form of the term stemming from the determinant:
863b | SOM [x] = dt 2Dm små2 + 2mV,2 - DmEV,ET L (30)
fj24 | Note that 2Dm has the dimensions of action and there- fore plays in the thermal problem a role analogous to h in quantum mechanics - see also section II B in this respect. Unlike h of course, it can be varied by chang- ing the temperature, therefore controlling the strength of fluctuations.
uz3c | B. The Fokker-Planck equation and the spectral expansion
d5bi | Before moving on to the fRG we outline the more stan- dard procedure as to how the on-mass shell action (30) can be obtained from the Fokker-Planck equation which resembles a Euclidean Schrödinger equation. We will see later - in section VIID - that the spectral expansion method outlined here confirms the validity of the fRG approach at moderate to high temperatures.
ba4l | Instead of working with the Langevin equation directly once can deal with the probability distribution of posi- tion:
ffx8 | P(x,t) = (8(x-In)) (31)
s6su | where In is the solution to (4) for a given noise function n (i.e. a specific particle trajectory). It can be shown that this evolves according to the following PDE:
y219 | @P(x,t) Ot =Oz(P(x, t)dzV) + 20x2P(x,t)
06ht | (32) which is known as the Fokker-Planck (F-P) equation. It is usually more useful however to rescale the PDF like so: P(x,t) = e-V/IP(x,t) (33) This leads to the F-P equation taking the form:
v3r2 | 2 TOP(x,t) Ot
nv42 | Υ 2 022P(x,t) + ŪP(x,t) (34)
xags | 2 (35)
jc47 | which resembles a Euclidean Schrödinger equation with r/2 playing the role of h in controlling the fluctuation amplitude, as one might expect.
ko3c | Equation (34) can be solved in terms of a spectral ex- pansion (see e.g. [2, 24]). Writing
xek3 | P(x,t) = cnPn (x)e-Ent n=0
bbpr | (36)
5zyf | we find that pn satisfy the corresponding, time indepen- dent Euclidean Schrödinger equation
9own | 1 2 (V,z)2 Υ V,xx Pn = EnPn
bqfb | (37)
wwdt | The lowest eigenfunction with E0 = 0 is Po(x) =Ne-V(x)/T
mn1r | (38) corresponding to the equilibrium distribution Peq(x) = Po (x)2. The Pn(x) eigenfunctions are complete and or- thonormal
5vqw | [ dx pn(x) Pm (x) = 8mn
meyw | (39)
2e62 | > Pn (x)Pn (x0) = 8(x - x0) n=1
75y3 | (40)
s2g2 | The conditional probability, a quantity akin to the evolu- tion operator or propagator in quantum mechanics, can be expressed in terms of the spectral expansion as
q1q2 | <LATEX>\widetilde { P } \left( x , t | x _ { 0 } , 0 \right) = \sum _ { n = 0 } ^ { \infty } p _ { n } \left( x \right) p _ { n } \left( x _ { 0 } \right) e ^ { - E _ { n } t }</LATEX> <LATEX>P \left( x , t | x _ { 0 } , 0 \right) = e ^ { - V \left( x \right) / \Upsilon } \widetilde { P } \left( x , t | x _ { 0 } , 0 \right) e ^ { + V \left( x _ { 0 } \right) / \Upsilon }</LATEX> (41) (42)
cb7r | Any correlation function can then be expressed by using (42). An economic notation can be achieved by using Dirac bra-ket notation in terms of which e.g.
68xu | <LATEX>\widetilde { P } \left( t , 0 \right) = \sum _ { n = 0 } ^ { \infty } | n \rangle e ^ { - E _ { n } t } \langle n |</LATEX> (43)
hd35 | Correlation functions can then be expressed in the spec- tral expansion as:
2zpk | <LATEX>\langle f \left( x \left( t \right) \right) g \left( x \left( 0 \right) \right) \rangle = \sum _ { n = 0 } ^ { \infty } \langle 0 | f | n \rangle e ^ { - E _ { n } t } \langle n | g | \mathrm { i n } \rangle</LATEX> ( (4)
epu7 | where, explicitly
7od1 | <LATEX>\langle 0 | f | n \rangle = \int _ { - \infty } ^ { \infty } d x p _ { 0 } \left( x \right) f \left( x \right) p _ { n } \left( x \right)</LATEX> <LATEX>\langle n | g | \mathrm { i n } \rangle = \int _ { - \infty } ^ { \infty } d x p _ { n } \left( x \right) g \left( x \right) \widetilde { P } \left( x , 0 \right)</LATEX> (45) (46)
0bqy | Note that the "out state" in the stochastic problem is always <LATEX>\langle 0 |</LATEX> and the "in state" is defined in terms of
b780 | <LATEX>\widetilde { P } \left( x , t = 0 \right) .</LATEX> We can also write the conditional probability
ccmb | (47)
ma93 | <LATEX>P \left( x , t | x _ { 0 } , 0 \right) = \langle x | e ^ { - V \left( x \right) / \Upsilon } \widetilde { P } \left( t , 0 \right) e ^ { + V \left( x _ { 0 } \right) / \Upsilon } | x _ { 0 } \rangle</LATEX> governed by the above Euclidean Schrödinger equation, as a path integral
c6hh | <LATEX>P \left( x , t | x _ { 0 } , 0 \right) = \mathcal{N} \exp \left( \frac { \varepsilon } { 2 D } \left[ V \left( x \right) - V \left( x _ { 0 } \right) \right] \right)</LATEX> <LATEX>\times \int _ { x \left( 0 \right) = x _ { 0 } } ^ { x \left( t \right) = x } \mathcal{D} x \left( \tau \right) \exp \left( - \int \frac { d \tau } { 2 D m } \left\{ \frac { 1 } { 2 } m \left( \partial _ { \tau } x \right) ^ { 2 } - \bar { U } \left( x \right) \right\} \right)</LATEX> (48)
y7ea | where we have reinstated the dimensionful variables. We therefore recover the "on mass-shell" path integral (30) obtained earlier. Note the importance of including the determinant (19) in order to obtain the <LATEX>\partial _ { x x } ^ { 2 } V</LATEX> term in the Schrödinger potential
nav4 | <LATEX>\bar { U } .</LATEX> Before proceeding to the next sections we should add a comment regarding the above path integrals. Beyond being expressions that allow formal manipulations, they can also be understood as limits of large multi-variate integrals arising from the discretization of time evolu- tion into small discrete time intervals. In general, this
gem8 | discretization results into apparent ambiguities [25]1. In our case this can also be linked to the discretization of the Langevin equation (8) (the index i refers to the <LATEX>i ^ { \mathrm { t h } }</LATEX> time interval)
e8nr | <LATEX>x _ { i } = x _ { i - 1 } + V ^ { \prime } \left( x _ { i } ^ { \star } \right) \Delta t + \int _ { t _ { i - 1 } } ^ { t _ { i } } d s \xi \left( s \right)</LATEX> (49)
