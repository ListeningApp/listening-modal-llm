First, it's the title that other people will see when they look at your profile on Tableau Public. Also, the name of the workbook and individual dashboards are a part of the URL of the file. It's important not to include special characters, such as ampersands, question marks, and periods, because they can disrupt the format of the URL. It's fine to include numbers though. You can name your workbook as shown in following screenshot:\ntkwl | If you want to replace an existing file with the one that you have opened now, you can perform the following steps:\no4qt | One.

You can add links to your Twitter and LinkedIn accounts as well as the blogs or corporate websites that you would like to promote. It's important to make sure that you have the permission before presenting URLs of organizations of which you're not an associate.\nb56g | My profile is shown in the following screenshot:\ni59k | You can change settings related to specific workbooks by hovering over them. As your catalogue of work grows, you should curate it by being selective about which visualizations are featured.\nj690 | When you roll over any of the thumbnails for a specific visualization, you can do several things; the following are a few of these things:\nfm81 | One.
