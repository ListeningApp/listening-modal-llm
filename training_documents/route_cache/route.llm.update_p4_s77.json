In all cases except nitrotosylazide 8e, the reaction afforded 4-ethynyl-5-iodotriazoles from moderate to high yields. In the case of nitrotosylazide 8e, only starting materials were detected in the reaction mixture after forty-eight hours even though five mol percent catalyst was used. Synthesis employing either OH-substituted alkylazide 8g or iodobutadiynes 7g, j required a higher catalyst loading (two-five mol percent). The scope of the reaction was also expanded to arylazide 8h, which required five mol percent CuI(PPh3)3 for the full conversion giving one-aryl-substituted triazole 9o.\nf2y8 | On the next step, we evaluated a synthetic application of four-ethynyl-5-iodotriazoles. Two types of reactions involving an iodine atom, which lead to one, four, five-trisubstituted triazoles were explored, the Sonogashira-Hagihara and the Suzuki-Miyaura couplings.\no7qm | It is important that both types of products, triazole-fused enediynes and five-aryl-four-ethynyltriazoles, are of special importance because of possible further intramolecular cyclizations known for other types of benzene(heteroarene)-fused enediynes and ortho-ethynylaryl-substituted arenes, leading to highly conjugated polyaromatic compounds. Among such systems, polycyclic fused one, two, three-triazoles are of particular interest.\nd52l | We started with the synthesis of enediynes. Remarkably, a triple bond has been introduced into position five of a triazole ring mostly using the Sonogashira coupling, yet several examples for the synthesis of four-aryl-five-ethynyl-one, two, three-triazole using one-pot CuAAC/ethynylation have also been reported.\nqlbb | Common conditions for the Sonogashira reaction of four-aryl-five-iodo-one, two, three-triazoles (Pd(PPh3)4/CuI/K2CO3/THF, sixty-five\nnhsg | °C and Pd(PPh3)4/Cul/Et3N/toluene, eighty °C) were initially employed for coupling of iodotriazole 9b with four-MeO-phenylacetylene 12a and two-methylbuta-three-yn-two-ol 12b, respectively. Surprisingly, the reaction with alkynol 12b proceeded with a partial deiodination of iodotriazole 9b. A mixture of the desired enediyne 13b along with reduced four-ethynyltriazole and a significant amount of the alkyne homocoupling byproduct was obtained. The reaction with four-MeO-phenylacetylene 12a reached only approximately sixty percent conversion of starting iodide to enediyne. Switching to other conditions useful for the Sonogashira coupling in the synthesis of enediynes fused to heterocycles gave either a poor conversion or mixture of target enediynes with the deiodinated starting triazole. Taking into account electron-withdrawing properties of a triple\nhy0l | bond neighbor to iodine, we analyzed examples of the Sonogashira reaction for five-iodotriazoles bearing an EWG at the C4 position reported earlier. The literature search revealed that low conversion and reductive deiodination are common problems for the Sonogashira coupling of five-iodo-one, two, three-triazolecarboxylates, carboxamides, nitriles, and even five-iodo-four-phenyl-triazoles. It is particularly remarkable that for five-iodotriazoles with an EWG at N-one the Sonogashira reaction proceeded smoothly, while for triazole with bulky EDG (ferrocenyl) the yields also were low. The best and the simplest solution was found by David Goyard et al., who carried out both the Sonogashira and the Suzuki coupling using K3PO4 as a base and Pd(PPh3)4 as a catalyst in THF.\n4jmz | These conditions also worked perfectly for the cross-coupling of four-ethynyl-five-iodotriazoles with acetylenes, providing unsymmetrically substituted enediynes thirteen a - g fused to one, two, three-triazole ring in high yields (Scheme five). These conditions proved to be FG tolerant, which allowed OH functions and substituted amino groups to be introduced into an enediyne system. Unsymmetrically substituted enediynes such as thirteen e - g are of crucial importance because they could be used as starting compounds for the synthesis of macrocyclic triazole-fused enediynes by the Nicholas-type macrocyclization.\nb7cq | The Suzuki coupling of N-benzyliodotriazoles nine c, d, m proceeded in high yields also using Pd(PPh3)4 as a catalyst and K3PO4 as a base providing five-aryl-four-ethynyltriazoles 15a-c in moderate to good yields (Scheme six). In contrast with N-benzyl-substituted five-iodotriazoles, the reaction of N-(four-methoxyphenyl) triazole 9o gave the coupling product 15d in a low yield because of a formation of an unidentified byproduct complex mixture. The possible reason for this exception could be a relatively easy five-iodotriazole ring opening promoted by both N-aryl group and EWG (four-(chlorophenyl)-ethynyl) at C-four of the triazole ring. Thus, the palladium-catalyzed denitrogenative indolization of N-aroylbenzotriazoles with internal alkynes has been reported previously.\n```",
