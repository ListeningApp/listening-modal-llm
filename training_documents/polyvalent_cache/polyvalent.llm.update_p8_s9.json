        "content": "6d4s | The dissociation constant was calculated using k-ELISA, according to the procedure first described by Friguet. Phages P equals ten to the power of ten pfu per milliliter corresponding to about sixteen pico M were preincubated with different concentrations of TnT from zero to four nanograms per milliliter which corresponds to one hundred and eight pico M. Next, mixtures were transferred into wells precoated with zero point two five micrograms per milliliter TnT or BSA. Further steps were performed in the same manner as for phage concentration measuring experiments.\nmqah | AUTHOR INFORMATION\nxxr8 | Corresponding Authors\nrl4j | Authors\nvz32 | Author Contributions\nncb0 | The manuscript was written through the contributions of all authors.
