        "content": "ywxn | Mr Isaac Eliot Nyieku - Member\nuxhs | Dr Irene Kafui Vorsah Amponsah - Member/Secretary\ned6e | Consultation\n6qqm | The Committee aside the intercepted documents that were brought to their attention, they also interacted with some convocation members and Management as listed below:\nonum | Staff\n3iir | Registrar, University of Cape Coast\n7a0a | Provost, College of Health and Allied Sciences\no1qp | Dean, Vice Dean and Faculty Officer - Medical School\njrik | Convocation Members\nxv78 | Documents\nsdks | UCC statues - two thousand twelve and vol fifty-nine, No. three\ny8fb | Prof Yankson's special committee report\n521q | Two Documents chanced on see attachment\nyogo | Findings\n2285 | The Committee after its interactions with Convocation Members and Management of Schools, Colleges and the University, a common trend runs through their narratives. Though not exhaustive, below are the issues found out by the Committee:\nys0g | Delays in the processing of promotional documents at both the College and the Department, thereby affecting their arrears and pensions or superannuation.\n7zvp | There are challenges relating to external assessment of their promotional documents:\nww6u | The time it takes to receive an update on assessment outcome is too long (some colleagues have outstanding issues over three to five years)\nhpi6 | Clarity of assessment results of assessment communicated; an example is \"Two reports received to submit two new assessors\" even though they have resubmitted the names of assessors countless times\n4uhb | Delay and clarity on some decisions taken on the promotion of some colleagues at A and P\nepyi | That issues revolving around fellowship and the acquisition of terminal degrees before colleagues are considered for promotion to a higher rank pose a demotivation to colleagues who have contributed immensely to the University's achievements\ny51p | Management is not clear or at variance between being appointed to a rank as being satisfying the first stage of meeting the criteria for the subsequent promotion. Communication regarding promotion outcomes delay unnecessarily. For instance, meeting of council to interpret issues several months ago, tenth February twenty twenty-two but the communication was received at the colleges the fourteenth April twenty twenty-two. More also, a letter written on the twenty-first March twenty twenty-two reached the College on the fourteenth April twenty twenty-two.\nx95m | Promotions have been withheld based on the interpretation of Yankson's Committee Report by a Council subcommittee.\nyfum | Some colleagues do not cooperate when asked to effect changes on their documents as suggested by either the Departmental, faculty, or College Appointments and Promotion Committee.\nppx4 | The Committee noted that there are some difficulties in getting a response from possible assessors (abroad), especially those related to the professorial rank.\nqf11 | Management and Board Members have some level of difficulties in understanding the report due to its scantiness, but one may ask what instruction did the Human Resources give to the assessors, hence the applicant should not be punished unduly.\n8oqt | Issues of wrong appointments to positions while experienced senior members in the field are not considered. For instance, the appointment of Prof Abu to replace Dr. Paul Nyagome as the Science coordinator in CODE while his time was not up.\n6zah | Statutes or Appointment and Promotion documents are not clear on revised or new editions of books.\n4v5o | Selective application of promotion criteria, while others are given an undue advantage over others.\nha9e | The policy on the use of the same data to publish different papers is vague and at the discretion of the Head, hence other promotions have been delayed unduly.\nxrnt | Interpretation of the statute, Appointment, and Promotional rules has been a bone of contention, with management and council having different interpretations.\nc8ra | Conclusions\np1l0 | The Committee in their interaction, have found out that most staff feel aggrieved because of delays in processing their promotion applications and it appears it is likely to degenerate. More also, it appears, management has not factored in the welfare of convocation members in their deliberations. Management should realize that it is very important to create an enabling environment for convocation members to work in peace and tranquility that will, in the long run, have a positive impact on the vision of the University.\n1i8b | The treatment of the medical school in relation to promotion is contributing to the decline in its performance contrary to being the best some five years ago and likely to see the exodus of lecturers to other sister universities. Also, convocation members who have immensely contributed to the University being ranked as the best in Ghana and West Africa are likely to be demoralized, hence the next ranking is likely to suffer.\n5sfj | Recommendations\nvk4h | The Committee requests that the VC and management address the above issues at Convocation from the findings.\nnsm3 | The University Statutes and policies should not be selectively applied. As it seems to be, adhered to in principle regarding its terms and reference of promoting staff within each college or school or unit.\njdfw | Convocation members that are highly cited and with special grants should not be punished with occurrences from the past but their progression should be clearly and properly communicated to them for future reference.\nuc9r | An assessment template should be designed and made available to external examiners to guide them in providing an in-depth assessment report.\nl0ap | HR or Colleges should exhaust the list of five examiners provided before asking Heads of Department to provide fresh examiners.\nx815 | The Examiners' reports should be made available to unsuccessful applicants always. This will foster transparency and accountability and also give the applicant a sense of trust.\nepbj | Officers (Head or Deans or Provost or management) must eliminate favoritism or bias (personal or ethical or political or etc.) in processing of application of convocation members.\nnmn2 | The A and P Board or management must do their best to communicate their decisions to applicants within a maximum of two weeks.\ng3tm | Management should put in place better measures to avoid delays in processing promotion documents as much as possible.\ntfra | Revised or new editions of books and or papers must be reexamined carefully to ascertain that the contents are entirely different before accepting to be part of the promotion package.",
