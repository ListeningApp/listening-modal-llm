You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

iest | Finally, PHLR is distinguishable from other kinds of public health research in that it evaluates not merely the effectiveness of a public health intervention but also the effectiveness of law as the tool used to implement or facilitate the intervention. For example, research on whether abstinence-only education reduces teenage pregnancy is not PHLR merely because abstinence-only education happens to be required by law. PHLR does, however, encompass research on how abstinence- only education rules are implemented (Sonfield and Gold 2001) and whether the existence of state-level, abstinence-only legal mandates is associated with differences in states' reproductive health outcomes.
cox8 | Health Services Research and Public Health Systems and Services Research
ppqi | Relationships between PHLR and several contiguous domains of empir- ical research are useful to delineate. Access to health care is an important determinant of population health, and health care is widely acknowl- edged to be a key component of the public health system (IOM 2003).
oxou | The study of how law affects population health through the mediating structure of the health care system falls squarely within the definition of PHLR. PHLR therefore overlaps with the field of health services re- search (HSR), "the multidisciplinary field of scientific investigation that studies how social factors, financing systems, organizational structures and processes, health technologies, and personal behaviors affect access to health care, the quality and cost of health care, and ultimately our health and well-being" (Academy Health 2009). The impact of law on racial disparities in cardiac care outcomes, for example, is an important question for both HSR and PHLR.
495n | The area of overlap, however, is limited to research that focuses on law as an independent variable and on population health (or an intermediate outcome with a well-demonstrated relationship to population health) as the outcome of interest. Research is not PHLR if it examines only the impact of some element of health care organization, financing, or delivery on health, without an important connection to law-for example, a study of the effect of capitated reimbursement in private managed care plans on the use of branded drugs.
awri | Public health systems and services research (PHSSR) is an emerging field of study that "examines the organization, financing, and delivery of public health services within communities and the impact of those services on public health" (Scutchfield 2009, 169). PHLR overlaps with PHSSR to the extent that law is an important factor in the organization of public health systems and agencies and the delivery of public health services (Henry, Scutchfield, and Pérez 2008; Pérez and Larkin 2009). A study of racial disparities in the use of involuntary civil commitment, an important legal tool for public health, could be considered both PHSSR and PHLR to the extent it focuses on how the organization or operation of civil commitment influences the outcomes the system produces (Swanson et al. 2009). Conversely, PHSSR that examines the flow of resources to and within the public health system (Mays and Smith 2009), although it might well inform PHLR on the implementation of a legal intervention, would not itself be PHLR.
bl28 | One feature of PHLR not shared by PHSSR or HSR is its consideration of incidental public health law, that is, the effects on population health of law, agencies, and private actors not commonly understood to be pursuing a public health mission. For instance, a growing body of cross- disciplinary research centers on the effects of criminal laws and the practices of criminal justice agencies, such as the police, on the spread of

ap5o | communicable disease (Burris et al. 2004). Research on this topic would fall under PHLR but not HSR or PHSSR.
7zvf | A Logic Model of PHLR
mov9 | A wide range of laws and legal practices affects the health of the popula- tion in cities, counties, states, and nations. Cataloging all such possible effects of law is impossible, and any schema for organizing such effects is characterized by trade-offs and simplifications. Nevertheless, the field of PHLR is advanced by a shared understanding of the range of possible effects of laws, and potential mechanisms for such effects, encompassed within the field.
ks7m | The range of studies that empirically evaluate the effects of law on population health is depicted in figure 1. Generally, the independent variable in PHLR is some aspect of lawmaking, laws, or the activities of legal agents. These will be studied in relation to dependent variables that can be arrayed along the presumed causal chain that includes key medi- ators as well as the distal or ultimate outcomes of interest: population morbidity and mortality.
w1w1 | First are studies of policymaking, the factors that influence which laws are enacted and that shape the specific characteristics of the statutes and regulations adopted (path A in figure 1). In these studies, public health laws (or judicial decisions) themselves are the outcome variables, and political and other jurisdictional characteristics are often the main explanatory variables tested.
h8gv | Paths B and C examine the principal mediators in the causal chain linking laws and health outcomes. Studies of legal practices (path B)
kwkp | focus on the implementation or enforcement of the law on the books, including how the law affects the structure or operation of various regulatory systems. Laws may vary considerably in how well they are implemented; for example, whether a legal mandate for health education in schools translates into all pupils receiving the education that legisla- tors envisioned may depend critically on the appropriation attached to the bill. There are opportunities and resources for litigation in some mat- ters and not others. Unfunded mandates, unclear statutory provisions, the failure to identify an administrative agency responsible for issuing implementing guidelines and overseeing the rollout of the new legal provisions, lack of political commitment, and many other factors may undermine implementation. Similarly, laws may induce varying levels of compliance by the regulated entities or population, depending on the degree of political resistance, the extent to which the administering agency is armed with effective enforcement mechanisms, the litigation environment, and many other factors. The completeness of implementa- tion and the effectiveness of mechanisms for ensuring compliance with the law are critical elements influencing the law's effect on health out- comes. Legal practices studies explore these influences as mediators of the statute or regulation's impact on health.
yj0m | Path C involves the study of the law's effects (as implemented through legal practices) on environments and health behaviors. We use the term environment broadly to refer to both the physical environment and social structures and institutions. Laws and their implementation affect social institutions and environments by creating or reducing opportunities, in- creasing or decreasing available resources, expanding or reducing rights and obligations, and creating incentives and penalties. Even private in- stitutions, such as corporations or the family, are deeply influenced by law. Research in this area examines these mechanisms of influence and how they shape the conditions for people to be healthy.
ewfp | Law may affect health behaviors both directly and by shifting the environmental conditions that make particular behavioral choices more or less attractive (path D). For example, land-use laws may determine where supermarkets and restaurants are located, affecting the availability of healthy food options and the healthfulness of the local residents' diet. Ultimately, changes in environments and behaviors lead to changes in population-level morbidity and mortality (path E).
oczy | PHLR may examine health outcomes directly, or it may use mediat- ing environmental and behavioral changes as proxy outcome variables.
2ttg | Making the Case for Laws That Improve Health
his3 | While directly measuring health effects is generally desirable because it provides more information to policymakers about the public health returns to lawmaking, a focus on mediating factors is often appropriate. For example, laws designed to improve rates of immunization with the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine might best be evaluated for their effects on the prevalence and burden of cervical cancer, but the time hori- zon for observing such effects is around forty years. Consequently, mea- suring rates of HPV vaccinations is a reasonable intermediate measure.
