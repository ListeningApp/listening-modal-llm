You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

xmgs | increase, which should raise the income inequality level (Castells-Quintana et al. 2013).
bd9h | Globalization, via trade and foreign direct investments (FDI), can also be attributed to an additional channel through which economic development affects environmental impact and income inequality (Zhuang et al. 2014). When discussing CO2 emissions, the reviewed authors provide different results. Some authors found that FDI and trade contribute to economic growth and to the degradation of environment at the same time (Shahbaz et al. 2015; Kivyiro and Arminen 2015; Ertugrul et al., 2016; Azam and Khan 2016; Sarkodie and Strezov, 2019). Other authors showed that FDI and trade contribute to economic development due to technology development, productivity and efficiency gains, and promotion of new and more innovative processes and managerial skills (Shahbaz et al., 2015) resulting in the reduction of environmental impact in host countries (Sbia et al. 2014; Tang and Tan 2015; Zhang and Zhou 2016; Kang et al. 2016). As far as income inequality is concerned, the mechanisms of FDI and trade openness dif- fer, and the results of the estimations are different as well (Dreher and Gaston 2008; Celik and Basdas 2010; Ines 2011; He and Feng 2019).
m047 | Therefore, the reviewed results display that, in the case of economic development, income inequality level and CO2 emissions could change differently and separate channels af- fect these variables differently.

y4mj | The approaches to the influence of income inequality on production- and consumption-based emissions
vpgq | Almost all authors (listed in Table 1) have analysed the rela- tionship between income inequality and territorial or production-based CO2 emissions. However, only few of the studies have estimated the consumption-based emissions (see Golley and Meng 2012; Hübler 2017) or analysed the consumption-based emission inequality (see Wang and Zhou 2018; Xu et al. 2016). Baker (2018) and Jorgenson et al. (2019) emphasize that research should focus on international inequality impact on both consumption- and production-based CO2 emissions. With respect to the production-based emis- sions, the leakage phenomenon should also be considered, which is defined as a process where the transfer of dirty in- dustries to the emerging economies with weak regulatory sys- tems rather than the increase in production efficiency and productivity accounts for the decrease of CO2 emissions in the developed countries (Carvalho et al. 2013; Ertugrul et al. 2016; Bilgili et al. 2016).
ousl | Three theories have been proposed by the authors that the- oretically analyse the approaches of relationship between in- come inequality and environmental impact: (i) political econ- omy explanation (in this paper, it is renamed as determination of environmental policies), which was suggested by Boyce (1994); (ii) economic behaviours of households (the latter the- ory overlaps with the MPE theory), suggested by Ravallion et al. (2000), and "Veblen effect" (Schor 1998; Veblen 2009); (iii) inequality determined changes in working time, which could also be attributed to "Veblen effect", discussed by Bowles and Park (2005). These theories were widely discussed by other authors (Table 2). However, the authors who presented these theories usually referred to the production-based emissions. Meanwhile, in this paper, it is assumed that all the abovementioned approaches do not

pxbq | adequately explain the relationship between inequality and territorial (or production-based) CO2 emissions. Thus, it is emphasized that the approaches should be separated when analysing the production and consumption-based CO2 emis- sions. The following sections propose the separate approaches to the influence of income inequality on the production-based and consumption-based emissions.
jfsr | The approaches to income inequality impact on production-based CO2 emissions
u15r | Regarding the production-based CO2 emissions, only two of the abovementioned approaches are appropriate: determina- tion of environmental policies and inequality determined changes in working time. Determination of environmental policies operates mainly via political influence due to the changes in income inequality (Boyce 1994). Boyce hypothe- sized that the increasing demand for "the environment" is related to the increase in income. Therefore, in the countries where the inequality level is usually low, the prevailing higher environmental standards condition lower levels of emissions. Other authors state that the reduction of environmental impact might request a higher political and economic equality at first (Roberts and Parks 2006; Downey 2015). Meanwhile, accord- ing to Franzen and Vogl (2013) and Berthe and Elie (2015), a higher level of income inequality causes the material and so- cial problems to take priority over the environmental aspects. Thus, inequality renders the agreement on environmental pol- icies and implementation of these policies more difficult (Hourcade 2013; Laurent 2014; Chancel et al. 2018). In de- veloping countries, where the level of income inequality is usually high, the environmental standards are low. Grunewald et al. (2017) suggested that the growth of income inequality impedes environmental policy solutions to emerg- ing issues, which subsequently conditions that the growth of inequality can contribute to the increase of air pollutions.
lq35 | Environ Sci Pollut Res (2020) 27:8980-8990
3g9w | Besides, expensive environmental protection in wealthy coun- tries generates the transfer of dirty production to poor coun- tries, where the environmental standards are low. Consequently, due to the leakage phenomenon, the CO2 emis- sions increase in developing (or of higher inequality) coun- tries, while in developed (or of lesser inequality) countries, the pollution level decreases. Furthermore, within countries, rich communities reap disproportionate benefits from dirty activi- ties and avoid the negative consequences (as air pollution) of their production by moving polluting industrial activities into less rich areas (Boyce 2007; Martinez-Alier and Muradian 2015; Jorgenson et al. 2017; Chancel et al. 2018). This reveals that income inequality promotes and enhances the implemen- tation of environment-polluting projects, which strengthens the power of the rich society to impose environmental fine on the poor (Wolde-Rufael and Idowu 2017). Hence, for the less developed countries, inequality is as an obstacle for the mobilization of the collective effort essential for confronting environmental pollution and carbon dioxide emissions (Islam 2015; Wolde-Rufael and Idowu 2017). Moreover, Gassebner et al. (2008) and Grunewald et al. (2017) stated that rising income inequality in less rich countries is related to industrial reduction and a decrease of producers' political power, there- by reducing their ability to decrease environmental impact.
d09o | With regard to the second approach, Bowles and Park (2005) reveal that income inequality increases working hours and consequently contributes to the growth of energy con- sumption and CO2 emissions (Knight et al. 2013; Fitzgerald et al. 2015, 2018; Jorgenson et al. 2017, 2019). Furthermore, the latter approach in this paper contributed to the explication of the theories on the impact of income inequality on production-based CO2 emissions. In addition, it separated the effects of scale, composition, technique and globalization. Therefore, the abovementioned channels of EKC, by the means of which economic growth affects environmental qual- ity, could be applied when analysing the relationship between inequality and CO2 emissions. Thus, the inequality deter- mined changes in working time could be attributed to the scale effect, when income inequality contributes to an increase in working hours and, analogically, to economic growth.
ylhz | Fig. 2 Theoretical model analysing the influence of income inequality on production-based CO2 emissions
a3td | Inequality, via contribution to economic growth, influences the growth of environmental pollution (Grunewald et al. 2017; Jorgenson et al. 2017; Rao and Min 2018; McGee and Greiner 2018).
ex5k | Referring to the composition effect, Gassebner et al. (2008) declared that in developed countries the increasing level of inequality is related to the industrial decline, which in turn reduces pollution. Meanwhile, in poorer countries, the rising industrial sector leads to the reduction of environmental reg- ulations, when richer segments of population are related to the growing industrial sector. Consequently, these arguments re- veal that in both poor and rich countries, different links be- tween income inequality and CO2 pollution could be observed (Grunewald et al. 2017).
9d4o | In terms of the technique effect, the reviewed authors re- vealed that a high level of inequality negatively affects the diffusion of environmental technologies and innovations (Vona and Patriarca 2011; Zhang and Zhao 2014). Thus, a high level of inequality can influence the reduction of tech- nologies, which determines the increase of carbon emissions.
cjq2 | Inequality level also influences trade and FDI transfers. With the high level of inequality investors are not inclined to invest, and in such countries, it is hard to develop international trade. Therefore, inequality via the globalization effect can contribute to either reduction or growth of CO2 pollution. It depends on whether trade and FDI enhance or reduce envi- ronmental impact.
5esx | These approaches to the influence of income inequality on production-based CO2 emissions are summarized in Fig. 2.
m5ka | The approaches to the influence of income inequality on consumption-based CO2 emissions
byu8 | The influence of income inequality on consumption-based carbon emissions can be explained referring to the following two approaches: (i) inequality determined changes in working time (which is also suitable in the case of production-based emissions and is related to "Veblen effect") and (ii) individual economic behaviours of households (or individual

zxz6 | consumption level), which combines the MPE theory and "Veblen effect". These approaches are summarized in Fig. 3.
xnth | With regard to the changes in working hours, authors have stated that people work more in order to copy the lifestyle of individuals who have higher status (Bowles and Park 2005; Chancel et al. 2018). Thus, at the same time, the increase in working time contributes to economic growth and to the con- sumption increase as well, influencing the growth of pollution (Jorgenson et al. 2017). In consumer society, people usually work more in order to buy more and to consequently support the self-image. It is particularly typical in unequal countries due to "Veblen effect". Veblen (1934) hypothesized that peo- ple from different social classes are more inclined to compare their lifestyle with other individuals from a higher social class and to mimic their consumption style. Particularly, it is ob- served in more unequal societies. Consequently, due to the Veblen status, consumption or, put in other words, the con- sumption competition (Schor 1998), wealthier or higher- income groups are more inclined to consume large amounts of goods and services (Veblen 1934; Jorgenson et al. 2017, 2019; Grunewald et al. 2017) and thus determine the environ- mental pollution (Ravallion et al. 2000; Wolde-Rufael and Idowu 2017).
vafm | With regard to the individual consumption level, the MPE indicates that at various levels of income and inequality dis- tribution, individuals' propensities to consume more polluting goods differ due to the change in the patterns of consumption level (Ravallion et al. 2000; Borghesi 2006; Grunewald et al. 2012; Jorgenson et al. 2017). Hence, Jorgenson et al. (2017) declared that consumption level was the key factor influencing the MPE. However, there is not a single hypothesis analysing the inequality influence on consumption-based CO2 emis- sions. The main condition of the changes in income inequality affecting the consumption-based carbon emissions depends
