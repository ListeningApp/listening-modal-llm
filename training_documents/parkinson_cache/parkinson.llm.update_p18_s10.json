Future Directions:\nnil3 | LRRK2 regulates the SV cycle by interacting with E-L system proteins that are also implicated in PD: auxilin, SYNJ1, and endophilin A. LRRK2 overactivity phosphorylates auxilin in its clathrin binding domain, making their interaction weaker. This leads to disruption of SV endocytosis. This was noted in patient iPSC- derived dopaminergic neurons, along with accumulation of oxidized dopamine, increased alpha- synuclein levels, and decreased GcaseOne activity.\n68a1 | Hyperphosphorylation of endophilin A and synJOne by LRRK2 significantly altered synaptic endocytosis. A recent study showed that LRRK2 can directly bind to clathrin-light chains through its GTPase domain, affecting RacOne-mediated endosomal dynamics. LRRK2 also perturbs synaptic exocytosis through phosphorylation of N-ethylmaleimide-Sensitive Factor which upregulates SNARE disassembly. Furthermore, LRRK2 is highly expressed in dorsal striatal medium spiny neurons, the postsynaptic compartment of nigrostriatal pathway. GTwoZeroOneNineS mutation of LRRK2 lead to abnormally high activity of medium spiny neurons and morphological perturbations during development. Abnormal synaptogenesis and dopamine receptor activation in the developing medium spiny neurons mediated by dysfunctional protein kinase A was seen in LRRK2 ROneFourFourOneC mutation. These defects can permanently modify the circuit structure and function, predisposing the individuals to both motor and non-motor dysfunctions of PD. LRRK2 mutation-mediated endocytosis defects were noted predominantly in these medium spiny neurons, along with nigral dopaminergic neurons and not in cortical or hippocampal neurons. This suggests a heightened vulnerability in the E-L system of nigrostriatal circuit for LRRK2 mutations.\nseik | Increased LRRK2 kinase activity mediated elevation of exocytosis may also be relevant for cell-to-cell transfer of misfolded alpha-synuclein. LRRK2 can selectively recruit to overloaded lysosomes and divert undegraded materials out of the kidney cells, along with secretion of alpha-synuclein from endosomes. Studies also demonstrate heightened uptake of alpha-synuclein fibrils through endocytosis in the presence of pathogenic LRRK2. However, LRRK2's role in prion-like spreading of alpha-synuclein remains speculative, until confirmation that similar mechanisms exist in neurons.\noq7c | Clinical description and diagnosis of PD has changed little since James Parkinson's characterization of the disease two hundred years ago. In the nineteen sixties, identification of dopamine deficiency as the cause of motor abnormalities led to symptomatic relief for patients. Though some success has been noted with deep brain stimulation, we are still relying on symptomatic relief. The last three decades of basic research have enriched our understanding of PD's cellular and molecular mechanisms, bringing tangible hope for disease modifying treatment strategies. Identification of risk genes and conceptual shifts in our understanding through genetic models point to the E-L system dysfunction as the key mediator of PD pathogenesis. Further strengthening this concept, PD pathogenesis appears to begin at synaptic terminals where endo and exocytotic machinery is most active and where alpha-synuclein and LRRK2 exert their\nz4mi | effects through the E-L system and vice-versa. Studies so far suggest that altered flux through the E-L system in nigral dopaminergic neurons that have lesser threshold for degeneration is the key trigger for neurodegeneration. Moving forward, critical elucidation of the mechanisms behind sorting, trafficking, and recycling defects demands detailed studies of auxilin and other DNAJ family proteins, along with SYNJOne, endophilin A, and the retromer complex. Studying these genes will also provide crucial insights into less explored roles of synaptic autophagy, axonal transport, and clathrin-independent endocytosis in PD. Recent surveys of PD patients note preservation of cognitive functioning as a major unmet need. Further investigation of GBA mutations implicated in PD is a promising avenue considering GBA's known involvement in cognitive disorders like Dementia with Lewy Bodies. Along with GBA, studying ATPOneThreeA2 and other lysosomal genes will enrich our understanding of lysosomal dysfunction, potentially bringing us closer to repurposing drugs used in Lysosomal Storage Disorders for PD. Affirming ongoing clinical trials targeting autophagy, alpha-synuclein, and LRRK2, an enhanced understanding of E-L system-mediated pathogenesis will prove crucial in developing novel treatment strategies and diagnostic tools for PD.\njai3 | LRRKTwo\n```",
