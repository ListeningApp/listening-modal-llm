Therefore, as we work with Bourdieu to understand educational leadership, we must examine the relationships that exist between the thinking tools in the context of schooling.\nnv42 | Eight Extant Scholarship on Bourdieu and Leadership\nxags | In an introductory essay for a special issue on Bourdieu in the International Journal of Leadership in Education, Lingard and Christie present the case for using Bourdieu's theoretical framework to examine the work of school principals. The special issue sought to explore how Bourdieu's conceptual frameworks and methodological approaches might be applied in educational leadership research. Lingard and Christie articulate substantively how Bourdieu enhances the educational leadership field with attention to relationships between individuals and social structures within the context of schooling. They argue that Bourdieu's theoretical approach will \"enable us to move beyond trait, situational and transformational leadership theories, emphasizing instead the recursive relationship between agency (individual leader habitus) and structure (field) in the broader social context.\"\njc47 | Lingard and Christie develop a 'productive leadership habitus' as a way in which school leadership ought to be practiced. This principal leadership habitus has three main elements. The first, reflexivity, is derived from the work of Bourdieu and Wacquant and Brubaker. According to Lingard and Christie, reflexivity allows productive leaders to acknowledge the logics of practice, \"challenging them, utilizing them, mediating them, rejecting them, selectively working with them, reflecting on them, segueing between them, in terms of keeping their eye on the central purposes of schooling.\"\nko3c | Secondly, leaders need to be prepared to \"do the most good and cause the right change.\" Lingard and Christie argue that as school leaders develop and improve school practices, they must not lose sight of the capacity of schools to reproduce social and economic inequalities. Principals need to be cognizant of the central role that schools have in changing and reproducing social and economic inequalities.\nxek3 | Thirdly, schools are complex and operate within different fields. The school principal must be aware of the different fields, their logics of practice, and, in many cases, their competing demands.\nbbpr | Nine Extending the Bourdieusian Approach to Leadership Agency in Diverse, Democratic Schools\n5zyf | While Lingard and Christie provide critically important insights from Bourdieu for educational leadership, we extend their productive leadership habitus and give explicit consideration to engaging with the cultural capital from increasingly diverse students. Specifically, we focus on the relationship between the school and the community in terms of how leaders mediate between diverse students' cultural capital and habitus and the common culture of schools in democratic societies. Bourdieu's theoretical work explains how schools produce and reproduce social and cultural inequalities from generation to generation. According to Bourdieu schools are structured to favor those with the cultural capital of the dominant classes. In other words, schools convert social hierarchies into academic hierarchies, and in so doing, legitimate the social inequalities of society.\n9own | Specifically, Bourdieu suggests that there are two main ways in which schools reproduce existing social inequalities. First, by ignoring the differences in children's backgrounds. Bourdieu posits, \"by treating all pupils, however unequal they may be in reality, as equal in rights and duties the educational system is led to give its de facto sanction to initial cultural inequalities.\" Secondly, teachers (and by extension school principals) are the products of the education system hence they are likely to unconsciously transmit the culture of the dominant class. Bourdieu argues,\nbqfb | It would no doubt be abusive in summary to describe relations between the upper classes and teachers as some kind of conspiracy. What is rather involved, though, is something most serious, complicity that is unconscious, and often hidden beneath generous professions of faith, the complicity based on an affinity of lifestyle and values.\nwwdt | The culture of the dominant class may come naturally to teachers and principals meaning they do not see the fundamental inequality in the system. Ease with the culture of the dominant class occurs because the habitus of most teachers and principals are in part the result of success in schools; they are products of the system. Therefore, according to Bourdieu, social reproduction is inherently embedded in the structure and functioning of schools, and as such social reproduction occurs largely in spite of the good intentions of teachers and school administrators.\nmn1r | A closer examination of Bourdieu's work suggests that for students to be successful in school they must adopt the cultural capital and habitus of the dominant classes, typically at the expense of their own culture. This may explain the \"acting white\" phenomenon; a reference to situations where some minority students ridiculed their minority peers for engaging in behavior that was perceived to be characteristic\n5vqw | of whites. In part, Bourdieu's assumption was that the cultural values promoted at school were different from those of the minority and/or low-income communities. Schools tend to embody the cultural capital of the dominant class. Schools may ignore the cultural resources of children for minority and/or low-income households because they are structured to reproduce the cultural capital of the dominant class. Thus, Lingard and Christie's approach is important as it illuminates the importance of the individual leader's consciousness about the community they serve.\nmeyw | Next, we take Lingard and Christie's argument a step beyond leader consciousness to leader agency and mediation, by changing the logic of practice or the rules of the game. As noted earlier, Bourdieu viewed society as a system of fields; each field with its own logic of practice. Bourdieu and Wacquant argue that a field \"follows rules or better, regularities, that are not explicit or codified.\" The school leader must understand these rules or regularities both in the school and the community. According to Bourdieu, fields are contested social spaces where those with the capital (economic, social and cultural) have the ability to influence the rules of the game within the fields. People and institutions individually or collectively implement strategies in order to improve their positions in relation to others within the field. Therefore, to a certain degree, school leaders have the capital within the school and the community to influence and change the logic of practice. Bourdieu and Wacquant note that there are social agents that can,\n2e62 | Transform, partially or completely, the immanent rules of the game. They can, for instance, work to change the relative value of tokens of different colors, the exchange rate between the various species of capital, through strategies aimed at discrediting the form of capital upon which the force of the opponents rests and to valorize the species of capital they preferentially possess.\n75y3 | School principals can change the relative value of tokens; in this case, increase the value of the cultural capital of students. Given this influence, school leaders can ensure the cultural capital of all students is embodied in schools. Since schools mainly embody the cultural capital of the dominant group, school leaders need to engage with the school community so that local funds of knowledge become part of the school.\n```",
