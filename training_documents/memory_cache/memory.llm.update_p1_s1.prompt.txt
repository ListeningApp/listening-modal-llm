You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

90no | Working Memory Capacity of ChatGPT: An Empirical Study
jt0y | Abstract
qb7o | 1 Working memory is a critical aspect of both human intelligence and artificial intelligence, serving as a workspace for the temporary storage and manipulation of information. In this paper, we systematically assess the working memory capacity of ChatGPT (GPT-3.5), a large language model developed by OpenAI, by examining its performance in verbal and spatial n-back tasks under various
oae5 | 6 conditions. Our experiments reveal that ChatGPT experiences significant declines 7 in performance as n increases (which necessitates more information to be stored in 8 working memory), suggesting a limit to the working memory capacity strikingly 9 similar to that of humans. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of different instruction strategies on ChatGPT's performance and observe that the fundamental
s0fl | 11 patterns of a capacity limit persist. From our empirical findings, we propose that
43ia | 12 n-back tasks may serve as tools for benchmarking the working memory capacity
3g2y | 13 of large language models and hold potential for informing future efforts aimed
gc7v | 14 at enhancing AI working memory and deepening our understanding of human 15 working memory through AI models.
wqfv | 16 1 Introduction
j30a | 17 The advent of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and GPT-4 [31] has propelled the
7bdk | 18 pursuit of artificial general intelligence [5] and unveiled human-level abilities that warrant further
fim0 | 19 exploration [39, 22]. Among these abilities is the capacity to retain contextual information while
ojro | 20 engaging in multi-turn conversations, suggesting the presence of working memory in these LLMs.
l6t9 | 21 In cognitive sciences, working memory is usually defined as the ability to temporarily store and 22 manipulate information in mind [1]. It is widely regarded as a critical element of human intelligence, as it underlies various higher-order cognitive processes such as reasoning, problem-solving, and
1ujy | 24 language comprehension [9].
qzor | 25 Studies on human participants have revealed a fundamental capacity limit in working memory [10].
a0by | 26 However, there has not been a consensus on why and how working memory capacity is limited [30, 41].
u1ky | 27 Among many theories, the executive attention hypothesis [16, 15] suggests that working memory
htm9 | 28 requires using attention to maintain or suppress information, and the constraint on working memory
8hul | 29 capacity is not really about memory storage per se, but about the capacity for controlled, sustained
87vz | 31 Supporting evidence of the executive attention hypothesis includes results from the n-back task,
ym66 | 32 which is arguably the current gold standard measure of working memory capacity in the cognitive
l0a3 | 33 neuroscience literature (for a review, see [20]). The n-back task, initially developed by Kirchner [21],
u8nw | 34 requires participants to monitor a continuous stream of stimuli, and to decide for each stimulus
l2v9 | 35 whether it matches the one n steps back in the stream (see Figure 1 for illustrations of basic verbal and
afbe | 36 spatial n-back tasks). The participants in this task must, therefore, continuously update their mental
78r8 | 37 representation of the target items while also dropping now irrelevant items from consideration. So,
320g | 38 some executive attention processes are required in addition to storage. Typical human performance
tp8g | 39 (measured by accuracy) as a function of <LATEX>n</LATEX> is shown in Figure 2, where we used the data presented in 40 [19].
gxfd | 41 In humans, working memory capacity has proved to be closely
s2v1 | 42 related with fluid intelligence (Gf) or general intelligence (g) [7,
jkp9 | 43 34], placing working memory at the core of human intelligence.
z8tt | 44 However, in artificial intelligence, there has not been a consensus as 45 to which metrics should be accepted as an intelligence index when 46 evaluating and comparing cognitive abilities of LLMs. In the current
9g22 | 47 study, we define working memory of LLMs as an emergent ability
41fx | 48 to selectively maintain and manipulate information for ongoing
7um8 | 49 cognitive processes, echoing the executive attention hypothesis in
uow2 | 50 cognitive sciences. We propose that the performance of LLMs
iat7 | 51 on n-back tasks can be a reliable metric for assessing their working
ywwr | 52 memory capacity, which in turn might reflect the general intelligence
0i6j | 54 To demonstrate this, we used ChatGPT (GPT-3.5) as a representative
87cq | 55 of LLMs, and designed two categories of the n-back task to eval-
0qs3 | 56 uate its working memory capacity. Our results revealed strikingly
z8f7 | 57 consistent patterns of a capacity limit across multiple experimental
7w7j | 58 conditions, hinting at possibly similar mechanisms of working mem-
51vd | 59 ory in humans and LLMs. We believe this finding is important for both cognitive scientists and LLM
baj1 | 60 researchers, and hope that this could guide future endeavors of better understanding why human
n1wo | 61 working memory capacity is limited and building more intelligent LLMs with better working memory 62 capacity.

ezla | 64 Working memory has long been a subject of study in human and animal cognition [11]. Unlike 65 long-term memory, which is stored in long-term synaptic weights in the neural system, working
rsbu | 66 memory is believed to be maintained by sustained activations of neurons in prefrontal cortex [26].
magd | 67 This working mechanism bears striking resemblance to the in-context learning ability found in LLMs.
tb74 | 68 However, the investigation of working memory in LLMs remains largely unexplored. Therefore,
8l69 | 69 exploring the working memory capacity of LLMs holds great interest and significance, as it can 70 contribute to the development of more powerful models [17, 18, 42, 23].
1jyv | 71 Large language models have played a crucial role in achieving impressive performance across a wide
olce | 72 range of downstream tasks. While fine-tuning has emerged as a popular approach for transferring to
erx1 | 73 new tasks [13, 38, 2], it can be impractical to apply this method to extremely large models and/or

0w8m | 75 showcasing the remarkable few-shot learning capabilities of large language models without requiring
vcu3 | 76 weight updates through gradient descent. Since its introduction, research on in-context learning in
hjzj | 77 language models has garnered significant attention from both academia and industry. Previous studies
j79f | 78 have presented various approaches to leverage the in-context learning ability of language models,
6tbv | 79 including selecting labeled examples for demonstrations [33, 25, 24], meta-training with an explicit
xb13 | 80 in-context learning objective [6, 27], and exploring the variant of in-context learning that involves
cxqi | 81 learning to follow instructions [40, 38, 14, 28, 29]
qfmx | 82 However, relatively less work has been done to calibrate the working memory capacity of LLMs and understand the limitation of in-context learning ability. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is 83
rut3 | 84 the first that provides an empirical analysis from the neuroscience view that investigates the working 85 memory ability of LLMs.
