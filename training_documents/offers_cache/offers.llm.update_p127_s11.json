        "content": "3txt | We start the name with a word or phrase that tells people the \"reason why\" we are running our promotion.\nqe3d | I like to tell people to think like a fraternity party planner. When I was in college, we had a party once because a guy got his wisdom teeth removed. I say this to say... the \"reason why\" can literally be anything.\nod26 | It really doesn't matter so long as you believe it. And you can even make a joke of it like the fraternity example. But this should answer one or both of the following questions: Why are they making this great offer? or Why should I respond to this offer?/What's in it for me?\nl4k6 | Examples: Free, eighty-eight percent off, Giveaway; eighty-eight percent off, Spring, Summer, Back To School; Grand Opening; New Management; New Building; Anniversary; Halloween; New Year.\ny4a0 | Announce Your Avatar\nbnif | This component calls out your ideal avatar: who you are looking for and who you are not looking for as a client. You want to be as specific as possible, but no more. When in a local area, the more local you can make your headline, the more it will convert. So don't do a city, try and go to the sub market, or hyper local area. Not Baltimore but Towson, Maryland. Not Chicago, but Hinsdale, etcetera.\nq018 | Examples: Bee Cave Dentists, Rolling Hills Moms, Brick and Mortar Businesses, Salon Owners, Retired Athletes, Brooklyn Busy Executives Give Them A Goal\njbak | This is where you articulate your prospect's dream outcome. It can be a single word or a phrase. It can be an event, a feeling, an experience, or an outcome, anything that would excite them. The more specific and tangible, the better.\ne9cp | Examples: Pain Free, Celebrity Smile, First Place, Never Out Of Breath, Perfect Product, Grand Slam Offer, Little Black Dress, Double Your Profit, First Client, High Ticket, Seven Figure, One Hundred K, etcetera.\n94lh | Indicate a Time Interval\njxk1 | You're just letting people know the duration to expect here. This gives an example of how long your results will take to achieve.\nwgvf | Note: If you're making any sort of quantifiable claim (like income gain or weight loss) most platforms will not approve this type of messaging with a stated duration to achievement because it implies a guarantee. It implies they are going to get this outcome in a period of time, which goes against many platform rules. So don't give a quantifiable outcome with the duration unless your platform allows it. That being said, duration is a powerful component of a Grand Slam Offer and you should definitely use it anywhere you don't need to deal with compliance. Alternatively, if the goal you help them with is not a \"claim\" per se, then absolutely use a time interval. \"$ten thousand in ten days\" versus \"Make Your First Sale in Ten Days.\"\n3jlo | Examples: AA Minutes, BB Hours, CC Days, DD Weeks, Z Months. \"Four Hour\" \"Twenty-One Day\" \"Six Week\" \"Three Month\"\nldqe | Complete With A Container Word\nqt5x | The container word denotes that this offer is a bundle of lots of things put together. It's a system. It's something that can't be held up to a commoditized alternative.\ncc6l | Examples: Challenge, Blueprint, Bootcamp, Intensive, Incubator, Masterclass, Program, Detox, Experience, Summit, Accelerator, Fast Track, Shortcut, Sprint, Launch, Slingshot, Catapult, Explosion, System, Getaway, Meetup, Transformation, Mastermind, Launch, Game Plan, Deep Dive, Workshop, Comeback, Rebirth, Attack, Assault, Reset, Solution, Hack, Cheatcode, Liftoff, etcetera.\nw8g7 | Pro Tip: Find Time To Rhyme\n0lyq | Good rhymes stick in people's minds. Rhyme your program name to win the game.\nmk88 | Google \"rhyming dictionary\" for an easy shortcut. Note - Don't try and force it. It's not a requirement, it's just a \"nice-to-have\".\nkft0 | Example: Six-Pack Fast Track, Five-Day Book Print Sprint, Marriage Thrive Deep Dive, Twelve-Week Two-Putt Shortcut, Twelve-Month No-Debt Reset, Celebrity Butt Shortcut, Get Some Ass Masterclass (just thought it was funny), etcetera. You get the idea.\nafqg | Pro Tip: Alliteration\nvz07 | Alliteration is when you make all (or most) of the words start with the same letter or sound.\n8wou | An alternative approach to rhyming is to use alliteration when naming your program. This is easier for most people than rhyming. Again, you do not need to rhyme or alliterate. Don't force it.\n6x7z | Example: Make Money Masterclass, Change Your Life Challenge, Big Booty Bootcamp, Debt Detox, Real Estate Reset, Life Coach Liftoff, etcetera.\n1q42 | I might be weird, but naming offers is one of my favorite parts of this process. What I want to highlight, yet again, is that your actual money model, pricing, and services will remain largely unchanged. Changing the wrapper simply means changing the exterior perception of what your Grand Slam Offer is.\n5ycu | Below you'll find a few examples of named offers for different industries.\nlhe0 | Wellness\narcp | Doctors\n8wsg | I could keep listing these, but hopefully you get the idea. Now it's time for you to give it a try for your Grand Slam Offer.\nm65y | Again, you don't necessarily have to use all the power components of the headline. Using three to five will typically create something that is more unique and desirable, allowing you to separate yourself from the competitive field and create an offer that will get clicks and engagement, and ultimately make you money.\nm652 | Furthermore, you don't need to do them in the M-A-G-I-C order. Do what sounds punchier to you. After doing this for a while, you'll see that some offers convert better than others. That's natural. And every once in a while you'll get a name that takes off like a rocket. I honestly have no idea why some names win and others do not. So, don't be emotional about it. Keep trying. Keep striking out. Then try more. You'll get there.",
