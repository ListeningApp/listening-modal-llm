        "content": "nhsg | But of all the ancient musical writers, the name of no one has come down to us, of whose works I was in greater want than those of the younger Dionysius Halicarnassensis, who flourished, according to Suidas, under the emperor Adrian, and who wrote twenty-six books of the History of Musicians, in which he celebrated not only the great performers on the Flute and Cithara, but those who had risen to eminence by every species of poetry. He was, likewise, the author of five books, written in defense of Music, and chiefly in refutation of what is alleged against it in Plato's Republic. Aristides Quintilianus has, also, endeavored to soften the severity of some animadversions against Music in the writings of Cicero; but though time has spared the defense of this author, yet it does not indemnify us for the loss of that which Dionysius junior left behind him; as testimonies are still remaining of his having been a much more able writer than Aristides Quintilianus.\n\nhy0l | But though all the musical histories of the ancients are lost, yet almost every country in Europe that has cultivated the polite arts, has, since the revival of learning, produced a history of Music, except our own. Italy can boast of two works under that title;\n\n4jmz | PREFACE\n\nb7cq | one written in the latter end of the last century by Bontempi, and that of Padre Martini, in this. France has likewise two, one by Bonet, and one by M. de Blainville; and Germany has not only produced two histories of Music in its own language, by Gaspar Printz, and M. Marpurg; but one in Latin, lately published in two volumes, quarto, by the prince abbot of St. Blasius. Unluckily, those of P. Martini, and M. Marpurg, are not yet finished; and that of the learned abbot only concerns church music; so that though much has been done, much is still left for diligence to do; and however I may respect the learning, and admire the industry and abilities of some of these writers, yet I saw the wants of English musical readers through such a different medium, that I have seldom imitated their arrangements, and never servilely copied their opinions. Printed materials lie open to us all; and as I spared no expense or pains either in acquiring or consulting them, the merely citing the same passages from them, cannot convict me of plagiarism. With respect likewise to manuscript information, and inedited materials from foreign countries, few modern writers have perhaps expended more money and time, undergone greater fatigue, or more impaired their health in the search of them, than myself.\n\n0b39 | And yet, though all will readily allow, in general, that perfection is not to be expected in the works of man; it is evident that, in particular cases, little tenderness is shown to imperfection in the most difficult and laborious undertakings.\n\nqecd | If I might presume to hope, however, for any unusual indulgence from the public with respect to this work, it must be from the peculiarity of my circumstances during the time it was in hand; for it may with the utmost truth be said, that it was composed in moments stolen from sleep, from reflection, and from an occupation which required all my attention, during more than twelve hours a day, for a great part of the year.\n\n1o7p | A GENERAL HISTORY OF MUSIC\n\ncp13 | If it be asked, why I entered on so arduous a task, knowing the disadvantages I must labor under, my answer is, that it was neither with a view to rival others, nor to expose the defects of former attempts, but merely to fill up, as well as I was able, a chasm in English literature. I knew that a history of Music was wanted by my countrymen, and was utterly ignorant that anyone else had undertaken to supply it; yet, to confess the truth, I did, at first imagine, though I have been long convinced of my mistake, that, with many years practice and experience in musical matters, some reading, and the possession of a great number of books on the subject, I should have been able to compile such a history as was wanted, at my leisure hours, without great labor or expense.\n\nbgre | But, after I had embarked, the further I sailed, the greater seemed my distance from the port: doubts of my own abilities, and respect for the public, abated my confidence; my ideas of what would be required at my hands were enlarged beyond my powers of fulfilling them, especially in the narrow limits of two volumes, and in the little time I had allowed myself, which was made still less by sickness.\n\n57lp | A work like this, in which it is necessary to give authorities for every fact that is asserted, advances infinitely slower, with all the diligence that can be bestowed upon it, than one of mere imagination, or one consisting of recent circumstances, within the knowledge and memory of the writer. The difference in point of time and labor is as great as in building a house with scarce materials produced in remote regions of the world, or with bricks made upon the spot, and timber from a neighboring wood; and I have frequently spent more time in ascertaining a date, or seeking a short, and, in itself, a trivial passage, than would have been requisite to fill many pages with conjecture and declamation.\n\nukth | However, after reading, or at least consulting, an almost innumerable quantity of old and scarce books on the subject, of which the dullness and pedantry were almost petrific, and among which, where I hoped to find the most information, I found but little, and where I expected but little, I was seldom disappointed; at length, wearied and disgusted at the small success of my researches, I shut my books, and began to examine myself as to my musical principles; hoping that the good I had met with in the course of my reading was by this time digested, and incorporated in my own ideas; and that the many years I had spent in practice, theory, and meditation, might entitle me to some freedom of thought, unshackled by the trammels of authority.\n\nkpvt | Concerning the music of the Greeks and Romans, about which the learned talk so much, it is impossible to speak with certainty; however, the chief part of what I have to say with respect to its theory and practice, is thrown into a Preliminary Dissertation, in order that the narrative might not be interrupted by discussions concerning dark and disputable points, which will be generally uninteresting even to musical readers; and in which it is very\n\njie2 | PREFACE\n\nd0ik | doubtful, whether I shall be able either to amuse or satisfy the learned.\n\n0x0s | It is, indeed, with great and almost hopeless diffidence, that I enter upon this part of my work; as I can hardly animate myself with the expectation of succeeding in inquiries which have foiled the most learned men of the two or three last centuries. But it has been remarked by Tartini, in speaking of ancient music, that doubt, difficulty, and obscurity, should not be imputed to the author, but to the subject, since they are in its very essence: for what, besides conjecture, is now left us, concerning things so transient as sound, and so evanescent as taste?",
