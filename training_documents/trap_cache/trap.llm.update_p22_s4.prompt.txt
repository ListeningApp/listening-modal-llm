You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021.

u8nw | Sensitivity to the impact of business fragmentation has been in short supply. Nearly all multilateral agencies-the World Bank, Inter- American Development Bank (IDB), OECD, the UN Economic Com- mission for Latin America and the Caribbean, and others-have pub- lished reports on the centrality of business-government dialogue and collaboration in industrial policy, usually with reference to past suc- cesses in Ireland, Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan. Yet these studies say little or nothing about the types of structural cleavages within the busi- ness community that might impede such collaboration.75 They do not mention, for one, that foreign firms were not included in earlier busi- ness-government forums, except when pressured to join state-initiated coalitions, as in Ireland and Singapore.
l2v9 | IV. THE ABSENCE OF UPGRADING COALITIONS IN EDUCATION
afbe | Given the universal consensus on the need for more and better educa- tion, one might think that this would be the area where resistance to reform in MI politics would be easiest to overcome. And the historical precedents are clear: big push education politics were evident in coun- tries that escaped MI in the late twentieth century.76 Yet broad, effective education coalitions have not been forming in today's MI countries. In the case of education upgrading, most large firms and many workers share a lack of concern over public school performance, though the sources of their interests diverge.
78r8 | To get at the institutional challenges to upgrading education, it is worth remembering that the politics of expanding low-quality primary education are relatively simple in the process of growing from LI to MI. The costs of building schools and hiring teachers (with minimal train- ing and salaries) are low, and the political benefits to local politicians are high. By contrast, rapidly improving quality of schools through twelve years of basic education requires costly upgrading of facilities, replacing ineffective teachers (often in opposition to powerful teachers unions), and training new teachers.77 Moreover, getting the right sorts of education, especially technical (often vocational) education, requires knowledge of the local economy, coordination with business, and on- going curricular revision. Politicians reap few visible benefits and must manage costly distributional conflicts, especially with teachers, over pay and performance. In sum, the task of achieving profound and lasting
320g | educational reform takes decades, extending well beyond the terms of incumbent politicians.
tp8g | These costs and challenges mean that a strong, broad-based, durable coalition is required to keep upgrading reforms going, but it comes at precisely the time when interests are quite divergent. Under high levels of inequality, the wealthy tend to favor public investment in tertiary, often nontechnical education, rather than in secondary and postsec- ondary technical training.78 Moreover, the wealthy and the professional middle class in most MI countries can send their children to private schools and have little interest in paying more in taxes for the education of poorer children.79
gxfd | Inequality, along with informality, also discourages poorer workers from investing their own funds in education. The costs of education to them (relative to their minimal disposable income) are high, as are op- portunity costs (relative to employment options in the informal econ- omy). The returns on education for poor households are therefore often uncertain.80 Workers are also split over education between those in low- tech or informal jobs that require few skills and those in the labor elite in capital-intensive firms. And although those in the labor elite have more skills, many were acquired on the job81 and so these workers have little interest in pushing for higher taxes to provide more schooling for others. Some evidence for the lack of interest among workers and the poor in upgrading reforms in education comes from opinion surveys across Latin America. Summarizing the findings, the IDB study thought it "rather disturbing" that two-thirds of all respondents (72 percent of poorer respondents) were satisfied with their local schools, despite evi- dence of the shortcomings of their overall educational systems.82
s2v1 | Even without bottom-up pressure, unified business support for in- vestment in human capital might be sufficient to push for major up- grading in education.83 If a large proportion of big businesses agreed
jkp9 | MIDDLE-INCOME TRAP
z8tt | that their long-term future depended on an increasingly more skilled workforce, that the cost of this education was too high for firms to bear (especially if they are in competitive international markets), and that therefore the cost had to be "socialized" and borne by the government, this coalition might be able to push state actors to provide the necessary upgrading policies and institutions. This is close to the story usually told about business support for education in Korea.84
9g22 | The fissures within big business in MI countries make such a unified voice improbable, however. First, the interests and capacities of domes- tic firms and MNCs are different. Many MNCs can move their investments to other countries, those with more human capital, rather than invest in upgrading education. MNCs that are less mobile, either because they are investing in natural resources or are in countries with large domestic markets, usually have sufficient resources to pay internally for training their typically small workforces.85 In the rare cases of countries that made it into HI with significant FDI (Hong Kong, Ireland, Singapore, and Spain), earlier investments in education (often motivated by other political considerations, to be discussed below) preceded rapid growth in FDI. Many MNCs were in fact drawn to these countries precisely because of their high levels of education.86
41fx | Nor do most of the largest domestic firms have strong interests in educational upgrading. As noted earlier, most such firms are diversified business groups with large subsidiaries in commodities, natural resources, regulated utilities, and other services. In these sectors, firms need either small numbers of skilled workers in capital-intensive sectors that can be covered by in-house training, or large numbers of less-skilled workers. Service firms and others in nontradable sectors might have a generic interest in education, but they do not feel competitive pressures from international markets for more urgent action. In surveys of problems and needs, firms in Latin America usually do not list skills as a major concern.87 Across all upper MI countries, lack of skills was not among the three most severe problems facing firms.88 Although most business associations regularly list education as one of their policy priorities, their advocacy is in practice too feeble to support a business-led coalition that would impose the heavy costs required to upgrade education.89
7um8 | In sum, after getting most children into schools, the challenge for MI countries is to improve the quality of education and expand higher education and vocational training. The shift from quantity to quality takes time (beyond the horizons of most politicians), resources, and political resolve to confront entrenched interests in education bureau- cracies and teachers unions. For all these reasons, cohesive, enduring coalitions matter, but just at a time when workers and big business are seriously fragmented.
uow2 | V. FURTHER COMPARISONS
iat7 | Comparative analysis across several dimensions provides further insight into institution building and coalitions in escaping the MI trap. This section briefly considers comparisons (1) within our nine large MI coun- tries, with a focus on exceptional instances of sectoral upgrading; (2) across our nine countries, highlighting differences between Malaysia and Thailand; and (3) with more recent graduates to HI in the twentieth century. The section closes with a brief consideration of some signifi- cant ways in which China differs from countries in the MI trap.
