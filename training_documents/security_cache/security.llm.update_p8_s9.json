'What are the problems that I need to deal with?'\nsfcf | Two. 'What should I do about it?'\nnuxs | Three. 'What do I do if something goes wrong?'\numx0 | To put this into more technical terms, we are talking about Risk Assessment, Risk Control and finally Contingency Planning. This module introduces these three basic concepts, and shows how they act as the foundation for all security management operations.\no306 | Four point one Three-Stage Risk Management System.\nqm1b | Stage One: Risk Assessment.\nn9ms | The purpose of the Risk Assessment is to take all of the thousands of possible or potential risks that might occur, and to give them some kind of comparative value. This will allow us to decide which of them is more serious, and which need to be actively managed. The truth is, that if we take any simple situation - walking from our home to the train station, or delivering a package from your warehouse to a client, for example - there are literally hundreds of possible scenarios that could be considered as risks, from the road being closed or the tube being disrupted, to a twisted ankle or being mugged, and even a major terrorist attack.\nicdp | As an example, a risk assessment carried out in a factory might identify realistic possible threats such as workers stealing goods; an electrical breakdown that would stop the production line; a hole in the fence; a phoned-in bomb threat; suspicious activity outside the main gate; a major terrorist attack somewhere nearby, but which would lead to the police putting a cordon around our factory so that no-one could get in, or a breakdown in the access control system.\nwtse | This is the first stage of a Risk Assessment, in that we have Identified Potential Threats. However, that is only the first part of the process, because we then need a way of putting them into some sort of order.\nbm7g | The accepted way of doing this is to create a Risk Matrix, based on two measures: Likelihood (the likelihood of an event occurring) and Impact (the disruption that event would have on our operations if it did occur). Both of these measures can range from Low (unlikely, low impact) to High (very likely, high impact). See Figure Four for two different versions of a risk matrix.\njr68 | The Risk Matrix (see figure Five) has been divided into five distinct Risk Zones, based on the Likelihood and Impact values. Each of these areas would identify a different class of problems, which would require different forms of solutions.\naxix | Each risk zone would identify a different class of problem, each of which would require a different approach in risk management.\n05y4 | Stage Two: Risk Control.\n2fb0 | The purpose of Risk Control is to minimize the likelihood of any identified unwanted event occurring, and minimize the impact of any unwanted event that does occur.\ns9fn | Once we have identified the risks and given them a Comparative Risk Value, we can then identify those risks that can be most easily managed through our security systems. For example, if we have identified that the lack of access control means that unauthorized people are walking around our premises, the introduction of a Reception Desk and or an entry-phone system could be one way of solving that problem.\nk5r6 | In order to ensure that the most effective Risk Control measures are put in place, each identified threat should lead to the introduction of a specific Security Protocol or Procedure.\nz9v9 | For example, if you are working in a situation where the possibility of a parcel or letter bomb is considered greater than normal, this would be identified during the risk assessment process. As part of your risk control measures, you would then develop specific security protocols to maximize the likelihood of identifying a letter-bomb, and to minimize the effect if any letter bomb that might be sent. This might involve screening all incoming mail at a separate location away from the main offices. You might also have ensured that all mail-room and reception staff had undergone specific training to teach them how to identify suspicious packages and what to do if they were found. Reception staff would also need to undergo the training in case someone hand-delivered a suspicious package, either themselves or using one of the major logistical companies. If a suspicious package was found, you could then isolate the area whilst a specialist police team was called. As this was identified as a high-likelihood potential threat during your Risk Assessment, you should have developed good relationships with the police units, who would be aware of the threat and may well have taken part in joint-exercises with\ngpu9 | your staff to respond to a suspect package. All of these actions would be developed in response to the initial identification of a high-impact threat.\nu5ws | There have been a number of examples of letter bombs in the United Kingdom, and a company might be targeted because it is working in the pharmaceutical industry, or it may be associated with political or national issues that increase the likelihood of attack. In two thousand seven, a single person sent seven letter bombs in the United Kingdom to companies associated with DNA testing and various traffic organizations. The Animal Liberation Front have also used letter bombs, as have Arabic organizations targeting both Jewish and Israeli targets, as well as Arab-language newspapers in the United Kingdom.\nonkh | A security protocol is a set of guidelines outlining how a person should behave in the event that a specific incident was to occur. Figure Seven provides an example of a security protocol that could be used in the event that a delivery lorry arrived at the front gate, but without the appropriate paperwork.\n8t55 | The first two stages of any risk management program, namely Risk Assessment and Risk Control, are designed to prevent an incident occurring. The third stage, Contingency Planning, prepares you to react and respond as effectively as possible when something does happen. In some American risk management models, the difference between the proactive Risk Assessment and Risk Control stages, and the reactive Contingency Planning stage is described as 'Left of Bang' and 'Right of Bang' (see Figure Eight).\n7imw | Stage Three: Contingency Planning.\nlf1t | The purpose of Contingency Planning is to allow the security team to regain control of the situation, and return to normal operational status, as quickly and effectively as possible.\ntze7 | Once an incident has occurred, it is clear that it will have a negative impact on the normal running of the operation, whether it is someone forgetting the key to the front gate, disruption of your normal supply chain, or a water-pipe bursting in the office above, and flooding your whole control room. This last example is exactly what happened at the main police control room just before the two thousand twelve London Olympics.",
