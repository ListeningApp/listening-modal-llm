You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

m5ka | the same mode applied to similar situations may produce two opposing reactions in two different clients. A client's reactions are less a function of the mode choice and more a function of the interpersonal characteristics and imme- diate needs of the client. The case example at the begin- ning of this chapter illustrates this point with respect to the instructing mode. When Kamisha explained why she was asking Margarita questions about her daily occupa- tions and roles, Margarita's daughter reacted negatively, whereas Margarita appeared to accept the explanation as being valid. It is important to keep in mind that modes are perceived, relativistic, and subjective. As such, they are best interpreted through the mind's eye of the client. Rather than the mode itself, the client's interpretation and experi- ence of the mode is what determines which mode is most desirable at any given time.
byu8 | Carrying this point a step further, it is even possible that the same mode applied to similar situations may produce vastly different reactions in the same client. For example, when Rigel used the instructing mode to ed- ucate Mr. Johnson about the assessment he was using, Mr. Johnson's nonverbal cues revealed that he was not interested (refer to the case example in Chapter 1). How- ever, when Rigel used the same mode to explain the con- cept of brain plasticity as justification for why his early engagement in therapy is likely to facilitate functional improvement, Mr. Johnson's body language became more positive. Ultimately, he invites Rigel to return to work with him on the following day.
76b0 | Because therapists naturally select and use modes that are most consistent with their interpersonal styles in everyday life, the use of therapeutic modes is as diverse and complex as the therapists who use them. All modes have equal potential to enable a functional therapeutic relation- ship. However, any mode may have a negative effect on a client's attitudes and feelings toward the therapist if used:
zxz6 | Too frequently or inflexibly
xnth | When the timing is not right for the client
vafm | When the mode is not consistent with the client's inter- personal needs in the moment
2zmw | When the mode is not changed so as to be more consis- tent with the client's interpersonal needs of the moment
bf9k | In the worst cases, overreliance on a particular mode with a client can result in negative consequences for the ther- apy process and for the client.
otkr | Your therapeutic style is defined by the primary mode or set of modes that you tend to utilize most often during interactions with clients. It is important to recognize that some therapists' styles reflect the use of one primary mode or set of modes, whereas other therapists incorporate a much wider range of modes into their approach. For this reason, the therapeutic modes are presented in this section in alphabetical order to underscore that no single mode is superior to another. Key points regarding each of the modes and examples of how they are typically enacted are summarized in Table 4.1. The table contains a general description of each mode, examples of phrases a therapist might use when communicating with the mode, examples of questions a therapist might ask when communicating with the mode, recommendations for facial expressions and body language that would be consistent with the mode, and ideas for how a mode might be implemented in practice.
ibgs | The points describing each mode are guidelines, not rules. They were included to stimulate creative thinking about a wide range of interpersonal behaviors that could potentially converge to form a therapeutic style. As you learn more about each mode, you may begin to form some of your own thoughts and ideas about interpersonal be- haviors that you typically utilize that reflect a given mode but are not explicitly described in this section. This type of thinking is encouraged because it promotes critical self-awareness and greater insight into your own unique therapeutic style.
colo | Advocating Mode
d6r4 | The advocating mode is becoming more prevalent as ther- apists become aware of and embrace the perspective that disability is a function of environmental barriers rather than client impairments. Therapists using the advocating mode work to ensure that clients have the personal, ma- terial, and interpersonal resources they need for maximal participation in productivity, leisure, and all other daily life activities. It includes ensuring that clients have access to housing, transportation, education, equal opportunities for employment, assistive devices, personal assistants, and any other resources pertinent to their independence and well-being. Functioning in the mode of advocate often involves being a facilitator or defender of justice, rather than in the more traditional roles in which the occupa- tional therapist guides, questions, listens, or administers a service (Fig. 4.4).

mn1r | Therapists functioning in the advocating mode are quick to recognize and respond to the physical, social, and occu- pational barriers that their clients encounter. They are care- ful not to undermine their clients' autonomy, dignity, sense of personal power, and capacity to judge what is in their own best interest by functioning in an expert role. They are also careful about being misperceived by clients as someone interested in fixing or rehabilitating them. At the same time, therapists functioning as advocates can be ardent and force- ful activists and promoters on behalf of their clients when the circumstances require it. Some engage in consciousness- raising with their clients about their legal rights, and some utilize their professional capacity to testify on behalf of a client in a legal situation or to broker access to services or resources to which a client is entitled. Additionally, thera- pists using this mode will seek opportunities to bring clients together in community with their disabled peers, and also normalize their clients' experiences and impairments as a part of the natural continuum of human experience.

Those who function in the advocating mode go out of their way for their clients to provide them with access to vital resources that ensure physical mobility and access, socialization, equal participation, and appropriate work or educational opportunities. Occupational therapists are most often called on to function in the advocating mode when they recognize the advantages of raising a client's awareness of an injustice or when clients are themselves unable to overcome social and economic barriers without additional resources.
75y3 | Cautions of the Advocating Mode
s2g2 | As with any other mode, the cautions associated with the advocating mode manifest when the mode is overused or misapplied. The strong ideological orientation that often characterizes a therapist in the advocating mode may lead some therapists to overestimate a client's desire; abil- ity; socioeconomic, political, or cultural context; as well as resources for pursuing autonomy and independence. Because clients differ in their experience of disability, they respond differently to advocacy efforts that involve consciousness-raising. For some clients, it may be pre- mature to raise their awareness about injustices that they would rather deny or discover in their own time.
q1q2 | Collaborating Mode
cb7r | The growing emphasis on client-centered practice in occupational therapy underscores the importance of the collaborating mode. Therapists functioning in the collab- orating mode expect their clients to drive the therapeu- tic reasoning that underlies the session, to choose their own activities, and to set their own goals for therapy, even if the therapist disagrees with some or all of the client's goals or agenda. Therapists functioning in the collaborat- ing mode also solicit ongoing feedback from their clients about their own performance as therapists and about the therapy process.
68xu | Therapists in the collaborating mode believe that cli- ents are more likely to achieve positive outcomes if they take ownership of the therapy process. They tend to view clients as capable of determining what they need from therapy and selecting occupational therapy goals and tasks that address those needs. In this way, they work to promote

epu7 | CASE EXAMPLE 4.2 The Advocating Mode
7od1 | Virgil1 is a man in his late 20s with cerebral palsy and moderate learning disabilities who has lived in an institution for most of his life. The managers of his care team at the institution had built a plan that he would move into independent living within the community with staff support to accommodate him. Before I was referred to work with Virgil, his care team from the institution had already located, set up, and obtained funding for his new housing sit- uation. I was referred to provide Virgil with a bath board to facilitate his bathing in the terraced house that was to become his home.
0bqy | Virgil had been schooled in the notion that his home was suitable to his needs, and he was thrilled about the possibility of moving into a new home. When I met with him within this new environment, it was immediately evident to me that the housing arrangement was not acceptable. Fundamentally, the way the house was set up did not facilitate Virgil's independence, maximize his dignity, or pro- vide a safe environment for staff to support him.

ccmb | client empowerment, autonomy, independence, and per- sonal choice. When disagreements or other interpersonal difficulties with clients occur, therapists who utilize the collaborating mode encourage clients to use their own judgment. In practice, this mode can be difficult to enact in its purest sense. A therapist must possess the confidence and capacity not only to receive criticism from his or her clients but also to let go of all control and professional authority regarding what is taking place during therapy, if even for a brief period of time. Although most clients for whom this mode is most appropriate make positive deci- sions on their own behalf, any therapist that has witnessed a client act against his or her own best interest knows how challenging it can be to step aside and watch this occur.
ma93 | Instead of providing the bath board, I felt it was my duty to inform the managers of Virgil's care team and the organization that was to fund his new housing that I had found the proposed accommoda- tions unacceptable. I provided a report that outlined the safety risks that would have been associated with providing a bath board. The report empha- sized other shortfalls in the environmental design of the house and outlined the oversights in the overall care plan for Virgil.
c6hh | The managers took offense at my report and attempted to remove me from the situation. They insisted that Virgil was no longer in need of oc- cupational therapy services. However, I pursued my agenda and held meetings with the funding organization and the managers to explain the ra- tionale behind my position. Therefore, the funding organization conducted an independent review and later decided to offer Virgil an alternative accom- modation. The housing that Virgil was eventually provided enabled him to move freely about the entire home and gain access to the bath, toilet, and other areas in a much safer and more dignified manner.

Moreover, as explained earlier, the collaborating mode is most appro- priate for clients who are educated, informed, and proac- tive about their care. It is the correct match for a client with a high need to control and drive the goals and out- comes of therapy.
gem8 | Strengths of the Collaborating Mode
e8nr | The collaborating mode reflects many of the core val- ues of occupational therapy. Specifically, the field places a strong emphasis on promoting client choice, freedom, and autonomy. Therapists who utilize the collaborating mode demonstrate these values by enabling clients to

f682 | I met Edward, a 17-year-old boy, when he was admitted to the adolescent psychiatric unit for aggression toward staff and peers at his residential placement. At this time his primary diagnoses were conduct disorder, bipolar disorder, and posttrau- matic stress disorder. Treatment was initiated with administration of the Adolescent Occupational Self-Assessment, an interview developed for this setting based on the Model of Human Occupation.
li1k | During his initial interview, Edward was coop- erative but made no eye contact and gave vague answers to the questions asked about his daily routine. He lacked insight into his aggressive be- haviors and took no personal responsibility for his actions. He perceived himself as being alone in the world and was anxious to move to independent living where he could come and go as he pleased. Edward had low self-esteem and a poorly defined sense of self. He was motivated to be successful in the role of worker, friend, boyfriend, family member, and student yet consistently experienced failure in all these roles. Edward also reported on the initial assessment interview that he was having some difficulty managing his affect and regulating his feelings.
