The untitled album usually designated Led Zeppelin Four was Jimmy Page's bid to refute any notion that it was the hype itself that drew fans: \"We wanted to demonstrate that it was the music that made Zeppelin popular; it had nothing to do with our name or image.\" Ultimately they succeeded in winning over the rock intelligentsia through a respectably consistent career of albums and concerts, but their initial backing by a powerful media company, bragging of the potential they had yet to realize (let alone exceed), was not an uncommon problem for artists in the late nineteen sixties. \"All that stuff about us being a hyped band...,\" John Paul Jones has reflected. \"That didn't help us early on.\" The point is not that Zeppelin were not enthusiastically pitched by Atlantic Records and its field agents—they were—but that for once the act was worthy of the enthusiasm. Whenever salesmen have tried to plug a cool new product to a cohort resistant to the very notions of salesmen and products, red flags are raised (similar populist scorn greeted many of the post-Nirvana \"grunge\" acts signed out of Seattle in the early nineteen nineties). Truly, every mass-marketed assembly of musicians, from the Texas Playboys and the Ink Spots to U2 and Public Enemy, has been a \"hype band,\" even the ones that catered to the audience's conceits of integrity and independence. Insofar as Led Zeppelin was hyped, the gambit was one that backfired, and the group ended up having to make its case through music alone—which it more than did.\n0i1k | I Don't Know, But I've Been Told: Led Zeppelin as Heavy Metal\ndqlg | As late as the nineteen eighty-three Rolling Stone review of Coda, Led Zeppelin was praised as \"the greatest heavy metal band that ever strutted the boards.\" Around the same time they were included with other \"Great Heavy Metal Bands\" in The Book of Rock Lists, alongside Thin Lizzy, Uriah Heep, Blue Cheer, Grand Funk Railroad, and AC DC, and a nineteen eighty-two Hit Parader article titled \"Heavy Metal: The Hall of Fame\" decreed that \"quite simply, Led Zeppelin is, was, and will always be the ultimate heavy metal masters.\" The tag was stuck on the band early in their working life and they were saddled with it through the nineteen seventies and beyond. Rock critics such as Dave Marsh and Lester Bangs included Zeppelin in their own definitions of the genre, and the average high school fan of nineteen seventy-four would likely have classified the group's music as heavy metal. One Zeppelin tune, \"Trampled Underfoot,\" actually uses the term in its lyrics, albeit as an automotive pun. Sociologist Donna Gaines's Teenage Wasteland: Suburbia's Dead End Kids reported on the alienation and aggression of the adolescent heavy metal cliques she interviewed in\np6pq | But in the Long Run\nzse6 | New Jersey, calling them \"The Children of Zoso,\" after Jimmy Page's runic signature from Led Zeppelin Four. Even today, few scholarly or popular studies of heavy metal as a social or musical subculture will fail to mention the centrality of Led Zeppelin.\np2n3 | This would not be such an issue if the members of Zeppelin themselves were not disappointed to be put into the company of Grand Funk Railroad and their ilk. \"There was nothing heavy about that at all,\" Robert Plant said of the Led Zeppelin album in Musician magazine. \"It was ethereal.\" To the New York Post in nineteen eighty-eight he also dismissed most of Zeppelin's imitators: \"It's mindless, it's not a reflection of something sociological. I don't think Zeppelin was their inspiration—Tiny Tim was. But this is some kind of demented dwarf giving strange hand signals as he walks out of a volcano onstage. It's tacky.\" Plant later told writer Chuck Klosterman that John Bonham had described acts like \"Deep Sabbath\" as \"a conglomerate of English, sketchy, blues-based thud... It was inane and no mystery to it at all.\" The other survivors, Jones and Page, have made equally distancing remarks about the band's relationship to the heavy metal format, Page pointing out the lack of \"light and shade\" dynamics in competitors like Black Sabbath, and Jones sneering at the \"glowering, Satanic crap\" of most metal acts. Page was quoted as saying, \"I can't relate [the heavy metal term] to us because the thing that comes to mind when people say heavy metal is riff-bashing, and I don't think we ever just did riff-bashing at any point.\" \"No one ever compared us to Black Sabbath after this record,\" was the bassist's blunt conclusion of Led Zeppelin Four's impact. Yet even pundits who concede \"Zep was always too arty and eclectic to be considered a real metal band\" (Guitar World's \"Top Fifty Heavy Metal Albums\") allow that \"for sheer power chord mania and horny, guttural hoo-ha, it doesn't get any better than 'Whole Lotta Love' or 'Heartbreaker.'\"\nohh7 | Jimmy Page and his bandmates were not alone in rejecting whatever pigeonhole they were consigned to. Most rock musicians at some point have complained about industry or critical simplifications of their work, a protest which usually tends to enforce their reputations all the more. \"You cannot classify anything,\" Plant avowed to Chuck Klosterman. \"Classification is a killer.\" Most artists in any medium, indeed, will resist being slotted into some or other stereotype, saying that their work is only their self-expression and that any generalization will miss the personal subtleties they try to impart to it; yet the defense of artistic freedom on the part of the creator is about as predictable as the inclination to format and sort on the part of the spectator or listener. As Led Zeppelin's players sought to demonstrate that they had more to offer than the one-dimensional boogie of Grand Funk—Led Zeppelin Three was an early example of this—professional and\nvbni | Led Zeppelin FAQ\ndgcw | amateur audiences strained to define their songs as something, and heavy metal was still the handiest option.",
