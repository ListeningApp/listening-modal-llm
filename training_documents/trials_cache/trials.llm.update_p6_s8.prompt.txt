You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.

ym66 | Note that the aim of a sample size calculation is to approximate the number of patients required rather than provide exact figures. There are several assumptions that need to be made including the anticipated true values which of course cannot be known.
l0a3 | 5.2 More general formula for any combination of significance and power
u8nw | The formula given for the comparison for two proportions is based on a type I error of <LATEX>\alpha = 0 . 0 5</LATEX> (equating to a significance level of 5%) and a type II error of <LATEX>\beta = 0 . 1</LATEX> (equating to 90% power). However, a more general formula for different values of <LATEX>\alpha</LATEX> and <LATEX>\beta</LATEX> is needed.
l2v9 | A more general formula is as follows:
afbe | where <LATEX>\mathrm { f } \left( \alpha , \beta \right)</LATEX> is a function of a and B. The table below provides the value of <LATEX>\mathrm { f } \left( \alpha , \beta \right)</LATEX> for different values of <LATEX>\alpha</LATEX> and B.
78r8 | Note that the value of <LATEX>\mathrm { f } \left( \mathrm { \alpha } , \beta \right)</LATEX> can be calculated for any level of <LATEX>\alpha</LATEX> and <LATEX>\beta</LATEX> and this is given by the formula below (you will need to understand what <LATEX>Z 1 - \alpha / 2</LATEX> and <LATEX>Z _ { 1 - \beta }</LATEX> represent: the z-distribution has a mean of 0 with a standard deviation of 1).
320g | <LATEX>f \left( \alpha , \beta \right) = \left( z _ { 1 - \alpha / 2 } + z _ { 1 - \beta } \right) ^ { 2 }</LATEX> For example, for <LATEX>\alpha = 0 . 0 5</LATEX> and <LATEX>\beta = 0 . 1 :</LATEX> <LATEX>f \left( \alpha , \beta \right) = \left( 1 . 9 6 + 1 . 2 8 \right) ^ { 2 } = 1 0 . 5</LATEX> For example, for <LATEX>\alpha = 0 . 0 5</LATEX> and
tp8g | <LATEX>\beta = 0 . 2 :</LATEX> <LATEX>f \left( \alpha . \beta \right) = \left( 1 . 9 6 + 0 . 8 4 \right) ^ { 2 } = 7 . 8 5</LATEX> 6 Impact of choice of scientific criteria on sample size
gxfd | The key factors required in order to calculate the required sample size and needed for a trial comparing two percentages have been introduced. Assuming the primary outcome variable has been identified these are (1) the expected percentage or risk in the control arm (2) the smallest clinically important difference that needs detecting (3) the level of significance, and (4) the power to detect the difference specified in (2) if such a true difference exists.
s2v1 | While a set significance (usually 5%) and power (usually 90% or 80%) can be specified perhaps the most important assumptions that need to be considered are for the unknown underlying risk in the control group and the smallest clinically important decision that needed to be detected.
jkp9 | Some flexibility is usually needed in assessing sample size requirements and it is a useful exercise to calculate the numbers needed for several different scenarios. In this section the impact of altering each of the four criteria given above on the sample size for comparing two percentages will be demonstrated using the UK PACE trial. Note that previous calculations showed 1926 patients were required based on the following criteria:
z8tt | Expected mortality in the single chamber arm <LATEX>\left( \pi _ { 1 } \right) = 2 4 \%</LATEX> Expected mortality in the dual chamber arm <LATEX>\left( \pi _ { 2 } \right) = 1 8 \%</LATEX> (i.e. one quarter reduction) <LATEX>\alpha = 0 . 0 5 ,</LATEX> <LATEX>\beta = 0 . 1</LATEX> (power =90%) i.e.
9g22 | <LATEX>\mathrm { f } \left( \alpha , \beta \right) = 1 0 . 5</LATEX> (1) Impact of reducing the difference to detect.
41fx | Suppose one quarter reduction is considered unrealistically high and decide an absolute difference of 3% from 24% would clinically important to detect (i.e. <LATEX>\pi _ { 1 } - \pi _ { 2 } = 3 \% .</LATEX> The total sample size required is 8128. Halving the absolute difference to detect for a given expected percentage outcome in the control arm resulted in more than quadrupling the sample size.
7um8 | (2) Impact of overestimating the event rate in each group.
uow2 | Suppose the true mortality is half that expected in both groups i.e. <LATEX>\pi _ { 1 } = 1 2 \% ,</LATEX> <LATEX>\pi _ { 2 } = 9 \% .</LATEX> Note that this is still a one quarter reduction in mortality. The total sample size required is 4376, more than double the initial estimate.
iat7 | Note however that this assumes the relative effect remains the same i.e. a quarter reduction. For a given absolute difference to detect, the total number decreases as the event rate decreases (for event rates below 50%). For example, suppose it is required to detect a difference of 12% vs. 6% then the total sample size would be 946 but this represents a halving in mortality.
ywwr | (3) Impact of reducing the significance level (i.e. reducing risk of a type I error).
0i6j | Suppose more stringent evidence for a treatment difference is required and the level of significance is set to be 1% i.e. require p<0.01 to claim a treatment difference. f(a,ß) now becomes 14.9 and the total sample size needs to be increased to 2732.
87cq | (4) Impact of increasing the power (i.e. the risk of a type II error).
0qs3 | Suppose it is required for the study to give more chance of finding a treatment difference and 95% power is used. f(a,ß) now becomes 13.0 and the total sample size needs to be increased to 2384.
z8f7 | In practice, these calculations are usually done using computer packages, such as Stata, R or Epi- Info. The number of patients which different packages arrive at may differ slightly from those above as slightly different approximations are used.
7w7j | In deciding upon the required size of a trial the numbers are often disappointingly large in respect of investigators expectations and available patients. For example reducing the absolute required difference to detect by half meant increasing the sample size more than fourfold.
51vd | Sample sizes entail some judgement, and some compromise between using stringent statistical criteria and what can practically be achieved is required. However, the choices to be made need to be realistic.
baj1 | Comparing two means 7
n1wo | In some clinical trials the primary endpoint is a continuous outcome, e.g. kidney functioning as measured by glomerular filtration rate or systolic blood pressure, rather than the occurrence of some binary event, e.g. mortality. The principles behind calculating the required sample size when the outcome is a comparison of two means are the same as when comparing two percentages.
