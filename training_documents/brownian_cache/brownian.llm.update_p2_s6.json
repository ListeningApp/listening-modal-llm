        "content": "erre | Onsager-Machlup form of the generating functional. To turn the functional integro-differential equation one into a mathematically more tractable form we employ two commonly used approximations for the effective action Tk: the Local Potential Approximation (LPA) as well as the LPA augmented by Wavefunction Renormalisation (WFR). In the LPA, the effect of fluctuations is progressively taken into account during the flow by the effective potential Vk (x) experienced by the particle, which is altered compared to the bare, fundamental potential V (x). Wavefunction Renormalisation (WFR) involves a second function Zk(x) which can be interpreted as a redefinition of position x to Z(x). These are also known as the first two (leading and subleading) orders in a gradient expansion of T.\n835g | In Section Four we derive the effective equations of motion (EEOM) through variational derivatives of the effective action T. We do this first for the one point function, or average position x, whose equation of motion simply reduces to an over-damped equation in an effective potential with no noise i.e. purely classical. We then obtain an equation for the evolution of the two point function; this Green's function equation allows us to solve for the Variance and Covariance of the stochastic process. Solutions to these deterministic equations with appropriate initial conditions can then approximate the relaxation towards equilibrium.\nx3l9 | In Section Five we present numerical solutions to the flow equations for three types of potential: a simple polynomial one, an unequal LJ type potential and a \"rugged\" potential consisting of an underlying harmonic x squared potential with the addition of six Gaussian bumps and dips. We also consider different temperatures, effectively controlling the strength of thermal fluctuations compared to the classical force. Naturally, we find that the end results of the flow equations differ, with higher temperatures resulting in potentials that carry less memory of the bare potentials' morphology. In section Six the numerical solution of the LPA flow equation accurately reproduces static equilibrium quantities, as it should. We also examine the characteristic decay behaviour of the connected two-point function (x(0)x(t)) or covariance at equilibrium by utilizing both the effective potential Vk->0 and the WFR function Zk-10 and find good agreement with exact results down to relatively low temperatures when deviations start becoming pronounced.\nd2fj | In Section Seven we examine how well the LPA plus WFR approximation to the effective action can handle relaxation towards equilibrium in our potentials starting from a fixed initial condition (Pini (x) equals eight(x minus Xini)). Numerical solutions to the EEOM for the one- and two-point functions are compared to direct numerical simulation of equation four and/or numerical solutions to the Fokker Planck equation. We find that under the LPA plus WFR approximations, the fRG solutions give a good description of the relaxational evolution and are able to capture overshoots of the variance in the potentials we examine. Similarly to equilibrium, the approximations fare\ngeyi | worse as the temperature is decreased and the classical force determined by the potential's slope becomes dominant. We suggest that this behaviour is correlated to the spectral decomposition of the relaxation in terms of eigenvalues of the relevant Fokker-Planck operator: the more the spectral decomposition of Langevin, Langevin x (t) equals, Langevin x (t sub ini) x (t) equals and Langevin x squared (t) equals is shifted towards lower eigenvalues, the better the LPA plus WFR approximation performs.\n2181 | We conclude in Section Eight. Appendix A derives the zero-dimensional analogue of the Wetterich equation one for the effective potential corresponding to the equilibrium Boltzmann distribution while in Appendix B we include a derivation of the solution of one hundred thirteen that provides the two-point function. In Appendix C we explicitly show that the determinant appearing in the path integral directly follows from the boundary conditions imposed in two point A.\n9ubl | Two. Brownian Motion as Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics\no8pj | This section reviews Brownian motion and its path integral formulation in terms of the action functional of Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics. In the next section we will exploit this link to derive the RG flow equations.\n27b9 | Brownian motion for a single particle of mass M moving in a potential V bar (x), coupled to an external heat bath with temperature T can be described by the Langevin equation:\n09xa | M d squared x plus gamma dot x equals negative m partial sub x V (x) plus f (t)\nyi97 | Langevin f (t) f (t prime) equals two D gamma squared delta (t minus t prime)\n4zj7 | where gamma is a frictional coefficient, f (t) is a Gaussian \"noise\" term and V (x) is the potential in which the particle moves. D equals k sub b T divided by gamma is the diffusion constant, given so as to match the Boltzmann equilibrium distribution (should an equilibrium state exist). Hereafter, we will be concerned with the overdamped limit:\n3wgh | dot x equals negative epsilon partial sub x V (x) plus eta (t) Langevin eta (t) eta (t prime) equals two D delta (t minus t prime)\nuvo3 | to which the system settles over a timescale epsilon equals m divided by gamma which we assume to be short. Note that the overdamped equations are a consistent approximation to the full dynamics as long as\nyjbv | epsilon squared V double prime much less than one. We will be examining the impact of changing the temperature, and hence changing the strength of the fluctuating force n, on the coarse-grained effective theory. Let us therefore introduce a reference temperature T sub zero and a dimensionless parameter Upsilon which allows us to dial the temperature around T sub zero. Writing D equals D sub zero Upsilon we further define dimensionless variables",
