You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

xv78 | Oxygen and hydrogen isotope analyses were performed on 14 samples of monomineralic clays (<2 um), free from Fe and Mn oxides as determined by XRD. The analyses were car- ried out by the Queen's Facility for Isotope Research (Queen's University, Ontario, Canada). Oxygen was extracted from
sdks | 5-mg samples at 550° to 600℃ using the BrF5 technique of Clayton and Mayeda (1963). Samples were analyzed via dual inlet on a Thermo-Finnigan DeltaPlus XP isotope ratio mass spectrometer (IRMS). For hydrogen isotope measurements, samples were weighed into silver capsules, degassed for 1 h at 100℃, and then crushed and loaded into a zero blank autos- ampler. Hydrogen isotope compositions were measured using a Finnigan thermos-combustion elemental analyzer (EA) coupled to a Thermo-Finnigan DeltaPlus XP continuous-flow IRMS. All values are expressed in the conventional ò notation as per mil (%0) deviation from V-SMOW (Vienna-Standard Mean Ocean Water), with analytical precision and accuracy for 8180 values of ±0.1%% (lo) and for OD of ±3%% (lo) and ±1.5%% (lo), respectively.
y8fb | Sulfur isotope measurements were conducted on 57 hand- picked mineral separates, including anhydrite, gypsum, barite, chalcopyrite, and sphalerite, at the Westfälische Wil- helms-Universität Münster, Germany (described in detail by Wienkenjohann, 2015). For 35 pure monomineralic samples (as defined optically), the sulfur isotope composition was determined directly without prior chemical treatment, using a Carlo Erba EA interfaced to a ThermoFinnigan Delta Plus mass spectrometer (EA-IRMS). Repeat analyses showed a precision of better than ±0.3%% (lo), and standard measure- ments (IAEA-S1, S2, S3, NBS127, Ag2S-lab) gave an accu- racy of better than ±0.2%% (lo). For 22 samples of intergrown sulfide-sulfate mineral assemblages, a mineral-specific, wet- chemical pretreatment protocol was applied, yielding four different sulfur phases. Briefly, anhydrite and gypsum were dissolved using a 10% NaCl-solution for 24 h, and dissolved sulfate was precipitated as BaSO4 using standard procedures (e.g., Dogramaci et al., 2001). BaSO4 precipitates were then converted into silver sulfide using Thode solution (a mixture of HI, HCl, and H3PO2; Thode and Monster, 1961). Sphal- erite sulfur was liberated as hydrogen sulfide (acid volatile sulfide [AVS]) with HCl (25%) for 1 h at 85℃. Subsequently, disulfides such as chalcopyrite and pyrite were extracted using chromous-chloride solution (chromium-reducible sul- fide [CRS] fraction, cf. Canfield et al., 1986). Each time, resulting hydrogen sulfide was precipitated first as zinc sul- fide (using zinc acetate) and ultimately as silver sulfide (using silver nitrate) as described in Canfield et al. (1986) and Rice et al. (1993). Following the quantitative removal of all sulfide minerals using acidic (HCl) CrCl2 solution (cf. Canfield et al., 1986), acid-insoluble sulfate (barite) was liberated as hydrogen sulfide, following Thode and Monster (1961), and ultimately precipitated as silver sulfide. All silver sulfide precipitates, representing water-soluble sulfates (WSS) such as anhydrite and gypsum (Ag2Swss), acid-insoluble sulfates (AISs) such as barite (Ag2SAIS), AVSs (i.e., sphalerite), and CRSs (i.e., chal- copyrite and pyrite), were subjected to fluorination IRMS, following the procedure outlined by Ono et al. (2006), using a ThermoScientific Mat 253 mass spectrometer. Results are reported in the standard delta notation as per mil difference relative to Vienna-Canyon Diablo Troilite (V-CDT). Precision and accuracy were better than ±0.03%% (lo).
521q | The 226Ra/Ba dating of hydrothermal barite from 23 sulfide- sulfate samples was carried out following the methods of Jamieson et al. (2013), modified after Ditchburn et al. (2004). Samples were crushed and powdered, with one split used to

The daughter product of 226Ra is 222Rn, with a half- life of 3.8 d. A daughter isotope from the decay of 222Rn, 214Pb, was measured as a proxy to avoid peak overlap with 235U. Prior to measurements, the sample tubes were sealed for 21 d to prevent the escape of 222Rn gas and obtain secular equilib- rium between 226Ra and 214Pb. Measurements were made using an XLB-GWL-SV digital gamma spectrometer (DSPec, Ortec®) containing a high-purity germanium crystal, 54.7 x 66.2 mm, with an active well depth of 40 mm. Counting times ranged from 2 to 12 h, depending on the activity of 226Ra in each sample. Spectral signatures were calibrated using IAEA- 312 reference material and analyzed using a custom program developed and provided by Peter Appleby (University of Liv- erpool) to correct for background, detector efficiency, sample volumes, and matrix effects. Ages were determined relative to a zero-age end member selected from one of the actively venting chimneys and assumed to represent the initial 226Ra/ Ba ratio (1,022 ± 68 Bq/kg.wt %; sample GMA13-024). All ages are considered minimum values, as incorporation of young barite in the samples cannot be ruled out (e.g., Ditch- burn and de Ronde, 2017).
ys0g | Drill Sites
7zvp | Shallow seafloor drilling was focused along the main NS- trending fissure (sites A-E), targeting areas with accumula- tions of chimneys and mounds and spatially associated with buried circular structures that may be manifestations of the cinder cones, with an additional site to the west of this structure (site F) (Fig. 2). Three subseafloor rock types were encountered in most drill holes, in order of increasing depth: (1) unconsolidated volcaniclastic sediment (cover sequence), (2) mineralized intervals consisting of mixed chimney talus, and (3) intensely clay altered volcaniclastic material (footwall sequence). In addition, several drill holes intersected intervals of oxidized ferruginous mud associated with rounded to sub- rounded chimney fragments, interpreted to be paleoseafloor horizons.
