You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

06yq | Microdosing with psychedelics to self-medicate for ADHD symptoms in adults: A naturalistic study
dpv6 | ARTICLE INFO
8r5j | ABSTRACT
2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

ci51 | The superficially religious apply 'tests' for sincerity which en- able ignorance and misunderstanding to continue.
jaj7 | 121
uc0w | THE BEDOUIN TEACHER
494y | Rumi brings us a fine analogy of this, showing how people in judging things from ignorance of the facts, come to false con- clusions.
5whs | In this tale, a bedouin was listening to another man saying prayers. He began by repeating a passage from the Koran, where it is said, in Chapter IX ('Repentance') verses 97 onwards:
kigc | 'The Arabs of the desert are the worst in unbelief and hy- pocrisy ... '
k5st | Infuriated, the Arab gave him a blow on the head.
d8e8 | The man at prayer continued the quotation, coming to the passage:
gb7b | ... But some of the desert Arabs believe in God and in the Last Day ..
jxu0 | That's better!' said the bedouin, 'now I have taught you how to behave .. . '
l1bb | Here the bedouin stands for the superficial and assumption- prone part of the mind of the literalist religious person, whose faith' seems demonstrably based on conduct, and whose assess- ment of the faith of others is based on his own imagination of what the other person's beliefs mean.
i3e0 | Rumi's bedouin-and our questioner about sincerity - could have made this test, had they known of it, to think of the aphorism:
78dj | 'If you think that you are not self-deluded, just check whether you think well of yourself or not.'
c1pj | 122
6v9y | The Would-Be and Should-be people
deen | THERE can be all the difference in the world between the would-be followers of the Tradition and the should-be followers.
27bo | Each of them may have the necessary capacity.
72k6 | The should-be ones could very well never have heard of meta- physics. They could even hate the idea of esotericism. Nowadays there are still very many people who have no ideas about-nor interest in - religion, mysticism, 'things of the mind': though they are fewer every day.
emhp | The would-be ones are those who have been attracted at some time or other to a scrap of genuine inner activity. They may have met some person, engaged in some such activity, read some litera- ture. They are would-bes because they believe that because they have heard about something, might even have tried to practise it, for that reason they have a right to it.
tcgw | In general, close contact with the would-be shows that his interest is comparatively shallow. He is guilty, as the psychologist would claim, of desiring a system which fits in with preconcep- tions, seeking no more than to achieve any kind of personal equilibrium.
4d8s | He may have the capacity. Most frequently he does not have the necessary attitude. He will tend, of course, to believe that he has got the right attitude. He will accuse others of not having it
1cmq | Both types need education in Sufi evolutionary philosophy, initially by means of familiarisation with its viewpoints and some of its materials. This is difficult because few general- purpose expositions of this material exist contrary to the popularised belief that 'it must be in books': or, 'I won't bother with books, but I will get it from someone in the flesh.' But this is why there are, and always have been, Sufi schools. This is one reason why the schools take, to the crude ob- server, mystifyingly diverse outward forms.
u8s6 | 123
86m5 | As the Akhlaq-i-Muhsini says:
lzzv | The bird which knows not of sweet water Has his beak in salt water all the year.
623p | IS YOUR BEAK IN SALT WATER?
50lp | This salt water, in the mind of the Sufi, is what is otherwise called 'The World'. The ordinary person imagines that that which he more instandy perceives, like material objects and obvious (to him) thoughts, must logically be what is more real. But the Sufi says that so-called concrete things are not experienced but inferred.
i4nn | You infer fire from smoke, and smoke may appear to be real, but its underlying reality is the fire. When this habit of assuming that instandy perceptible things are more important than more subde ones goes, the latter become perceptible. Sufi study is de- voted to this task.
nuk3 | It is for this reason that the great Sheikh Abdul-Karim Jili says:
y2cn | Truth, reality [al-Haqq] is felt, perceived:
hgm4 | The world is inferred [ma'qulun].
nc42 | As long as one regards what are in fact secondary things (including one's secondary, conditioned self) as primary, the subtler but more real primary element - Reality and the Essence of the individual - will not be perceived.
tbfm | A MEETING WITH THREE DERVISHES
ok18 | I met three dervishes in the Middle East, and asked them whether they had ever encountered any Seekers from the West. 'Frequendy* they told me. I asked them if they ever taught these people anything. 'This is what happens' one them said. 'They come to us and say "Teach us", and we start to try, sitting before them or leaving them there and retreating to communicate by direct per- ception.' I wondered what happened next. 'Always the same thing. After two or three days they set off again, complaining that we are not doing what we said we would do.'

qo9m | Satisfactions and Purpose of Ritual
e7zz | Q: We see people all over the world deriving satisfactions from ritual. How can we get beyond ritual?
lhzk | A: Initiation and celebratory rituals carried out by religions, societies and other groupings can have various-very different - origins, purposes and functions.
wdpw | We might liken all these purposes, origins and functions to, say the various processes which are known to and carried out in any given science. In chemistry, distillation is not the same as fermen- tation; the use of alkalis is not the same as the use of acids. There is both industrial and research chemistry.
twiq | In the case of the science of man, there are similar distinctions.
cchx | WHEN RITUALISM STARTS
2vma | When the knowledge of these distinctions disappears, ritualism takes over, or else the limited use of such processes. When the use and possibility is limited, the effect is slight: it may even be harmful. As Saadi says: 'Though the fire-worshipper may tend his flame for a hundred years, if he falls into it, he will be killed.'
z4aw | Take prayer. When prayers are carried out among people with a certain preparation, and when due regard is taken for such things as correct attunement, there will be one effect of prayer. If people are encouraged to pray without these or other elements, their prayer may become a psychotherapeutic tool: immensely valuable, but nonetheless at a lower level than its optimum function.
mo0p | EMOTION MISTAKEN FOR HIGHER FEELINGS
tyxr | In such a case, emotional feelings are mistaken for spiritual ones. The only objection to such an activity is that a person or com- munity triggered to associating prayer with emotion will be al-
txaa | most incapable of developing further, because the conditioning invariably elicited by the sight, sound or participation in prayer will be an emotional one.
qz8s | Communities and individuals reared in the emotional and con- ditioned use of rituals and other procedures have to undergo a reorientation before they can perceive a higher content in such observances.
y7de | This is difficult, because such people generally seek a deepening of their familiar experience, not an improvement upon it.
rukn | Saadi says, in his Boston: 'Do not expect, my child, a reward from Omar, when you are working in the house of Zaid.'
5tu7 | DEFINITION OF A SUFI
vqgg | To learn, people must give up a great deal, and this includes ritual as something from which they imagine they might learn. It is to emphasise this that Abu-Yaqub al-Susi, quoted in Kalabadhi's Taaruf, states that the Sufi is 'One who does not care when some- thing is taken from him, but who does not cease to seek for what he has not.'
sbs5 | 126
n413 | Real andOstensible Self-Improvement
mvxd | Q: Does the Sufi school do anything about the automatism of man?
gyzb | A: Ostensibly, and as far as they understand, people may be trying to improve themselves.
rrp1 | In fact (as can be determined by studying what they are actually doing and what they really mean by what they say) they are often automatising or diverting themselves.
8b70 | This is only because they are working with a shallow use of the mind, an area which becomes conditioned comparatively easily.
nivt | Ironically, many who have heard of this process, and see it in others, think that they are immune from it by the very act of repeating that 'man becomes moribund, conditioned'. Yet this very repetition will automatise, condition him. Liberation, for such theoreticians, is farther than it is from the 'non-initiate', who has never heard of the argument.
8925 | It is possible to turn away from automatism by using techniques devised to outmanoeuvre it. But first we must register sufficiently deeply, not just frequently or excitedly, that such a process is needed. Second, we must discover whether the individual involved has the capacity to be deautomatised. Third, we must prescribe the treatment for that particular individual. Fourth, we must assess whether he will abide by the treatment.
y2tz | These are among the reasons for the techniques and
p769 | specialised studies of the real Sufi school.
jhwn | Some people are inwardly determined to retain their automat- ism, while trying to profit from a Sufi school's work. I think that that is the real problem. 'You are in the bonds of attending to the beard and turban,' says the Diwan of Shams-i-Tabriz, 'how will you gain the quaffer of the great goblet?'
o1y4 | The automatism of man is overcome, in the words of Dhun'Nun, by aiming for 'being as you were, where you were, before you were'.

2n4o | Roles of Teacher and Student
31ya | Q: How does the Sufi teacher overcome the fixed but unper- ceived biases of the student?
7nda | A: Let us look at the relative positions of the teacher and the student. The student regards the teacher as someone who has a quantity of something, and will give him a part of it. Or he may look upon him as someone who knows a method of achieving something.
4pv9 | The teacher sees the student as someone who is eligible for gaining a portion of something. In another sense he looks upon him as someone who can achieve something.
7w0x | Each in its own way, the attitudes of the two have a connection.
pehk | The problem of the teacher is greater than the problem of the student. One reason for this is that the student is anxious to learn but seldom realises that he can learn ONLY UNDER THE CONDITIONS WHICH MAKE THIS LEARNING POS- SIBLE.
h7hi | He cannot make real progress until he has undergone a prepara- tion for learning. When this preparation is complete, the student may progress slowly, rapidly or instandy through a number of phases in which he understands what he has called the meaning of life, or to know himself.
z8wk | The most important thing, therefore, is to get the student into an alignment in which his progress can be effective and continuous.
3fxr | This can only be directed by someone who knows the whole picture, and who knows what is possible and what is not, with an individual and a given group of people.
1rwa | Because the student is likely to be imprisoned by attitudes which have trained him, he will tend to approach the teacher, and the teaching, in all kinds of ineffective and minor ways. He will ask for 'peace of mind', progress in his worldly life, money, knowledge, illumination, assurances - all things which may be important in one way or another, but which are not necessarily
40h8 | 128
9w49 | relevant to his situation. In other words, he asks to be taught, or to be given, knowledge and things which HE HAPPENS TO BE WANTING FOR THE SOLE REASON THAT HE HAS DECIDED THAT THESE ARE NECESSARY OR URGENT.
kgl8 | This, from some viewpoints, is a ridiculous situation. It is as if a schoolboy were to say: 'Yes, teach me French, but teach me only at 4 p.m.', or 'I want to learn mathematics, but I will not do so in this particular class', or, again, 'I would like to learn the principles of biology, but first I must have some information about tadpoles, because to my mind they are the most important thing'.
kq4g | The fact is that you can learn only what you can be taught. If
qjp8 | you impose or interpose conditions gained from speculation, emo- tion , imagination, intellect and so on, you will still have to learn
pc64 | how to learn. This means finding out how to collect knowledge, stage by correct stage, without the foregoing limitations.
mbrx | The human being, not knowing what he really is, not knowing where he came from or where he can go to, is hardly in a position merely to assume that he should get his instruction in this or that form; or that before he does anything else his warts should be charmed or his house set in order in a way which he happens capriciously, or even dedicatedly, to demand.
pcd0 | The first duty of the teacher is to make this plain and not to compromise with the superficial sentiments which many people be- lieve are fundamentals.
txkp | Rumi says: 'You are a lover of your own experience not of me/You turn to me to feel your own emotion.'
mxqe | If you look at the way in which you approach things, including your desire to leam and its expression in action, and if you note what mistakes you have made and also what the Sufis say about the roles of teacher and student, you will realise that the fixed but unperceived biases of the student to which you refer need someone outside of the student to supply the stimuli which will enable him (or her) to escape from the trap of customary thinking-patterns.
y9ob | 129
twm6 | STUDENTS WHO DO NOT LEARN
8qsp | Sheikh Abdullah Ansari of Herat, recognised as one of the clearest exponents of the School, as well as one of its greatest sages, lists the things which people do and think which block their progress.
yck2 | These cause bafflement, sorrow and confusion. People who do not follow their teacher's prescriptions either remain in one of those conditions or else adopt some-often unperceived - psycho- logical stratagem which causes hypocrisy, fanaticism or imagined understanding.
hthe | These are the things which the student cannot measure in himself, and which the teacher attends to:
otjm | 'To want before it is due To desire more than is due To want for oneself what belongs to others.'
q0fv | Some people, of course, are so wilful that even if you tell them that you are not going to compromise with fixed biases, they will continue to battle. In such cases the teacher will disappoint their expectations by making himself out to be unsuitable to the student, borrowing from the Malamati techniques. Even then, the de- linquent student may not be able to understand what is going on, and will put all kinds of fanciful interpretations on the matter. Saadi, in the Gulistan, has a tale about this.
v9vo | TALE OF THE MUEZZIN
rwty | There was once a Muezzin who called the faithful to prayer with such an awful voice that the mosque trustee, a kindly man, offered him ten dinars to go to another town. Subsequendy he came across the trustee and said, 'You offered me only ten dinars to go to another town, but where I am now they are offering twenty, but I still refuse to leave.'
ki97 | The trustee laughed and said: 'Hold out, and you will find that they will even go as high as fifty.'
