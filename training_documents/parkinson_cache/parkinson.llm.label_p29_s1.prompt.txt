You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

sqxn | A. Soma: E-L system proteins that form structural and functional components are synthesized in the neuronal soma. Following production in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and post-translational modifications in the Golgi apparatus, proteins (e.g. lysosomal hydrolases) are packed into vesicles and delivered to the trans-Golgi network (TGN). In the TGN, based on the nature of post-translational modification, the vesicles are diverted either towards lysosomes (black arrows) or to the secretory pathway (red arrows). Vesicles that are destined for lysosomes bud off from the TGN to form early endosomes. Simultaneously, early endosomes carrying nutrients and surface receptors for recycling are also derived from the plasma membrane through clathrin mediated endocytosis (CME, purple arrows). These early endosomes, with the help of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT), pass through highly dynamic tubulovesicular structures like multivesicular bodies (MVB) and/or late endosomes before fusing with lysosomes. Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2

dl6i | (LRRK2) plays a significant role in this sorting, whereas Glucocerebrosidase 1 (GBA) and ATPase cation transporting 13A2 (ATP13A2) are crucial for normal lysosomal function. Early endosomes from the cell surface that are not sorted follow the recycling pathway back to the plasma membrane (blue arrows). Retrograde transport of receptors that are used for sorting from early endosomes to TGN occurs through the retromer complex where Vacuolar Protein Sorting 35 (VPS35) and VPS13C take part (yellow arrows). An expanding membrane sac called a phagophore sequesters malfunctioning organelles (e.g. sick mitochondria) and misfolded proteins to form a double-membraned autophagosomes. These later fuses with lysosomes and releases its contents for degradation and recycling of components; the complete process is called autophagy (green arrows). PTEN Induced Putative Kinase 1 (PINK1) and Parkin are important in identifying sick mitochondria and diverting them to a specialized form of autophagy called mitophagy.
89ub | B. Axon: Axons form a crucial bridge for retrograde transport of endosomes/ autophagosomes from presynaptic terminals to soma for lysosomal degradation. A gradual development of phagophore to full-fledged autophagosome happens within the axon (green arrows) as the encapsulated cargo arrives towards proximal end.
dhle | C. Synapse: Neurotransmitter release in the presynaptic terminal is regulated principally by the synaptic vesicle cycle, an integral part of the neuronal E-L system. Initially, endosomes derived from the soma forms synaptic vesicles (SV) in the nerve terminal where RME-8 plays a role in association with clathrin (yellow arrow). Neurotransmitters are loaded into these SVs through specialized transporters. Upon arrival of an action potential in the synaptic terminal, these SVs fuse with the plasma membrane at active sites and release neurotransmitters via exocytosis (black arrows). Empty SVs are then recycled through CME (Purple arrows). a-Synuclein and endophilin A play roles here in membrane bending and SV curvature formation. Clathrin forms a layer on these invaginations with the help of adaptors, and in conjunction with dynamin leads to membrane fission forming clathrin coated vesicles (CCV). Clathrin uncoating is a prerequisite for SV recycling, which is performed by coordinated action of auxilin, Hsc70, endothelin A1, and synaptojanin 1. Phosphorylation by LRRK2 is necessary for activation of these proteins. Synaptic autophagy and mitophagy are also crucial in maintaining the health of the presynaptic terminal (green arrows), where PINK1/Parkin are crucial.
