You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

pdjh | A global assessment of the social and conservation outcomes of protected areas
xmgs | Abstract: Protected areas (PAs) are a key strategy for protecting biological resources, but they vary con- siderably in their effectiveness and are frequently reported as having negative impacts on local people. This has contributed to a divisive and unresolved debate concerning the compatibility of environmental and socioeconomic development goals. Elucidating the relationship between positive and negative social impacts and conservation outcomes of PAs is key for the development of more effective and socially just conservation. We conducted a global meta-analysis on 165 PAs using data from 171 published studies. We assessed how PAs affect the well-being of local people, the factors associated with these impacts, and crucially the relationship between PAs' conservation and socioeconomic outcomes. Protected areas associated with posi- tive socioeconomic outcomes were more likely to report positive conservation outcomes. Positive conservation and socioeconomic outcomes were more likely to occur when PAs adopted comanagement regimes, empowered local people, reduced economic inequalities, and maintained cultural and livelihood benefits. Whereas the strictest regimes of PA management attempted to exclude anthropogenic influences to achieve biological conservation objectives, PAs that explicitly integrated local people as stakeholders tended to be more effective at achieving joint biological conservation and socioeconomic development outcomes. Strict protection may be needed in some circumstances, yet our results demonstrate that conservation and development objectives can be synergistic and highlight management strategies that increase the probability of maximizing both conservation performance and development outcomes of PAs.
bd9h | Una Evaluación Global de los Resultados Sociales y de Conservación de las Áreas Protegidas
m047 | Resumen: Las áreas protegidas (APs) son una estrategia clave para la protección de los recursos biológicos, pero estas varían considerablemente en su efectividad y son reportadas frecuentemente por tener impactos negativos sobre los habitantes locales. Esto ha contribuido a un debate divisivo y sin resolución con respecto a la compatibilidad de los objetivos de desarrollo socioeconómico y ecológico. Esclarecer la relación entre los impactos sociales positivos y negativos y los resultados de conservación de las APs es esencial para el desarrollo de una conservación más efectiva y más justa socialmente. Realizamos un meta-análisis de 165 APs usando datos de 171 estudios publicados. Evaluamos cómo las APs afectan al bienestar de los habitantes locales, los factores asociados con estos impactos y significativamente, la relación entre los resultados socioeconómicos y de conservación de las APs. Las APs asociadas con resultados socioeconómicos positivos tuvieron una mayor probabilidad de reportar resultados positivos de conservación. Los resultados positivos, tanto socioeconómicos como de conservación, tuvieron una mayor probabilidad de ocurrir cuando las APs adoptaron regímenes de co-manejo, les otorgaron poder a los habitantes locales, redujeron la inequidad económica y mantuvieron los
gy8c | beneficios culturales y de sustento. Mientras los regímenes más estrictos de manejo de APs intentaron excluir las influencias antropogénicas para alcanzar los objetivos de conservación biológica, las APs que integraron explícitamente a los habitantes locales como actores tuvieron la tendencia de ser más efectivos en la obtención de resultados conjuntos de desarrollo socioeconómico y de conservación. La protección estricta puede ser necesaria en algunas circunstancias, pero nuestros resultados demuestran que los objetivos de desarrollo y de conservación pueden ser sinérgicos. También resaltan las estrategias de manejo que incrementan la probabilidad de maximizar tanto al desempeño de la conservación como a los resultados de desarrollo de las APs.
y4mj | Introduction
vpgq | An alarming erosion of taxonomic and functional bio- diversity is occurring in half of tropical protected ar- eas (PAs) (Laurance et al. 2012). The magnitude of this decline is directly linked to human mediated habi- tat disruption, including land-use change, hunting, and exploitation of other forest-related resources. These human-induced pressures on PAs and conflict between biodiversity conservation and the needs of local people are predicted to increase due to numerous factors, in- cluding market forces and a reduction in distance be- tween PAs and human population centers (Joppa et al. 2008; McDonald et al. 2008). Conflicts between local people and conservation initiatives have generated one of the greatest and longest running debates in conserva- tion science (Roe 2008). At one end of the spectrum is the fences-and-fines approach, which contends that to deliver successful conservation outcomes people must be excluded, even forcibly, from PAs (Brockington & Igoe 2006). Opponents of this approach consider such exclusionist protection arrangements ethically troubling because they frequently result in PAs having disadvanta- geous social outcomes for local people that ultimately result in ineffective long-term conservation outcomes (Adams et al. 2004). An increasingly advocated strategy is that to deliver effective and long-term environmental pro- tection PAs must accommodate the needs of local people so as to secure sustainable livelihoods and enhance their well-being (Roe 2008). The debate between adherents to these two approaches and the importance of considering human well-being in conservation remains lively, intense, and unresolved (Soulé 2013; Marvier 2014).
ousl | A key factor limiting the resolution of this debate is the insufficient evidence base, which is currently lim- ited to individual case studies, with few studies specifi- cally testing causal pathways (e.g., Andam et al. 2010) and lack of a global analysis (Geldmann et al. 2013). Available case studies do, however, usefully highlight several key issues (Table 1). First, social impacts of PAs take different forms, including economic, livelihood, and cultural impacts, and can result directly from PA poli- cies, such as hunting regulations, or indirectly through
m4ju | wider social and economic changes, for example the ef- fects of increased tourism (Holmes & Brockington 2012). Second, how local people experience and respond to the social impacts of PAs is influenced by socio-political contexts at both local and regional scales (Brockington & Igoe 2006; Nelson & Agrawal 2008). Third, impacts of PAs are unevenly distributed. They are felt most in- tensely at local rather than national scales and within communities along lines of class, gender, ethnicity, and caste; benefits tend to accrue to the wealthiest and most powerful and costs fall on the weakest and poorest (Holmes 2007).
a0mb | The lack of a global study on the impact of key recur- ring factors affecting PA socioeconomic and conservation outcomes has resulted in three specific knowledge gaps (Adams & Hutton 2007; Mascia & Claus 2009): how the socioeconomic and biodiversity conservation outcomes of PAs are linked to specific social impacts; how social impacts are influenced by the management and other characteristics of PAs; and how social impacts relate to socioeconomic and biodiversity conservation outcomes, given the insufficient performance of many PAs. Address- ing these questions is critical for the design of efficient and effective conservation and development interven- tions that meet both biodiversity conservation targets and socioeconomic needs.
ki8m | We conducted a global review and analysis of the sci- entific literature that addresses these knowledge gaps re- garding the principal drivers of the social impacts of PAs and their consequences for biodiversity conservation. We used data from 160 terrestrial and marine PAs distributed across six continents and that were representative of all International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) PA management and governance categories (Supporting Information). We quantified and determined how PAs' geographical, physical, and management characteristics were associated with their social impacts (Table 1). We then evaluated how these geographical, physical, and management characteristics were associated with over- all PA socioeconomic and biodiversity conservation out- comes and assessed whether these two contrasting types of outcomes trade off against each other or are positively associated.
