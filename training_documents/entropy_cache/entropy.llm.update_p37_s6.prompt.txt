You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

013l | Say a system with finitely many states maximizes entropy subject to a constraint on the expected value of some quantity E that we choose to call 'energy'. Then its probability of being in the ith state is proportional to exp(-BE;) for some number .
4flw | When ß is big and positive, the probability of being in a state of high energy is tiny, since exp(-ßE;) gets very small for large energies Ej. This means our system is cold.
pzyx | Conversely when ß is small and positive, exp(-ßE;) drops off very slowly as the energy E; gets bigger. So, high-energy states become quite likely when ß is small and positive. This means our system is hot.
qc4k | It turns out 3 is inversely proportional to the temperature more about that later. But in modern physics ß is just as important as temperature. It comes straight from the principle of maximum entropy!
btsb | So ß deserves a name. And its name is 'coolness'.
s1u0 | By the way, the formula
ju0a | Pi xe BEi
e4y0 | is only strictly true when ß is finite. There's also a limiting case ß -> +0, when pi = 0 except for states of the very lowest energy. And there's a limiting case ß -> -0, where Pi = 0 where except for states of the very highest energy. I'll say a bit about these oddities later. First I'll say more about what coolness has to do with temperature.
kpra | COOLNESS VERSUS TEMPERATURE
egbi | Coolness 3 is inversely proportional to temperature T:
bnhs | where k is Boltzmann's constant.
ktv2 | Coolness is measured in joules-1, temperature is measured in kelvin, and Boltzmann's constant is a conversion factor:
woy6 | k =1.380649.10-23 joules kelvin
6xev | In statistical mechanics, coolness is inversely proportional to temperature. But coolness has units of energy-1, not temperature-1. So we need a constant to convert between coolness and inverse temperature! And this constant is very interesting.
u2ud | Remember: when a system maximizes entropy with a constraint on its expected energy, the probability of it having energy E is proportional to exp(-ßE) where ß is its coolness. But we can only exponentiate dimensionless quantities! (Why?) So ß has dimensions of 1/energy.
3qum | Since coolness is inversely proportional to temperature, we must have ß = 1/kT where k is some constant with dimensions of energy/temperature. This constant k is called 'Boltzmann's constant'. It's tiny:
obst | k = 1.380649 . 10-23 joules/kelvin.
3mg9 | This is mainly because we use units of energy, joules, suited to macroscopic objects like a cup of hot water. Boltzmann's constant being tiny reveals that such things have enormously many microscopic states!
4j8f | Later we'll see that a single classical point particle, in empty space, has energy 3kT/2 when it's maximizing entropy at temperature T. The 3 here is because the atom can move in 3 directions, the 1/2 because we integrate x2 to get this result. The important part is kT. The kT says: if an ideal gas is made of atoms, each atom contributes just a tiny bit of energy per kelvin, or degree Celsius: roughly 10-23 joules. So a little bit of gas, like a gram of hydrogen, must have roughly 1023 atoms in it. This is a very rough estimate, but it's a big deal.
e3ba | Indeed, the number of atoms in a gram of hydrogen is about 6 . 1023. You may have heard of Avogadro's number-this is quite close to that. So Boltzmann's constant gives a hint that matter is made of atoms-and even better, a nice rough estimate of how many per gram!
8c0j | Later we will see that Boltzmann's constant has another important meaning: it's a fundamental unit of entropy, a nat, expressed in joules/kelvin.
urfd | TEMPERATURE
whtg | If a system has finitely many states with energies Ei, in thermal equilibrium at temperature T the probability that it's in the ith state is Pi xx exp(-Ei/kT)
2u5k | where k is Boltzmann's constant and T can be positive, negative, or even infinite:
f8wg | T = 00
hgz1 | T < 0
khf5 | T> 0
ya4d | A system with finitely many states can be pretty weird. It can have negative tem- perature! Even weirder: as you heat it up, its temperature becomes large and positive, then it reaches infinity, and then it 'wraps around' and become large and negative.
dzub | The reason: coolness is more fundamental than temperature. The coolness ß is inversely proportional to the temperature T:
oidq | 3 = 1/kT.
fp0u | When the temperature goes up to infinity and then suddenly becomes a large nega- tive number, it's really just the coolness going down to zero and becoming negative. Temperatures 'wrap around' infinity, as shown in the picture.
34lv | A system with finitely many states can have negative or infinite temperature because in thermal equilibrium, its probability of being in the ith state is
gmoh | exp(-ßE;) n Lexp(-BEi) i=1
2xvo | Pi
fhh2 | where E; is the energy of the ith state, and this makes sense for any ß E R. Moreover, the probability pi depends continously on , even as ß passes through zero. This means a large positive temperature is almost like a large negative temperature!
c2q0 | But the circle of temperature can be misleading. Temperatures wrap around T = 00 but not T = 0. A system with a small positive temperature is very different from one with a small negative temperature! That's because pi for B >> 0 is very different than it is for ß < 0.
4wwg | For a system with finitely many states we can take the limit of the Boltzmann distribution when ß -> +0; then the system will only occupy its lowest-energy state or states. We can also take the limit when 3 -> -co; then the system will only occupy its highest-energy state or states. In terms of temperature, this means that the limit where T approaches zero from above is very different than the limit where T approaches zero from below.
ix7t | So, for a system with finitely many states, the best picture of possible thermal equilibria is not a circle of temperatures but a closed interval of coolness: the coolness ß can be anything in [-0, +x], which topologically is a closed interval. In terms of coolness, too is different from -0, but approaching 0 from above is the same as approaching it from below. But in terms of temperature, approaching 0 from above is different from approaching 0 from below, while a temperature of too is the same as a temperature of -0.
a46e | Now, if all this seems very weird, here's why: we often describe physical systems using infinitely many states, with a lowest possible energy but no highest possible energy. In this case the sum in the Boltzmann distribution can't converge for ß < 0, so negative temperatures are ruled out.
ozpq | However, some physical systems can be approximately described using a finite set of states (or in quantum theory, a finite-dimensional Hilbert space of states). Then the things I just said hold true! And people enjoy studying these systems, and their strange properties, in the lab.
22sy | It's good to look at a simple example, and work everything out explicitly:
kuwj | Puzzle 25. Suppose a system has two states with energies E1 / E2. Compute the probabilities pi that it is in either of these states in thermal equilibrium as a function of the coolness B. Then express these probabilities as a function of the temperature T. Using these functions pi(T):
b3n9 | . Show that when 0 < T < +oo the system is more likely to be in the lower-energy state: P1(T) > p2(T).
