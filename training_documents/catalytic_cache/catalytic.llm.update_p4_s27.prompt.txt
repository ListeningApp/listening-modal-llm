You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

uodj | Raman spectra were conducted to characterize the graphitiza- tion degree. Typically, the band at 1350 cm-1, known as D-band, is assigned to defect sites or the disordered sp2 carbon. The G band at 1580 cm-1 is corresponded to the in-plane vibrational mode of sp2 hybridized carbon.33 The intensity ratio of <LATEX>I _ { \mathrm { D } } / I _ { \mathrm { G } }</LATEX> values for FC- 0-8, FC-1-8 and FC-1-8-HCl are 1.30, 0.99 and 1.00, respectively (Fig. 2d). Compared with FC-0-8, the lower <LATEX>I _ { \mathrm { D } } / I _ { \mathrm { G } }</LATEX> values of FC-1-8 and FC-1-8-HCl indicated a relatively short-range order graphitic carbon because of the treatment of K2FeO4. Furthermore, the <LATEX>\mathrm { X }</LATEX> ray photoelectron spectrum verified the existence of C, O and Fe elements in the surface of FC-1-8 (as illustrated in Fig. 2e).32 The high-resolution spectra Fe 2p orbit showed two dominant peaks at 711.0 and 713.1 eV, which were indexed to the <LATEX>2 \mathrm { p } _ { 3 / 2 }</LATEX> orbitals of <LATEX>F e ^ { 2 + }</LATEX> and <LATEX>\mathrm { F e } ^ { 3 ^ { 4 } } ,</LATEX> respectively (Fig. 2f). The peaks located at a binding energy of 724.6 eV, 726.4 eV and 718.5 eV were assigned to <LATEX>\mathrm { F e } ^ { 2 }</LATEX> and <LATEX>\mathrm { F e } ^ { 3 + }</LATEX> for the <LATEX>2 p _ { 1 / 2 }</LATEX> band, and a satellite.34
k16v | To evaluate the surface morphology and structure of the samples, SEM measurements of FC-0-8, FC-1-8 and FC-1-8-HCl were conducted (Fig. 3). After annealed in <LATEX>\mathrm { A r }</LATEX> atmosphere at 800 ℃, the as-prepared carbon spheres (FC-0-8) became black and maintained a similar structure and the carbon spheres interconnected forming the 3D network, which was favorable to electron transfer. Besides, FC-1-8 and FC-1-8-HCl generally inherited their structure except for the rough surface of carbon spheres. Furthermore, a comparison of SEM images revealed that the average diameter of the FC-1-8-HCl sample was a little bit smaller than that of FC-1-8 after the removal of Fe3C/Fe NPs. Convinced by the particle size distributions (Fig. S2+), as measured by a statistical method measuring the diameter of 100 particles, the average size of FC-1-8 decreased from ~450 nm to <LATEX>\sim 2 4 0</LATEX> nm after being etched by HCl.
b2lm | The TEM images of FC-0-8 presented disordered carbon lattice fringes (Fig. 4a-c), suggesting the existence of amorphous carbon. As shown in Fig. 4d-f, the HRTEM of FC-1-8 was composed of graphitic carbon and Fe NPs. The lattice fringe with a spacing of 0.34 nm corresponded to the (002) plane of carbon and the lattice fringe calculated to be 0.20 nm and 0.24 nm were assigned to the (101) plane of Fe and (111) plane of Fe3C, respectively. Obviously, the existence of metallic Fe contributed to the formation of graphitic carbon. The corresponding elemental mappings of C and Fe further verified that the rough surface of carbon spheres should be Fe3C/Fe NPs (Fig. 4g-i). Part of FC-1-8-HCl NPs showed irregular structure while the HRTEM images in Fig. 41 confirmed the existence of graphitic carbon.
ti7f | The whole process was economic and environmentally friendly without any toxic or hazardous materials input. FC-1-8 and FC-1-8-HCl were expected to be excellent electrode mate- rials. On the one hand, the partial graphitization with hierar- chical porosity structure could offer large SSA value and electroactive sites. On the other hand, the graphitic carbon ensured conductivity of the sample.
oksu | 3.3 Electrochemical performance
wtow | Electrochemical properties of the obtained carbon material were examined under a voltage window from -1.2 to -0.3 V at a scan rate of 100 mV s-1 initially in a three-electrode configuration. As shown in Fig. 5a, the FC-1-8 electrode displayed a larger area than the other two samples, implying a larger capacitance value. A pair of explicit and symmetrical cathodic and anodic peaks can be observed in the CV curve of FC-1-8, implying a kind of pseudo- capacitive behavior. It was reported that Fe3C species can be oxidized to <LATEX>\mathrm { F e } _ { 3 } O _ { 4 }</LATEX> irreversibly in the KOH electrolyte and result in the reversible redox reaction of the newly formed Fe3O4 material as expressed by the following eqn (3).21
o22k | <LATEX>F e _ { 3 } O _ { 4 } + 4 H _ { 2 } O + 2 e ^ { - } \Rightarrow 3 F e \left( O H \right) _ { 2 } + 2 O H</LATEX> (3)
nwfz | Notably, the graphitic FC-1-8-HCl displayed a much larger integral area than FC-0-8, which convincingly demonstrated excellent energy storage performance. In other words, carbon materials with higher graphitization degree exhibit superior Faraday capacitance. In detail, according to the GCD profiles,
nvfy | the FC-1-8 and FC-1-8-HCl electrodes can deliver the specific capacitance as high as 428.0 and <LATEX>2 4 3 . 3 F g ^ { - 1 } a t 1 A g ^ { - 1 } ,</LATEX> whereas the specific capacitance of FC-0-8 are only 84.3 F g 1 at 1 A g 1 (Fig. 5b). The capacitance value of FC-1-8 outperforms most reported Fe-based carbon materials in Table 2.
