You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

06yq | Microdosing with psychedelics to self-medicate for ADHD symptoms in adults: A naturalistic study

8r5j | ABSTRACT
2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

333g | Ibn Arabi taught through what was apparently love-poetry, and people became bitterly hostile towards him. This behaviour of theirs was due to their inability to understand the projection which he was using, not to the reality of their imaginings. But their suppositions about him and his work were firmly believed by them to represent the truth, to be factual in nature. In his case, he was able to teach them further by providing a commentary which satisfied them and caused them to hail him as a great mystic. But in so doing, since they had not arrived at this understanding through inward and personal perception, they were cut off from
6kja | 102
fmi5 | the benefits of the material's actual use within themselves. They were only intellectually and emotionally satisfied. Their perception of him was limited to a reassurance that his ideas did not conflict with their own ingrained beliefs.
bqn5 | It is this mentality of what is in fact superficial assessment which causes the poverty of potential understanding in people who seek only explanation and not perceptions.

jzqz | Stories of the Miraculous
0uje | Q: Are the 'miraculous' stories of the doings of Sufis literally true, or are they designed to illustrate structures equivalent to what may happen, or are they intended to make people credulous or to 'think in a new way?'
apx3 | A: The answer is the same as the answer to such a question as 'Is a carrot yellow, is it intended to give nourishment, or to propagate itself, or to make up stories about?' The truth is that, under the right circumstances all of the factors may be true, according to what use is made of them.
kcrm | You can use dervish tales to impress people, if they want to be impressed or if you gain anything from such deception, and many people do actually do so.
mbsp | Again, the hearers can misuse them if they insist upon being impressed, or upon being cynical about them. They almost always, too, contain structures and immediate values which may be ana- logical; and they may be again and again repeated in actual events, which makes them literally true when they recur in their cyclical fashion.
zynb | Q: Can I have an example of one which you can remember as actually having happened, as well as being traditional and as representing a pattern?
8h0u | THE KING AND THE WOODCUTTER
b09f | A: Here is one, very well known among the Afghans, and attributed nowadays to Ahmad Shah the first king of modern Afghanistan:
zutp | Ahmad Shah was crowned King with a wreath by a certain dervish, respected by all. From that time on, he often wore the dervish mande, and roamed among his subjects, seeking to im- prove the quality of his rule.
qgmy | 104
40wi | One day he visited, in this disguise, a woodcutter, living in a forest shack. 'What would you do if you could not sell your wood?' he asked. 'Respected Dervish,' said the woodcutter, T would trust in God and find something.'
a418 | The next day the king had it proclaimed that no woodcutters were to be allowed into the city, and a day or two later visited the man again, in his disguise.
e9lu | 'How are you living, now that the King has taken such a strange attitude towards woodcutters?' he asked.
a278 | .Well, now I make leather belts and sell them to the shops. Trusting in God, I have enough to eat.'
ffto | The king left him and some time later issued an edict that no item of leather was to be sold in the shops.
ak21 | When Ahmad Shah visited his poor woodcutter-leather-belt- maker again, he said: 'How are you getting on, now that Fate seems to be pursuing you and has stopped your new career?'
i7n1 | 'Sir,' said the other man, 'I trust in God and work as a market porter. All is well, and I have enough to eat.'
m9yn | Ahmad Shah now caused all market porters to be conscripted into the Palace Guard, without any pay, and not even to be given anywhere to sleep.
cg8u | That night the king went in his dervish cloak to see his friend, and found him in his hut, eating some food and whittling wood.
2hsv | "What are you doing?' asked the king. 'I have been taken into the Royal Guard, but without food or anywhere to sleep,' said the man; 'so I have pawned the sword they issued me, bought the necessary food, and I am making a dummy sword until my future shall further be known.'
7s7l | The king went back to his palace.
uwdf | The following morning the Commander of the Guard called the woodcutter and ordered him to behead a prisoner. They walked together to the place of execution, where the king, as was the custom, was waiting. The woodcutter did not recognise the king in his crown and royal robes, but saying 'Trusting in God', he drew his wooden sword and awaited the order to strike. The prisoner said: 'In the Name of God, may this sword refuse to cut-for I am innocent!' The wood-cutter dropped his sword on the ground. After an investigation the condemned man was
jjgp | 105
df4g | found to be innocent after all. Ahmad Shah was so impressed that he made this man his Grand Vizier. From that time the Afghan kings always used before their names 'Al Mutawakkil ala Allah' - he who trusts in God.
qc2j | EMOTIONAL CRAVING
x3oh | People who are interested in the miraculous will either 'consume' wonder-tales from emotional craving, or may allow them to operate as alternative ways of thinking about things, to exercise the part of the mind which says: 'stereotyped reactions are constricting'.
fqvx | The automatic and emotional reactions alike are part of the secondary self and do not represent perception of truth.
viae | Sirri al-Saqati, who died in 867 of the Christian Era, said:
p8u9 | 'True wisdom is: non-attachment to self and devotion to Truth.'
49ky | 106
p5wo | Continuous versus Effective Activity
74rp | CONTINUOUS activity, labels, a conditioned sense of importance or progress, the attainment of lesser goals on a shallow plane, these tend to be the body and bone of many a human system whose members expect much more of it than it can deliver.
oolg | Since it supplies social needs, keeps people occupied and re- lieves strains, it is believed to be-not just that, but something of a higher order.
3ewf | On the other hand the teaching method and the study which is discontinuous, which does not use the reward-and-punishment motif, which works with whom it can and when and where it can - the Sufi way - is regarded by the children of automatism as less ful- filling, less interesting, less attractive.
5iea | It would be less important, and should be less interesting, if there were an alternative. That is to say, if it were possible to achieve insight, fulfillment, illumination, know yourself, higher consciousness, and so on, through the mechanical organisation. In such a case there would be no need for the Sufi system: it would be irrelevant and ineffective.
62l5 | But these are not the alternatives. It is only when this is under- stood that people can approach the Sufi study and can profit from it. Until then they are always hankering after either:
shub | "A system which will be revealed to them if only they will endure the confusions of the Sufis;
zjn5 | Themselves being able to force order out of what they un- consciously imagine to be the chaotic state of the Sufi pro- jection;
w8ia | "or something to which they can transfer which may resemble the Sufi one to them, but which offers the kind of stimuli which they crave.
4vej | This is no new problem. But it must be stated constantly. If it is learned, real learning outside of the strait-jacket and blinkers of shallower activity can begin.
8ut1 | But how is this done, where do we start?
6o35 | 107
8r63 | It is done by lodging the idea firmly in the mind with at least as much durability as the fantasies which oppose it and which masquerade as fact; we start by making sure that we have ab- sorbed the statement, and that we don't just gobble it up and ask for the next piece of attractive news.
qze0 | HUMANS AS DEMONS
o3m2 | Remember what Rumi said, and you will see how people chain themselves with their desires, which are not the same as their potentialities:
kro9 | Humans are demons and lust is their chain It drags them to the shop and field This chain is composed of fear and anxiousness Do not see this creation as chainless: It pulls them to effort and chase It pulls them to the mines and to the sea.
i438 | Capacity comes before Opinion
yr7b | Q: Some people say they can learn through studying books, others that there isn't anything worthwhile in books, and others that they haven't found the right books yet. What are your re- actions to this sort of thing?
60hk | A: I can't do better than repeat an old story told by a Sufi. He described how at one time he looked for books and did not find them; then he found them and thought that everything was in them; then he decided that there was nothing in them. Finally, but only after going through all these phases - and phases they are -he realised which were the books useful to him, and what their use really was.
5djf | What had been wrong was his attitude of accepting or rejecting books before he himself attained the capacity to study the matter properly. He was forming opinions without first developing ordi- nary capacities further; and asking for things without being able to profit from them.
hem5 | He should have started with more common sense.
vfd9 | Rumi speaks of people who rely upon the written word as sometimes being no more than donkeys laden with books. Why do people always wonder whether books are any good, without won- dering whether they are themselves in a state to profit from them?
jkgk | When I was first taught this, I was given this saying, so that by calling it to mind I could again experience the shallowness of the discussions about books, as carried out in so many circles:
8nom | 'Premature independence is the daughter of conceit.'
vsjd | If you write the question down and look at it, you will, I think (and hope) at once see that it is not a question about Sufi learning, but about books. This person is concentrating on the idea of books, not the ideas in the books.

prly | Sanctified Greed
2epy | SUFI study is in some ways more difficult, in others easier, than other forms of study involving man's development of himself.
v55t | It is more difficult, for instance, because many of the approaches and behaviour-patterns needed by Sufic study are not naturalised in ordinary culture: they have not been needed by societies in order to form and sustain themselves up to a certain point.
53fa | It is easier, again, to approach many Sufi patterns because we already have the analogy of thought-patterns and behaviour- instruction being passed down by the culture for establishing and maintaining itself: the principle is there.
nnb3 | But sometimes the two are in conflict-or seem to be. For example, the undifferentiated desire for attention and frequent stimuli intakes in common-denominator rhythm is known to everyone. In most human cultures, especially in the cruder forms, this stimulus-intake has been harnessed to the culture's own service. It has not been analysed and divided up as, for instance, you would divide (in the case of food) appetite from nutritional requirement and again from taste, flavour, habit and greed.
s943 | So, taking our example, people have sanctified greed-so long as it is the kind of greed prized by the society. All other kinds of greed are labelled 'bad', but acceptable greed is labelled 'good moti- vation', only too often. This diversion of greed into national, tribal and similar objectives only perpetuates addictive behaviour. People develop a taste for, say, attention; the society says: 'Yes, you may have it-all you have to do is to seek our approval by works of charity, heroism' - whatever the society in question thinks it wants or needs. Such approved works not infrequently cause in- justice to others.
o7zd | Because the victim seeks and gets stimuli, he is generally fully occupied with this, and fails to see that he is being manipulated, or that he has a compulsion. His spectrum of perception of the (in this case) acquisitive is never developed. It is as if he had a sense of touch but could not tell fine from rough, or hot from cold. He
thxo | is correspondingly at a disadvantage in respect to people who nave a finer sense and also in respect to his and his society's possible variety, including the solution of problems.
b67w | As he has never been told that there is sensitive touch, (to continue the analogy) he cannot perceive it As he gets approval from using coarse touch, he is at the mercy of those people and institutions which lay down the rules. As he does not conceive the possibility of anything more sophisticated, he has no chance of finding it. Because it does not exist, of course, within the terms of his conventions, in his tribe. Or he may imagine the possibility, but be wrong in his choice of method of developing it.
hoze | This is, of course, the pre-rational, pre-scientific, pre-organised state. It is referred to by Sufis as the 'All Soup has Lumps in It* situation: after the tale of the yokel who wouldn't accept lumpless soup because he hadn't encountered it before, and refused to eat it.
hd71 | So he is not only coarse, he is an addict. How can he be cured?
eix9 | He can be cured by experience. But first he must conceive the possibility. Next he must be exposed to it but only after he has attained 'spare capacity', time and alignment which will allow him to focus on the problem. He can never do so while the only alternatives which he is offered are simply other forms of addic- tion.
h4p4 | He must get used to the idea that he is automatised even while he is gulping the panacea called 'I am not going to be auto- matised!'
asp2 | He may have to try again and again. Saadi, in his Boston, 'The Orchard' says: 'Not every oyster holds a pearl/Not every time does the archer hit the target'
8d1n | Psychic Idiots
559s | Q: Is there any quick, rule-of-thumb way of telling whether a person is serious and capable of learning in the Sufi Way?
rhb6 | A: If there is any, it is this: serious people are prepared to start at the beginning and go a step at a time, to 'start the jour- ney of a thousand miles with one single step'; people who are not serious are looking for miracles and stimuli and 'advanced work'.
dpdb | Q: What produces, and what sustains, this unsuitability ?
lek9 | A: Vanity, which is why most systems require humility.
i22c | Q: If most systems require this, why does it not work?
ofle | A: Because most systems end up by making imagined humility into a form of vanity, so they end up with vanity just the same.
ezbr | You can perceive a person's aspiration if it is genuine, because this creates a change in the emanations from such a person.
tpiw | USELESS PRAYER
dgkq | Omar Khayyam said:
hxjr | They went, and none returned again
2yv3 | To tell you the telling of that beyond
opoe | You won't gain anything through automatic prayer
vr2v | Prayer is worthless without sincerity and true aspiration.
m4jl | This second question, about unsuitability, interests me rather more than the first, about 'Quick, rule-of-thumb methods.' Has the enquirer ever asked himself what he could do with such a method?
59hi | Q: But surely prayer, properly carried out, can prepare for proper learning?
ua3p | 112
0a2t | A: 'Properly learned' is the operative phrase. People who pray and who do not attend to the necessary change in themselves as its basis, are not the same as those who really do pray. People who pray have to be altered by prayer, and this alteration is partly manifested in their behaviour and temperament.
