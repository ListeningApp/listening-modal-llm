You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

k0bw | Meninges in MS patients include inflammatory B cell infiltrates, and a greater load of these injects to the severity of cortical lesions, neurodegeneration, and clinical impairment. B cells may serve as Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) reservoirs [53,54]. After EBV infection, B cells transform into antigen-processing cells, resulting in a more precise presentation of antigens. Recombinant human myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein was shown to be internalized and cross-presented by EBV-infected B-cells, which were efficiently identified by cytotoxic CD8+ T-cells. Furthermore, B cells obtained from MS patients had more CD40 on their surface, indicating that B cells deliver antigens more effectively [24]. Increased expression of B cell activation markers in individuals with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) was related to a high degree of neurodegeneration, as indicated by a rise in the number of T1 hyperintense lesions and a decrease in brain
aq5a | volume. In addition to B-cell-related diseases, loss of normal functioning in the effector T-cell population can contribute to the course of MS [24]. In healthy people, CD8+ cytotoxic T cells that eliminate EBV- infected lymphoblastoid cell lines keep EBV infection under control. Since particular cytotoxic CD8+ cells are prepared to identify and kill infected cells that express EBV latent proteins, they will be referred to as "latency-specific T cells" from now on. During MS exacerbation, the EBV-specific T-cell population expands, and the latency-specific CD8+ T-cell activity increases. However, as MS progresses, latency-specific CD8+ T- cells exhibit a fatigued phenotype and cannot inhibit the proliferation of latently infected cells. This results in a vicious loop in which an increased number of infected cells inhibits the autoregulatory system and further depletes T cells. Recurrent relapses can be linked to poor management of EBV reactivation, leading to increased infection of naive B cells and viral generation [24].
sc5y | Antigen presentation to T cells and releasing chemicals that may harm oligodendrocytes are additional pathogenic pathways involving B cells in MS [54]. Microglia and macrophages release many cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-«, and interleukin (IL)-1ß, which can contribute to neurodegeneration through cytokine-induced cell death, inhibition of astrocytic glutamate reuptake, and induction of dysfunctional ribonucleic acid-binding proteins. Microglia and macrophages can also release glutamate, which might contribute to glutamate excitotoxicity and neurodegeneration. Microglia and macrophages produce reactive oxygen/nitrogen species, which can contribute to dementia by generating oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage. Microglia can also express anti-inflammatory phenotypes, promoting remyelination [54].
0yab | Clinical presentation
w95z | When a patient arrives with a clinically isolated condition, MS is often assumed. Depending on the location of the eloquent lesion, it could be uni- or multisymptomatic. Brainstem, spinal cord syndrome, and optic neuritis are the most common presentations; nevertheless, there are various other, less typical presentations, including cortical presentations such as dominant parietal lobe syndromes [57]. Relapses of MS often develop subacutely over hours or days, plateau for many weeks, and then recover gradually. In early MS, gross clinical recovery after relapse typically looks complete; however, most relapses leave behind damage [58]. For instance, gross visual acuity may improve after acute optic neuritis, but impairments in color vision, contrast sensitivity, and depth perception remain. As the neuronal reserve is depleted, recovery from relapses becomes insufficient, and neuron deficiencies accumulate, resulting in permanent impairment [59]. On magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), approximately 10 "asymptomatic" lesions are seen for each clinical attack. A minor lesion in the eloquent region is likely to produce symptoms. Macroscopic or MRI-visible lesions are only the tip of the iceberg; many more lesions are apparent at the microscopic level, and many more are in deep and cortical gray matter. Secondary progressive MS occurs approximately 10-15 years after the beginning of RRMS, with a steady progression from isolated relapses to a slowly progressing disease. There is no clear transition between the disease categories; relapses occur against a backdrop of gradual progression until passage becomes predominant [59]. Cognitive impairment and an increase in MRI atrophy in early MS imply neurodegeneration from the outset of clinical symptoms. In 5 to 15% of cases, primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) is characterized by the slow accumulation of progressive impairment that affects the dominant neural system [57]. Progressive spastic paraparesis is the most prevalent manifestation of PPMS, although sensory ataxia, cerebellar ataxia, cognitive impairment, and advanced visual failure are well-described variations. There has been a decline in the percentage of individuals with PPMS [57,58].
0i1k | Diagnosis
dqlg | McDonald's criteria are widely used in both clinical and research settings. In light of scientific advancements over the past seven years, these guidelines may no longer offer the most current information for physicians and researchers [60,61]. MS Diagnosis examined the McDonald criteria and suggested modifications
p6pq | [60]. McDonald's standards in 2017 continue to apply primarily to patients with a specific clinically isolated disease, define what is necessary to fulfill the spread in time and space of CNS lesions, and highlight that there must be no alternative explanation for the presentation [60,61] (Table 1).
zse6 | McDonald criteria
p2n3 | None. Clinical evidence is adequate. Further evidence is desirable.
ohh7 | Transmission in space as shown by MRI, or waiting for additional clinical research involving a different site.
vbni | Timing of dissemination exhibited by MRI or second attack or demonstration of OCBs in the CSF.
dgcw | Year of disease development and spread in space, demonstrated by1 or more T2 lesions in the brain in areas characterized by MS 2 or more T2 spinal cord focal lesions with positive CSF.
gvwz | Management and treatment
sk5m | Current therapy options focus on treating acute episodes, alleviating symptoms, and decreasing biological activity. The predominant therapy for MS is disease-modifying medications such as dimethyl fumarate, interferon-beta, natalizumab, and fingolimod. When the diagnosis of MS is obtained, immediate treatment should proceed. Short-term objectives include reducing MRI lesion activity. Long-term goals involve preventing secondary progressive MS. After beginning the medication, patient compliance and drug toxicity monitoring are the key concerns [3,62].
qws8 | Ocrelizumab selectively depletes CD20-expressing B cells while retaining preexisting humoral immunity and the ability to reconstitute B cells. B cell depletion is associated with potent interruption of B-cell trafficking from the periphery to the CNS, decreased presentation of B cell antigens to T cells, modulation of proinflammatory cytokine secretion by B cells, and reduced activation and differentiation of immunoglobulin-secreting plasma blasts. Ocrelizumab is administered every 24 weeks by intravenous infusion. The initial results of the phase 3 trial suggested a low potential risk of increased malignancies, including breast cancer; however, prolonged follow-up showed cancer rates that were consistent with the expected epidemiological rates. Although significant herpes virus infections are now a documented side effect, post-marketing research is typically consistent with clinical trials [63,64]. It is indicated to cure relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS) and PPMS. According to the label, two 300 mg initial doses are delivered two weeks apart, followed by 600 mg every six months. To prevent infusion reactions, patients should be premedicated 30-60 minutes before ocrelizumab infusion with 100 mg of methylprednisolone and antihistamine. Observe patients for 60 minutes after injection of ocrelizumab injection [62-64].
