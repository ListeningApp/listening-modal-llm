        "content": "1ocm | Mid-Level Grounding Instead of grounding the LLM generation to low-level actions by using downstream data from a specific environment, we focus on high-level to mid-level grounding such that we evaluate raw knowledge of LLMs as closely and broadly as possible. Hence, we only consider the most prominent challenge in mid-level grounding that the generated plans must satisfy all common-sense constraints characterized by executability metric. As a result, we assume there is a low-level controller that can execute these mid-level actions such as \"grab cup\", and we do not investigate the usefulness of LLMs for low-level sensorimotor behavior grounding. To perform sensorimotor grounding, such as navigation and interaction mask prediction, domain-specific data and fine-tuning are likely required.\n527v | Ignorant of Environment Context We do not incorporate observation context or feedback into our models. To some extent, we approach LLMs in the same way as how VirtualHome asks human annotators to write action plans for a given human activity by imagination, in which case humans similarly do not observe environment context. Similar to human-written plans, we assume the plans generated by LMs only refer to one instance of each object class. As a result, successful plan generation for tasks like \"stack two plates on the right side of a cup\" is not possible.\nlrri | Evaluation Protocol We measure quality of plans by a combination of executability and correctness instead of one straightforward metric. To the best of our knowledge, there isn't a known way to computationally assess the semantic correctness of the plans due to the tasks' open-ended and multi-modal nature. Prior work also adopt similar combination of metrics. We report two metrics individually to shine light on the deficiencies of existing LLMs which we hope could provide insights for future works. To provide a holistic view, we report results by combining two metrics in Section five point two.\n5cl9 | We believe addressing each of these shortcoming will lead to exciting future directions. We also hope these findings can inspire future investigations into using pre-trained LMs for goal-driven decision-making problems and grounding the learned knowledge in embodied environments.\nu7a3 | For each evaluated method, we perform grid search over the following hyperparameters:\nw409 | For methods that use fixed example across evaluated tasks, we search over the following three randomly chosen examples:\nm04y | Human evaluations are conducted on Amazon Mechanical Turk. For each method, we generate action plans for all eighty-eight high-level tasks. To account for the expressivity of the VirtualHome environment, we include action plans written by human experts from the VirtualHome dataset as references in our human evaluations. The evaluations are conducted in the form of questionnaires containing all action plans whose order is randomly shuffled and whose corresponding methods are unknown to the annotators. Human annotators are required to answer all the questions in the questionnaire. For each question, the annotators need to answer either \"Yes\" or \"No\" indicating if they believe the action plan completes the task. For each method, we report correctness percentage averaged across ten participated human annotators and all eighty-eight tasks. We further report the standard error of the mean across human annotators.
