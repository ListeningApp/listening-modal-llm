Note the importance of including the determinant nineteen in order to obtain the partial with respect to X X squared V term in the Schr√∂dinger potential\nttwt | U bar. Before proceeding to the next sections we should add a comment regarding the above path integrals. Beyond being expressions that allow formal manipulations, they can also be understood as limits of large multi-variate integrals arising from the discretization of time evolution into small discrete time intervals. In general, this\nx5l2 | discretization results into apparent ambiguities. In our case this can also be linked to the discretization of the Langevin equation eight (the index I refers to the I-th time interval)\nilrs | X sub I equals X sub I minus one plus V prime left parenthesis X sub I star right parenthesis Delta T plus integral from T sub I minus one to T sub I D S xi left parenthesis S right parenthesis forty-nine\n0a03 | where X sub I star equals alpha X sub I plus left parenthesis one minus alpha right parenthesis X sub I minus one. In the above discussions and manipulations we have tacitly assumed alpha equals one half (Stratonovich) which, in the continuous limit is equivalent to setting Theta left parenthesis zero right parenthesis equals one half. It is well known however that, as long as the noise amplitude does not depend on X (known as additive noise), the solution to the Langevin equation is unique, as is the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation. Our path integrals respect this and all results derived from them are independent of the choice of alpha. Calculations with the discrete version, show that contributions from terms involving alpha cancel. For example, one can start from the discretized path integral with an arbitrary choice of alpha and obtain a unique Fokker-Planck equation. In the continuum formulation, the supersymmetry discussed in subsection two capital D below imposes the cancellation of terms where the ambiguous quantity Theta left parenthesis T equals zero right parenthesis appears. This is also reflected in the path integral forty-eight through the special form of the potential U left parenthesis X right parenthesis in terms of the \"superpotential\" V left parenthesis X right parenthesis. Overall, this non-dependence on alpha ultimately stems from the inclusion of the determinant detM in thirteen. These considerations support the view that the formal path integrals considered here are well defined and free from any ambiguity.\nauae | C. Correlation functions from the generating functional\n5b6y | One way to compute correlation functions is through the use of objects called generating functionals. In this subsection we will outline how these generating functionals yield correlators in practice. We will then outline in section three how the f R G can be used to compute these generating functionals in the first place and therefore how to obtain correlation functions in section\n1y10 | four.
