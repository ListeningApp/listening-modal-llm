        "content": "aq5a | In the present article we describe our investigations of the MMO hydroxylase from both organisms in which four substrate probes, one through four, illustrated in Chart I, have been used to address the question of radical intermediates and other aspects of the hydroxylation mechanism. Specifically, reactions with trans-one, two-dimethylcyclopropane (three) and bicyclo[two point one point zero]pentane (four), both of which were used to study the rate constants for rebound with cytochrome P-four-fifty, and with two additional, much faster, radical clock substrates, trans-two-phenylmethylcyclopropane (one) and two, two-diphenylmethylcyclopropane (two), were carried out to determine whether substrate radicals are produced during hydroxylation. If, for example, hydrogen atom abstraction from probe one at the methyl position were to occur, the resulting cyclopropylcarbinyl radical (U', Scheme I) either would be trapped before ring opening to give trans-(two-phenylcyclopropyl)methanol (one a) or would ring open to the one-phenylbut-three-enyl radical (RÂ°). Subsequent trapping of radical R' would afford one-phenylbut-three-en-one-ol (one b). Substrate one has been employed previously as a hypersensitive radical probe in oxidations by resting cells and crude enzyme preparations of Pseudomonas oleovorans monooxygenase. In that work, the only oxidation product detected was the ring-opened alcohol, leading to the conclusion that radical intermediates had been\nsc5y | formed and that the oxygen rebound step had a rate constant of less than four times ten to the ninth per second.\n0yab | Experimental Section\nw95z | Isolation and Purification of Proteins. M capsulatus (Bath) was grown as reported previously. The hydroxylase protein was purified and assayed following the described procedure, except that Q Sepharose was substituted for DEAE Sepharose in the initial ion exchange chromatography step. The coupling protein (formerly designated protein B) was prepared from an Escherichia coli strain harboring a plasmid containing this gene from M capsulatus (Bath) and then purified according to published procedures. The reductase was purified as described except that an HPLC TSKG-three-thousandSWG column was employed as a final purification step. Specific activities with propylene were measured at two hundred to two hundred fifty, eight thousand to eight thousand five hundred, and four thousand to four thousand two hundred milliunits per mg for the hydroxylase, coupling protein, and reductase, respectively.\n0i1k | Growth of M trichosporium OBthreeb and purification of its hydroxylase were carried out as reported. Its specific activity for conversion of propylene to propylene oxide was monitored with the use of coupling protein and reductase from M capsulatus (Bath), for which cross-reactivity with the M trichosporium OBthreeb hydroxylase has been reported previously. The measured activity was one hundred eighty milliunits per mg of protein, a value considerably less than expected, possibly due to the use of coupling protein and reductase from a different organism. Reactions of fifteen micromolar solutions of the M trichosporium OBthreeb hydroxylase with ten millimolar hydrogen peroxide produced zero point one nine millimolar propylene oxide in a three-minute reaction, however, which compares favorably with literature reports that forty-four micromolar hydroxylase and ten millimolar HtwoOtwo yielded approximately zero point four millimolar propylene oxide in the same time period. The measured iron content, two point two mol of iron per mol of hydroxylase, was less than that found by others, four point three mol of iron per mol of protein, for which we have no obvious explanation.\ndqlg | Synthesis and Characterization of Substrates and Products. The substrate trans-two-phenylmethylcyclopropane (one) was prepared as previously reported by reducing commercially available trans-two-phenylcyclopropanecarboxylic acid or its ethyl ester to alcohol one a, trans-(two-phenylcyclopropyl) methanol, with lithium aluminum hydride, converting the alcohol to the mesylate, and reducing the mesylate with lithium triethylborohydride. As an alternative, conversion of alcohol one a to the corresponding chloride by treatment with triphenylphosphine and carbon tetrachloride followed by reduction with lithium aluminum hydride gave hydrocarbon one and ring-opened product four-phenylbut-one-ene; treatment of the mixture with meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid to epoxidize the alkene byproduct, followed by silica gel chromatography, gave pure one. Deuterated analogues of one were prepared by the mesylate route with lithium aluminum deuteride as the source of deuterium. Their NMR and mass spectra were consistent with the expected amount of deuterium incorporation for each analogue.\np6pq | The substrate two, two-diphenylmethylcyclopropane (two) was prepared by a sequence similar to that described above for one. Reaction of ethyl diazoacetate in the presence of copper sulfate with one, one-diphenylethene gave ethyl two, two-diphenylcyclopropanecarboxylate, which was reduced with lithium aluminum hydride to (two, two-diphenylcyclopropyl)methanol (two a). Conversion of two a to the mesylate followed by lithium triethylborohydride reduction gave two.\nzse6 | Authentic samples of the products obtained by the MMO-catalyzed oxidation of substrates one and two were prepared in the following manner. trans-(two-Phenylcyclopropyl)methanol (one a) and its dideuterated analogue were obtained from the synthesis of one, and alcohol two a was available in the preparation of two, as indicated above. Monodeuterated one a was prepared by lithium aluminum deuteride reduction of trans-(two-phenylcyclopropyl)methanal which, in turn, was obtained from the acid by sequential treatment with dimethyl sulfide borane and pyridinium chlorochromate. One-Phenylbut-three-en-one-ol (one b) and one, one-diphenylbut-three-en-one-ol (two b) were prepared by reactions of allylmagnesium chloride with benzaldehyde and benzophenone, respectively.\np2n3 | An authentic sample of trans-two-(para-hydroxyphenyl)methylcyclopropane (one c) was prepared by the following sequence. Reaction of para-vinylanisole with ethyl diazoacetate gave a mixture of ethyl cis- and trans-two-(para-methoxyphenyl)cyclopropanecarboxylates, which was separated by column chromatography and crystallization.
