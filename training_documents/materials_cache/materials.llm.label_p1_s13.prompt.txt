You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

936l | Efficient heuristics have predicted many functional materials such as high-temperature supercon- ducting hydrides, while inorganic structural chemistry explains why and how the crystal structures are stabilized. Here we develop the paired mathematical programming formalism for searching and systematizing the structural prototypes of crystals. The first is the minimization of the volume of the unit cell under the constraints of only the minimum and maximum distances between pairs of atoms. We show the capabilities of linear relaxations of inequality constraints to optimize structures by the steepest-descent method, which is computationally very efficient. The second is the discrete optimization to assign five kinds of geometrical constraints including chemical bonds for pairs of atoms. Under the constraints, the two object functions, formulated as mathematical programming, are alternately optimized to realize the given coordination numbers of atoms. This approach suc- cessfully generates a wide variety of crystal structures of oxides such as spinel, pyrochlore-o, and K2 NiF4 structures.
06yq | Discovering advanced materials enables technological innovation in many areas such as batteries, photovoltaics, and catalysis. Since electronic structure depends on the spatial arrangements of atoms, predictions of unknown crystal structures have a major impact on the discovery of better materials. However, computational structure searching is still difficult despite the progress of com- putational power, since structure prediction is a large- scale nonconvex minimization problem of the total en- ergy, which has a large number of local minima, concern- ing the atomic arrangement and crystal lattice.
dpv6 | Finding the global minimum essentially involves visit- ing every local minimum, but some heuristic approaches with more or less intelligent ways such as evolution- ally algorithms [1-4] and particle swarm-intelligence ap- proach [5-7] have predicted novel materials including bi- nary hydrides that have been experimentally synthesized as high-temperature superconductors under high pres- sure [8-14]. The drawbacks of these methods are that there are no guarantees that the most stable structure are found, and similarly, they can miss synthesizable unique structures. Furthermore, they cannot explain why and how the predicted structures are stabilized. This is also true of the deep learning approach [15-18] and the ran- dom structure searching methods [19, 20], while the latter may lead to peculiar structures without a priori knowl- edge.
8r5j | The integer programming approach has been devel- oped to deterministically find the lowest energy struc- ture with guarantees [21]. The global optimum of in- teger programming can be found deterministically by brute force with branch-and-cut algorithms that are ca- pable of rapidly eliminating large parts of the optimiza-
2taz | tion domain from consideration. To apply this universal method, all the atoms are placed at discrete positions within a fixed cubic unit cell, and the total energy is rep- resented by the sum of two-body classical interaction po- tentials [21]. This approach has successfully found com- plex crystals such as garnet structure, but the fixed unit cells and approximated total energies may limit its ap- plicability. Instead of using approximated total energies, geometrical approaches may be effective to search crystal structures, for example, Yokoyama et al. have developed the dual periodic graph approach to generate structures composed of space-filling polyhedra [22].
o3ya | Important structural principles for ionic crystals have been summarized by Pauling in the five rules [23-25]. George et al. have shown the limited predictive power of the Pauling rules since a few oxides simultaneously sat- isfy them [26], but the rules offer the basic concepts for inorganic structural chemistry. For example, the crys- tal structures of oxides, chalcogenides, and mixed anion compounds are linked polyhedra with explicit chemical bonds, especially between anions and cations [24, 25]. Anions such as oxygen prefer to constitute the Barrow packings, which are the densest packings of spheres [27], and small cations are placed in the tetrahedral and oc- tahedral sites, while large cations typically have a co- ordination number greater than 6, and in some cases, constitutes the Barrow packings with anions [24, 25]. Small and large cations generally behave as hard and soft spheres, respectively. Highly polar bonds do not fa- vor edge-sharing polyhedra and especially face-sharing polyhedra because of the increased electrostatic repul- sion between central atoms [24, 25].
r5il | The structure of amorphous semiconductors is well rep- resented by continuous random network models which require a condition that each atom should satisfy fully its bonding needs [28-31]. Two atoms interact only if they are explicitly bonded, and the total energy is given
5gui | by the Keating potential [31, 32]. The network is repro- duced periodically by bond transpositions accepted with the Metropolis acceptance probability, conserving four coordination. This approach can generate structurally and electronically good structures comparable with ex- periments from random initial structures.
82qc | In this study, we propose a paired mathematical pro- gramming approach that finds candidate structures of crystals satisfying a series of empirical rules. The first is the minimization problem of the volume of the unit cell within the constraints of minimum and maximum distances between pairs of atoms. The constraints repre- sent linked polyhedra and simultaneously the packings of anionic spheres regardless of the kinds of chemical bonds. We approximate the inequality constraints as the linear potentials for the structural relaxation. The second is the maximization problem of the number of chemical bonds. The five kinds of geometrical constraints, which impose restrictions on the distances between every pair of atoms, are assigned by the network of chemical bonds. The two optimization problems are alternately solved to find a proper structure where every cation satisfies its bond- ing needs; the transpositions of geometrical constraints transform random initial structures into linked polyhedra as the sillium approach for amorphous silicons [28-31]. We define a feasible solution as a structure satisfying all the constraints in the two optimization problems and all the bonding needs of atoms, and the other cases are de- noted as infeasible solution. An optimal solution in this study is defined to be the feasible solution whose volume of the unit cell is minimized. The paired mathematical programming we propose is an efficient method which tries to find the optimal solution for a model system with a given composition.
ls7d | Let us start our discussion by introducing the first ob- ject function in the paired mathematical programming formalism. The geometrical constraints are composed of the minimum and maximum distances between pairs of atoms. Suppose xi is the cartesian coordinate of atom i, and rijT is the distances between atoms i and jT given by
tzt3 | (1) where the atom jT corresponds to the atom j with the translational vector T of the crystal lattice. The object function is the volume § of the unit cell. The mathemat- ical programming is given by
t8vv | CijT = x; +T- xil,
qvnu | minimize $2
kggw | subject to xijT ≥ d.min) dijT ,
xrd1 | (2) XijT ≤ dijT (max)
5746 | where dijT 7(min) and d(max) lijT are the minimum and maximum distances between atoms i and jT, respectively. This model finds structural candidates of crystals without cal- culating the total energies.
7toz | To solve the problem, the equality and inequality con- straints are relaxed as follows: The constraint of mini- mum distance between atoms i and jT:
j346 | (min) (3)
v8uq | KijT ≥ dyjm,
x972 | is relaxed to the hard-spherical potential Umin (xijT) de- fined to be
cwrw | Umin = To [ -ki (Cir - d'min)
4i0e | CijT < dijT (min) bijT < WijT VI
h2l3 | , (4)
dfzb | where ky is a common constant for the minimum con- straints. Similarly, the constraint of maximum distance between atoms i and jT:
u6ty | CijT < d (max) , (5)
awvu | is relaxed to the hard-spherical potential Umax (x) defined to be
on9b | 7(max) < HijT , (6)
a8ge | 0
h27a | XijT ≤ dijT 7(max) d' bijT
pdjh | Umax = kt (CijT - d(max) lijT
xmgs | where k+ is a common constant for the maximum con- straints. The relaxations transform the problem of Eq. (2) into the minimization problem of the enthalpy H ({x¿, ai}) per unit cell formulated as
bd9h | minimize H ({x¿, ai }) = E ({xj, ai}) + PQ, (7)
m047 | where P is the pressure and E ({xi, ai}) is given by E ({xi, ai}) = >[Umin (XijT) + Umax (xijT)], (8) ij T
gy8c | and ai is the primitive translation vectors of crystal lat- tice. The displacement of each atom is calculated from the derivative of the enthalpy H per unit cell as
y4mj | Axi = - Ki J dơi dH
vpgq | (9)
ousl | The constant ki is scaled to ensure so that the norm of displacement does not exceed the given maximum value, Axmax, for each optimization step. Similarly, the primi- tive lattice vectors a¿ is optimized as

u15r | where o is a constant and n is the number of geometrical optimization steps. The values of pameters such as a, ky, kj, and P are discussed in Supplementary Informa- tion [33]. One may consider that structures are never re- laxed due to the discontinuity in the first derivative of the potential. However, the structure converges to an opti- mal solution by gradually reducing the maximum A.xmax and AAmax, even though there is the discontinuity. The effectiveness of linear relaxations of inequality constraints has already been shown in the previous studies on the densest sphere packings as iterative-balance method [34- 36]: The method enables the structures to reach a local optima precisely enough to calculate packing fractions. The inequality constraints are widely approximated by the logarithmic barrier functions [37], but the advantage of the linear potentials consists of the two folds: One is that the computational cost is the lowest and the other is that the potentials can impose hard penalties only when the constraints are not satisfied.
lq35 | Next we turn our discussion to the second object func- tion in the paired mathematical programming formalism. The problem is how to determine the values of dair (min) and d(max) ijT 2. In the following discussion, we focus on the crys- tal structures of oxides. We introduce the five kinds of geometrical constraints as listed in Table I and illustrated in Fig. 1. The minimum and maximum distances are de- termined as

d09o | (min)
ylhz | SiiT "ijT
a3td | ʹijT

9d4o | (p,max)
cjq2 | (13)
5esx | (p)
m5ka | where Siir E {0, 1} is a switch variable selecting one of
byu8 | the geometrical constraints, and p runs chemical bond (CB), non-bonding constraint (NBC), anionic constraint (AC), cationic constraint (CC), and polyhedral con- straint (PC). The geometrical constraints for every pair of atoms are assigned depending on the network of CBs. CBs or NBCs are formed between every pair of an an- ion and a cation. ACs are formed between every pair of anions. Besides, if two coordination polyhedra around cations share some bridging anions, PC is formed be- tween the two cations. Finally, CCs are formed between remained pairs of cations. To assist making coordination polyhedra, NBCs spatially separate the anion and cation when CB is not formed between them. ACs impose the hard-spherical constraint for every pair of anions; oxygen ions often constitute the Barrow-packings if the cationic radii are small. CCs are necessary to spatially separate two cations enough to avoid the condensation of cations, while a minimum distance of PC is smaller than that of CC to share a common edge or face as
76b0 | r(M) D(shared) + D(shared)
zxz6 | otherwise N (CBA) )=1, (14)
xnth | (PC,min)
vafm | 'ijT
2zmw | where D(shared) is the minimum distance from the cation i to the shared common edge or face as detailed in Sup- plementary Information [33].
bf9k | Since any cation i has the desirable coordination num- ber N.(CB) for CBs, the feasible linked-polyhedra must satisfy the conditions of
otkr | s(+) (N(CB) - n[CB) = 0,
ibgs | (15)
colo | where nå n(CB) is the coordination number, which is counted by the number of CBs for atom i, and s+) (+) is a switch function for the atom i given by
d6r4 | 1 if the atom i is cation
9mrz | (16)
pk06 | 0 if the atom i is anion .
7wn9 | Most of random initial structures are infeasible solu- tions, and the analytic optimization methods such as the steepest-descent method cannot escape from the infeasi- ble solution to a feasible solution. Therefore, we period- ically update the values of d(min) and d(max) depending on the network of CBs that are also renewed periodi- cally. The network is determined from the maximization problem of the number of CBs given by
