You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

1xr0 | CARROTS AND STICKS
m230 | 3. Founders' Position in the Firm
71rx | The entrepreneurial team is likely to have a greater incentive to block a trade sale if the founder is still the CEO. First, a founder-CEO is likely to own more common stock than a replacement CEO; everything else equal, he or she will thus face a greater loss of option value if the firm is sold. Second, a founder-CEO may derive greater nonfinancial benefits from the business and thus may have additional incentive to keep the firm independent.
73zy | The entrepreneurial team may also have greater ability to impede a sale if the founder is still the CEO. A founder-CEO is likely to have substantially more common stock than a hired CEO, giving him more shareholder-blocking power. Compared to a hired CEO, the founder-CEO is also likely to have longer and deeper relationships with other directors and common shareholders. As a result, the founder-CEO is likely to have influence over directors and other common shareholders, increasing the likelihood that directors will resist the trade sale and further increasing the likelihood that common shareholders will vote against the transaction.
uhaq | To reduce resistance to a trade sale, a firm's VC investors may use their control over the board of directors to replace the CEO before the planned exit. In our 50-firm sample, 29 of the founders (58%) were replaced as CEOs before the firm was sold. However, as we will discuss shortly, none of these replacements appeared to be made to overcome resistance to a trade sale.
w3yw | ACTUAL CARROTS AND STICKS IN THE SALE OF VC-BACKED STARTUPS
llp1 | Part III described the potential carrots and sticks that VCs could deploy to induce entrepreneurial teams to sell the firm. Here, we describe the actual carrots (subpart A) and sticks (subpart B) used in our sample. We also describe the total out-of-pocket cost to the VCs in our sample of using carrots in connection with trade sales.
5fpi | A. Carrots
niji | 1. Common Carve-Outs
v7nq | In our sample, 11 sales (22% of 50 sales) feature carve-outs to common shareholders-extra value above the amount to which they were contractually entitled. To measure these carve-outs, we compare the actual payout received by VCs to the VCs' contractual entitlement. When VCs convert their preferred shares to common shares, their contractual entitlement equals their pro rata share of the sale price. When VCs exit as preferred shareholders,
vwfi | CARROTS AND STICKS
4jgz | their contractual entitlement is the lesser of their liquidation preferences and the sale price.89 Any excess payment received by the original common shareholders is treated as a carve-out to common.
v6qh | Table 3 describes the carve-outs to common shareholders in our sample. Limited to the 11 sales in which a carve-out occurs, the average carve-out to common shareholders is $3.7 million, or approximately 10% of the total sale price. Though most firms do not provide a carve-out, carve-outs can be substantial when they occur. In our sample, one sale provided a $10 million carve-out to common shareholders, and in two deals, the carve-out was at least 25% of the total sale price.
gmi2 | Carve-outs to common shareholders occur only in the 42 firms where the VCs exit holding preferred stock. Limited to the subsample of 42 firms where VC investors did not convert their preferred shares to common shares, we find that common shareholders receive, on average, $969,000 more than their contractual entitlement, or approximately 2.5% of the total sale price. Among all 50 companies, common shareholders receive, on average, $810,000 more than their contractual entitlement, or approximately 2.2% of the total sale price.
t6kj | Carve-outs to common shareholders are illustrated in Figure 1. Each bar represents a firm's total sale price (in millions of dollars). The sale price is divided into four components: (1) the amount actually paid to VCs (in black); (2) the contractual entitlement of the original common shareholders at the given sale price (in white); (3) the carve-out given to the original common shareholders (in dark grey); and (4) nonretention bonuses paid to senior management in connection with the sale (in light grey).
h4la | In our sample, common carve-outs are used, at least in part, to overcome common shareholders' opposition to trade sales. Elsewhere, we showed econometrically that these carve-outs are more likely to occur when: (1) VCs lack de facto board control and thus need to convince other directors-such as independent directors and common-appointed directors-to support the sale; (2) the firm is domiciled in California rather than Delaware, and therefore common shareholders' rights are likely to be slightly stronger; or (3) common shareholders would otherwise be wiped out and receive none of the sale proceeds.90
gh34 | Qualitative interview data confirm that carve-outs to common shareholders are designed to induce common shareholders and their allies on the board to support the sale. In one California-domiciled firm, for example, the VCs carving out a portion of their liquidation preferences for common
qjkr | CARROTS AND STICKS
340z | shareholders required each common shareholder to sign a liability waiver before receiving a portion of the carve-out. According to the entrepreneur, the carve-out was offered only because the VCs were concerned about a possible common-shareholder suit challenging the terms of the sale. In another case, where the VCs lacked board control, the entrepreneur told us that the VCs were forced to give a carve-out payment to common shareholders to obtain the support of other directors.
zb66 | Of course, some of the carve-outs to common might have had other motives. VCs might have wanted to be "fair" to common shareholders or to build or maintain a reputation as "friendly" VCs. However, the fact that these carve-outs are more likely to occur when common shareholders have more power, or more incentive to block a sale, suggests that they are being used at least in part to induce common shareholders' cooperation with sales.
mfjz | 2. (Nonretention) Management Bonuses
pto6 | Bonuses that do not require management to stay with the acquirer might be used as carrots to induce executives to support a sale.91 Of the 50 firms in our sample, sixteen offered various nonretention management bonuses in connection with the acquisition, with an average bonus in these 16 firms of $1.63 million (or 6.6% of the sale price). Bonuses are sometimes given to a broad class of employees (five firms), but in most cases they are limited to key executives (11 firms).
n8dc | Among all 50 companies, senior executives receive an average nonretention bonus of approximately $520,000. Across all companies, these payments represent approximately 2.1% of the total purchase price (or 0.95% on a dollar-weighted basis).92 Compared to bonuses awarded in connection with the sale of publicly held firms, the payments we document are modest in dollar terms, but large as a fraction of deal size.93 Nonretention management bonuses are depicted in Figure 1.
9wsa | Of course, VCs might have other reasons to give executives a management bonus besides inducing them to sell the company. They may want to reward the executives for a job well done or to curry favor with
xs83 | CARROTS AND STICKS
96ib | executives whom they hope to hire in the future. Thus, we cannot be certain that all of the nonretention bonuses observed were sale-related carrots.
d7l3 | 3. Cost of Carrots
5z1u | In our sample, 23 of the 50 firms offer a management bonus or common carve-out. Limited to the group of 23 firms offering a carrot, Figure 2 illustrates the value of these benefits relative to the sale price. In most cases, total carrots represent between 5% and 12% of the sale price, with a mean amount of approximately $2.9 million (or 9.4% of deal value) (Table 3). In two firms, however, total carrots exceed 20% of deal value.
