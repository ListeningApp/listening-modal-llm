## Observational constraints on Hubble constant and deceleration parameter in power-law cosmology

ABSTRACT

In this paper, we show that the expansion history of the Universe in power-law cosmology essentially depends on two crucial parameters, namely the Hubble constant H zero and deceleration parameter Q. We find the constraints on these parameters from the latest H of z and S N e I a data. At lo level the constraints from H of z data are obtained as Q equals negative zero point one eight plus zero point one two minus zero point one two and H zero equals sixty-eight point four three plus two point eight four minus two point eight zero kilometers per second per megaparsec while the constraints from the S N e I a data read as Q equals negative zero point three eight plus zero point zero five minus zero point zero five and H zero equals sixty-nine point one eight plus zero point five five minus zero point five four kilometers per second per megaparsec. We also perform the joint test using H of z and S N e I a data, which yields the constraints Q equals negative zero point three four minus zero point zero five and H zero equals sixty-eight point nine three plus zero point five three one minus zero point five two kilometers per second per megaparsec. The estimates of H zero are found to be in close agreement with some recent probes carried out in the literature. The analysis reveals that the observational data successfully describe the cosmic acceleration within the framework of power-law cosmology. We find that the power-law cosmology accommodates well the H(z) and S N e I a data. We also test the power-law cosmology using the primordial nucleosynthesis, which yields the constraints Q greater than zero point seven two and H zero less than or equal to forty-one point four nine kilometers per second per megaparsec. These constraints are found to be inconsistent with the ones derived from the H(z) and S N e I a data. We carry out the statefinder analysis, and find that the power-law cosmological models approach the standard A. C. D. M. model as Q approaches negative one. Finally, we conclude that despite having several good features power-law cosmology is not a complete package for the cosmological purposes.


## One INTRODUCTION

Power-law cosmology finds a reasonable place in the literature to address some common problems such as the age problem, flatness problem, horizon problem associated with the Standard Cold Dark Matter model based on Big Bang theory. In such a cosmology, the cosmological evolution is described by the scale factor a of t proportional to t to the power of n, where n is a constant. The viability of the model with n greater than one has been explored in a series of articles in different contexts. Observational constraints on phantom power-law cosmology are discussed by Kaeonikhom, Gumjudpai and Saridakis. The motivation for such an endeavor is followed by a number of considerations. For instance, power-law cosmological models with n greater than one do not encounter the horizon problem at all. These models do not witness the flatness problem since the matter density is not constrained by the scale factor. In these models, age of the Universe turns out at least fifty percent greater than the age predicted by the Standard Cold Dark Matter model. This bridges the gap between the age of the Universe and the age estimates of globular clusters and high-z redshift galaxies, and thus the age problem is alleviated. Sethi, Dev and Jain showed that an open linear coasting cosmological model constrained with type I a supernovae gold sample and ages of old quasars accommodates a very old high-redshift quasar, which the Standard Cold Dark Matter model fails to do. The linear coasting cosmology is found to be consistent with the gravitational lensing statistics and the primordial nucleosynthesis.

Kaplinghat et al. found that the power-law cosmological models which succeed in primordial nucleosynthesis are in conflict with the constraints from Hubble expansion rates and S N e I a magnitude redshift relations.

In any cosmological model, the Hubble constant H zero and deceleration parameter Q play an important role in describing the nature of evolution of the Universe. The former one tells us the expansion rate of the Universe today while the latter one characterizes the accelerating q less than zero or decelerating q greater than zero nature of the Universe. In the recent past, there have been numerous attempts to estimate the value of H zero. Freedman et al. used the Hubble Space Telescope observations of Cepheid variable to estimate a value of H zero equals seventy-two plus or minus eight kilometers per second per megaparsec. An observational determination of the Hubble constant obtained by Suyu et al. based upon measurements of gravitational lensing by using the Hubble Space Telescope yielded a value of H zero equals sixty-nine point seven minus five point zero plus four point nine kilometers per second per megaparsec. WMAP seven-year results gave an estimate of H zero equals seventy-one point zero plus or minus two point five kilometers per second per megaparsec based on WMAP data alone, and an estimate of H zero equals seventy point four minus one point four plus one point three kilometers per second per megaparsec based on WMAP data with Gaussian priors corresponding to earlier estimates from other studies. A recent estimate of the Hubble constant, which used a new infrared camera on the Hubble Space Telescope to measure the distance and redshift for a collection of astronomical objects, gives a value of H zero equals seventy-three point eight plus or minus two point four kilometers per second per megaparsec. An alternative probe using data from galactic clusters gave a value of H zero equals sixty-seven point zero plus or minus three point two kilometers per second per megaparsec.

In this paper, we show that the power-law cosmology essentially depends on the parameters Q and H sub C. We intend to find the observational constraints on the power-law cosmology parameters using the recent observational data from H of Z and supernova observations. We also intend to test the power-law cosmology with primordial nucleosynthesis. The paper is organized as follows: The basic equations of power-law cosmology are introduced in Section Two. Section Three deals with the constraints on the parameters Q and H sub zero from the latest H of Z data while Section Four is devoted to find the constraints using Union Two compilation of five hundred fifty-seven S N e I a data points. In Section Five, we perform the joint test using H of Z and S N e I a data. Section Six deals with the constraints on power-law cosmology from primordial nucleosynthesis while Section Seven is devoted to study the statefinders in power-law cosmology. In the last Section, we summarize the main results of the paper.


## Two BASIC EQUATIONS IN POWER-LAW COSMOLOGY

We study a general class of power-law cosmology described by the dimensionless scale factor a of t equals a sub zero of t over t sub zero raised to the alpha power, (one)

where t sub zero is present age of the universe, a sub zero is the value of a today and alpha is a dimensionless positive parameter. Hereafter, the subscript zero denotes the present-day value of the parameter under consideration.

The deceleration parameter Q, which characterizes accelerating left parenthesis Q is less than zero right parenthesis or decelerating left parenthesis Q is greater than zero right parenthesis nature of the Universe, reads as

Q equals negative a double dot a over a dot squared equals one over alpha minus one. (two)

Q is greater than negative one. The cosmic scale factor in terms of the deceleration parameter may be written as

Constraints on power-law cosmology a of t equals a sub zero of t over t sub zero raised to the one over one plus Q power. (three)

We observe that Q is greater than negative one is the condition for expanding Universe in the power-law cosmological model.

the Hubble parameter, H of t equals a dot over a equals one over one plus Q times one over t, while the present expansion rate of the Universe is given by The scale factor a and the redshift Z are connected through the relation a equals a sub zero of one plus z raised to the negative one. Therefore, the Hubble parameter in terms of the redshift may be expressed as

The expansion history of the Universe is described by

(four)

H sub zero equals one over one plus Q t sub zero one

This shows that the expansion history of the Universe in power-law cosmology depends on the parameters H sub zero and

It may be noted that the above model is well motivated in the literature as mentioned in the previous section. However the focus has been on one parameter namely alpha or Q. But here we find the observational constraints on both parameters H sub zero and Q by subjecting the power-law cosmological model to the latest data from H of Z and S N e I a observations. We also constrain H sub zero and Q using primordial nucleosynthesis scenario.


## Three CONSTRAINTS FROM OBSERVATIONAL H of Z DATA

Simon, Verde, and Jimenez determined nine H of Z data points in the range zero less than or equal to Z less than or equal to one point eight by using the differential ages of passively evolving galaxies determined from the Gemini Deep Deep Survey and archival data. Recently, H of Z data at eleven different redshifts based on the differential ages of red-envelope galaxies were reported by Stern et al. while three more H of Z data points were obtained by Gaztanaga, Cabre, and Hui. The newly H of Z data points have been used to constrain parameters of various cosmological models. Here, we use thirteen observational H of Z data points given in Table One of the paper by Chen and Ratra and the one at Z equals zero estimated in the work by Riess et al. For this sake, we define the chi squared as chi squared sub H left parenthesis q comma H sub zero right parenthesis equals the sum from i equals one to fourteen of the fraction with numerator H left parenthesis z sub i comma q comma H sub zero right parenthesis minus H sub obs left parenthesis z sub i right parenthesis over sigma sub i squared. (six)

The model has two free parameters namely q and H sub zero in the entire parametric space array We perform a grid search left parenthesis q greater than negative one and H sub zero greater than or equal to zero right parenthesis to end array find the best fit model. We find that the best fit values of q equals negative zero point one eight and H sub zero equals sixty-eight point four three together array the parameters are q equals negative zero point one eight with chi squared sub nu equals one point four nine, where chi squared sub nu equals end array chi squared sub min over (degree of freedom). Here and in what follows H sub zero is in the units of kilometers per second per megaparsec. The negative value of q suggests that the newly obtained H left parenthesis z right parenthesis data confirms the accelerating nature of the present-day Universe. The likelihood contours at sixty-eight point three percent (inner contour), ninety-five point four percent (middle contour) and ninety-nine point seventy-three percent


## Four CONSTRAINTS FROM OBSERVATIONAL SNE IA DATA

The observations directly measure the apparent magnitude M of a supernova and its redshift Z. The apparent magnitude M of the supernova is related to the luminosity distance dL of the supernova through m equals M plus five log ten one megaparsec dL plus twenty-five, (seven)

where M is the absolute magnitude, which is believed to be constant for all SNe Ia.

It is convenient to work with Hubble free luminosity distance given by

DL(Z) equals Ho dL(Z). Ho

(eight)

Now, equation (seven) can be written as

(nine)

m equals M plus five log ten DL(Z) minus five log ten Ho plus fifty-two point three eight.

The distance modulus mu(Z) is given by mu(Z) equals m minus M equals five log ten DL(Z) minus five log ten Ho plus fifty-two point three eight. (ten)

The Hubble free luminosity distance DL, in the present case, for a geometrically flat Universe reads as

DL(Z) equals left parenthesis one plus Z right parenthesis integral H left parenthesis Z right parenthesis dZ prime equals left bracket left parenthesis one plus Z right parenthesis minus left parenthesis one plus Z right parenthesis to the negative nine. (eleven)

SNe Ia are always used as standard candles, and are believed to provide strongest constraints on the cosmological parameters. In the present analysis, we use recently released Union two set of five hundred fifty-seven SNe Ia from Supernova Cosmology Project. In this case, we define the chi squared as chi squared sub SN left parenthesis q comma Ho right parenthesis equals the sum from i equals one to five hundred fifty-seven of left bracket m sub i left parenthesis z sub i comma q comma Ho right parenthesis minus m sub obs left parenthesis z sub i right parenthesis right bracket squared over sigma sub i

(twelve)

After performing a grid search in the entire parametric space (q greater than negative one and Ho greater than zero), we find that the best fit values of the parameters are q equals negative zero point thirty-eight and Ho equals sixty-nine point eighteen together with chi squared equals zero point ninety-nine. Again, the power-law cosmological model fitted with the five hundred fifty-seven SNe Ia data confirms the cosmic acceleration with q equals negative zero point thirty-eight. The likelihood contours at sixty-eight point three percent (inner contour), ninety-five point four percent (middle contour) and ninety-nine point seventy-three percent (outer contour) confidence levels around the best fit values point (negative zero point thirty-eight, sixty-nine point eighteen) (indicated by star symbol) in the q minus Ho plane are shown in Figure two. The errors at one sigma level are derived as q equals negative zero point thirty-eight plus or minus zero point zero five and Ho equals sixty-nine point eighteen plus point fifty-five minus point fifty-four.


## Five BEST-FITTING MODEL FROM THE JOINT TEST: H(Z) PLUS SNE IA DATA

In order to obtain tighter constraints on the model parameters and to avoid degeneracy in the observational data, we combine H(z) and SNe Ia data. Since H(z) and SNe Ia data are obtained from independent cosmological probes, the total likelihood is considered to be the product of separate likelihoods of the two probes. Therefore, we define chi squared total equals chi squared sub H plus chi squared sub SN

(thirteen)

In the joint analysis, we find that the best fit values of the parameters are q equals negative zero point thirty-four and Ho equals sixty-eight point ninety-three together with chi squared sub nu equals one point zero one. The joint test also confirms the cosmic acceleration with q equals negative zero point three four. The likelihood contours at sixty-eight point three percent (inner contour) and ninety-five point four percent (outer contour) confidence levels around the best fit values point left parenthesis negative zero point three four, sixty-eight point ninety-three right parenthesis (indicated by star symbol) in the q minus H sub zero plane are shown in Figure three. The errors at one sigma level read as q equals negative zero point three four plus or minus zero point zero five and

H naught equals sixty-eight point nine three minus zero point five two plus zero point five three. Figure four demonstrates the comparison of the best fit cosmological model obtained from the joint test with the observational H of Z data in the one sigma region sixty-eight point four one less than or equal to H naught less than or equal to sixty-nine point four six, negative zero point three nine less than or equal to Q less than or equal to negative zero point two nine. We observe that the model fits well to the observational fifteen H of Z points shown with error bars, especially at redshifts

Z less than one. In figure five, the comparison of the derived best fit model based on H of Z plus S N e I a with the observational five hundred fifty-seven SNe Ia data points (shown with error bars) of Union two compilation in the lo region sixty-eight point four one less than or equal to H naught less than or equal to negative zero point three nine less than or equal to Q less than or equal to negative zero point two nine is illustrated. We see that the model is in excellent agreement with the observational SNe Ia data.


## Six Constraints from Primordial Nucleosynthesis

Before we find constraints on power-law cosmology parameters from primordial big bang nucleosynthesis, it is helpful to reproduce the brief review of the BBN in standard model given by Kaplinghat et al. The neutron-proton ratio n over p equals exp of negative Q over T, where Q equals one point two nine mega electron volts is the neutron-proton mass difference, at high temperatures T greater than or equal to one mega electron volt is maintained by charged-current weak interactions among neutrons, protons, electrons, positrons and neutrinos. When the Universe is of order one second old, T less than or equal to one mega electron volt, the n over p ratio "freezes out" due to the inequilibrium of weak interactions and free neutron decay with a lifetime of eight hundred eighty-seven seconds. At this stage the deuterium, D, produced due to


## Constraints on power-law cosmology

collision of neutrons and protons is rapidly photodissociated by the cosmic background photons. This causes very low abundance of D and thus heavier nuclei are not formed at this epoch. Thus nucleosynthesis is delayed by this "photodissociation bottleneck". However, when the universe is approximately three minutes old, the temperature falls below approximately eighty kilo electron volts, the deuterium bottleneck is broken. At this stage the nuclear reactions quickly burn out the remaining free neutrons into helium four and leave trace amounts of D, helium three and lithium seven. A viable cosmological model must mimic the above scenario for proper synthesis of the light elements in the early Universe. In the following, we test the power-law cosmological model for primordial nucleosynthesis.

In power-law cosmology the scale factor a of t and the cosmic microwave background temperature T of t are related through the relation:

a over a naught equals T naught over beta T equals open parenthesis t over t naught close parenthesis to the power of one over one plus q, (fourteen)

where beta stands for any non-adiabatic expansion due to entropy production. In standard cosmology, the instantaneous e plus e minus annihilation is assumed at T equals m subscript e. The heating due to this annihilation is accounted by beta where beta equals one for T less than m subscript e while beta equals open parenthesis one one over four close parenthesis to the power of one third for

T greater than m subscript e. In order to find constraints from primordial nucleosynthesis on power-law cosmology parameters, we utilize t naught approximately thirteen point seven giga years (age of the Universe) estimated by Komatsu et al. on the basis of seven year data from WMAP and astrophysical data from other sources. Further, the model is assumed to have current temperature T naught equals two point seven two eight Kelvin. The primordial nucleosynthesis requires that t less than or equal to eight hundred eighty-seven T approximately eighty kilo electron volts. This puts the following constraints on q and

H sub zero: We observe that primordial nucleosynthesis requires decelerating expansion (Q is greater than zero) of the Universe within the framework of power-law cosmology. This is contrary to outcome of accelerated expansion (Q is less than zero) of the Universe obtained in earlier sections by using latest data sets of H of z and SNe Ia observations. Also the primordial nucleosynthesis forces the Hubble constant H sub zero less than or equal to forty-one point four nine, which is much smaller than its values estimated in earlier by using the updated data sets of H of z and SNe Ia. This shows that the power-law cosmological models which succeed in mimicking the nucleosynthesis scenario are in conflict with the constraints obtained on power-law cosmology parameters by using the latest observational data from H of z and SNe Ia. A similar conclusion on power-law cosmologies was drawn by Kaplinghat et al. However, in the case at hand, it has been done with updated observational data sets and the constraints have been obtained on both the parameters Q and


## H sub C. Seven CONSTRAINTS ON STATEFINDERS IN POWER-LAW COSMOLOGY

The Hubble parameter H equals a dot over A and deceleration parameter Q equals negative a double dot over A H squared are useful geometric parameters in cosmology, which describe the expansion history of the Universe. For instance, H is greater than zero (A dot is greater than zero) indicates an expanding Universe while Q less than zero (A double dot greater than zero) characterizes an accelerated expansion of the Universe. In order to explain accelerated expansion of the Universe, various dark energy models have been proposed in the literature. However, these models encounter degeneracy on the geometric parameters H (involving first time derivative of scale factor) and Q (involving second time derivative of scale factor) at the present epoch (Malekjani and

Khadom-Mohamaddi). Thus the geometric parameters H and Q are not capable of discriminating between different dark energy models and a viable diagnostic tool is required for this purpose. Sahni et al. proposed a pair of parameters R, S called statefinders as a means of distinguishing between different dark energy models. The statefinders involve derivatives of scale factor up to third order and are defined as

R equals A dot over A H cubed, S equals R minus one over three (Q minus one half). and'

The remarkable feature of statefinders is that these parameters depend on scale factor and its time derivatives, and hence are geometric in nature (Sahni). Further, different dark energy models exhibit different evolutionary trajectories in the S-R plane. Moreover, the well known flat ACDM model corresponds to the point S equals zero and R equals one in the S-R plane (Alam et al.). These features of statefinders provide an opportunity to distinguish between different dark energy models. The statefinder diagnostic tool has been extensively used in the literature as a means to distinguish between different dark energy models. In what follows, we test the power-law cosmology by statefinder diagnostic tool.

In power-law cosmology, the statefinders read as R equals two Q squared plus Q and where

Q does not equal one half. S equals two-thirds times the quantity Q plus one, we immediately notice that R equals one and S equals zero at Q equals negative one. Thus, the power-law cosmology mimics the Lambda Cold Dark Matter model at Q equals negative one. We obtain the evolutionary S minus R and Q minus R trajectories for the power-law cosmology as shown in Figure six for the values of Q in the range negative one is less than or equal to Q less than zero point five. The black dot in the left panel at the coordinates zero, one represents the location of flat Lambda Cold Dark Matter model while the black dot in the right panel shows the location of the de Sitter point at the coordinates negative one, one. The star symbol in both panels corresponds to the best fit model based on hatch Z plus S N E I A. It is interesting to note that the Lambda Cold Dark Matter statefinder pair zero, one or equivalently the de Sitter point at negative one, one is an attractor in power-law


## Constraints on power-law cosmology

Now we find the constraints on the statefinders of power-law cosmology from hatch Z, S N E I A and Big Bang Nucleosynthesis observations. The hatch Z data constrain the statefinders as R equals negative zero point zero nine plus or minus zero point zero four, and S equals zero point fifty-eight plus or minus zero point zero four while the S N E I A data constraints on statefinders are R tilde equals negative zero point zero nine plus or minus zero point zero three and S equals zero point forty-one plus or minus zero point zero three. The joint test of hatch Z and S N E I A data puts the following constraints on statefinders: R equals negative zero point eleven plus or minus zero point zero two. S equals zero point forty-four plus or minus zero point zero three. The errors in the above values are at one sigma level. The primordial nucleosynthesis restricts R greater than or approximately equal to one point seventy-six and S is greater than or equal to one point fifteen. We observe that the best fit values of statefinders R and S predicted by observational hatch Z and S N E I A data are in conflict with the ones estimated by Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, as expected.


## Eight. Summary

In this paper, we have found the bounds on the parameters hatch zero and Q of the power-law cosmology. The numerical results are summarized in Table one.

Some key observations are as follows:

(i) The constraints on the deceleration parameter Q clearly indicate that the astronomical observations of H of Z and SNe Ia predict the cosmic acceleration within the framework of power-law cosmology. Thus, power-law cosmological models are viable for describing the observed accelerating nature of the Universe.

(ii) We see that the estimates of the Hubble constant in power-law cosmology are in close agreement with independent investigations of H naught carried out in literature as discussed in Section one.

(iii) The derived best-fitting model fits well to the observational data points from H of Z and SNe Ia observations.

(iv) The primordial nucleosynthesis demands a decelerating expansion of the Universe with smaller values of the Hubble constant.

(v) The statefinder analysis shows that power-law cosmological models approach the standard Lambda C D M model in future with varying values of Q.

We see that the power-law cosmology turns out viable in the description of the acceleration of present-day Universe when subjected to recent observations of H of Z and SNe Ia. Also, the Hubble constant within the framework of power-law cosmology falls in the range of observations. However, the power-law cosmology fails to produce primordial nucleosynthesis with the values of Q and H naught estimated from observational data of H of Z and SNe Ia as discussed in Section six. Moreover, because of the constant value of deceleration parameter Q in power-law cosmology, it fails to provide time or redshift based transition of the Universe from deceleration to acceleration. Thus, one has to use different values of Q for the description of the Universe at different epochs. Finally, despite having several useful features, the power-law cosmology is not a complete package for cosmological purposes.
