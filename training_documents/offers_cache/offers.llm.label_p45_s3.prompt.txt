You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

06yq | Microdosing with psychedelics to self-medicate for ADHD symptoms in adults: A naturalistic study
dpv6 | ARTICLE INFO
8r5j | ABSTRACT
2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

umx0 | Commit to the Niche
o306 | I have a saying when coaching entrepreneurs on picking their target market "Don't make me niche slap you."
qm1b | Too often, a newer entrepreneur half-heartedly tries one offer in one market, doesn't make a million dollars, then mistakenly thinks "this is a bad market." Most times that's not actually the case. They just haven't found a Grand Slam Offer yet to apply to that market.
n9ms | They think, I'll switch from helping dentists to helping chiropractors - that's it! When, in reality, both of those are normal markets and represent billions of dollars in revenue. Either would work, just not both. You must pick one. No one can serve two masters.
icdp | I have coined the term "niche slap" to remind entrepreneurs in my communities to commit once they pick. All businesses and, all markets, have unpleasant characteristics. The grass is never greener once you get to the other side. If you keep hopping from niche to niche, hoping that the market will solve your problems, you deserve to be niche slapped.
wtse | You must stick with whatever you pick long enough to have trial and error. You will fail. In fact, you will fail until you succeed. But you will fail far longer if you keep changing who you market to, because you must start over from the beginning each time. So, pick then commit.
bm7g | Riches Are In The Niches
jr68 | The other reason to commit to the niche is because of how much more you will make.
axix | Simply put, niching down will make you far more money.
05y4 | Author Note - When To Broaden (Advice For Most People)
2fb0 | For most, if you are under $10M per year, niching down will make you more money. After that, it will depend on how narrow the niche is, or, what is called TAM (total addressable market). A business can really only grow to meet the total addressable market. That being said, for most people, getting to $10M per year is already a top .4% achievement (only 1 in 250 businesses achieve this). So for 99.6 percent of readers below $10M per year, it's almost always easier to serve fewer clients more narrowly. But if you want to go beyond that, you may (depending on the size of your TAM) have to broaden your audience by going up market, down market, or into an adjacent market where your existing services can provide value.
s9fn | For context, many companies expanded to $30M+ per year serving a single niche: Chiropractors, Gyms, Plumbers, Solar, Roofers, Salon Owners, etc. If you are at $1M or $3M, thinking you have capped and must expand, you are wrong. You just need to be better.
k5r6 | When I truly grasped how much more profit I was leaving on the table, it changed my life. It was what took me from doing acquisition for anyone to teaching it to a specific avatar. In my instance, I decided on a microgym owner with ~100 members, a signed lease, at least one employee, and wanted to help clients lose weight. That's pretty specific compared to "small business owners" or "anyone who will pay me" which is common. And I was very specific. In that business (Gym Launch) - we turned down - and still do - anyone who is not that avatar. That means no personal trainers, no online coaches, etc.
z9v9 | Could I have helped them? Of course I could have. I mean heck, the majority of our portfolio is comprised of non-gym companies. But in order to maintain product focus, and high converting messaging, knowing exactly who the product was for was a game changer.
gpu9 | It helped us know exactly who we were speaking to at all times. And exactly whose problems we were solving.
u5ws | But simplicity and ease may not be enough to sway you, so let me illustrate why honing in on one niche will make you more money.
onkh | Reason: you can literally charge 100x more for the exact same product. Dan Kennedy was the first person to illustrate this for me, and I will do my best to pass on the torch to you in these pages.
8t55 | Niching Product Pricing Example: Example
7imw | Product
lf1t | Price
tze7 | Time Management
ryvv | $19
zdrh | Time Management For Sales Professionals
osmo | $99
0b8v | Time Management For Outbound B2B Sales
fucs | $499
yply | Time Management For Outbound B2B Power
75n5 | $1997
ec91 | Tools & Gardening Sales Reps
wul6 | Dan Kennedy taught me this (and it changed my life forever). Let's say you sold a generic course on Time Management. Unless you were some massive time management guru with a compelling or unique story, it would be unlikely it would turn into anything significant. What do you think "yet another" time management course is valued at? $19, $29? Sure. Nothing to write home about. Let's just say $19 for illustration sake.
4rhy | ** Now we shall unleash the power of niche pricing in various stages on your product*
092d | So let's imagine you make the product more specific, keeping the same principles, and call it "Time Management For Sales Professionals." All of a sudden, this course is for a more specific type of person. We could tie their increase to even one more sale or one more deal and it would be worth more. But there are a lot of sales people. So this might be a $99 product. Neat, but we can do better.
94ul | So let's go down another level of niching and call our product .... "Time Management for B2B Outbound Sales Reps." Following the same principles of specificity, now we know our sales people probably have very experienced deals and commissions. A single sale would easily net this salesman $500 (or more), so it would be easy to justify a $499 price tag. This is already a 25x increase in price for almost an identical product. I could stop here, but I'm going to go one step further.
0vdu | Let's just niche down one last level .... "Time Management for B2B Outbound Power Tools & Gardening Sales Reps." Boom.
a230 | Think about it for a second, if you were a power tools outbound sales rep, you would think to yourself "This is made exactly for me" and would happily fork over maybe $1000 to $2000 for a time management program that could help you achieve your goal.
dvoe | The actual pieces of the program may be the same as the generic $19 course, but since they have been applied, and the sales messaging could speak so much to this avatar, they will find it more compelling and get more value from it in a real way. This concept applies to anything you decide to do. You want to be 'the guy' who services 'this type of person' or solves 'this type of problem.' And even more niched 'I solve this type of problem for this specific type of person in this unique counter- intuitive way that reverses their deepest fear."
677t | That's why a fitness program for generic weight loss might be priced at only $19 while a fitness program designed and marketed only to shift-nurses might be priced at $1997 .... (even though the core of the program is likely similar - eat less, move more).
5hk6 | End Result: The market matters. Your niche matters. And if you can sell the same product for 100x the price, should you?
viei | I'll let you decide.
rk0j | Summary Points
c6x9 | The purpose of this chapter is to reinforce two things. First, don't pick a bad market. Normal markets are fine. Great markets are great. Second, once you pick, commit to it until you figure it out.
g5at | If you try one hundred offers, I promise you will succeed. Most people never try anything. Others fail once, then give up. It takes resilience to succeed. Stop personalizing! It's not about you! If your offer doesn't work, it doesn't mean you suck. It means your offer sucks. Big difference. You only suck if you stop trying. So, try again. You'll never become world class if you stop after a failed attempt.
re3j | If you find a crazy good market, ride it, and ride it hard. And if you pair a Grand Slam Offer with a crazy market, you'll likely never need to work again (seriously). So have this skill set - the ability to accurately assess markets by taking into account pain, money, targeting, and growth - in your back pocket so that when lightning strikes, you can make sure it strikes twice.
6z45 | Having established how to nail a market, let's get back to pricing. The first step to making crazy money is charging premium prices.

86d4 | ll I could see was black. My eyes felt glued shut. I was awake, but the fatigue in my temples felt like a five-pound weight was duct-taped to my skull, dragging my eyelids back down. I had to concentrate forcibly to open them.
z7qp | The details of the dimly lit room beamed in. I rolled over to the edge of the hotel room bed, feeling each and every muscle in my body as my weight shifted. Hunched on my side, I could see my clothes scattered on the floor. I was so beat the night before that I didn't even remember taking them off.
6t1g | I had just finished a five-day gauntlet of keynote after keynote presentation. Two days of presentations for our highest-level clients immediately followed by spending two days planning with our entire company (135+ employees).
cpls | I had missed a FaceTime call from my father the day before. I didn't have anything on my agenda for the morning. So I creakily got up, slid into a hoodie and some sweats, and walked into the hotel hallway to call him back. After the initial pleasantries, he immediately dove into why he was calling - parental concern.
m50n | "I saw the picture you posted of all your clients . .. " he said, but in an unusually concerned tone. "I thought the event was for all your highest-paying clients? I didn't know it was a big event. It looked like you had a thousand people there!"
eztf | Alone in the hallway and struggling to shake the heavy weight of exhaustion still, I tried to gauge where his concern was coming from and what he was getting at. I had explained this all to him already. "It was only for our highest-level clients, that wasn't all our clients," I said. "Just the ones who pay $42,000 a year ... our Gym Lords, like I told you."
bwsu | "Every single person in that picture paid you $42,000?" He sounded almost frightened at the idea.
oqod | "Yeah, wild right?" My voice was hoarse from days of speaking and thousands of twenty-second conversations.
tey0 | "Is it legal what you're doing?" he asked. Wow. That escalated quickly, I thought to myself. "Do they know they're paying you that much?"
ghiv | "Yes, it's legal. And of course they know. It's not like magically siphoning money." "That's a lot of money. I hope what you're giving them is worth it."
o5ts | I contemplated whether it was worth the effort to dive into this or just ignore it. But knowing this was going to be "a thing," I took a deep breath and began to explain. "If I made you $239,000 extra this year, would you pay me $42,000?" I asked, using "$239,000" because it was the average increase in topline revenue of a gym using our systems for 11 months.
hd7d | "For sure," he said, "I mean if I knew I was going to make that back. But what would I have to do?"
ehux | "About 15 hours a week of work"
poxj | "And how long would it take me to make the $239,000?"
2xvb | "Eleven months"
m1hx | "And how much of the $42,000 would I have to pay you up front?"
9psh | "Nothing. Just pay me as you start making the money using the system"
aiqv | I watched it click. My dad got it. "Oh," he said, "well then, yeah, I would do it."
4klz | "And that's why they do it, too."
xz5d | Making shit loads of money breaks people's minds. It literally stretches their minds so far past what they believe is possible they assume you are doing something wrong or illegal. They literally "can't even."
erwx | Why? Because they think to themselves . . . they can't be that much smarter than me or work that much harder than me, so how is it possible for them to make 1,000 times more than me? Enough money that it would take me literally ten lifetimes to make what they make in a year.
ie7i | In the three years leading up to me writing this book, I took home over $1,200,000/mo in profit. Every. Single. Month. That's more than the compensation for the CEOs of Ford, McDonalds, Motorola, & Yahoo . . . combined . . . every year . . . as a kid in his twenties.
aksw | It angers those who believe life isn't fair. It confuses others who cannot comprehend and believe there must have been a mistake. And it inspires a select few, who are bound for greatness.
0fsl | I hope that you are in the last category, because that is who I am writing this for.
0m3g | You can do this.
9sp0 | You just need to learn how.
nbpk | And I'm gonna show you.
xs3r | Price to Value Discrepancy
ffuj | "I hope what you're giving them is worth it."
h7f6 | Those words would probably sting for most, but when my dad said them to me, I just knew he didn't understand the value we were providing. What I want to show you is how to create and communicate value, aka the "worth-it-ness" of an offer.
t74k | In order to understand how to make a compelling offer, you must understand value. The reason people buy anything is to get a deal. They believe what they are getting (VALUE) is worth more than what they are giving in exchange for it (PRICE). The moment the value they receive dips below what they are paying, they stop buying from you. This price to value discrepancy is what you need to avoid at all costs.
qdn7 | After all, as Warren Buffet said, "Price is what you pay. Value is what you get."
dib4 | PRICE TO VALUE DISCREPANCY
yvqj | VALLE
vz2f | PRICE
wyu0 | POINT OF CANCELLATION
s8xw | The simplest way to increase the gap between price to value is by lowering the price. It's also, most of the time, the wrong decision for the business.
afv1 | Getting people to buy is NOT the objective of a business. Making money is. And lowering price is a one-way road to destruction for most - you can only go down to $0, but you can go infinitely high in the other direction. So, unless you have a revolutionary way of decreasing your costs to 1/10th compared to your competition, don't compete on price.
fwf1 | As Dan Kennedy said, "There is no strategic benefit to being the second cheapest in the marketplace, but there is for being the most expensive."
3wck | So the goal of our Grand Slam Offer will be to get more people to say yes at a higher price by increasing our value to price discrepancy. In other words, we will raise our price only after we have sufficiently increased our value. This way, they still get a great deal (think buying $100,000 of value for $10,000). It's 'money at a discount.'
