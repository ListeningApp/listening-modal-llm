You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,

82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

863b | For the first subtask, the performance at TF and cell type ASBs was 0.74 and 0.73 for the area under the receiver operating characteristic (auROC), and 0.44 and 0.56 for the area under the precision-recall curve (auPRC), respectively (see the plots in Supplementary Fig. 8). For the second subtask, we used the top 10 TFs and top 10 cell types with the highest numbers of ASBs, and a dedicated model was trained for each TF and each cell type (Supplementary Table 6 and Supplementary Fig. 8). The quality of the models was different for different TFs and cell types, with the highest auROC of 0.72 and 0.81 for CTCF (of TFs) and HepG2 (of cell types), and the highest auPRC of 0.35 and 0.64 for CTCF and A549. Of note, RAD21 ASBs were also predicted with

Data for HeLa and GM12878 cells were extracted from the Shi et al. collection (dotted green line). A subset of 2438 top-significant ADASTRA ASBs (the subset size equal to that of the BaalChIP set) is additionally shown to illustrate that these ASBs relatively more often coincide with potent eQTLs.

ba4l | Analysis of the feature importance (Supplementary Fig. 8) showed that all models utilized signals from the final layer of the DeepSEA neural network that was specifically designed to distinguish regulatory SNVs. Of note, among multiple DeepSEA features, those for the matched cell types were automatically prioritized. In agreement with previous studies16,20, the models also obtained useful information from the experimental DNase- Seq data, and the data on allelic imbalance were generally more important than the basic read coverage. In the case of ASBs of particular TFs, motif-based features further facilitated distin- guishing ASBs from non-ASBs. We expect that the same framework can allow further improvement of ASB prediction when supplied with additional chromatin accessibility and allelic imbalance data from matched cell types and with improved models of TF-binding sites.
ffx8 | Disease-associated SNPs and eQTLs are enriched with ASBs. To assess if ASB facilitates the identification of functional reg- ulatory sequence alterations, we annotated the ASB-carrying SNVs using data from several databases on phenotype-genotype associations: NHGRI-EBI GWAS catalog36, Clin Var37, PheWAS38, and BROAD fine-mapping catalog of causal auto- immune disease variants39. With these data, we counted the number of known associations per SNP, considering SNVs of several classes: low-covered SNVs not tested for ASB (non-can- didate sites having the maximal read coverage across experiments not reaching 20); candidate sites that exhibit or not exhibit ASB from the data sets of a single TF; candidate sites from the data sets for two or more TFs that, again, exhibit ASB or do not; and finally, regulator-switching ASBs, where different TFs prefer to bind alternative alleles, e.g., in different cell types. All variants

06ht | were segregated into classes in regard to known associations: no known associations, with a single association, and with multiple associations.
v3r2 | We have found that the share of ASB variants with genetic associations was consistently higher than expected by chance (Fig. 5a), which apparently makes ASBs good candidates for prospection for causal SNVs. Specifically, the odds ratio between the observed and expected SNP numbers was specifically high for TF-switching ASBs, although only 1.5% of such ASBs were involved in two or more known GWAS associations. For many variants, there are no known associations with "macro-pheno- types," as provided by GWAS studies, but there are data on molecular phenotypes like variations in mRNA levels. In fact, the effect of the so-called eQTLs40 can be explained by the alteration of TF-binding affinity that is revealed by ASB. Using the same classification of SNVs as above, we tested ASB and non-ASB SNVs for overlaps with GTEx41 eQTLs and observed the same pattern as for phenotype associations, with the strongest enrichment of ASBs for which different TFs preferably bind alternative alleles (Fig. 5b). The enrichment also grew stronger with the number of genes, mRNA levels of which were associated with the variant. The same effect holds for multi-cell type ASBs (Supplementary Fig. 9).
nv42 | More than 80% of ASB SNVs with alternative alleles preferably bound by different TFs overlap eQTLs in at least one cell type, whereas 10% of such ASB SNVs overlap eQTLs targeting ten or more genes. A large fraction of genes of medical relevance from the ClinVar catalog37 was found among protein-coding genes associated with ASB eQTLs (twofold enrichment as compared to random expectation, Fisher's exact test P ~10-49). Of note, as many as 90% of genes of medical relevance in Clin Var are eQTL targets of ASB SNVs, and this constitutes 30% of all target genes of ASB eQTLs.

ko3c | It is not trivial to measure the reliability of ASB identification due to difficulty in assembling a highly reliable "ground truth" set of ASBs, that is necessary to compute standard performance measures based on true and false positives/negatives. For instance, only synthetic data were used for benchmarking purposes in the original BaalChIP paper19. On the other hand, despite difficulties in the direct evaluation of ASB calling performance, it is possible to estimate implicitly the "regulatory potential" of particular SNPs from functionally related data. We performed a comparison of ASB calls between ADASTRA, BaalChIP, and Shi et al. data comparing ASBs with GTEx eQTLs (Fig. 5c and Supplementary Fig. 9). The level of eQTL support for ADASTRA ASBs turned out to be comparable to that of the BaalChIP ASB set, with Shi et al. data close behind.
xek3 | We also studied the association of GWAS-tested phenotypes with all candidate SNVs, not necessarily significant ASBs, found in TF-binding regions. To this end, we performed a general enrichment analysis for SNPs found in ChIP-Seq data of particular TFs within linkage disequilibrium blocks (LD-islands identified in42) using Fisher's exact test (see "Methods"). Thus we identified TFs for which phenotype-associated SNVs were enriched within TF-binding regions (Supplementary Fig. 9). For a number of TFs such association with phenotypes was reported in other studies. The examples include FOXA1 (involved in prostate development43 and in our case, found associated with prostate cancer), IKZF1 (for which the protein damaging mutations are associated with leukemia), STAT1 (involved in the development of systemic lupus erythematosus44), and others. Practically in all cases one or several of the associated SNVs also acted as ASBs of the respective TF, providing strong candidates for causality.
bbpr | To illustrate how the functional role of regulatory SNPs can be highlighted with ASB data, we present several case studies. First, there is rs3761376 (G > A) that serves as a Ref-ASB for ESR1, which was already confirmed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay45. rs3761376 is located in the TFF1 gene promoter and was shown to reduce TFF1 expression through altered ESR1 binding, suggesting a molecular mechanism of the increased risk of gastric cancer45.
5zyf | Next, there is rs17293632 (C > T) that serves as a Ref-ASB for 25 different TFs and was previously reported to affect the chromatin accessibility in the adjacent region46. rs17293632 is associated with Crohn's disease. This SNP is located in SMAD3 intron and overlaps an eQTL targeting SMAD3, AAGAB, and PIAS1 genes41. Interestingly, a variant of SMAD3 is also associated with Crohn's disease, particularly, with increased risk of repeated surgery and shorter relapse47. Among the TFs displaying ASBs, there are JUN/FOS proteins with the ASB- concordant motif annotation. The AP1 pioneer complex of JUN/ FOS likely serves as a "driver" for changes both in gene expression and chromatin accessibility, and is likely to cause ASB of all 25 TFs.
9own | Apart from multi-TF ASBs which are linked to local chromatin changes, non-trivial cases can be found among TF-switching ASBs. For example, SNP rs58726213 is associated with psoriasis and is ASB of CREB1 (reference allele preference, concordant with motif) and JUN (alternative allele preference). rs58726213 is located in the STX4 intron or upstream region depending on a transcript variant. STX4 is significantly downregulated in psoriasis48, and, according to GTEx, rs58726213 serves as an eQTL of STX4 and HSD3B7; the latter is also reported as psoriasis susceptibility locus49.
bqfb | Another example is SNP rs11257655 that is associated with type 2 diabetes50. rs11257655 is reported to be located in the CDC123 regulatory region and exhibits ASB of FOXA1 (alter- native allele preference, concordant with the sequence motif),

mn1r | ESR1 (reference allele preference), and three other TFs (SPI1, STAT1, and SMC3). According to UniProt51, FOXA1 is involved in liver and pancreas development, and in glucose homeostasis. At the same time, polymorphisms in the ESR1 gene are associated with type 2 diabetes and with fasting plasma glucose 52,53
5vqw | Thus, ASBs highlight the cases where phenotype-genotype associations arise with different mechanisms, either from protein structure variation, or due to altered gene expression caused by nucleotide substitutions in the gene regulatory region.
meyw | Discussion
2e62 | The functional annotation of noncoding variants remains a challenge in modern human genetics. Phenotype-associated SNPs found in GWAS are usually located in extensive linkage dis- equilibrium blocks, and reliable selection of causal variants can- not be done purely by statistical means. Additional data for the identification of causal variants come from functional genomics. In particular, an important class of causal variants consists of regulatory SNVs affecting gene transcription. For those variants, there are various approaches, e.g., parallel reporter assays, to obtain high-throughput data on molecular events caused by particular nucleotide substitution. Another common strategy is to check if a variant of interest falls into a known gene regulatory region detected by chromatin immunoprecipitation or chromatin accessibility assay followed by deep sequencing. By assessing the allele specificity, it is possible to further profit from these data through direct estimation of the effect that a particular allele has on the binding of relevant regulatory proteins or chromatin accessibility.
75y3 | In this meta-study, for each SNV, we integrated the data by considering a TF bound to SNV in different cell types or a cell type and different TFs bound to the same SNV. Surprisingly, ASB identification through data aggregation had better sensitivity than standard ChIP-Seq peak calling at the level of individual data sets. Particularly, in GTRD, the ChIP-Seq peak calls were gathered from four different tools (MACS, SISSRs, GEM, and PICS), but only 85-90% of significant ASBs were detected within peak calls (199,819 of 233,290 and 324,890 of 351,965 for TF-centric and cell type-centric aggregation), suggesting that up to 15% of ASBs could be lost if the ASB calling was restricted to the peak calls only.
