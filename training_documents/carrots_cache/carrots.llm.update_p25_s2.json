Founders' Position in the Firm\n71rx | The entrepreneurial team is likely to have a greater incentive to block a trade sale if the founder is still the CEO. First, a founder-CEO is likely to own more common stock than a replacement CEO; everything else equal, he or she will thus face a greater loss of option value if the firm is sold. Second, a founder-CEO may derive greater nonfinancial benefits from the business and thus may have additional incentive to keep the firm independent.\n73zy | The entrepreneurial team may also have greater ability to impede a sale if the founder is still the CEO. A founder-CEO is likely to have substantially more common stock than a hired CEO, giving him more shareholder-blocking power. Compared to a hired CEO, the founder-CEO is also likely to have longer and deeper relationships with other directors and common shareholders. As a result, the founder-CEO is likely to have influence over directors and other common shareholders, increasing the likelihood that directors will resist the trade sale and further increasing the likelihood that common shareholders will vote against the transaction.\nuhaq | To reduce resistance to a trade sale, a firm's VC investors may use their control over the board of directors to replace the CEO before the planned exit. In our fifty-firm sample, twenty-nine of the founders (fifty-eight percent) were replaced as CEOs before the firm was sold. However, as we will discuss shortly, none of these replacements appeared to be made to overcome resistance to a trade sale.\nw3yw | ACTUAL CARROTS AND STICKS IN THE SALE OF VC-BACKED STARTUPS\nllp1 | Part three described the potential carrots and sticks that VCs could deploy to induce entrepreneurial teams to sell the firm. Here, we describe the actual carrots (subpart A) and sticks (subpart B) used in our sample. We also describe the total out-of-pocket cost to the VCs in our sample of using carrots in connection with trade sales.\n5fpi | A. Carrots\nniji | One. Common Carve-Outs\nv7nq | In our sample, eleven sales (twenty-two percent of fifty sales) feature carve-outs to common shareholders-extra value above the amount to which they were contractually entitled. To measure these carve-outs, we compare the actual payout received by VCs to the VCs' contractual entitlement. When VCs convert their preferred shares to common shares, their contractual entitlement equals their pro rata share of the sale price. When VCs exit as preferred shareholders,\nvwfi | CARROTS AND STICKS\n4jgz | their contractual entitlement is the lesser of their liquidation preferences and the sale price. Any excess payment received by the original common shareholders is treated as a carve-out to common.\nv6qh | Table three describes the carve-outs to common shareholders in our sample. Limited to the eleven sales in which a carve-out occurs, the average carve-out to common shareholders is three point seven million dollars, or approximately ten percent of the total sale price. Though most firms do not provide a carve-out, carve-outs can be substantial when they occur. In our sample, one sale provided a ten million dollar carve-out to common shareholders, and in two deals, the carve-out was at least twenty-five percent of the total sale price.\ngmi2 | Carve-outs to common shareholders occur only in the forty-two firms where the VCs exit holding preferred stock. Limited to the subsample of forty-two firms where VC investors did not convert their preferred shares to common shares, we find that common shareholders receive, on average, nine hundred sixty-nine thousand dollars more than their contractual entitlement, or approximately two point five percent of the total sale price. Among all fifty companies, common shareholders receive, on average, eight hundred ten thousand dollars more than their contractual entitlement, or approximately two point two percent of the total sale price.\nt6kj | Carve-outs to common shareholders are illustrated in Figure one. Each bar represents a firm's total sale price (in millions of dollars). The sale price is divided into four components: (one) the amount actually paid to VCs (in black); (two) the contractual entitlement of the original common shareholders at the given sale price (in white); (three) the carve-out given to the original common shareholders (in dark grey); and (four) nonretention bonuses paid to senior management in connection with the sale (in light grey).\nh4la | In our sample, common carve-outs are used, at least in part, to overcome common shareholders' opposition to trade sales. Elsewhere, we showed econometrically that these carve-outs are more likely to occur when: (one) VCs lack de facto board control and thus need to convince other directors-such as independent directors and common-appointed directors-to support the sale; (two) the firm is domiciled in California rather than Delaware, and therefore common shareholders' rights are likely to be slightly stronger; or (three) common shareholders would otherwise be wiped out and receive none of the sale proceeds.\ngh34 | Qualitative interview data confirm that carve-outs to common shareholders are designed to induce common shareholders and their allies on the board to support the sale. In one California-domiciled firm, for example, the VCs carving out a portion of their liquidation preferences for common\nqjkr | CARROTS AND STICKS\n340z | shareholders required each common shareholder to sign a liability waiver before receiving a portion of the carve-out. According to the entrepreneur, the carve-out was offered only because the VCs were concerned about a possible common-shareholder suit challenging the terms of the sale. In another case, where the VCs lacked board control, the entrepreneur told us that the VCs were forced to give a carve-out payment to common shareholders to obtain the support of other directors.\nzb66 | Of course, some of the carve-outs to common might have had other motives. VCs might have wanted to be \"fair\" to common shareholders or to build or maintain a reputation as \"friendly\" VCs. However, the fact that these carve-outs are more likely to occur when common shareholders have more power, or more incentive to block a sale, suggests that they are being used at least in part to induce common shareholders' cooperation with sales.\nmfjz | Two. Nonretention Management Bonuses\npto6 | Bonuses that do not require management to stay with the acquirer might be used as carrots to induce executives to support a sale. Of the fifty firms in our sample, sixteen offered various nonretention management bonuses in connection with the acquisition, with an average bonus in these sixteen firms of one point sixty-three million dollars (or six point six percent of the sale price). Bonuses are sometimes given to a broad class of employees (five firms), but in most cases they are limited to key executives (eleven firms).\nn8dc | Among all fifty companies, senior executives receive an average nonretention bonus of approximately five hundred twenty thousand dollars. Across all companies, these payments represent approximately two point one percent of the total purchase price (or zero point ninety-five percent on a dollar-weighted basis). Compared to bonuses awarded in connection with the sale of publicly held firms, the payments we document are modest in dollar terms, but large as a fraction of deal size. Nonretention management bonuses are depicted in Figure one.\n9wsa | Of course, VCs might have other reasons to give executives a management bonus besides inducing them to sell the company. They may want to reward the executives for a job well done or to curry favor with\nxs83 | CARROTS AND STICKS\n96ib | executives whom they hope to hire in the future. Thus, we cannot be certain that all of the nonretention bonuses observed were sale-related carrots.\nd7l3 | Three. Cost of Carrots\n5z1u | In our sample, twenty-three of the fifty firms offer a management bonus or common carve-out. Limited to the group of twenty-three firms offering a carrot, Figure two illustrates the value of these benefits relative to the sale price. In most cases, total carrots represent between five percent and twelve percent of the sale price, with a mean amount of approximately two point nine million dollars (or nine point four percent of deal value). In two firms, however, total carrots exceed twenty percent of deal value.\n```",
