        "content": "nwfz | et al., two thousand six. The element of predictability of jellyfish strandings may provide beach management authorities to plan for and manage beach use and swimming activity when jellyfish swarms are brought close to shore by tides and onshore winds. This has previously been emphasised by Gershwin et al., two thousand fourteen who show how changes in wind patterns can be responsible for onshore transport of cubozoan jellyfish and can be used to predict when irukandji jellyfish stings are most likely to occur. Although our results show tide as a significant predictor of strandings, our results did not reveal wind or modelled current direction as significant predictors. It is possible that for the chi-squared analyses which relied on wind measurements from satellite made out to sea, we had an insufficient sample size to find an effect because the satellite did not provide any data during twenty-three of the fifty-eight days over which the strandings occurred. For the logistic regression, we used wind measurements taken at a weather station on land to avoid missing values; however, these data are less relevant to where the jellyfish are located offshore before stranding, and thus, those winds will have less influence on the onshore transport of jellyfish. It is possible that direct measurements of wind and current related to jellyfish occurrence would yield better results than the satellite wind and modelled current data used here. Thus for the purposes of prediction and to be routinely applied, a method of more reliably obtaining current speed and direction and wind direction, from out over the ocean, west of the beach where the jellyfish are swarming, needs to be found. This could be in the form of moored weather stations and current meters. Another factor that could be important in confounding attempts to match stranding events to environmental conditions is that some scyphozoan jellyfish have been shown to exhibit swimming behaviour including prey searching and diel vertical migrations which will influence the extent to which ocean conditions and currents will influence onshore directional movement of jellyfish. Moreover, recent novel research using jellyfish tagged with accelerometers has shown how jellyfish can actively orient themselves to swim with or against a tidal current and that this behaviour can act to both maintain swarms and avoid beach strandings.\nnvfy | The observations of Marsh and Slack-Smith two thousand ten and those from our study suggest that C. mastigophora can be seasonally abundant in tropical north-western Australia. However, the observed strandings may\nmror | represent a small fraction of those that have occurred due to the remoteness and sparse human population in this region. The areas where it has been observed to be washed up in large numbers are popular tourist areas and strandings in more remote areas are unlikely to be recorded, especially given our observations of rapid disintegration of stranded jellyfish and their subsequent removal by large tidal ranges in the region. Any link between interannual variability in the timing and scale of observed swarms in relation to ocean climate variability is not evident. The swarm in two thousand twelve coincided with an increase in both water temperature and chlorophyll-a, but it is not possible to say the swarm event is related to either as these are likely to be seasonal events. The large swarms in Broome in the latter months of two thousand six and two thousand twelve were during or at the end of El Niño conditions; however, other large swarms observed further south in April two thousand and two thousand thirteen were during La Niña conditions; the swarm in April two thousand seven was during neutral or slight El Niño conditions and the two thousand ten swarm was neutral but right on the transition between the strong two thousand nine El Niño and two thousand ten La Niña conditions.\nzlxc | Economic and ecological significance of C. mastigophora swarms\nk0bw | Large swarms, especially those that occur over protracted periods such as was the two thousand twelve swarm, result in numerous stings on swimming beaches and also deter swimmers from beaches and from areas where tourism is of great economic importance. Other significant impacts of the swarms have included blocking the water cooling intakes of the power station in Karratha in nineteen seventy-six.\naq5a | C. mastigophora is an edible jellyfish species, and a fishery has been established in Indonesia based on export to Japan. To avoid confusion, it is worth noting here, that Rumpet nineteen ninety-one provides an excellent description of another sea-east Asian fishery for \"red\" jellyfish, but it is unlikely that this is C. mastigophora. Rumpet's nineteen ninety-one report from the South China Sea almost certainly refers to Rhopilema esculentum Kishinouye eighteen ninety-one based on the description of fisheries for this species and Rhopilema hispidum Vanhöffen eighteen eighty-eight elsewhere in the South China Sea.\nsc5y | et al., two thousand eight. The economic feasibility of a fishery for C. mastigophora has not been evaluated in Australia and maybe worthy of examination especially if swarms continue to have detrimental economic impacts.",
