Technologies might, for instance, shape public services making them more sustainable and inclusive. Overall, technological transformation is 'concerned with the changes digital technologies can, for instance, bring about in organizations' model, products or organizational structures'. In particular, the challenge is how to integrate technology with the work and actions of frontline professionals, here, street level bureaucrats, in a meaningful and effective way.\ncop0 | The study field of street-level bureaucracy, e-government, ICT and new technologies has also focused on the consequences of technological developments for discretion, legitimacy and the ethics of street-level bureaucrats (later, SLBs). For instance, Buffat offers an extensive summary of e-government and SLB as curtailment and enablement theses. Her study shows that e-government (and overall, ICT) does not have negative or positive consequences for SLB per se, but the outcomes depend on context and implementation. This study contributes to the street-level bureaucracy literature specifically from the viewpoint of the implementation of technology within the public service ecosystems. In our paper we focus on social care services, where direct contact with service users and frontline discretion plays a key role. Implementation of social policies in social work entails negotiations and creation of meanings on the frontline with clients and colleagues, as well as with managers (see,\nlhkq | Carson et al.). Thus, Nothdurfter and Hermans underline the political role of social workers: \"Social policies do not work automatically; their internal ambiguities permit and require considerable discretion for their implementation and street-level delivery\".\n82ju | Against this backdrop we ask, how do street-level bureaucrats implement a new technology in social services? For analytical purposes we utilize a framework of public service ecosystems. Empirically, we focus on the implementation process of a client and patient information system (later, IS), called 'Apotti', which is a large-scale, technology-driven development initiative in Finland. The data consists of ten in-depth, narrative interviews with professionals working at social care services in a mid-sized city in Helsinki-Uusimaa region. In the analysis, the professionals' experiences about how they implemented the new IS in the practices of their everyday work are foregrounded through an interpretive, phenomenon-driven analysis method. We argue that technology implementation, in practice, is done by the public service professionals who in their everyday work constantly make decisions of which available institutional arrangements (aims, values, beliefs, assumptions and practices) they are to follow.\ny2qo | Implementation of New Technologies through the Framework of Public Service Ecosystems\n1piq | In this article we focus on implementation of new technology from the perspective of street-level bureaucrats. We utilize an analytical framework of public service ecosystems (PSEs). The approach of PSE recognizes that multiple actors and components are interrelated in multi-level, dynamic and overlapping PSE, where institutional arrangements both enable and constrain the processes taking place in that particular context. Following Cabrera et al., technology should therefore be considered as only one, although an inter-related component affecting the processes, decision-making and behaviours of actors undergoing technology-driven change.\n7fqw | Foregrounding the interdependencies between the different components, such as technology, of a PSE, is a 'both-and' situation - the technology could be designed to fit the organization's current structures and ways of working or the structures and practices need to be reformulated to meet the operational logic of the new technology. Accordingly, new technologies can, for instance, foster changes in\nrhaz | organizations' structures, processes, products or services. In turn, new technologies may cause disruptions in practices, which means changes that make previous products, services and or processes ineffective. There even might be an inherent expectation about the problems (for example, fragmented social and healthcare service sector) and solutions (for example information systems fostering the integration of social and healthcare services), to which the new technology is considered as an answer.\nwak1 | To better understand the nuanced and multilayered functions of digital technologies within public services, there is a growing body of public service literature utilizing public service ecosystem (PSE) as an analytical framework. Petrescu describes PSE as a unifying framework to understand and analyse the complexities of public service delivery and value creation at the societal, service, and individual levels. According to Strokosch and Osborne, PSEs \"move us beyond the transactional and linear approach associated with NPM, towards a relational model where value is shaped by the interplay between all of these dimensions and not least by the wider societal context and the values that underpin it.\". Thus, the PSE literature better recognizes the policy-making role and interconnectedness of street-level workers who implement new technologies by shifting the focus from the intra-organizational aspects and structures of organizations to the multi-actor, multi-logic, and multi-level PSE.\nwtfz | Public service ecosystem, a dynamic, interactive and tension-filled entity comprising of constellations of living and non-living, co-existing, co-evolving and co-dependent components, provides a more holistic understanding of the complex contexts and interlinked processes of these components. As Vargo et al. foreground, ecosystems are holistic entities, turning one's attention to the dynamics and interconnectedness of the ecosystems' components. For analytical purposes, scholars often divide PSEs to micro, meso and macro levels to better understand the individual (micro), organizational (meso), and institutional (macro) aspects and their interrelations within the context of public service ecosystems.\nqy1i | Understanding technologies as non-living components of PSE, we turn our attention to the street-level bureaucrats and their experiences about the implementation of new technologies and ask, what happens when street-level workers are required to cope with new technologies in the processes of implementation.\n1k9e | That is, how street-level workers and new technology are interlinked; how the street-level workers are able to implement a new technology; and ultimately, what limiting and enabling elements within the particular context of social services does the focus on street-level workers' experiences reveal.\n5bjs | Street-level bureaucrats as policymakers and as sources of reform",
