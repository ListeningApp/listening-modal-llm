Second, we present our empirical study and its results. Third, we discuss the practical challenges of materiality in sustainability reporting and the way forward.\nftfg | Approaches to materiality in sustainability reporting: definitions and tensions Let us first consider the concept of materiality - what it is and how it matters for sustainability reporting. In financial accounting, from where the concept originates, materiality is defined as follows:\n7xi5 | The omission or misstatement of an item is material in a financial report, if, in light of surrounding circumstances, the magnitude of the item is such that it is probable that the judgment of a reasonable person relying upon the report would have been changed or influenced by the inclusion or correction of an item.\nw8r5 | The concept of materiality has, however, increasingly been translated from its use in the conceptual frameworks of financial accounting into the realm of sustainable business and reporting, as well as assurance. Practically speaking, the goal is to distinguish between material sustainability issues, i.e. those sustainability issues that are likely to influence the decision making of\nybik | stakeholders and those issues that are non-material, i.e. not likely to influence decision-making. While the purpose of discerning between more or less material issues in financial reporting is related to understanding factors influencing the financial performance of the company, materiality in sustainability reporting is related to the company's social and environmental performance.\ngii5 | Often, materiality assessments are visualized using a so-called materiality matrix. Such a matrix illustrates the prioritization of sustainability issues in a two-dimensional diagram in which the two axes represent the interests of different stakeholder groups (see the subsequent section for more detail on materiality matrices). In a reporting context, the materiality matrix serves as a taxonomy of the issues that are disclosed in the sustainability report. However, as pointed out by Forstater et al., the basic methodology and matrix can be adapted for different needs and applications either in reporting or strategy development. Thus, it can be used to support various activities, such as risk assessment, performance management and reporting, that rely on discerning material sustainability information from non-material information.\nq5eu | As defined by Adams et al., material sustainability information is any information that is reasonably capable of making a difference to the conclusions drawn by:\na7ao | · stakeholders concerning the positive and negative impacts of the organization on global achievement of the SDGs; and\n29a3 | · providers of financing concerning the ability of the organization to create long-term value for the organization and society.\nsb1e | This definition reflects what is often referred to as \"double materiality,\" in which the former bullet point captures \"environmental and social materiality\" and the latter captures \"financial materiality\". That is, this definition provides a holistic perspective on materiality, which corresponds with the interest of both stakeholders at large and shareholders or investors specifically. Importantly, however, the two rival definitions of materiality that correspond with each of these two are used separately and in parallel. In the following, we outline these concepts and the tensions between them.\nw2yn | Global Reporting Initiative vs Sustainability Accounting Standards Board: two definitions of materiality\nap6l | The two rival definitions of materiality are associated with and used by GRI and SASB, respectively. According to Global Reporting Initiative, material sustainability information refers to \"those topics that have a direct or indirect impact on an organization's ability to create, preserve or erode economic, environmental and social value for itself, its stakeholders and society at large.\" The corresponding two-dimensional matrix used by the GRI to visualize degrees of materiality has \"Influence on stakeholder assessments and decisions\" along the Y-axis and \"Significance of the reporting organization's economic, environmental and social impacts\" along the X-axis.\niest | SASB defines material issues as those \"that are likely to affect the financial condition or operating performance of companies within an industry.\" SASB does not explicitly use a comparable materiality matrix as the one in Figure one. However, conceptually, the SASB approach to materiality is more akin to what is captured in a different kind of materiality matrix commonly used in sustainability reports, e.g. by large companies such as Unilever and Nestlé. In such materiality matrices, the Y-axis typically reads \"Importance for stakeholders\" while the X-axis typically reads \"Importance for the company\" or some comparable variety thereof. The latter phrase relates to the business performance of the reporting company itself, which is of crucial importance to its shareholders. While the materiality matrix\ncox8 | illustrated in Figure two is not used by SASB, it visualizes an approach to materiality that lies closer to the SASB variant. As is evident from the axes in Figure two, such an approach to materiality much more strictly delineates those sustainability issues that are financially material - a concept that SASB indeed has begun using to distinguish it from other forms of materiality. We should note, however, that issues that are judged to be important for the company's business performance by the company itself, may not necessarily be financially material. Thus, to use Figure two as a visual proxy for the SASB approach to materiality, we need to assume that \"Sustainability issues that are important for the company\" refers to sustainability issues that are deemed financially material for the sector in which the company operates.\nppqi | Companies increasingly use such materiality analyses and develop materiality matrices to analyze and visualize which sustainability issues are material to them and that therefore needs to be addressed. Such materiality assessments can thus inform sustainability strategy as well as the measurement and reporting of sustainability performance, as they are a tool for identifying and prioritizing between sustainability issues. Consequently, materiality analyses can be found on corporate websites, in strategy documents and in sustainability reports or integrated reports to visualize and communicate such prioritizations.\n```",
