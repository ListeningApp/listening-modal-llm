You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

ojro | We identified 1234 different sources that published papers on SES. The top 20 journals each published between 0.63% and 7.73% of all publications, accounting for 28.05% of publications in total (Fig. 3a). There were significant differences in the median number of publications between the five most prominent journals <LATEX>\left( x ^ { 2 } = \right.</LATEX> 32.1302, <LATEX>\mathrm { D F } = 4 ,</LATEX> <LATEX>\mathrm { p } < 0 . 0 0 0 1 ,</LATEX> with Ecology and Society having significantly more publications (compared to Ambio, <LATEX>\mathrm { p } < 0 . 0 0 0 1 ,</LATEX> Ecological Economics, <LATEX>p = 0 . 0 1 9 ,</LATEX> Global Environmental Change, <LATEX>p = 0 0 1 ,</LATEX> Journal of Environmental Management, <LATEX>\left. \mathrm { p } < 0 . 0 0 0 1 \right) .</LATEX> There were no significant differences between other journals (Fig. 3b). Ambio and Global Environmental Change published proportionally more papers in the SES field prior to 2000, while Ecology and Society has become increasingly dominant as the main journal publishing SES research since 2000 (Fig. 3c).

u1ky | As measured by raw number of publications, European, North American, and Australasian institutions have contributed most significantly to SES research (Fig. 4a, b), with the United States,
htm9 | Canada, Sweden, Australia, the Netherlands, Germany, the United Kingdom, and South Africa emerging as countries with particularly high number of institutions that study SES. When normalizing institutional paper count by the number of higher education institutions in the country, Kenya, Denmark, and New Zealand were also included as hotspot countries. The lead authors of institutions publishing SES research was most frequently associated with Stockholm University (199 studies), Arizona State University (179 studies), Wageningen University (97 studies), James Cook University (79 Studies), and the University of Queensland (71 studies; Table 2).
8hul | Whereas institutions conducting SES research were clustered in the Global North, the SES being investigated were distributed more broadly across the globe (Fig. 4c, d). Studied SES were most frequently reported to be located in the United States (422), China (226), Australia (169), India (167), Canada (142), Brazil (134), and Mexico (100). A one-way ANOVA revealed significant differences between regions <LATEX>\left( F = 5 . 0 6 8 , \right.</LATEX> <LATEX>\mathrm { P } < 0 . 0 0 1 ,</LATEX> <LATEX>\mathrm { d f } = 1 4</LATEX> Fig. 5), but a posthoc Tukey test revealed that significant differences were mostly between island regions and mainland areas, and that most mainland areas were not significantly different from each other, on average. Even when accounting for size, the Caribbean Islands were understudied compared to most regions. It had a <LATEX>\mathrm { s i g n i f i c a n t l y } \mathrm { m e a n } \mathrm { l c }</LATEX> lower normalized frequency than Asia <LATEX>\left( d \mathrm { i f f } = \right.</LATEX> <LATEX>\mathrm { p } < 0 . 0 0 1 ,</LATEX> Middle East (diff =0.113, <LATEX>\left. p < 0 . 0 3 9 \right) ,</LATEX> North and Central America <LATEX>\left( d i f f = 0 . 1 8 6 , \right.</LATEX> <LATEX>\left. \mathrm { p } < 0 . 0 0 1 \right) ,</LATEX> South America <LATEX>\left( \mathrm { d i f f } = 0 . 1 2 5 \right. ,</LATEX> <LATEX>\left. p = 0 . 0 1 6 \right) ,</LATEX> Southern <LATEX>A f r i c a \left( d i f f = 0 . 1 3 6 , \right.</LATEX> <LATEX>\mathrm { p } = 0 . 0 2 9 ,</LATEX> <LATEX>W e s t \quad A f r i c a \left( d i f f = 0 . 1 0 1 , p = 0 . 0 4 5 \right) , a n d \quad W e s t \quad a n d \quad C e n t r a l \quad E u r o p e</LATEX> Oceania, which was significantly underrepresented compared to both Asia <LATEX>\left( \mathrm { d i f f } = 0 . 1 0 1 \right. ,</LATEX> <LATEX>\left. p < 0 . 0 0 1 \right)</LATEX> and North and Central
