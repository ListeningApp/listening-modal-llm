If a covariate is selected, the post hoc tests are disabled because the tests that we used in the previous chapter are not designed for models that include covariates.\nezla | However, comparisons can be done by clicking Contrasts ...\nrsbu | to access the\nmagd | Contrasts dialog box in Figure Thirteen point six. You cannot enter codes to specify user-defined contrasts (but see SPSS Tip Thirteen point one); instead you can select one of the standard contrasts that we met in Table Twelve point six. In this example, there was a control condition (coded as the first group), so a sensible set of contrasts would be simple contrasts comparing each experimental group to the control (this results in the same contrasts as dummy coding). Click the drop-down list ( None and select a type of contrast (in this case Simple) from this list. For simple contrasts you need to specify the reference category (i.e., the category against which all other groups are compared). By default the last category is used, which for our data is the thirty-minute group. We need to change the reference category to be the control group, which is the first category (assuming that you coded control as one). We make this change by selecting\ntb74 | @ First. Having selected a contrast, click Change\n8l69 | to register the\n1jyv | selection. Figure Thirteen point six shows the completed dialog box. Click Continue to return to the main dialog box.\nolce | Thirteen point five point six Other options\nerx1 | You can get a limited range of post hoc tests by clicking EM Means ... to access the Estimated Marginal Means dialog box (see Figure Thirteen point seven). To specify post hoc tests, drag the independent variable (in this case Dose) from the box labelled Estimated Marginal Means: Factor(s) and Factor Interactions to the box labelled Display Means for (or click Save ... ). Once a variable has been transferred, you'll be able to select Compare main effects to activate the drop-down list ( LSD(none) ) of post hoc tests. The default is to perform a Tukey LSD post hoc test which makes no adjustment for multiple tests (and which I don't recommend). The other options are a Bonferroni post hoc test (recommended) and a Šidák correction, which is like the Bonferroni correction but is less conservative and so should be selected if you are concerned about the loss of power associated with Bonferroni. For this example we'll use the Šidák correction just for variety (we have used Bonferroni in previous examples). As well as producing post hoc tests for the Dose variable, the options we've selected will create a table of estimated marginal means for this variable: these are the\nb3bt | Continue\n0w8m | group means adjusted for the effect of the covariate. Click\nvcu3 | Clicking Options ... opens a dialog box containing the options described in Jane Superbrain Box Thirteen point three. The most useful are (in my opinion) descriptive statistics, parameter estimates, residual plot and HC-four robust standard errors (see Figure Thirteen point seven).\nhjzj | There is no option for specifying planned contrasts like we used in the previous chapter (see Section Twelve point six point two). However, these contrasts can be done if we fit the model using the regression menu. Imagine you chose some planned contrasts as in Chapter Twelve, in which the first contrast compared the control group to all doses of puppy therapy, and the second contrast then compared the thirty-and fifteen-minute groups (see Section Twelve point four). We saw in Sections Twelve point four and Twelve point six point two that we specify these contrasts with codes. For the first contrast we discovered that an appropriate set of codes was negative two for the control group and then one for both the thirty-and fifteen-minute groups. For the second contrast the codes were zero for the control group, negative one for the fifteen-minute group and one for the thirty-minute group (see Table Twelve point four). To do these contrasts when a covariate is included in the model, enter these values as two dummy variables. In other words, add a column called Dummy one in which every person in the control group has a value of negative two and all other participants have a value of one. Add a second column called Dummy two, in which everyone in the control group has the value zero, everyone in the fifteen-minute group has the value negative one and those in the thirty-minute group have a value of one. The file Puppy Love Contrast.sav includes these dummy variables. Output Thirteen point four\nj79f | Run the analysis as described in Section Thirteen point three. The model summary and ANOVA table for the model will be identical to Output Thirteen point one (because we've done the same thing as before; the only difference is how the model variance is subsequently broken down with the contrasts). The B b-values for the dummy variables will be different than before because we've specified different contrasts. Output Thirteen point four shows the model parameters. The first dummy variable compares the control group with the fifteen-and thirty-minute groups. As such, it compares the adjusted mean of the control group (two point nine three) with the average of the adjusted means for the fifteen-and thirty-minute groups: the average of four point seven one plus five point one five over two equals four point nine three. The B b-value for the first dummy variable should reflect the difference between these values: four point nine three minus two point nine three equals two. We discovered in a rather complex and boring bit of Section Twelve point four point two that this value gets divided by the number of groups within the contrast (i.e., three) and so will be two over three equals zero point six seven (as in Output Thirteen point four). The associated T t-statistic is significant: P equals zero point zero one zero, indicating that the control group was significantly different from the combined adjusted mean of the puppy therapy groups.\n6tbv | The second dummy variable compares the fifteen-and thirty-minute groups, and so the B b-value should reflect the difference between the adjusted means of these groups: five point one five minus four point seven one equals zero point four four. In Section Twelve point four point two we discovered that this value gets divided by the number of groups within the contrast (i.e., two) and so will be zero point four four over two equals zero point two two (as in Output Thirteen point four). The associated T t-statistic is not significant: P equals zero point five nine three, indicating that the thirty-minute group did not produce significantly higher happiness than the fifteen-minute group after adjusting for love of puppies.\nxb13 | The remaining options in this dialog box are as follows:\ncxqi | · Descriptive statistics: This option produces a table of means and standard deviations for each group.\nqfmx | · Estimates of effect size: This option produces the value of partial eta squared (partial eta squared) - see Section Thirteen point ten.\n```",
