You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

tf43 | Links can be subjected to axial loads due to the axial restraining effect of adjacent members (which was discussed in Section 2.1) and also the loading scheme and/or geometry of a structural system. For instance, in case of a seismic loading, the EBF configuration shown in Figure 1b will impose higher axial forces on link segments compared to the negligible link axial forces developed in the configuration shown in Figure 1a. A study by Kasai and Popov [10] revealed that the presence of axial force can have deteriorative effects on link behavior. These researchers proposed modified expressions for the plastic moment and shear capacities of links in the presence of axial force. In addition, a modified shear link length limit was defined. The modified capacities are in general related to the axial load ratio, defined by P/Py, where P is the available axial force and Py is the nominal axial yield strength. This study revealed that the plastic capacities should be reduced as a function of P/Py when this ratio exceeds 0.15. These recommendations still form the basis of the AISC 341-10 [3] provisions for links under axial loads.
fcco | In 1990, Ghobarah and Ramadan [61] used nonlinear FE analysis to investigate the effect of axial force on the performance of EBF links. Numerical results demonstrated that the presence of axial force not only reduces the link plastic strength but also its plastic rotation capacity and energy dissipation. A maximum decrease of 37% in ymax was reported. It was also noted that the effect of axial force is most pronounced in links with length ratios near 1.6.
8uji | In a study by Mansour et al. [41] in 2011, the behavior of replaceable shear links was investigated inside a frame system. In these tests the cyclic loading was applied to the floor beam from one end, and thus, half of the applied load was transferred axially through the link. The maximum value of P/Py was reported to be 0.26 which represented a relatively high axial force level. Mansour et al. [41] observed that the links experienced higher peak shear forces when subjected to tension rather than compression, with a maximum difference of 12%. Mansour [34] also demonstrated this issue
df3e | numerically in his dissertation and proposed a simple equation for estimating the increase in the shear capacity due to axial tension.
53eu | In 2014, Dastmalchi [62] conducted nonlinear time-history analyses on a three-story prototype structure with eccentric braces, similar to the configuration shown in Figure 1b. Results revealed that the peak value of P/Py recorded for the links exceeded 0.15 by a wide margin under most earthquake records, indicating the high probability of developing large axial forces in shear links with the selected configuration. Dastmalchi [62] also performed nonlinear FE analyses to examine the behavior of shear links under very high levels of axial force (0.15 < P/Py < 0.5). The monotonic and cyclic shearing of short links under constant axial compression confirmed its detrimental effect on the shear strength and ductility of short links, especially when the length of the shear link was increased. It was also found that the shear capacity formula given in AISC 341-10 [3] underestimates this effect for P/Py > 0.2, and therefore, a numerically calibrated modification factor was introduced for this formula.
a5u1 | It is worth noting that, as stated in the AISC 341-10 [3] commentary, the effect of high axial force on the behavior of long and intermediate links has not been investigated adequately. Therefore, the code [3] requires the use of shear links if high axial force is present in a link.
ry7u | 2.4. Effect of Concrete Slab
5mda | In 1989, Ricles and Popov [63] conducted research on the effect of a concrete slab, placed over the steel framing as a floor system, on EBF links. These researchers reported that the initial stiffness and strength of the composite links were higher than those of the steel links, however, the composite action deteriorated in later cycles. The maximum shear forces resisted by the composite links were 1 to 13% higher than the corresponding steel links. Nevertheless, the general hysteretic behavior of the composite links resembled that of the bare steel links. The slab damage was localized in the vicinity of the link and no damage was observed in the concrete located away from the link segment. The test results also demonstrated that a concrete slab alone cannot provide sufficient lateral bracing for links. Engelhardt and Popov [11, 64] noted in their experimental study that if a diagonal brace is connected to the bottom flange of a link, the presence of a concrete slab can substantially enhance the stability of
i4li | the link by restraining the top flange. A similar observation was also reported by Tsai et al. [65] during the tests on large EBF sub-assemblages conducted at the National Taiwan University in the early 1990s.
r8sm | Mansour et al. [41] also investigated the effect of a concrete slab on link behavior. In the details studied, the replaceable link segment had a smaller depth than the floor beam. Therefore, there was no direct interaction between the link and the composite slab. Nevertheless, it was reported that the specimen with the concrete slab sustained a higher shear force, 14% more when compared to the bare steel specimen, without a notable change in the link rotation capacity. Mansour et al. [41] recommended using more shear studs away from the link region in order to guarantee the slab diaphragm action during major earthquakes.
cuin | Recently, Ciutina et al. [37] tested a single-story EBF setup with very short links with and without a concrete slab. In one case the shear studs were placed along the entire beam length, while in the other case they were suppressed in the link region. Tests by Ciutina et al. [37] confirmed that omitting shear studs only in the link region does not fully eliminate the composite action, since in both of the above cases the shear strength and stiffness were notably higher than those of the steel link. Therefore, it was recommended that the composite action be considered during the EBF design, even if shear studs are only available on the floor beams and not in the link regions. It is worth noting that link regions are protected zones per AISC 341-10 [3] in which the use of shear studs is prohibited. In addition to link behavior, the presence of a concrete slab also affects the structural response of EBF systems, which is discussed further in Section 5.2.
n1i7 | 2.5. Effect of Loading History
0r5m | Popov and his colleagues (e.g. [6, 18]) noticed that the applied loading history (or protocol) during an experimental study has a major effect on the observed plastic rotation capacity of EBF links. A comprehensive study on this effect was, however, conducted recently by Richards and Uang [66, 67].
ne2o | Okazaki et al. [29] reported unexpected link web fractures for a number of tested short links prior to reaching the code-specified 0.08 rad rotation limit. Richards and Uang [66, 67] attributed this issue
sqxn | mainly to the utilized loading history and stated that the loading protocol used by Okazaki et al. [29] (based on Appendix S of AISC 341-02 [68]) was significantly more severe than the loading sequences used in the 1980s tests on short links. Nonlinear time-history analyses were conducted by Richards and Uang [66, 67] on three prototype EBF structures subjected to 20 large-magnitude-small-distance Los Angeles ground motions. The obtained cumulative rotation demands were used to come up with a new protocol which was adopted by AISC 341-05 [69] for the cyclic testing of link-to-column connections. The proposed protocol has fewer cycles with large rotations compared to the old protocol.
