Since G sub i is a weighted sum of the variable X sub i, and the denominator of G sub i is invariant under random permutations of left brace x sub i, j not equal i right brace, it follows, provided W sub i over left parenthesis n minus one right parenthesis is bounded away from zero and from one, that the permutations distribution of G sub i under H sub zero approaches normality as n approaches infinity; cf. Hoeffding and Cliff and Ord. When d, and thus W sub i, is small, normality is lost, and when d is large enough to encompass the whole study\n43ia | fraction numerator W sub i left parenthesis n minus one minus W sub i right parenthesis Y sub i two over denominator left parenthesis n minus one right parenthesis squared left parenthesis n minus two right parenthesis Y one one squared end fraction fraction numerator W sub t star left parenthesis n minus W sub t star right parenthesis Y sub t star over denominator n squared left parenthesis n minus one right parenthesis left parenthesis Y one star right parenthesis squared end fraction area, and thus left parenthesis n minus one minus W sub i right parenthesis is small, normality is also lost. It is important to note that the conditions must be satisfied separately for each point if its G sub i is to be assessed via the normal approximation.\n3g2y | ATTRIBUTES OF G sub i STATISTICS\ngc7v | It is important to note that G sub i is scale-invariant left parenthesis Y sub i equals b X sub i right parenthesis yields the same scores as X sub t but not location-invariant left parenthesis Y sub i equals a plus X sub i right parenthesis gives different results than X sub i. The statistic is intended for use only for those variables that possess a natural origin. Like all other such statistics, transformations like Y sub i equals log X sub i will change the results.\nwqfv | G sub i left parenthesis d right parenthesis measures the concentration or lack of concentration of the sum of values associated with variable X in the region under study. G sub i left parenthesis d right parenthesis is a proportion of the sum of all x sub j values that are within d of i. If, for example, high-value x sub j s are within d of point i, then G sub i left parenthesis d right parenthesis is high. Whether the G sub i left parenthesis d right parenthesis value is statistically significant depends on the statistic's distribution.\nj30a | Earlier work on a form of the G sub i left parenthesis d right parenthesis statistic is in Getis, Getis and Franklin, and Getis. Their work is based on the second-order approach to map pattern analysis developed by Ripley\n7bdk | left parenthesis one nine seven seven right parenthesis. In typical circumstances, the null hypothesis the set of x values within d of location i is a random sample drawn without replacement from the set of all x values. The estimated G sub i left parenthesis d right parenthesis is computed from equation one using the observed x sub j values.
