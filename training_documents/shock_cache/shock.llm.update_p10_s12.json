        "content": "tb74 | The role of invasive hemodynamic assessment with a pulmonary artery catheter is not clearly defined in cardiogenic shock. Although several randomized trials have assessed the use of the pulmonary artery catheter in shock, it is important to note that these studies did not explicitly include patients with cardiogenic shock, nor did they assess the use of pulmonary artery catheter-derived data to guide a treatment algorithm relating to the use of vasoactive agents or mechanical circulatory support. Nonetheless, the use of invasively derived measures of filling pressures and cardiac performance are of increasing clinical interest in the setting of cardiogenic shock. From a left ventricular perspective, in acute myocardial infarction-related cardiogenic shock the cardiac power output (defined as mean arterial pressure minus right atrial pressure multiplied by cardiac output divided by four hundred fifty-one) is a well-defined prognostic marker for short-term outcomes, including mortality. Furthermore, in a population with acute myocardial infarction-related cardiogenic shock, there is evidence suggesting that the cardiac power output can be used to assess the adequacy of hemodynamic support measures, with a cardiac power output greater than zero point eight watts associated with improved outcomes. With respect to the right ventricle, there are several parameters including pulmonary artery pulsatility index (defined as pulmonary artery pulse pressure divided by right atrial pressure), right atrial pressure, and right ventricle stroke work index (defined as stroke volume index multiplied by mean pulmonary artery pressures minus mean right atrial pressure), which have been shown to be predictive of in-hospital mortality in acute myocardial infarction-related cardiogenic shock and decompensated heart failure. In view of the paucity of randomized data supporting the use of the pulmonary artery catheter in cardiogenic shock, there is a considerable need for additional evidence to guide the use of the pulmonary artery catheter in this setting. At present, societal guidelines have insufficient evidence to recommend the routine use of the pulmonary artery catheter in this setting; however, upcoming trials including the ongoing pulmonary artery catheter in cardiogenic shock trial will greatly assist with addressing this knowledge gap.\n8l69 | Biochemical Assessment of Perfusion\n1jyv | Regular biochemical assessment can provide a \"window\" into the current perfusion status of the patient, in addition to classical clinical signs that may include mentation, skin quality, and urine output. In addition to direct measures of end-organ function and injury, for example dynamic changes in serum creatinine when assessing for renal injury, serum lactate provides an important global measure of tissue perfusion.\nolce | Absolute lactate levels have been shown to be a powerful prognostic biomarker in multiple shock states. However, temporal changes in lactate levels may be more meaningful, owing to the highly dynamic nature of these measurements. In a cohort of the Intraaortic Balloon Pump in Cardiogenic Shock Two study, absolute lactate level and clearance at eight hours was an independent predictor of mortality. Furthermore, in the CAPITAL DOREMI study, the time taken for lactate normalization was the most powerful predictor of thirty-day mortality. Serial measurements of biomarkers, in addition to routine clinical examination, can therefore provide clinicians with ongoing feedback about the effectiveness of the initial pharmacologic\nerx1 | Vasoactive Medications in Cardiogenic Shock\nb3bt | stabilization on perfusion (in particular for patients with low cardiac output state and preserved mean arterial pressure) and indicate the need for further escalation of therapy with additional pharmacotherapy or potentially mechanical circulatory support.\n0w8m | FUTURE DIRECTIONS\nvcu3 | Addressing a Lack of Randomized Data to Guide the Appropriate First-Line Therapy in Cardiogenic Shock\nhjzj | The challenges of performing high-quality randomized controlled trials in patients with cardiogenic shock have been well described. Furthermore, the external validity and\nj79f | generalizability of the available trial data are a considerable issue as the majority of studies have exclusively recruited patients once they have undergone their initial prehospital and invasive cardiology management and are receiving supportive care within intensive care unit at the time of randomization. Nonetheless, two seminal intensive care unit trials are currently ongoing. First, the CAPITAL DOREMI-two trial is recruiting patients with cardiogenic shock and assigning them to receive either milrinone, dobutamine, or placebo. This study will provide a crucial insight into the role of inodilators in the initial management of cardiogenic shock. Second, LevoHeartShock is a French prospective, double-blind, multicenter randomized controlled trial of patients with cardiogenic shock already treated with noradrenaline or dobutamine and assigned to receive the addition of either levosimendan or placebo. This study will help inform clinicians about the utility of inodilator therapy, compared with traditional catecholamine agents.\n6tbv | Although these intensive care unit-based trials are likely to be instructive, given the high rates of prehospital treated cardiogenic shock, randomizing patients at first medical contact with emergency medical services may enhance the applicability of any findings to a variety of clinical settings. As catecholamines are frequently used as a first-line therapy in cardiogenic shock, a trial assessing the efficacy and safety of this drug class should be considered as an area of priority. Our group is currently seeking to address this clinical question through the PANDA trial (Paramedic Randomized Trial of Noradrenaline Versus Adrenaline in the Initial Management of Patients with Cardiogenic Shock). This study will randomize patients with cardiogenic shock in the prehospital setting to receive either epinephrine or norepinephrine and will be sufficiently powered to detect a difference in twenty-eight-day mortality and therefore guide first-line catecholamine therapy.\nxb13 | Comparing Mechanical Circulatory Support With Medical Therapy, an Urgent Need for Randomized Data\ncxqi | Mechanical circulatory support use in cardiogenic shock has increased dramatically over the past fifteen years, despite the cost, associated risk of major complications, and limited evidence to support its use. The rationale for the use of these devices is predicated on their ability to restore systemic perfusion, reduce cardiac filling pressures, limit myocardial oxygen consumption, and reduce vasoactive agent requirements. The Impella (Abiomed, Danvers) catheter-based micro-axial flow pump and venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation have been readily adopted to provide hemodynamic support and incorporated into a range of cardiogenic shock treatment algorithms. This practice has occurred despite very limited randomized data supporting the safety and efficacy of these treatments, in addition to determining\nqfmx | Vasoactive Medications in Cardiogenic Shock",
