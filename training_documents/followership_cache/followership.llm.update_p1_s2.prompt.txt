You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021.

c6hh | Rethinking Followership
y7ea | ABATERIAL
nav4 | W hen I began my work on followership twenty-five years ago, I was not particularly aware of what I was doing in the bigger scheme of things. My only goal was to bring attention to the study of followers. I was simply thinking about followers and followership roles, and I wanted to explore the subject.
gem8 | At the time, leadership was the primary focus for just about all scholars in the field. Very little research or theorizing considered followers, and if it did, its pur- pose was to better understand leadership.1 I felt like the odd person out. Execu- tives, academics, and even people sitting next to me on airplanes questioned why I would bother with followership when leadership spurred the media attention, research funding, and high-paying corporate training gigs. Most people held a very negative view of followership and discounted anything positive that could come from the role. No one talked about followership; it was never part of the conversation, unless it was tagged on as an afterthought. At some point, I finally decided to put a stake in the ground and say to the world, "We need to pay atten- tion to followers. Followership is worthy of its own discrete research and training. Plus, conversations about leadership need to include followership because leaders neither exist nor act in a vacuum without followers."
e8nr | The road I went down was not easy at first. I made a major step with my 1988 Harvard Business Review article, "In Praise of Followers."2 In it, I explained that
k78w | we view the world as a map with leadership in the center and everything else on the periphery. I remember a perspective-altering trip to Japan, where I was shown a world map with Japan in the center and the United States tucked over in the corner. This is what I wanted to do for followership: to put it in the middle of the map and to let everything else be on the periphery.
g9du | "In Praise of Followers" turned out to be fairly controversial. Some people just flat out didn't like it, comparing followers to sled dogs whose destiny is always to look at the rear end of the dog in front of them, but never to see the wider hori- zon or make the decisions of the lead dog. Other readers could not thank me enough for articulating what they secretly held in their heart. These folks believed that being a strong #2 often allowed for greater contributions than being in the #1 spot and that making the assist was just as important as making the score. Many had no desire to be leaders.
f682 | Controversy, I learned, can be good for spreading the word. So many people read, discussed, argued, and tried to apply the ideas in the article that it became one of HBR's best-selling reprints and earned the article the "HBR Classic" designation. My 1992 book, The Power of Followership, and Ira Chaleff's 1995 book, The Courageous Follower, propelled the concept even further.3 In the years since then, followership has made increasing headway into the mainstream, and the amount of interest in the topic seems to be escalating. For example, the word itself is now part of the organizational vocabulary. It is rare for someone to talk about leadership without also discussing the corresponding role of followership. Most leader- ship courses now have a section devoted to followership, and followership is increas- ingly taught as a stand-alone course in universities and corporations, such as Barbara Kellerman's followership course at Harvard's Kennedy School. Several master's theses and doctoral dissertations have studied followership in nursing, education, business, and sports. A 2007 Google search turned up over 187,000 hits for the term follower and over 92,000 hits for followership research. Ron Riggio, Jean Lipman-Blumen, and Ira Chaleff organized at Claremont McKenna College in 2006 the first national followership conference. On a personal level, more and more people contact me now wanting to know about followership. Most impor- tant, more people admit to me that they not only play the followership role but also prefer it. The landscape for followership has changed considerably in the last twenty-five years.
li1k | The Art of Followership
pbea | FOLLOWERSHIP STYLES
ccpt | My previous work, which served as a launching point for the field, involved basic preliminary research on the styles of followership. Two dimensions seemed to define the way that people follow:
0fpw | 1. Do they think for themselves? Are they independent critical thinkers? Or do they look to the leader to do the thinking for them?
dqn8 | 2. Are they actively engaged in creating positive energy for the organization? Or is there negative energy or passive involvement?
cop0 | Based on these two dimensions, there are five basic styles of followership:
lhkq | The sheep. Sheep are passive and look to the leader to do the thinking for them and to motivate them. If you are the boss and in your car on the way to work, and you're thinking about what you're going to get your workers to do and how you're going to do that, then you're dealing with sheep.
82ju | The yes-people. Yes-people are positive, always on the leader's side, but still looking to the leader for the thinking, the direction, the vision. If the leader asks them to do something, they've got the energy, and they'll go forward with it. When they finish that task, they'll come back to the leader, asking, "What do you want me to do next?" However, yes-people don't see themselves this way. One of the things I've learned is that the different styles of followers will almost always put a positive spin on their style. Yes-people will say, "I'm a doer; that's my job. The boss gets paid to think, and I'm the one who does the work." But the rest of us would say there's more to being a good follower than simply doing.
y2qo | The alienated. Alienated followers think for themselves, but have a lot of nega- tive energy. Every time the leader or organization tries to move forward, these are the ones who have ten reasons why the leader or organization shouldn't. They are not coming up with the next solution, but are skeptical, cynical about the cur- rent plan of action. They have energy, they can think for themselves, they can be smart. But they are not moving in a positive direction. However, they see them- selves as the mavericks, the only people in the organization who have the guts to stand up to the boss.
1piq | The pragmatics. Pragmatics sit on the fence and see which way the wind blows. Once they see where things are headed, they'll get on board. They'll never be the first on board, but they will never let the leader or organization leave
7fqw | Rethinking Followership
rhaz | without them. They see themselves as preservers of the status quo. Their internal dialogue goes something like this: "If I got all excited every time there was a new leader or a change of direction, my wheels would be spinning constantly. Leaders come and go. New visions come and go. If I just sit here and wait it out, I won't have to do all that work." So they do what they must to survive, but wait it out until the storms of change blow over.
wak1 | The star followers. Star followers think for themselves, are very active, and have very positive energy. They do not accept the leader's decision without their own independent evaluation of its soundness. If they agree with the leader, they give full support. If they disagree, they challenge the leader, offering constructive alternatives that will help the leader and organization get where they want to go. Some people view these people as really "leaders in disguise," but this is basically because those people have a hard time accepting that followers can display such independence and positive behavior. Star followers are often referred to as "my right-hand person" or my "go-to person."
