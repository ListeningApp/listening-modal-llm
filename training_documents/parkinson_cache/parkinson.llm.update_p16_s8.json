        "content": "p1l0 | Recent developments suggest that alpha-synuclein pathology spreads in a prion-like manner through synaptically connected regions in a manner consistent with Braak staging. The E-L system plays a prominent role in cell-to-cell transmission of preformed alpha-synuclein filaments, leading to the spread of phospho-alpha-synuclein pathology. Internalization of fibrillar alpha-synuclein occurs via endocytosis (as well as tunnelling nanotubules) and follows the neuronal endosomal pathway to lysosomal degradation. Heparan sulfate proteoglycans, lymphocyte-activation gene three, alpha-three isoform of sodium/potassium ATPase, and a few endocytic vesicle receptors are predicted to act as receptors for alpha-synuclein preformed fibrils. In vitro studies suggest that internalized alpha-synuclein fibrils are localized in both early endosomes and late endolysosomes. The lipid bilayer of endosomes restricts cytoplasmic spillage, so most endocytosed alpha-synuclein is degraded by lysosomes. How a fraction of alpha-synuclein preformed fibrils escapes this barrier and goes on to initiate seeding is still unclear. Studies of alpha-synuclein axonal transport predict that retrograde transport of alpha-synuclein preformed fibrils is mediated by endocytic vesicles and is twice as fast and more efficient than anterograde transport. This strengthens the notion that PD pathology spreads retrogradely from the synaptic terminal to soma. The E-L system is also involved in exocytosis of fibrilized alpha-synuclein, facilitating its prion-like spread. An ER-bound enzyme with chaperone activity USP19 (Ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase nineteen) has been shown to deliver misfolded alpha-synuclein to late endosomes, which then fuses with the plasma membrane through a unique process called misfolding-associated protein secretion. Another recent study suggests that the DNAJ/Hsc70 complex could facilitate alpha-synuclein exocytosis. Overexpression of ATP13A2 and GBA is also noted to increase exocytosis of alpha-synuclein. Together, these observations identify the E-L system as the primary conduit for the spread of alpha-synuclein-mediated pathology in PD.\n1i8b | Leucine-Rich Repeat Kinase two (LRRK two) is a multidomain large protein with both GTPase and kinase activity along with other domains for protein-protein interaction. Epidemiological, histopathological, and clinical investigations have all established LRRK two gene mutations as the most common genetic cause of PD, with a considerable contribution to sporadic cases. Over eight identified LRRK two mutations cause PD. The mutation at\n5sfj | G two thousand nineteen S is the most common and is known to increase LRRK two's activity. LRRK two functions have been explored through PD-related studies, in which increased G two thousand nineteen S kinase activity reveals its close association with the E-L system. LRRK two's role in vesicular trafficking, lysosomal homeostasis, and autophagy are well accepted. Phosphorylation by LRRK two is essential for a subset of RAB GTPases' function of endolysosomal vesicular sorting and trafficking. In an overexpression system, RAB7L one was noted to interact strongly with LRRK two at the switch-two site, unlike as seen in in vitro kinase assays. Several LRRK two mutations significantly affect RAB pathways, where variations in Rab7L one's interactions with LRRK two have been identified to increase the risk of sporadic PD. In fact, recent GWAS identify RAB29 encoding RAB7L one as an independent risk gene for PD. Rab7L one upregulation could attenuate LRRK two-induced toxicity in dopaminergic neurons. This is predicted to be functioning through VPS35 and VPS26. VPS35 also cooperates with LRRK two to regulate SV recycling and dopaminergic synaptic release, thus suggesting a prominent role for the retromer complex in LRRK two-mediated PD pathogenesis.\nvk4h | LRRK two regulates lysosomal protein trafficking and morphology. In LRRK two mutants, perinuclear lysosomal clustering was noted, mediated by increased phosphorylation of RAB seven. Two-pore channels are the calcium channels present on acidic vesicles of the E-L system and help in regulating their trafficking and fusion of lysosomes with autophagosomes/endosomes. Abnormal lysosomal morphology and density seen in fibroblasts from patients with LRRK two mutations could be reversed by inhibiting these two-pore channels. Thus, these channels might be one potential mediator of E-L system dysfunction in LRRK two-associated PD. Lysosome-related proteins involved in PD such as Gcase one, Lamp two A and ATP13A two are also downregulated in PD patients with LRRK two mutations, suggesting lysosomes are one of LRRK two's prime targets.",
