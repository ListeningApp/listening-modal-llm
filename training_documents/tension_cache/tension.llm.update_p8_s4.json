        "content": "dqvj | Consider the case of the category \"Clothing, accessories and footwear\" in SASB's materiality map. This shows that no environmental improvements are considered to have positive effects on profits for companies in this industry, as studies of financial materiality in the textile industry do not find that investments in the environment have yielded financial returns. Hence, the environmental footprints of NIKE's footwear or Zara's apparel are not judged as financially material when applying SASB's materiality map, even though one might expect such environmental improvements to have beneficial outcomes with regard to the companies' brands and reputations. They will, however, likely be considered socially and environmentally material in a GRI-based materiality assessment.\nr17u | This challenge of discernment has important implications for numerous questions:\n3c47 | Question one. Which sustainability efforts should companies prioritize and which key performance indicators should they monitor that reflect relevant improvement?\ng345 | Question two. Should the reporting company only emphasize financially material sustainability issues, or also those that are environmentally and socially material?\nsvhz | Question three. If both types are reported, how should the report communicate in which sense and by what definition, any given sustainability issue is material?\noaen | Question four. How would the sorting between the two materiality categories vary by reporting horizon?\n5u67 | Empirical study: method and results\ndvms | To shed light on our proposition that there are tensions and potential conflation between different approaches to materiality, we conducted a mixed-method empirical study of various stakeholders in Norwegian financial markets. Through a combination of a brief survey on sustainability reporting, materiality and information quality and follow-up interviews with a selected set of the survey respondents, we aimed to provide insight into the beliefs and assessments of these users of information.\nqrd3 | Method\nrxrg | We conducted a two-part empirical study - the survey and semi-structured interviews - on a sample of financial market professionals who were enrolled in an Executive Master of Business Administration program in sustainable financial analytics in Norway, offered by the Norwegian School of Economics and the Norwegian Society of Financial Analysts in cooperation. The respondents are experienced professionals working in different roles related to financial markets. The sample is dominated by financial analysts and portfolio managers from large institutional investors, but also includes financial market regulators, managers in finance positions in corporations, professionals from banking and insurance, auditors and financial journalists.\ntf43 | We wanted to capture respondents' perceptions of central concepts related to materiality as it relates to sustainability reports. We developed seventeen items in four broad categories related to sustainability reporting as follows:\nfcco | the information needs of users;\n8uji | approaches to materiality in sustainability reports;\ndf3e | information availability in sustainability reports; and\n53eu | information quality in sustainability reports.\na5u1 | Regarding information needs, we developed items to capture three informational needs: those that relate to financial materiality and the two information dimensions of Adams' definition of materiality outlined above. Regarding approaches to materiality, we developed items to capture respondents' views on disclosure requirements with regard to double and dynamic materiality. Regarding information availability, we developed items to capture respondents' assessment of how available the information in sustainability reports is and the degree to which they were able to discern between information related to different approaches to materiality. Regarding information quality, we developed items to capture respondents' assessment of sustainability disclosures, in light of traditional quality of information concepts. In addition, we collected data on respondents' socio-demographic characteristics.\nry7u | All items are shown in Table one and were measured on Likert scales where one indicated \"strongly disagree\" and seven indicated \"strongly agree.\" We distributed the survey through the online platform Qualtrics and collected all responses in March twenty twenty-one. We conducted all statistical analyses in IBM S P S S Statistics twenty-seven. The analyses were largely descriptive statistics of the respondents' views on the different themes of the survey.\n5mda | We conducted follow-up interviews with six of the respondents from the survey in April twenty twenty-one. As demonstrated by Guest et al., twenty twenty, six to seven interviews provide reasonable information saturation within a relatively homogeneous sample, which is the case in this study. Still, we recruited participants in a manner that was intended to capture the relative diversity of stakeholders represented in the sample as follows:\ni4li | one financial officer who is also in charge of the company's sustainability reporting (male, fifty-two);\nr8sm | one sustainability manager in a large bank (male, forty-six);\ncuin | one manager in a public funding body for innovation (female, forty-one);\nn1i7 | one compliance officer in a financial institution (female, thirty-seven);\n0r5m | one financial analyst (male, thirty-five); and\nne2o | one portfolio manager (male, fifty-three).\nsqxn | We conducted the interviews in Zoom owing to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The interviews lasted from thirty to forty-five minutes and were based on the interview guide in Table two. However, the interviews were semi-structured to allow respondents to address related issues that they deemed important in light of the questions we asked. We conducted the interviews in the respondents' native Norwegian language, but we have translated all quotes below. Initially, we used the findings from the survey responses as guidance for patterns to investigate further in the analysis of the qualitative interviews. Statements that either supported or contrasted with findings from the survey analyses in interesting ways were selected for inclusion in the account of our qualitative findings in the results section. In this way, we aimed to triangulate between the qualitative and quantitative investigations of the respondents' views and perceptions.\n6pmo | Results from the survey\n195r | The survey had thirty respondents, of which eighty percent were male, equivalent to in the whole class of students. The average age was forty-eight point five years and the average work tenure twenty-two years. The respondents mainly worked in banking, thirty percent, institutional investment firms, twenty-three point three percent, regulatory units or other public sector entities, six point seven percent, as well as other corporate roles such as consultancy firms, insurance firms or financial positions in\nkqmi | Sustainability reporting and materiality\ng8rd | sustainability impacts. Respondents to a somewhat lesser degree desired information about sustainability issues that were deemed important by the general public, NGOs and so on\nnns9 | Regarding materiality, Table three shows the respondents' beliefs about materiality and the relationship between material sustainability issues and financial performance. We note that the respondents believe quite strongly that dynamic materiality should be taken into account in reporting and that they do not believe that sustainability reporting should be limited to financially material sustainability issues alone. They also believe that properly addressing material sustainability issues is crucial for companies' financial performance.\n9uwy | Regarding information availability, the respondents strongly disagreed that it was easy to identify financially material sustainability issues in sustainability reports and also disagreed that it was easy to distinguish sustainability issues that are financially material from those that are material in other ways, e.g. based on a GRI understanding. Overall, the respondents seem skeptical to the information availability in such reports and express a high appetite for reporting in accordance with recognized standards\nsrly | Finally, with regard to information quality, the respondents gave a mixed assessment.
