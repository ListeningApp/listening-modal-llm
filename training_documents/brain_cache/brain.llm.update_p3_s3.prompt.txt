You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).

y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

ccmb | 2.3. Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire
ma93 | The Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ; Baer et al., 2006) is a 39-item scale to measure five factors of mindfulness: Observing (attending to or noticing internal and external stimuli, such as sensations, emotions, cognitions, sights, sounds, and smells), describ- ing (noting or mentally labeling these stimuli with words), acting with awareness (attending to one's current actions, as opposed to behaving automatically or absent-mindedly), non-judging of inner experience (refraining from evaluation of one's sensations, cognitions, and emotions) and non-reactivity to inner experience (allowing thoughts and feeling to come and go, without attention getting caught up in them). Responses to the items are given on a 5-point Likert-type scale <LATEX>\left( 1 = \mathrm { n e v e r } \right.</LATEX> or very rarely true, <LATEX>5 = \mathrm { v e r y }</LATEX> often or always true). The five subscales have shown adequate to good internal consistency (Baer et al., 2006). Usable data from both time-points were obtained from 14 MBSR and 14 control participants.
c6hh | 2.4. MRI data collection and analysis
y7ea | All participants were scanned at the Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging in Charlestown, MA. MBSR participants were scanned during the 2 weeks before (Pre) and after (Post) participation in the program. Control participants were also scanned twice, approximately 2 months apart. There was an average time of 56.25 days (S.D .: 4.5 days) in between scanning sessions for the MBSR group and 65.67 days (S.D .: 11.22 days) for the control group. High-resolution MRI data were acquired with a Siemens Magnetom Avanto 1.5 T scanner with standard head coil. Data sets of the whole brain were collected using a T1 weighted MPRAGE-sequence, consisting of 128 sagittal slices <LATEX>\left( 1 . 0 \times 1 . 0 \times 1 . 3 m m \right. ,</LATEX> <LATEX>\mathrm { T I } = 1 0 0 0 \mathrm { m s }</LATEX> <LATEX>T E = 3 . 3 9 \quad m s ;</LATEX> <LATEX>\left. T R = 2 7 3 0 \quad m s \right) .</LATEX> Image analysis was performed with voxel-based morphometry (VBM) tools within the Statistical Para- metric Mapping (SPM5) neuroimaging statistical software (Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, London, www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/ spm/software/spm5/) based in MATLAB 7.1, release 14 (Mathworks Inc., Natick, MA, USA), using default settings unless otherwise specified. VBM permits an automated voxel-wise whole brain statistical comparison of MRI scan (Ashburner and Friston, 2000). Images were manually aligned to the anterior commissure and then segmented into gray and white matter in native space (i.e., before normalization, using the 'Native Space' segmentation option imple- mented in SPM5). For each individual, the (unmodulated) gray matter segmentations of the Pre and Post images were spatially registered. Normalization parameters were calculated for the <LATEX>P r e</LATEX> scan and were applied to both time-points (trilinear interpolation, <LATEX>\left. 2 \times 2 \times 2 m m \right) ,</LATEX> to make sure that regional differences between the images were not removed by scan-specific spatial normalization (Driemeyer et al., 2008; Ilg et al., 2008). Images were smoothed using an 8-mm full width at half maximum Isotropic Gaussian Kernel.
nav4 | We computed exploratory whole brain analyses as well as region of interest (ROI) analyses. The ROI contained the bilateral hippocampi and bilateral insulae and was created using the WFU Pickatlas software (Maldjian et al., 2003) and based on the parcellation of Tzourio-Mazoyer et al. (2002). A paired t-test within the MBSR group was first performed in SPM5, in order to identify those brain regions with significantly increased gray matter concentration following participation in the MBSR program. Since our ROI analysis was spatially focused, we chose to correct for multiple comparisons within the ROI (bilateral hippocampi and insulae) using the voxel- wise method implemented in SPM5. Given the very large number of voxels in the whole brain analysis, a voxel-wise method for
gem8 | preventing false positives seemed too conservative and leads to a substantial loss of statistical power (Forman et al., 1995; Friston et al., 1996). We therefore chose to use a cluster-wise method for the exploratory whole brain analysis and corrected for multiple compar- isons across the entire brain using the method implemented in SPM5 (Friston et al., 1994). In order to exceed the threshold of <LATEX>P < 0 . 0 5 ,</LATEX> clusters had to exceed a size of 250 voxels. Statistical parametric maps were initially thresholded with <LATEX>P = 0 . 0 1 ,</LATEX> uncorrected. P- <LATEX>\mathrm { v a l u e s } < 0 . 0 5 ,</LATEX> corrected for multiple comparisons, were considered significant for both the exploratory whole brain analysis as well as the ROI analysis.
e8nr | Following the paired <LATEX>t</LATEX> t-test within the MBSR group, follow-up tests were then conducted within the identified regions to test for significance compared with the control group. Values from the identified clusters were extracted for each person and each time- point using the Marsbar toolbox (Brett et al., 2002). A repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was then performed for each cluster in the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS), with group (MBSR and control group) as the between-subjects factor and time-point (Pre and Post) as the within-subjects factor. Since groups were not identical in age and gender, these variables were controlled by entering them as nuisance variables.

g9du | 3.1. Amount of mindfulness practice
f682 | MBSR participants reported spending an average of 22.6 h (S.D .: 6.3 h) engaged in formal homework exercises over the 8-week course (average =27 min per day). In detail, the amount of body scan practice ranged between 335 and 1002 min (mean: 699 min, S.D .: 217 min), yoga between 103 and 775 min (mean: 327 min, S.D .: 194 min), and sitting meditation between 0 and 755 min (mean: 332 min, S.D .: 211 min). The three measures were not significantly correlated with each other: body scan and yoga: <LATEX>r = - \quad 0 . 0 4 2 ,</LATEX> <LATEX>P = 0 . 8 7 ;</LATEX> body scan and sitting: <LATEX>r = - \quad 0 . 2 6 ,</LATEX> <LATEX>P = 0 . 3 3 ;</LATEX> yoga and sitting:
