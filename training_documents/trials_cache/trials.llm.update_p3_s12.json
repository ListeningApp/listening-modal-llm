These observed effects could be larger but could also be smaller than the true effects. The trials need to give a good chance of providing evidence for a treatment difference even if the observed effects are smaller than the true effects. The chances of this can be improved by increasing the numbers in our trial.\nme84 | For example, the investigators in the UK PACE trial wanted to be ninety percent sure of picking up a statistically significant result if a true difference of twenty-four percent versus eighteen percent existed.\no56m | Three point three\nslz6 | In total, the UK PACE trial needed to recruit approximately two thousand patients to satisfy the above criteria as will be seen in later sections.\n90k5 | Four Type I and type II errors\n9m8s | Note the true population values in each treatment group are not known but in calculating the sample size some estimate of these values are needed based on the alternative hypothesis. In the following sections the observed and anticipated percentages will be distinguished using the following notation:\n893y | p one equals the observed percentage in those on standard treatment observed percentage in those on 'new' treatment\nfavz | i.e. observed treatment effect (observed absolute percentage reduction on 'new' treatment)\n7szx | percentage in those on standard treatment anticipated percentage in those on 'new' treatment\nhx9e | i.e. true difference which has been decided it is important to detect\nywn2 | Further notations are as follows:\na63r | alpha equals significance level for detecting a difference (usually set at 0.05 or five percent)\ndqvj | one minus beta equals degree of certainty that a true difference would be detected i.e. the power (often aim for ninety percent power)\nr17u | Consider the table below. Ideally, the results of the trial should fall either:\n3c47 | (i) in the top left-hand cell of the table, i.e. if, in truth, no difference exists (the null hypothesis), then no evidence for a difference is observed in the trial, or\ng345 | (ii) in the bottom right-hand cell of the table, i.e. if, in truth, a difference does exist (the alternative hypothesis), then evidence for a difference is observed in the trial.\nsvhz | These are marked by X in the table.\noaen | Table two: Observed trial results compared to the 'truth' of (i) no difference\n5u67 | (ii) a true difference\ndvms | X Three point four\nqrd3 | However, there are two particular types of errors that can be made in interpreting trial results. These are referred to as type I and type II errors.\nrxrg | Â· Type I error. A type I error is when a treatment difference is claimed based on a statistically significant observed result when in truth no such difference exists i.e. a false positive result.\ntf43 | . Type II error. A type II error is when in truth there exists a difference of T one - seventy-two but the observed results fail to reach statistical significance, i.e. a false negative result.\nfcco | Alternative ways of describing alpha and beta are as follows and represented in the table below:\n8uji | (ii) the alternative hypothesis being true\ndf3e | It needs to be decided in advance what levels will be set for alpha and one minus beta and in the following sections the influences of the choice of these on the required sample size will be demonstrated.\n53eu | Five Comparing two percentages (or proportions) - power calculation\na5u1 | Five point one Sample size formula using five percent significance and ninety percent power\nry7u | Up to now the key factors needed in calculating a sample size have been considered and the concept of power in this process has been introduced.\n5mda | In the UK PACE example the intended power was set at ninety percent. This means that if the true underlying percentages are twenty-four percent and eighteen percent, there is a ten percent probability that the observed results will give p greater than 0.05. This will occur if the observed difference is less than the true difference to the extent that it is more compatible with the null hypothesis of no difference. Some risk of a false negative result has to be accepted (otherwise an infinitely large study is needed).\ni4li | Note that some risk of a false positive result also has to be accepted: it is quite possible that p less than 0.05 might be observed even if there is no true treatment difference.\nr8sm | Three point five\ncuin | Common choices for alpha (significance level) and one minus beta (power) are 0.05 and 0.90 respectively as already stated. Based on these choices, the equation to calculate the required sample size in each group for the comparison of two proportions is given below:\nn1i7 | There are two key notes that you need to be aware of given below.\n0r5m | Note one: The above equation calculates the required number of patients required in each group. Therefore for a trial with two treatments (with equal numbers planned for each group), the required number of patients in total is double this amount.\nne2o | Note two: Up to this point the outcomes have been considered as percentages. If proportions are preferred in the calculation of the sample size then the above equation must be adapted by substituting 'one' in place of 'one hundred' throughout.\nsqxn | By using the sample size formula above, the total sample size required for the UK PACE trial is one thousand nine hundred twenty-six (nine hundred sixty-three in each group). In practice the UK PACE trial aimed to recruit two thousand patients.\n6pmo | Note that the aim of a sample size calculation is to approximate the number of patients required rather than provide exact figures. There are several assumptions that need to be made including the anticipated true values which of course cannot be known.\n195r | Five point two More general formula for any combination of significance and power\nkqmi | The formula given for the comparison for two proportions is based on a type I error of alpha equals 0.05 (equating to a significance level of five percent) and a type II error of beta equals 0.1 (equating to ninety percent power). However, a more general formula for different values of alpha and beta is needed.\ng8rd | A more general formula is as follows:\nnns9 | where the function of alpha and beta is a function of alpha and beta. The table below provides the value of the function of alpha and beta for different values of alpha and beta.\n9uwy | Three point six\n```",
