If the client sees a cheaper version of the \"same thing,\" then the value discrepancy will cause them to swap providers. This is a dilemma . . . lose this client, the rest of your clients, and potential clients, or stay \"competitive.\" Your margins become so thin they vanish.\nfy1j | Furthermore, it's hard to get prospects to say yes (and keep them saying yes) unless you're hypervigilant about clients commoditizing your business by staying \"competitive.\" And that's the problem with the old commoditized way. They're able to compare. Unless you switch to a Grand Slam Offer, your prices will keep getting beaten down. The business eventually dies, or the entrepreneur throws in the towel. No bueno.\nfujm | We want to make an offer that's so different that you can skip the awkward explanation of why your product is different from everyone else's (which, if they have to ask, then they are probably too ignorant to understand the explanation) and instead just have the offer do that work for you. That's the Grand Slam Offer way.\nqq4d | Let's dive in to see the contrast in sales numbers.\nma98 | New Grand Slam Offer Way (Differentiated, Incomparable) (Value-Driven)\nrboa | Grand Slam Offer: Pay one time. (No recurring fee. No retainer.) Just cover ad spend. I'll generate leads and work your leads for you. And only pay me if people show up. And I'll guarantee you get twenty people in your first month, or you get your next month free. I'll also provide all the best practices from the other businesses like yours.\nbdkb | 路 Daily sales coaching for your staff\nl47b | 路 Tested scripts\nzio7 | 路 Tested price points and offers to swipe and deploy\nmty2 | 路 Sales recordings\ntbjy | . . . and everything else you need to sell and fulfill your customers. I'll give you the entire play book for (insert industry), absolutely free just for becoming a client.\nmszq | In a nutshell, I'm feeding people into your business, showing you, exactly, how to sell them so that you can get the highest prices, which means that you make the most money possible . . . sound fair enough?\ni0p0 | It's clear these are drastically different offers . . . but so what? Where's the money !? Let's compare both in the below chart.\nok43 | Metric\nqnqv | Get paid to get customers.\niwpq | Breakdown: You spend the same amount of money for the same eyeballs. Then, you get two point five times more people to respond to your advertisement because it's a more compelling offer. From there, you close two point five times as many people because the offer is so much more compelling. From there, you are able to charge a four times higher price up front. The end result is two point five times two point five times four equals twenty-two point four times more cash collected up front. Yes, you spent ten thousand dollars to make one hundred twelve thousand dollars. You just made money getting new customers.\noial | Comparison: Remember the old way, the way you lost half the ad spend up front? With the new way, you are making more money and getting more customers. This means that your cost to acquire a customer is so cheap (relative to how much you make) that your limiting factor becomes your ability to do the work you already love doing. Cash flow and acquiring customers is no longer your bottleneck because it's twenty-two point four times more profitable than the old model. Yup. You read that right. This is the part in the action movie where you walk away from an explosion in slow motion.\n8xfx | This is the exact Grand Slam Offer we used with our software business that serves agencies. The numbers can become wild . . . fast. I know twenty-two point four times better sounds unreasonable, but that's the point. If you play the same game everyone else does, you'll get the same results everyone else does (mediocre). You hit singles and doubles, keep the lights on, but never get ahead. But remember the opening passage of this book: that when you align all the pieces, you can knock it out of the park so well that you win for good. In my first eighteen months in business, we went from five hundred thousand dollars per year to twenty-eight million dollars per year off of less than one million dollars in ad spend. So, when I say twenty to one . . . fifty to one . . . one hundred to one returns, I mean it. When you get this right, the results are, well . . . unbelievable.\npgp5 | Summary Points\n8rz1 | This chapter illustrated the basic problem with commoditization and how Grand Slam Offers solve that. This gets you out of the pricing war and into a category of one. The next chapter will focus on finding the correct market to apply our pricing strategies to. It's one of the most important things to get right. A grand slam offer given to the wrong audience will fall on deaf\nxhb4 | ears. We want to avoid that at all costs. We must detour from pricing for a moment to learn what to look for in a market. It's an essential box to check before continuing on our journey.\nkext | FREE GIFT number one BONUS TUTORIAL: \"START HERE\"\ntshv | If you want a deeper dive, go to Acquisition.com/training/offers and watch the first video in the free course (starring yours truly) about how I differentiate offers in businesses I consult with and get them to charging premium prices.

Quality! .... Low prices! .... Best taste!\"\nybu5 | The students kept going until eventually they had run out of answers. They looked at each other waiting for the professor to speak. The room finally fell quiet.\nwxhx | The professor smiled and replied, \"A starving crowd.\"\n```",
