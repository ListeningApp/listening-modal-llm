Having a therapeutic style that feels consistent with one's day-to-day personality is referred to as an integrated use of self.\n31wg | Assessing Mode Use\ncelk | To date, nine assessments of mode use based on the IRM have been developed. One of these assessments is featured in this chapter: The Self-Assessment of Modes, Version Three. The Self-Assessment of Modes, Version Three, consists of nine different clinical scenarios, each portraying a client or caregiver facing a dilemma. Four possible therapeutic responses (i.e., modes) are presented beneath each clinical scenario. Respondents are required to rank-order the responses from one to four based upon the degree to which they agree with the given response.\n3mf9 | Exercises for Learning and Reflection\nz2rd | One. Please complete Exercises Four point one to Four point three. Reflect upon your responses.\nvqld | Two. Provide a description of each of the six modes.\nljmz | Three. Why is it important to clearly differentiate between each of the six modes when communicating with a client?\nen1l | Four. Define the three types of suboptimal mode use. Why is it important to differentiate mode use and suboptimal mode use?\n45gx | Exercise Four point one\nxgur | Self-Assessment of Modes Questionnaire, Version Three\niz66 | This assessment is designed to allow you to identify whether you have a dominant way or central set of ways of responding to various interpersonal events that arise in therapy. Please do not think too hard about the responses and respond as if you were facing the situations described in real-time practice. All responses represent plausible therapeutic actions, and there are no incorrect responses.\ndndq | For every scenario, please rank-order each of the four response options according to the extent to which you would view the option as being consistent with your predominant (i.e., usual) way of interacting. Please rank the general idea or feeling you have about the response, even if the way that the example is worded is not identical to what you would actually say. Your numeric rankings should adhere to the following scale:\nxzce | One equals highly consistent with how I would usually respond.\nw4vd | Two equals very consistent with how I would usually respond.\ncuh0 | Three equals moderately consistent with how I would usually respond.\nk36t | SUMMARY\nz1wx | The \"cautions\" section under each of the interpersonal modes reveals one of the hidden secrets of therapeutic use of selfâ€”that no therapist is perfect. There is no way to escape the caveats and downsides that go along with any therapeutic mode or set of modes. Additionally, no one is immune from communicating the modes suboptimally from time to time. One key to the intentional use of self is to familiarize oneself with the caveats to each of the modes that are part of one's therapeutic style. The more you develop an ability to draw on as many modes as necessary and appropriate for a given client, the more likely you are to avoid overutilizing one style at the expense of using a more appropriate or more indicated style for that client.\no6gf | Please note that you may only assign a number once; please do not assign the same number to more than one response option. It is recognized that your actual response may depend on information that is not available in the case description. The point of this questionnaire is not to ascertain a correct response but to ascertain the one that is most representative of your interpersonal style. Please do not dwell on the options for too long. Instead, choose the response that would be the easiest, most natural, or most typical for you in each situation.\n0hs6 | Please see the following example, where, in this case, option \"d\" is the response most consistent with the respondent's usual way of interacting:\nm05x | A marathon runner is looking for a relief station to rehydrate but cannot find one. The runner is trying to decide whether to continue running or to rest in order to avoid a state of complete exhaustion. Walking alongside the runner, you are able to have a conversation. Please rank-order the following possible responses.\nds29 | a. Three. Assume a clear leadership role by providing the runner with information, structure, guidance, or constructive feedback (e.g., educate the runner on the potential consequences of continuing to run without hydration).\nqcmr | b. Two. Ask questions or engage in a discussion that leads the runner to think about alternative ways of approaching the situation (e.g., assist the runner in weighing the pros and cons of continuing to run without hydration).\n7c6p | c. Four. Give the runner total and complete control over the situation (e.g., ask the runner what he or she feels is the best thing to do in this moment).\nd1ee | d. One. Normalize the runner's experience or connect the runner with social or physical resources that will enable him or her to have an equal chance of finishing (e.g., let the runner know that dehydration is common among marathoners; if desired, gather information for the runner about the location of the next relief station).\nitx4 | One. You are working with a ninety-two-year-old retired steelworker who has always performed his own handiwork around the house. He is receiving postsurgical therapy for a shoulder injury that he endured after a fall from a stepstool while changing a light bulb in his home. When the client is not in the room, his family members tell you that this is not the first accident that he has had doing handiwork. They add that, recently, he has become more accident-prone while completing tasks that should be done by hired workers. The client's family is concerned about his safety. They feel that he does not listen to them when they ask him to call a hired worker instead of performing household duties on his own. The family reports that the client is otherwise safe when not engaging in household tasks. Please rank-order each response to the family according to the following scale:\nvwrs | One equals highly consistent with how I would usually respond.\nxjkw | Two equals very consistent with how I would usually respond.\nwght | Three equals moderately consistent with how I would usually respond.\n3lgb | Four equals slightly or not at all consistent with how I would usually respond.\nttwt | a. Assume a clear leadership role by providing the family with information, structure, guidance, or constructive feedback (e.g., provide the family with information on the type of safety recommendations that you will discuss with the client and reassure them that these recommendations will be included in the client's next session).\nx5l2 | b. Give the family total and complete control over the situation (e.g., ask the family what they think they will need from you to better ensure the client's safety at home).\nilrs | c. Witness, listen to, and show full acceptance of the client's thoughts, feelings, or behavior (e.g., summarize what you have just learned and make a statement that validates their concerns about the client's safety).\n0a03 | d. Ask questions or engage in a discussion that leads the family to think about alternative ways of approaching the situation (e.g., assist the family in weighing the pros and cons of a range of ways that a convincing message about safety might be best communicated to the client).\n```",
