You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

kpvt | Ecological novelty is a characteristic feature of species redistribution in the Anthropocene (Saul and Jeschke 2015). Different facets of ecological novelty can be conceptual- ized, and we argue that these are associated in different ways with range-expanding and alien species (table 1). Specifically, ecological novelty can be inversely measured as ecoevolutionary experience of interacting resident and non- resident species (sensu Saul and Jeschke 2015): Organisms with novel weapons (sensu Callaway and Ridenour 2004) or other novel traits the resident species are not familiar with (i.e., they have a low ecoevolutionary experience) are expected to have stronger impacts than organisms that are similar to resident species (i.e., high ecoevolutionary experi- ence). We would expect that resident species typically have a higher ecoevolutionary experience when interacting with range-expanding species responding to human-induced environmental change than with alien species coming from

d0ik | further away. This is because alien species are frequently more distinct in their morphology, behavior, or other traits and characteristics. Extreme examples are alien mammalian predators introduced to New Zealand (and other oceanic islands) that had a devastating impact on resident flightless birds. Because of the previous absence of such predators on New Zealand, kiwi and other ground nesting bird species became easy prey for cats and mustelids (Blackwell 2005). However, because of evolutionary convergence, aliens some- times have a lower degree of novelty than range-expanding species. For example, range-expanding plants that track climate change and are expanding into biomes with cooler climates can have profound impacts on nutrient cycling and ecosystem functioning when they introduce novel growth forms (e.g., shrubification of tundra ecosystems, laurophyl- lisation of temperate forests; Sturm et al. 2001, Walther et al. 2007, Alexander et al. 2018). Similarly, pathogens that spread into new regions because of climate change can have severe impacts on their (new) hosts (Harvell et al. 2002). Future studies are therefore needed to test our prediction that range-expanding species typically have a lower degree of novelty than alien species (e.g., following the procedure proposed by Saul et al. 2013). These will also provide impor- tant insights for biodiversity management.
0x0s | Proposing a term for range-expanding species responding to human-induced environmental change
4exe | We note that given the overabundance of terminology in ecology and biogeography, introducing a new term for range-expanding species that respond to anthropogenic environmental change has the potential to exacerbate this unfortunate situation further. However, given the impor- tance of this phenomenon and the absence of a specific term for such species, we believe that suggesting a new term is useful and appropriate. Therefore, we propose that the term neonative be applied for range-expanding taxa responding to anthropogenic environmental change (figure 2). We have chosen this term because it succinctly captures the biogeo- graphic status of such taxa-that is, to be present in a region only relatively recently.
0myz | Specifically, we propose the following definition for neonatives (see also figure 2, table 2): Neonatives are those taxa that have expanded geographically beyond their native range and that now have established populations whose presence is due to human-induced changes of the biophysi- cal environment, but not as a result of direct movement by human agency, intentional or unintentional, or to the cre- ation of dispersal corridors such as canals, roads, pipelines, or tunnels.
xh3i | We propose that such taxa should be considered native in the new range, but that there are sound reasons to dis- criminate them from native species occurring within their historic range and from range-expanding native species that do so apparently without responding to human-induced environmental change. Therefore, taxa may be native, neo- native, or alien in different parts of their current range

lvae | and may even have become extinct in other parts of their former range (e.g., because environmental conditions have become unsuitable there, and their range has subsequently contracted).
o9sc | The word neonative has previously sometimes been used in other contexts. For instance, it has been used in anthropol- ogy with regard to colonizing human populations, especially in North America (e.g., Rudy and Farmer 2010). In forestry, the term has been used for discussing the establishment of neonative forest species, including the use of native and alien tree species and nonlocal tree provenances to better adapt forests to future climate conditions (e.g., Millar et al. 2007). We are aware that suggesting a term that has been previously

zh03 | used in related contexts is not ideal, but because previous usage of neonative was rare, this should not be a major issue.
1mvw | Considerations for managing species ranges in the Anthropocene
6d4s | Although there is broad agreement that alien species in some cases cause substantial impacts on the environment and human well-being (Vilà et al. 2011, Blackburn et al. 2014, Bacher et al. 2018) that warrants management, much less attention is given to the possible impacts of neonative species as defined above. However, there is accumulating evidence that impacts by neonatives can be substantial and even functionally similar to the impacts caused by alien
mqah | Forum
xxr8 | species (Nackley et al. 2017), and that the level of differ- ences to the traits represented in the recipient communities play an important role (Engelkes et al. 2008). For instance, neonatives often encounter closely related species in the newly colonized region, which may make hybridization and genetic introgression a more frequent phenomenon than when alien species invade a new region (Le Roux and Wieczorek 2009, Klonner et al. 2017). Predators and herbi- vores may switch to closely related prey or plant species as a food resource (Soininen et al. 2007, Pateman et al. 2012). Furthermore, the arrival of neonatives will occur with dif- ferential rates of spread, with generalist species likely to spread more rapidly (e.g., Chen et al. 2011, Alexander et al. 2018). Such asynchronous spread may cause boom-and-bust phenomena (Strayer et al. 2017) and an overdominance of generalist species capable of rapidly tracking changing envi- ronmental conditions.
rl4j | Aliens do, but neonatives do not depend on humans as the initial dispersal vector into a new region (although second- ary spread of alien species can also be unaided by humans). Consequently, although we can aim to control alien propa- gule and colonization pressure, there is no easy way to control the arrival and spread of neonatives; management practices can only be post hoc-and they include other risks, because restricting species migration might actually lead to the extinction of the species if the original range becomes unsuitable. The management of neonatives therefore poses
vz32 | challenges that are quite different from the management of aliens (table 1). In fact, the challenge is to manage spe- cies turnover, the enrichment or replacement of natives by neonatives such that negative impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem services are minimized or even turned into benefits. There is a critical need to understand how species turnover affects biodiversity and ecosystem services (Hobbs et al. 2013).
