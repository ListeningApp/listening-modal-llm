Equation seven further simplifies if we assume the Moon and the Earth rotating around the Earth-Moon barycenter in circular orbits; that is, we consider the CR three BP. In this case R underscore EM tilde equals one, A underscore MI tilde equals one, and A underscore MI tilde prime equals zero, and equations seven simplify as follows:\nnmn2 | Open parenthesis X underscore I tilde double prime equals two Y underscore I tilde prime minus X underscore I tilde minus mu fraction X underscore I tilde over R underscore MI tilde cubed minus open parenthesis one minus mu close parenthesis open parenthesis fraction X underscore I tilde minus one over R underscore EI tilde cubed plus one close parenthesis close parenthesis.\ng3tm | Z underscore I tilde double prime equals negative mu fraction Z underscore I tilde over R underscore MI tilde cubed minus open parenthesis one minus mu close parenthesis fraction Z underscore I tilde over R underscore EI tilde cubed.\ntfra | R underscore EI tilde equals the square root of open parenthesis X underscore I tilde minus one close parenthesis squared plus Y underscore I tilde squared plus Z underscore I tilde squared, comma space R underscore MI tilde equals the square root of X underscore I tilde squared plus Y underscore I tilde squared plus Z underscore I tilde squared. For the sake of simplicity, in the following sections the overlying tilde will be dropped, and derivation with respect to the normalized time will be denoted with the Newton notation. Thus, all variables and parameters must be considered normalized.\n5lm9 | Three. Relative Motion Equations in the Restricted Three-Body Problem\nwp2c | A. Exact Relative Dynamics\nus5v | Consider a target and a chaser spacecraft orbiting around the Moon and subject to both Earth and Moon gravitational influences. Their equations of motions with respect to the Moon are given by Eq. three:\nrs2m | Open bracket double dot R close bracket underscore I equals negative mu fraction R over R cubed minus open parenthesis one minus mu close parenthesis open parenthesis fraction R plus R underscore EM over norm R plus R underscore EM cubed minus fraction R underscore EM over R underscore EM cubed close parenthesis close parenthesis.\nuz9y | Open bracket double dot R underscore C close bracket underscore I equals negative mu fraction R underscore C over R underscore C cubed minus open parenthesis one minus mu close parenthesis open parenthesis fraction R underscore C plus R underscore EM over norm R underscore C plus R underscore EM cubed minus fraction R underscore EM over R underscore EM cubed close parenthesis close parenthesis.\n8ov0 | where R and R underscore C denote target and chaser position with respect to the Moon.\nmj9m | The aim of this section is to describe the motion of the chaser relative to the target in the LVLH frame L colon open brace R semicolon T hat, J hat, K hat close brace centered on the target center of mass. The unit vectors of L are defined as follows:\n94h3 | where H equals RX open bracket I close bracket M is the target-specific angular momentum with respect to the Moon, and H equals vertical bar H vertical bar vertical bar. The unit vectors I hat, J hat, and K hat in the rendezvous literature are generally referred to as V-bar, H-bar, and R-bar, respectively. Note that the LVLH frame is defined with respect to the Moon, because the target is supposed to fly on lunar orbits, and vehicles incoming from the Moon surface or lower and higher orbits are expected to approach the target.\n9jx1 | With reference to Figure two, the chaser position with respect to the Moon is given by:\nc3lz | Eleven\n8bwk | R underscore E equals R plus P\nez9s | where P is the relative position of the chaser with respect to the target. The time derivative of Eq. eleven in the inertial frame is:\nmqot | Twelve\noc99 | where omega underscore YI is the angular velocity of L, that is, of the target, with respect to I. Further derivation of Eq. twelve in I yields:\ngipz | Thirteen",
