We start with the partition function. The energy of a free particle of mass m is p. p over two m, so the partition function is the integral of exp(-p . p over two m) over all possible positions and momenta. Integrate over momentum and you get\nou3n | - e-B(p?+p3+p3)/2m dp1dp2dp3 h3 (ten - thirty over two m Ap) equals h two mm beta cubed\nd3bu | In terms of the thermal wavelength this is just one over A cubed. Integrate over position and you multiply this by the volume of the box, say V. So we get an incredibly simple final answer:\numpv | Z equals X- V\n1sha | And this sort of calculation works in any dimension: there's nothing special about the number three here.\nbw9p | PARTICLE IN A THREE-D BOX: ENTROPY\nwuha | In thermal equilibrium, a classical free particle of mass m in a three-dimensional box of volume V has expected energy\neei5 | (E) equals kT times two-thirds\ntzc8 | and free energy\nb6at | A cubed V\ntak4 | F equals negative kT ln\nkish | where A equals h over V two xmkT is the thermal wavelength. But entropy S is ((E) minus F) over T, so\n6i4k | S equals k ln (MAS plus three)\nwenx | The entropy of a particle in thermal equilibrium in a three-dimensional box works very much like our earlier calculation for a one-dimensional box, with a couple of adjustments due to the dimension. Since the particle's energy is now a quadratic function of three variables, the equipartition theorem now says its expected energy is\ndzhw | 〈 E〉 equals kT.\ng50k | We can work out its free energy from its partition function, which we computed in the last tweet:\n260v | V\n3v9q | F equals- kT ln Z equals- k ln\nb3q6 | Thirteen.\nf7n0 | Thus its entropy is\nqb6z | S equals (E) minus F over T\nwt9j | The meaning of the two terms here is very similar to that for the particle in the one-dimensional box. The first term is k times the logarithm of the number of accessible states, as always for the Gibbs entropy of a system in thermal equilibrium. Here the number of accessible states is V over A cubed. The second term is two k thanks to the equipartition theorem, since the particle's expected energy depends quadratically on three degrees of freedom. When V is much greater than A cubed this second term is a small correction to the first. As this ceases to be true, the second term becomes more important-and when A cubed is comparable to V, quantum corrections to our calculation also become significant.\nl4y1 | A TALE OF TWO GASES\nrdhl | The entropy of an ideal gas of N distinguishable classical particles of mass m in a box of volume V is\nlgqb | Sa equals kN (ln V plus ln kT plus ln kI plus ln Im plus two mm\nm5n9 | two\n94av | while for indistinguishable particles it's\nzfsc | Si approximately equals KN ln plus ln kT plus ln m plus\ntd4d | two\n8etc | two\nj4fi | where the corrections are small compared to N as N greater than zero.\n73ie | Now we are finally ready to tackle the entropy of a gas. We start with a 'monatomic ideal gas', which means N free point particles bouncing around in a box. But there's a subtlety! We'll get different answers depending on whether we think of these particles as distinguishable or indistinguishable. That is: do we count the state of the gas as different if we switch two particles, or not?\n7ml0 | The formulas look very similar. There are three differences:\nr2i6 | · For distinguishable particles we'll get an exact formula, while for indistinguishable particles we'll get an approximate one, where the corrections are small compared to N when N becomes large.\nsgha | · The entropy for distinguishable particles has a term equal to two kN, while for indistinguishable particles it has a term equal to two kN.\ny3c5 | · Most importantly, there's a huge difference in the volume dependence! Where the distinguishable particles have a term in the entropy equal to kN ln V, the indistinguishable ones have a term equal to kN ln, so their entropy is considerably smaller for large volumes.\n10g0 | The last difference makes the entropy behave strangely for distinguishable particles, so in practice the physically important case is the gas of indistinguishable particles. But we'll do the calculations in both cases, because the distinguishable case is easier, and interesting.\nnl64 | GAS OF DISTINGUISHABLE PARTICLES: PARTITION FUNCTION\na6si | The partition function of an ideal gas of N distinguishable classical particles of mass m in a three-dimensional box B of volume V is\no25a | Za equals JBN J 1. IRON e -B i=1 N two m d3 p1 . . . d3PN d3 q1 . . . d3 qN\nu5gt | pi· pi h3N\nf50c | two pi m β three N over two\n8x23 | equals VN h3N\nnf5i | Thus Za equals three N A cubed N VN\n6f7n | where A equals h(8 over two pi m) to the power of one-half is the thermal wavelength.\nr0bb | Suppose we have a system of N distinguishable classical free particles in a three-dimensional box B of volume V. The state of this system is described by N positions q1, ... , qN E B and N momenta pi, ... , pN E R cube. If each particle has mass m, the energy of the ith particle is equal to\nucxa | Ei equals pi· pi over two m\ndpzv | and the energy of the system is\np3zg | E equals sum over i equals one to N of Ei. Let's call the partition function of this system Za. To compute this we integrate exp(-BE) over the space of states, obtaining\ndcq6 | Za equals LAN JARON BN JR cubed N exp(-ßE) d3 p1 . . . d3pNd3q1 . . . d3qN h3N.\n4onb | Above, I proceeded to compute Za directly by doing the Gaussian integral over momenta and integrating each position over the box. Here's a slightly different way. Because\nj6i2 | exp(-(E) equals exp(-ßE1) ... exp(-ßEN),\nsu8b | the partition function Za is a product of integrals which are all equal:\nap79 | BJR cubed e-Bp·p over two m d3pd3q h3 .\no2lj | Za equals\n9ksk | The integral in the parentheses is the partition function of a single particle in a box. We have already seen that this equals\n3rje | JB JR cubed e - Bp.p over two m ď3pd3q _V h3\n1ib3 | A cubed\nlokq | where A is the thermal wavelength. Thus we have\ni9g3 | Za equals\naprs | We can also do this calculation with a lot less work using Puzzle thirty-six. This implies that when we build a new system from N identical noninteracting copies of some old system, the partition function of the new system is the Nth power of the partition function of the old system. What I just did is show this in a special case.\nnna4 | GAS OF DISTINGUISHABLE PARTICLES: ENTROPY\n83b6 | In thermal equilibrium, an ideal gas of N distinguishable classical particles of mass m in a three-dimensional box of volume V has expected energy\nph9z | (Ed) equals kNT over three\nmuji | and free energy\nglmb | A cubed N VN\nsaqe | Fa equals negative kT ln\ne6o9 | where A equals h over V two TmkT is the thermal wavelength. Its entropy Sa is ((Ea) minus Fa) over T, so\nwgep | Sa equals kN ln N (ln N plus three)\n```",
