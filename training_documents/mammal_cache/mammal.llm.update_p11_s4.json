        "content": "u8nw | CpGs linked to life span in various taxonomic orders and tissues\nl2v9 | To pinpoint CpGs associated with logarithm maximum life span independently of phylogenetic order or tissue type, we conducted a meta-analysis of EWAS findings from twenty-five distinct strata comprising phylogenetic order and tissue type. Using a nonparametric meta-analysis approach rank P value, we assessed the EWAS of life span meta lifespan in these strata to identify CpGs unconfounded by tissue type or phylogenetic order. Our meta lifespan results demonstrated significant overlap with the previously mentioned EWASs of life\nafbe | span in all eutherian species hypergeometric P equals one times ten to the negative one hundred seventy-five. By contrast, none of the meta lifespan CpGs overlapped with EWASs of age, which further supports the idea that methylation of life span-related CpGs does not change with age in mammalian tissues. The top four CpGs from the meta lifespan analysis are depicted in figure six B, showing significant positive correlations for CpGs near LOXL1 and ZSCAN29 exons and negative correlations for those near RAB29 exon and GATA3 downstream, with logarithm maximum life span across various taxonomic orders and tissue types. Similar to our above-mentioned results, CpGs implicated by our meta lifespan analysis FDR less than zero point zero five overlap significantly FDR less than zero point zero one with genes involved in organ morphogenesis, RNA biosynthesis, increased rib number in mice, Wnt signaling, and genes altered by transient expression of pluripotency-inducing factors in mouse models nominal Fisher's exact P less than ten to the negative five for skin and meta lifespan; P less than ten to the negative eleven for kidney and meta lifespan.\n78r8 | Chromatin state analysis\n320g | Our large-scale mammalian DNA methylation data confirm that CpGs located in promoter regions two thousand base pairs upstream to two thousand base pairs downstream of TSS have low methylation levels mean equals fifteen percent; contrast, those in gene bodies and distal regions are highly methylated mean equals approximately seventy percent. CpGs having a high or low mean methylation level tend to have positive or negative correlation test Z statistics for life span, respectively. We find that CpGs with low methylation levels in long-lived species are lo- binding P equals sixty-four times ten to the negative eleven; figure seven C P equals two times ten to the negative six. Lived species exhibit high or low methylation levels in chromosomal regions that are expected to have high or low methylation patterns, respectively, we used chromatin states that were identified and annotated based on greater than one thousand epigenetic datasets encompassing a diverse range of\ntp8g | human cell and tissue types. The negatively life span-related CpGs are enriched with a constitutive TSS chromatin state TSS one, P equals two point five times ten to the negative twelve and promoter flanking P equals five point six times ten to the negative ten P equals five point six times ten to the negative ten equals\ngxfd | two point zero times ten to the negative nine P equals three point zero times ten to the negative four; figure seven C. The CpGs with high methylation levels in blood samples of long-lived species are enriched in gene body-associated states notably transcribed and exon state TxEx one, P equals seven point five times ten to the negative eight and highly transcribed state TxEx four P equals one point seven times ten to the negative six figure seven D. A detailed description of the chromatin state enrichment for EWASs of maximum life span is provided in the supplementary text and tables S twenty-one and S twenty-two.\ns2v1 | A biclustering analysis between chromatin annotations and comethylation modules based on fold enrichments figure eight and tables S twenty-one and S twenty-two revealed that the fifty-five mammalian comet-\njkp9 | hylation modules fall into three large groupings referred to as meta-modules. The bar plot to the left of figure eight shows different mean methylation levels of the CpGs underlying the three meta-modules: mean methylation equals zero point two three, zero point six six, and zero point seven seven for meta-modules one, two, and three, respectively.\nz8tt | Meta-module one contains several chromatin states that are associated with Polycomb repression, including strong polycomb-repressed state ReprPC one and bivalent promoters BivProm one to two. Further, meta-module one contains chromatin states related to TSSs TSS one and TSS two and several flanking promoters Prom F two, Prom F three, Prom F four, and Prom F five. TSS one, Prom F four, and Prom F five associated with negatively life span-related CpGs were previously associated among universal chromatin states with the strongest enrichments for CpG islands seventy-one to one hundred one fold. The color band under figure eight reveals that six modules underlying meta-module one are sensitive to murine life span interventions. Meta-module one is enriched with CpGs that have low methylation levels in long-lived species overlap with EWASs of life span, tan and greenyellow mod-",
