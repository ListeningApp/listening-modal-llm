You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

tp8g | However, more important than uncertain volume estimates, is the question what proportion of this total can be utilized for underground hydrogen storage under the parameters presented here. For example, as fields in the Weser-Ems and Elbe-Weser sector located in the Rotliegend formation may reach depths of 2,500-5,000 m (LBEG, 2021). From an economic point of view,
gxfd | Frontiers in Energy Research
s2v1 | storing gas at these depths is not profitable due to the high compression costs (e.g., Foh et al., 1979). Typical depths of natural gas storage facilities are 1,000-1,200 m (Sedlacek, 1999a). Physical constraints limit the storage of hydrogen to depth of 3,700 m below which hydrogen is thought to percolate through the cap rock and, hence, confinement loss (Iglauer et al., 2021). Details on the specific gas production, horizon and depth are, however, not listed. Former gas deposits in carbonates of the Stassfurt formation (Ca2), common in the eastern part of the North German Basin and the Thuringian Basin, may prove unsuitable as they contain significant amounts of hydrogen sulphur. However, former gas deposits in the Tertiary sandstones in the Upper Rhine Graben could again show suitable potential and supplement storage capacities in saline aquifers and the UGS facilities Stockstadt, Hähnlein, and Frankenthal. According to forecasts, this could be the end point of the North-South hydrogen pipeline. However, the nearby industrial clusters would depend on an economical and steady supply of hydrogen, which could be ensured by underground hydrogen storage facilities. For the Munich area, on the other hand, there are no pipeline plans according to the Gas Network Development Plan 2022-2032 or the IPCEI project plan. The question, therefore, arises as to how the supply will be ensured, and here, too, underground hydrogen storage could be of significance. Future research should therefore focus on the technical storage potential matching it with planned hydrogen infrastructures and industrial demands. This is of paramount importance in the South of Germany where storage potential is lower than in the North, making targeted planning necessary.
jkp9 | 5.2 Assessment of underground hydrogen storage costs
z8tt | Early economic analyses have shown that the cost of service for hydrogen is approximately equal to the costs of storing natural gas, but have stressed that the costs are very site specific and that a range of costs is possible for each type of underground storage (Foh et al., 1979). In a more recent life cycle cost analysis, Lord et al. (2011) conclude on a cost per kg of hydrogen basis that depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs and aquifers would be the economically attractive options, considering costs for pipelines and wells, compressors, cavern mining, and base gas. The overall costs for UHS amount to 1.6 $/kg for salt caverns, 0.04 $/kg for depleted hydrocarbon fields, 0.08 $/kg for aquifers, and 2.75 $/kg for hard rock caverns (Lord et al., 2011). This methodology has been adapted with most recent cost estimates as of 2019 in a review by Raza et al. (2022) for UHS to be 0.14-14.03 $/kg (0.004-0.421 $/ kWh) for salt caverns, 1.42 $/kg (0.043 $/kg) for depleted hydrocarbon fields, 1.49 $/kg (0.045 $/kWh) for aquifers, and 0.36-3.20 $/kg (0.011-0.096 $/kWh) for hard rock caverns. However, a comparison of natural gas storage costs in Europe and the United States shows that storage costs in Europe could be twice as high, not least because of higher regulatory requirements (Sedlacek, 1999a). But unlike in the United States, where these figures are sometimes published, cost estimates in Europe are rather poor (Sedlacek, 1999a). Something that all cost estimates for hydrogen pore storages have in common is the substantial
9g22 | influence of cushion gas on the ultimate costs of service, similar to natural gas storage facilities (Foh et al., 1979; Lord et al., 2011). At the same time it is considered more economic to leave some gas in the reservoir than to invest in the additional pumps and compressors to empty it completely (Foh et al., 1979). Therefore, one way to reduce these costs is to use lower cost cushion gas, but further research is needed to investigate the possibility of mixing, viscous fingering and gravity override that needs to be considered (see Section 3.4; Feldmann et al., 2016). The economics will therefore depend on the quantity of the cushion gas, the quality of the recovered hydrogen gas, and costs of gas separation if required (Foh, 1991).
41fx | 5.3 Hydrogen purity requirements
7um8 | Probably the most important parameters influencing the economic development of underground hydrogen storage are biotic and abiotic reactions. Potential contaminations may result from biotic reactions, such as for instance in the town gas storage Lobodice (Czech Republic) in which methanogens were shown to transform hydrogen and carbon dioxide to methane (Šmigáň et al., 1990). Or abiotic reactions like in the in the town gas storage Beynes (France) where pyrite reduction is believed to be responsible for the observed rise in hydrogen sulphide within the reservoir (Bourgeois et al., 1979). There are several process engineering options for removing hydrogen sulphide from natural gas and the hydrocarbon industry has decades of experience. In Germany, too, a large proportion of all natural gas reserves contain varying amounts of hydrogen sulphur, which have been processed at the Großenkneten desulfurization plant (Lower Saxony) since the 1970s. Here the hydrogen sulphur is removed from the gas and converted to elemental Sulphur used as feedstock by the chemical industry. However, this is a costly process and the purity requirements of hydrogen extracted from the storage facility will ultimately depend on the end user. Fuel cells, for example, require hydrogen of 99.97% purity according to Beuth Verlag GmbH, (2019) because contaminants such as carbon monoxide and hydrogen sulfide can impede electrode charging, while ammonia causes irreversible effects on fuel cell performance. In contrast, fuel quality specification for applications other than PEM fuel cell, i.e., combustion processes in hydrogen boilers will tolerate higher concentrations of impurities of about 98% (ISO, 2019). In contrast, industrial combustion applications (e.g., for sintering processes, heating of furnaces) and domestic appliances (boilers, cookers, etc.) are more tolerant with respect to the hydrogen content and impurity levels resulting in fuel-types similar to "town gas" with hydrogen contents of around 50%. Generally, these higher impurity levels could facilitate hydrogen utilization by increasing the heating value but replacement by other components, e.g., oxygen or carbon monoxide have to be considered carefully with regards to safety, decarbonization and cost-effective level of purity for end user applications and quality measurements.
