        "content": "efs9 | One can give or withhold in a manner far more effective, sophisticated, useful, which is quite invisible to people who think that giving or withholding is done by external assessment. If you seek some mark of favour or 'promotion', know that you are not ready for it. Progress comes through capacity to learn, and is irresistible. Nobody can stand between you and knowledge if you are fit for it.\nqog6 | Anybody or anything may stand between you and knowledge if you are unfit for it.\n9es2 | You can learn more in half an hour's direct contact with a source of knowledge (no matter the apparent reason for the contact or the subject of the transaction) than you can in years of formal effort.\nwi3t | You can learn and equip yourself with latent knowledge, whose development comes at a later stage. Only those who insist upon instant attention want anything else.\nf1ik | The role of the teacher is to provoke capacity in the student, to provide what there is when it will be useful, to guide him towards progress. It is not to impress, to give an impression of virtue, power, importance, general information, knowledge or anything else.\n5uy6 | Systematic study or behaviour is valuable when it is of use. When it is not, it can be poisonous.\nz3rz | Those who seek consistency as a major factor, in people or in study materials, are seeking system at a stage where it is not indicated. Children and savages do this, when they ask for information which will explain or make possible 'everything'. Consistency is, however, on offer from those people whose business it is to offer comfort and reassurance as objectives.\nu0fj | If you seek illumination or understanding when what you really need is information or rest from pressures, you will get none of these things. If you know what you want, you should go and get it.\nl2ha | If you carry the habit of judging things into an area where it does not apply, you will judge in a manner which will not correspond with your needs.\nksv5 | You cannot work on a higher level entirely with the concepts, language and experiences of a lower level. Higher level work is in a combination of manners and relationships.\n4thm | The ultimate absurdity, incapacitating from real learning beyond\nhyi5 | the stage you have reached, is to imagine that one thing is another. If you think that a book is a sandwich, you may try to eat it, and will not be able to learn what a book can teach. If, too, you imagine that you are being 'open' or 'working' or eager to learn when you are only playing a social game, you will learn nothing. The people who refuse to play that game with you will also, of course, sooner or later annoy you.\n5kpe | Human organisations can take two forms: entities which are set up to express or attain the aspirations of their members; and those which exist in order to acquire or provide something which is needed. Wants and needs are not the same. The difference is in information. If people know what they need, they do not have to confuse wants with needs.\n9onv | If you do not know already the difference between opinion and fact, you can study it in the daily and weekly newspapers.\nw9zz | Overall Seven, Study.\n18mf | Learning and Non-Learning.\nd7pq | Question: Why is it that so many people read so much and yet are not changed by it? Can people not absorb Sufi information through the written word?\n5jpk | Answer: To learn something, you may have often to be exposed to it many times, perhaps from different perspectives; and you also have to give it the kind of attention which will enable you to learn.\nh333 | In our experience, people fail to learn from Sufi materials for the same reason that they do not learn other things-they read selectively.\ndxg7 | The things that touch them emotionally, or which they like or are thrilled by, they will remember or seek in greater quantity and depth.\nn4gr | Since these are often the last materials which they will probably need, and since such an unbalanced attitude towards anything makes the person in need of balance in his approach, we have the situation to which you refer.\nhnik | We may at once admit that cultures which seek to highlight crudities, things which immediately appeal, and to project them in attractive forms and endorse and sustain them are unlikely to produce, on the whole, people with appetites for other than more of the same thing. But this behaviour will merely perpetuate the same kind of personality and attitude which created it in the first place.\nyise | If you have a chocolate cake decorated with sixteen cherries, and you gobble up the cherries because you like them, and then want to know why you have not eaten the cake-what does that make you? And if I tell you, would you like me?\n5w50 | This is the barrier to surmount. It is crossed by observing it in action, deciding to surmount it, and taking action to study comprehensively and not to pretend to be a student and then wonder why one has not learned.\nuon4 | SEE THE MINE INSIDE THE MOUNTAIN\nosrv | Reading does not change people unless they are ready to change, Rumi said: 'You have seen the mountain, you have not seen the mine inside the mountain.'\np1q4 | Just because a book is available, even one of the very greatest books, does not mean that one can, or perhaps should, try to learn correctly from it at any given moment. The Sufi Sadruddin said, in his Testament, 'Hereafter let not every man seek to learn from the writings of the Sheikh Ibn Arabi or from mine, for that gate is barred to the majority of mankind.'\nordy | This is because teachers may not need what is in books, but can use them for students, while students may not know, but might well not profit from studying them as arbitrarily as they ordinarily do.\nywm9 | Even the self-styled 'specialists', some of them scholars, do not translate the various levels and implications of Sufi materials correctly. In fact, there are indications that many of these people do not see the extra dimensions and alternative readings in the classical literature at all. Some even admit that they have not been able to do this. Somewhat characteristically they do not seem to stop translating or to enrich their perceptions of the material.\nquv6 | The Sufi usage of Hafiz's works is not at all the same as the ordinary translator's or reader's. I have noted elsewhere that, although it has been translated many times and quoted many thousands of times, there is hardly a correct rendition of the very first couplet of Rumi's major classical Sufi work, The Masnavi.\nwdmp | We could give hundreds of examples. In fact, let us just open the Gulistan (Rose Garden) of Saadi and look at a passage and see what we find. Here is a passage; it runs in Persian:\nu72s | Kasani ki yazdan-parasti kunand/Bi-awazi dtdab masti kunand. One English translation gives the meaning, literally enough, as:\njbxs | Those who are God-worshippers\ntv7p | Become drunken (even) at the sound of a water-wheel.\niube | How, the word dulab (water-wheel), also means, figuratively, 'deceit' in Persian.\ne033 | Saadi is saying, therefore:",
