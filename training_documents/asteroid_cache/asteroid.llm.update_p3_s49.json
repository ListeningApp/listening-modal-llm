        "content": "ccpt | All samples were slightly re-polished (less than approximately zero point three micrometers) after the initial SEM-EDS observations and then gold coated and baked at approximately one hundred degrees Celsius in the NanoSIMS air-lock system prior to the isotopic\n0fpw | analyses. Both two three eight two zero six lead dating and two zero seven lead two zero six lead dating were conducted using a NanoSIMS fifty at Atmosphere and Ocean Research Institute, University of Tokyo, Japan. The detailed analytical protocols and calibration methods are given in Takahata et al. and Koike et al.. A two nanoampere O minus beam was focused with a spot size of approximately ten micrometers. To obtain the two three eight uranium two zero six lead age, secondary ions of thirty-one P plus, forty-three Ca plus, two zero four Pb plus, two zero six Pb plus, two three eight U one six O plus, and two three eight U one six O two plus were simultaneously collected for six hundred seconds per spot using the NanoSIMS multi-collectors. Then, in the magnetic peak jumping mode, the secondary ions of two zero four Pb plus, two zero six Pb plus, two zero seven Pb plus measured at the same spot for approximately one hour to determine two zero seven Pb two zero six Pb age. A natural apatite standard from Canada (called \"PRAP\" in Sano et al.) was used to calibrate the measured two three eight U two zero six Pb ratios in the two zero six P D plus P two three eight U one six O plus minus two three eight U one six O two plus divided by two three eight U one six O plus diagram. The two three eight U J two zero six Pb and two zero seven Pb two zero six Pb isochron ages were calculated using Isoplot software. The isochron ages were calculated for the individual meteorites, assuming that all phosphates in one meteorite (except for Juvinas, discussed later) recorded the same history. The model two zero seven Pb star divided by two zero six Pb star ages were calculated for the individual data, which provide in-situ thermal histories for individual analyzed areas. We assumed an initial two zero seven two zero six two zero four Pb composition (same to the Canyon Diablo troilite) and a specific two three eight U two three five U ratio for the model two zero seven Pb star divided by two zero six Pb star calculations, which does not affect our results and discussion.
