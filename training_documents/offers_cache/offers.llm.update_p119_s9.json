        "content": "kyih | Pro Tip: Name Your Guarantee Something Cool\nzvx5 | If you are going to give a guarantee, spice it up. Instead of using \"satisfaction\" or some other \"vanilla\" word, describe it more strongly. Generic Example (Bad): Thirty Day Money Back Satisfaction Guarantee.\naok4 | Creative Imagery Example number one (Good): In thirty days, if you wouldn't jump into shark-infested waters to get our product back, we will return every dollar you paid.\nomvu | Creative Imagery Example number two (Great): You'll get our famous \"Club a Baby Seal Guarantee.\" After thirty days of using our services, if you wouldn't club a baby seal to stay on as a customer, you don't have to pay a penny.\ne271 | Unconditional Satisfaction-Based Refund Guarantee (Expanded from above):\nlmdg | What the Client Gets: If at any time they're not satisfied with the level of service they're receiving from you, they can request a refund (at any time) for the program.\n5gqf | My Take: Believe it or not, this was my guarantee when I sold weight-loss programs. Besides being an irresistible offer, I guaranteed satisfaction. I used the strength of my guarantee to close a lot of deals. \"Do you think I'd still be in business if I gave a crazy guarantee like that and wasn't good at what I did? Now I'm not guaranteeing you're going to hit this goal in six weeks, after all, because I can't eat the food for you. But I am guaranteeing that you will get five hundred dollars worth of value and service from us to\nyg2b | support you. If you don't feel like we gave you that level of service, I'll write you a check the day you tell me we suck.\"\nkftl | It works perfectly with a best-case/worst-case close. \"Best case you get the body of your dreams and we give you all your money towards staying with us to hit your long-term goal. Worst case you tell me I suck, I write you a check, and you get six weeks of free training. Both options are risk free. But, the only thing guaranteed not to help you is walking out of here today.\" If you are good at what you do, you can use a guarantee like this to push a lot of people over the edge. That line made me a lot of money. I had two people take me up on it out of four thousand sales in three and a half years.\nwulb | Satisfaction/No questions asked is the highest form of guarantee. It means we could do everything right and you could still ask for your money back. As long as you know the math, you will typically make up for the refunds in spaces with higher and faster closing on the sales side. But you have to be good at fulfilling your promises. If not, steer clear. I believe this offer works much better in lower-ticket situations. It becomes very risky as you go into higher-ticket services with higher costs of fulfillment.\nle9r | Pro Tip: Unconditional vs Conditional Based on Business Type\n34uj | Bigger broader guarantees work better with lower ticket Business to Customer businesses (many people just won't bother taking the time). The higher the ticket, and the more business-oriented it is, the more you want to steer towards specific guarantees. That may or may not include refunds, and may or may not have conditions.\nu3ij | Conditional Outsized Refund Guarantee\nx0aw | What the Client Gets: Double or triple their money back, or a no-strings-attached payment of X,XXX dollars (or another amount that's far more than what they paid).\nrx1a | My Take: This is for when you sell something with high margins. And this is a guarantee to add with a consumption condition. That means they must do a variety of things to qualify for this guarantee. A world-class affiliate marketer Jason Fladlien (who did twenty-seven million dollars in a single day) recently used an amazing guarantee for a course he sold. He said \"if you buy this course and spend X dollars on advertising your ecommerce store using the methods herein, and don't make money, I will buy your store from you for twenty-five thousand dollars no questions asked.\" He claimed that an additional three million dollars in sales came from this crazy guarantee on a two thousand nine hundred ninety-seven dollar course. What's more, he only gave ten of these twenty-five thousand dollar refunds out. So the refund generated two point seven five million dollars in extra sales. That's what a crazy guarantee does for you.\nagnr | In general, a very strong guarantee like this will definitely drive more sales. This really serves the purpose when you need a lot of stuff to be done by your prospect, and, assuming those things are done, there's a low chance of the result not being achieved. Sometimes a guarantee like this can actually get clients better results on top. This guarantee will typically outperform a traditional thirty-day money back guarantee in terms of net conversions (sales minus refunds).\nt1o7 | Conditional Service Guarantee\n2830 | What the Client Gets: You keep working for them free of charge until X is achieved.\nq9nf | My Take: This is probably my personal favorite guarantee of all time. It essentially guarantees they will achieve their goal, but it eliminates the element of time. You are never at risk for losing the money. The guarantee is around the outcome. To add further flavor to it, you can make this guarantee conditional on them doing key actions linked with success: setting up a web page, attending calls, showing up to workouts, weighing in, reporting data, etc.\n5q5q | Real Talk: Since I have been advising businesses to use this particular guarantee, I have yet to have a single person say a client took them up on it. Realistically, if someone actually does everything you asked them to do and doesn't achieve the result by the time you had said, one of two things usually happens:\n4cbq | One. Seeing your client's commitment, you happily keep working with them until they achieve the desired result\n33ef | Two. It gets dropped. Your client is likely very close to the goal, which means satisfied.\nxfue | Also, it's likely the sales conversation with the guarantee was months earlier. What may have been important in the sales conversation is a distant memory now, replaced by their affection towards you or your business.\npmnr | Conditional Modified Service Guarantee\n7ce8 | What the Client Gets: You give them another Y-long period of service or access to your product or services free of charge. Generally, Y should give them at least twice the duration.\nqrtv | My Take: This is like the service guarantee, but it ties a specific duration to your extended work or involvement. So instead of being on the hook \"forever,\" you're only on the hook for an additional Y period of time. I've seen it work magically and keep the business on the hook for a more finite period of time which may be an easier place for you to start before doing the \"all out\" Service Guarantee above.\na7z0 | Conditional Credit-based Guarantee\n7dsi | What the Client Gets: You give them back what they paid but in a credit toward any service you offer.\niax1 | My Take: This is best used during an upsell process to seal the deal on a service they are unsure they will like. They already like what they have, you are trying to sell them more of that. Worst case, they can apply it to the thing they already like. So it maintains goodwill with the customer.\n61w7 | Conditional Personal Service Guarantee\nnllv | What the Client Gets: You work with them one-on-one, free of charge, until they reach X objective or result.\nbsru | My Take: This is absolutely one of the strongest guarantees in existence. It's like a service guarantee on crack. You will definitely want to add conditions, though: they must respond back in twenty-four hours, they must use the products you tell them to, they must X-Y-Z. Only if they do that, will you keep working with them one-on-one.",
