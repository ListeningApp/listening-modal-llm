        "content": "byu8 | Finally, we have considered the Toda model with conservative noise. In this case, it is natural to argue that the mean free path scales as the inverse of the collision rate, ell is proportional to gamma to the power of negative one. This intuition is confirmed by the data reported in Fig. one c, where we observe the same scenario as for the previous models, after setting theta equals one. For small gamma, j sub N converges again towards a function which asymptotically decays as one over xi. However, the heuristic formula four is not comparably accurate: it is necessary to add a correction term to reproduce the observed data as shown in Fig. two (see triangles V S the corresponding solid curve).\n76b0 | So far we have tested the structure of the first addendum in Eq. two, by studying a regime where the second contribution is negligible. What about the second addendum? Once j sub N has been determined, one can proceed by estimating the anomalous component as J sub A of L equals J of L, epsilon minus j sub N of L epsilon to the power of theta. The data in Fig. three indicates that J sub A exhibits the expected anomalous scaling already for system sizes where the direct estimates are strongly affected by the diffusive component. For the H P G the fitted slope, about negative zero point six six, corresponds to eta equals zero point three three, in excellent agreement with the K P Z prediction eta equals one third. For Toda we obtain eta equals zero point five two, consistent with Ref. and even closer to eta equals one half, the value rigorously proven for harmonic models with momentum-conserving noise. We thus conclude that the measurements are in full agreement with the crossover scenario from diffusive to hydrodynamic behavior proposed above.\nzxz6 | The same scenario is expected to emerge in the presence of generic momentum-conserving perturbations of the Toda chain, such as a potential of the form epsilon W of q. In fact, in this case, it has been already noticed that the energy-flux correlation decays over a time scale inversely proportional to a power of epsilon. A preliminary evidence of a diffusive regime for small epsilon was also given in Ref.\nxnth | More in general, we argue that the crossover from normal to anomalous regimes of the F P U T alpha beta model is fully accounted for by the above described scenario. Indeed, the F P U T alpha beta (at low enough energies) can be regarded as a perturbed Toda chain over very long time scales, on which the Toda actions are only weakly perturbed. We surmise that other model potentials\nvafm | should display the same phenomenology, if their form is \"close enough\" to\n2zmw | U sub T. What can we say about the simplest model of a perturbed harmonic chain? This textbook case deserves a special consideration. Numerical analysis of the F P U T three model at very low energy, i.e. below the strong stochasticity threshold, does not reveal any signature of an intermediate diffusive regime, but rather a direct crossover from ballistic to anomalous regimes. More compelling evidence of the absence of a diffusive regime comes from the study of the harmonic chain with conservative noise in the limit of vanishing noise, i.e. gamma approaches zero. It has been found analytically and confirmed numerically that J sub A of L, epsilon, exhibits a singular dependence for epsilon approaches zero (here gamma approaches zero in the form of a divergence of the coefficient c sub A in Eq. five, c sub A is approximately gamma to the power of negative one half, which implies that J sub A prevails over J sub N across the entire range of system sizes.\nbf9k | Hence, the different behavior displayed by weakly perturbed harmonic oscillators can be traced back to a divergence of the anomalous component, which is itself a consequence of the nonlinearity of the dynamical equations. While this counter-intuitive phenomenon requires further clarifications, it does not however jeopardize the general scaling theory developed in this Letter, which provides a convincing explanation of the seemingly normal diffusion observed in several models of nonlinear chains.",
