You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

v3r2 | is important to note that the ligands will likely be different from those coordinating zinc in the crystal structure. For example, several potential copper ligands, such as Met 199 from pmoA, are in the vicinity. Binding and activation of O2 occurs at mononuclear copper centers in the enzymes peptidylglycine a-hydroxylating monooxygenase (PHM), which hydroxylates the Ca atom of a terminal glycine residue, and dopamine ß-hydroxylase (DBM), which con- verts dopamine to norepinephrine.41 In PHM, there are two noncoupled mononuclear copper centers, CuA and Cup, that are separated by 11 Å. Substrate and O2 bind at the Cup site, which is coordinated by two histidines, a methionine, and a solvent molecule.42 Crystals of PHM soaked with substrate analogues under reducing condi- tions show electron density at the Cup site that is best modeled as O2. Surprisingly, O2 binds with an end-on n1 geometry, with distances of 2.1 and 2.8 Å from the copper ion to the two oxygen atoms.43 This crystallographic model is consistent with biochemical and computational data, suggesting that Cu"-superoxide is the reactive species, 44-46 as well as with the recent characterization of an end-on 71 superoxo-Cu" complex that is able to hydroxylate and hydroperoxylate phenols.47
nv42 | Could a similar species be important in pMMO? One difference is that the C-H bond dissociation energy in methane is 104 kcal/mol as compared to 87 kcal/mol for the PHM substrate.46 In addition, DFT calculations suggest that Cu"-superoxide cannot abstract a hydrogen atom from methane.48 On the basis of calculations using a model with two imidazoles and one acetate to mimic the pmoB monocopper center, Yoshizawa and Shiota propose a mechanism for methane hydroxylation involving a Cu1"1-oxo reactive species.48 According to their hypothesis, the initial reaction of Cul with O2 results in Cu"-super- oxide, which is converted to Cu"-hydroperoxide by hy- drogen atom transfer from a tyrosine residue in the active site. Abstraction of a hydrogen atom from a second tyrosine would then yield the Cu""-oxo species and a water molecule. The idea that tyrosine residues are involved derives from mechanistic proposals for PHM and DBM,46 which have actually been ruled out by mutagen- esis data.49 Yoshizawa and Shiota invoke participation of specific tyrosine residues near the pmoB mononuclear copper center. Their proposal could be modified to apply to the zinc site because two conserved tyrosines, Tyr 196 from pmoA and Tyr 178 from pmoC, are adjacent. At present, these ideas remain highly speculative.
xags | O2 Activation at a Dinuclear Copper Center. The case for the dicopper center as the active site is stronger than that for a monocopper center for several reasons. First, all of the ligands to this site are highly conserved. Second, the existence of the dicopper center is clear from both EXAFS29 and crystallographic data.14 In contrast, the pmoB monocopper center observed in the crystal structure may not be conserved, and the existence of a monocopper center at the crystallographic zinc site has not been established definitively. Third, a bis(u-oxo)dicopper core in copper-loaded zeolites has been demonstrated to oxidize methane selectively.50 Fourth, there is ample

ko3c | precedence for O2 binding and activation at dinuclear copper centers. In tyrosinase and catechol oxidase, di- copper centers catalyze the hydroxylation of tyrosine and the conversion of catechols to quinones, respectively. The active sites in these enzymes differ from the pMMO dicopper center, in that the two copper ions are ligated by six rather than three histidines and the Cu-Cu distances are longer.51 In these enzymes, the active species is likely to be a side-on u-72:12 peroxo dicopper(II) complex.52,53 The isoelectronic species in which the peroxo O-O bond is cleaved to yield a bis(u-oxo)dicopper(III) complex has been characterized in model compounds, although not yet in biology. Interconversion between the bis (u-oxo)di- copper(III) and u-72:12 peroxo dicopper(II) cores has been observed for many synthetic systems and is the subject of several theoretical studies.54-56
xek3 | Could one of these moieties be involved in methane oxidation by pMMO? By analogy to the above enzymes and model complexes, O2 could react with a dicopper(I) center in pMMO to yield either a u-12:72 peroxo dicop- per(II) or a bis(u-oxo)dicopper(III) species. Injection of an electron might then generate the mixed valent bis(u- oxo) Cu"Cu"" complex, which has been suggested to be more reactive (Figure 6).30,57 Yoshizawa and Shiota have investigated this possibility by computational methods.48,58 Using a dicopper model ligated by three imidazoles and one acetate, their results suggest that the mixed valent species is more reactive than the bis(u-oxo)dicopper(III) species and better suited to activation of the C-H bond in methane. Although the mixed valent species is similar in reactivity to the mononuclear Cu(III)-oxo complex, its formation is energetically more favorable.48 One important caveat to these results is that the assumed starting model may not represent the dinuclear copper center accurately. In particular, residue Glu 35 is modeled as a ligand, although its side-chain oxygen atoms are >4 Å from the copper ions in the crystallographic model (Figure 2B). In addition, the Cu-Cu distance of 2.65 Å in reduced pMMO is significantly shorter than that the >4 Å Cu-Cu distance observed in reduced catechol oxidase and tyrosinase.51
bbpr | Catalytic Mechanism. According to DFT calculations, methane oxidation by the mononuclear Cu""-oxo species discussed above begins with methane weakly bound to
5zyf | the monocopper center followed by C-H bond cleavage, formation of a nonradical intermediate, and recombina- tion of OH and CH3. A similar mechanism was computed for the bis (u-oxo)Cu"Cul" complex.48 Chan and co- workers have investigated the pMMO mechanism using M. capsulatus (Bath) membrane preparations. Hydroxy- lation of both chiral ethane59 and chiral butane60 proceeds with the retention of the configuration. These data combined with hydrogen/deuterium kinetic isotope ef- fects are consistent with a concerted, nonradical mech- anism.59,60 In other studies, the absence of a carbon kinetic isotope effect for propane oxidation was inter- preted as evidence of minimal structural change at the carbon center during transition-state formation in the rate-limiting step.61
