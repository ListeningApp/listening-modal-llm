        "content": "s6su | As far as recommending a control for neurodegeneration research, the optimal control for alpha-synuclein should be considered. Using similar titers or particle numbers of alpha-synuclein and control viral vectors would be essential to evaluate alpha-synuclein specificity on causing degeneration of dopamine neurons. GFP and similar proteins are often used as controls, but as they themselves can cause neurodegeneration and immune responses, are they really the best controls in all cases? We would also consider using mammalian proteins instead of commonly used fluorescent proteins derived from marine organisms. It would also be worthwhile considering a protein that forms oligomers that are not known to cause neuronal pathology. Endogenous alpha-synuclein likely is in soluble oligomeric form, and its aggregation and fibril forms may be important in disease pathology due to their toxicity. Thus, it would be important to use proteins that produce non-toxic oligomers to compare the in vivo effects in the\ny219 | substantia nigra of animals. Examples of these proteins are mostly cytoskeletal components such as actin or collagen.\n06ht | Six. Conclusions\nv3r2 | AAV as a vehicle to deliver both therapeutic proteins and potentially toxic or pathogenic proteins has been widely used and high protein expression is found in the brain even after long periods of time, making it a powerful tool in therapy and disease models. Consideration of whether to inject AAV into the striatum or the substantia nigra due to the intrinsic properties of the substantia nigra dopamine neurons is an important aspect in neurotrophic therapy. There is also evidence of unspecific immune responses or cell death due to protein overexpression in the substantia nigra in general, and therefore using foreign proteins in neurodegeneration studies should be considered closely. After reviewing the literature on previously published AAV-x-syn studies and performing a series of experiments, it is clear that, while it is possible to achieve mild degeneration in this model, caution needs to be taken in selecting appropriate control vectors when targeting the substantia nigra in order to avoid proteinopathy or RNA toxicity.\n```",
