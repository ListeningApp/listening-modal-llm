        "content": "ixcc | Farquhar and Busch demonstrated that the first-type effect of photorespiration on the Kok effect can generate the apparent light inhibition of R sub D for photorespiratory conditions. As stated in the introduction, this inhibition via regulation of g sub S and g sub M is the same as the importance that Loreto et al. emphasized for accounting for the refixation of respired carbon dioxide when estimating R sub D. Loreto et al. stated that there would be no significant difference between R sub four and R sub DK if the refixation of respiratory carbon dioxide during illumination is taken into account. Our results showing that, after correcting for varying Gamma star over C sub C, light inhibition of R sub D only became lower but did not disappear, do not agree with the conclusion of Loreto et al. The refixation is an important means to reduce the (photo)respiratory loss under photorespiratory conditions, but its net contribution to total photosynthesis should be negligible under nonphotorespiratory conditions. Berghuijs et al. showed that R sub D estimated by the Kok method was closer to the estimate made by their model (that accounted for the refixation) under nonphotorespiratory than\n8p6h | under photorespiratory conditions. The experiment of Loreto et al. was conducted with maize, a C four species where Rubisco is expected to be surrounded by a high carbon dioxide partial pressure as a result of the C four carbon-concentrating mechanism, and thus the refixation of carbon dioxide released from respiration and photorespiration should have little contribution to the total assimilation. Using carbon fourteen-labelling, PÃ¤rnik and Keerberg showed that light inhibition of R sub D occurs even when accounting for carbon dioxide refixation. Gong et al. reported a high suppression of R sub zero by light in a C four species. If refixation does occur appreciably in C four species as Loreto et al. stated, it may reflect the refixation more by phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase than by Rubisco, which might contribute to leakiness.\npmgl | Apparent versus real light inhibition of\n90no | R sub D The suppression of R sub D by light has been identified using the Kok method, in many experimental studies, including recent reports based on carbon dioxide-exchange measurements or both carbon dioxide and oxygen-exchange measurements. Light is known to suppress the activity of enzymes that involve carbon dioxide-releasing pathways contributing to R sub D. Using the model analysis, Farquhar and Busch demonstrated that at least part of the light inhibition of R sub D can be generated without assuming this inhibition beforehand. Here we used the modelling approach to analyse combined carbon dioxide-exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence data. With such combined experimental and modelling analyses, we demonstrated quantitatively that the original Kok method that attributes the Kok effect entirely to the light inhibition of R sub D overestimated the real inhibition, as a result of ignoring the contribution of varying Phi sub two and Gamma star over C sub C to the Kok effect. The effect of varying Phi sub two on the Kok method in overestimating the inhibition has been corrected simply by the Yin method, while the correction for varying Gamma star over C sub C is more complicated. We previously stressed that both Kok and Yin methods to estimate R sub D actually apply to nonphotorespiratory conditions. Our analysis with Equation five suggests an approach to estimate the real light suppression of R sub D for photorespiratory conditions, although we are unable to clarify which one of the three scenarios of suppression is most likely. Most importantly, our analysis using Equation five revealed that the real suppression still increased with relative amounts of photorespiration. While this new empirical trend receives the support from a theoretical analysis of Buckley and Adams that photorespiratory NADH may be involved in the suppression, there are probably other underlying biochemical mechanisms that merit further investigation.",
