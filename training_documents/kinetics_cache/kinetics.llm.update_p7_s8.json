Interestingly, we found the statistical phenomenon of Simpson's paradox. First, we observed from Figure three A that there were no significant differences in variability distributions between the positive-feedback and the negative-feedback genes, but the non-feedback genes exhibited higher expression variability. The latter result seemed inconsistent with the previous conclusions that positive feedback amplified variability and negative feedback attenuated variability. This can be interpreted by the fact that the expression level and the expression variability were negatively correlated (see Supplementary Figure S nine a). To show this point, we introduced the average expressed variable by dividing all the selected genes into five equal boxes based on average expression levels and tracked the expression-variability changes when the average gene-expression levels were increased. Then, we found that the expression variability was indeed negatively correlated with the average expression levels, regardless of feedback forms (see Figure three D). Furthermore, the positive- feedback genes showed relatively higher expression variability than the negative-feedback genes at the same expression levels, consistent with the results obtained in previous studies.\nuow2 | Next, we checked the genome-wide effects of feedback regulations on transcriptional burst frequencies and burst sizes. Interestingly, we found that positive and negative feedback differently modulated burst frequencies and sizes. Specifically, the burst frequencies of positive-feedback genes were significantly higher than those of negative-feedback genes on the whole genome and at the same expression level. By contrast, the burst sizes of positive-feedback genes were smaller than those of\niat7 | negative-feedback genes. In addition, the effects of negative feedback and non-feedback on burst frequencies were difficult to distinguish, but there was a significant difference in burst sizes. This observation suggested that burst size could be a distinguishable characteristic between negative-feedback and non-feedback genes.\nywwr | Finally, in this subsection, we point out that an unexplored issue is how promoter architecture affects transcriptional burst kinetics in the presence of feedback regulation on a genome-wide scale. Below, we address this issue from three aspects: promoter motifs, transcription start site distributions, and enhancer-promoter interactions in the following.\n0i6j | TATA genes are expressed with high burst frequencies only in the presence of positive feedback\n87cq | It was reported that promoter motifs such as TATA box and initiator regulated transcriptional bursting directly. On the other hand, we showed in the previous section that different feedback regulations led to different burst kinetics. This raised an unexplored question: how do promoter motifs modulate transcriptional burst kinetics\n0qs3 | in the presence of feedback regulation on the genome-wide scale?\nz8f7 | We first identified promoter motifs (TATA box, initiator, GC-box, and CCAAT-box) of each gene from the EPD database (see 'Materials and Methods'). Then, we found that both the TATA box and initiator positively regulated mean transcriptional levels, in line with the results obtained in previous studies. Besides, we verified that the TATA genes with positive feedback had higher proportions than those genes with negative feedback or without feedback, whereas the other promoter motifs were uncorrelated to feedback forms. These results implied that the TATA box was a critical promoter motif for the regulation of transcription by a positive feedback mechanism, which might be supported by the following experimental observation: TATA boxes were enriched in the promoters of genes with fewer transcriptional pauses, and the TATA box sequence was specifically bound by the TATA-binding proteins that acted as general transcription factors to facilitate the localization of RNA polymerase two and transcription.\n7w7j | To investigate the genome-wide effects of promoter motifs on burst kinetics in the presence of feedback regulations,\n51vd | we performed multivariate statistical analysis using linear regression models (see 'Materials and Methods'). We also observed the Simpson's paradox that the effect of promoter motifs on variability and burst kinetics is different between distinguishing feedback regulation and without distinguishing feedback regulation.\nbaj1 | First, we studied gene-expression variability. We characterized this variability with the residual squared coefficient of variation (see 'Materials and Methods') since this coefficient can disentangle the correlation of the coefficient of variation and the average expression levels across cells. Therefore, we focus on the residual squared coefficient of variation instead of the coefficient of variation. By performing the linear regression of the residual squared coefficient of variation (see 'Materials and Methods'), we found the synergy between positive feedback and the TATA box (or initiator or CCAAT box) can amplify the expression variability. This result was actually an extension of the previous result that the TATA box enlarged the gene-expression variability when feedback regulations were not distinguished. As an additional evaluation, we used the residual squared coefficient of variation rank to predict the presence of the TATA box and showed that the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, denoted by AUC, was larger in the case of positive feedback than in the case of negative feedback or non-feedback, indicating that\nn1wo | TATA boxes led to the larger gene-expression variability in the former case.\n5bq3 | Next, we assessed burst frequencies and sizes. Similar to the case of expression variability, we also performed multivariate linear regression analyses on them. When feedbacks were not distinguished, we showed that TATA boxes significantly boosted burst frequencies of the genes. However, when considering different feedback forms, we observed that only TATA genes with positive feedback increased burst frequencies. In addition, we observed that other promoter motifs had different degrees of effect on burst frequency, depending on feedback forms. These results were masked without distinguishing feedback forms. For burst sizes, it was reported that the genes with TATA box or initiator had larger burst sizes than those without TATA box or without initiator. We reproduced similar results, but observed that the TATA genes were expressed with larger burst sizes, independently of feedback regulation, and the genes with initiator had larger burst sizes only in the case of negative feedback. G C box and CCAAT box on the distal promoter had opposite effects on burst sizes in the cases of positive and negative feedback. In particular, no difference was found for all the genes if feedback forms were not distinguished.\nezla | Briefly, the above results indicated that the TATA box played a pivotal role in transcriptional bursting. It worked as a static promoter element to up-regulate burst sizes and simultaneously utilized a dynamic positive feedback regulation mechanism to increase burst frequencies.\nrsbu | Feedback regulations concealed the effects of transcription start site distribution on transcriptional burst kinetics\n```",
