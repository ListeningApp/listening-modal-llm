You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

p2n3 | 119 · As in the variants of verbal <LATEX>n</LATEX> n-back tasks, we also have "spatial-with-noise", "spatial-with- feedback", and "spatial-with-CoT-reasoning" versions of the task. The prompts for the 121 the with-feedback and with-reasoning versions were basically the same as those for the
ohh7 | 122 corresponding verbal tasks (see Table 1). For the spatial-with-noise version, we added a noise character (chosen from "#$%&@ ~~ ") to 1 to 3 unoccupied locations in the <LATEX>3 \times 3</LATEX> grid
vbni | 124 on every trial. This is a first step to examine the LLM's spatial working memory when it 125 was not able to get the correct answer by simply doing string match.
dgcw | 126 . To further confirm that the LLM can really reason in a spatial way rather than trivially 127 performing some kind of string match under the hood, we further introduced two variants 128 that specifically require abstract spatial reasoning; an model that would otherwise simply 129 match strings would have failed. To achieve so, in these two tasks, a match is defined as 130 when the location of the letter <LATEX>\mathrm { X }</LATEX> is in the same row or column as the <LATEX>\mathrm { X }</LATEX> n trials ago. The 131 difference is whether identical locations also count as a match. We expect the version 132 excluding identical locations to be harder for the LLM to perform.
gvwz | 133 . We also explored whether the size of the grid <LATEX>\left( 3 \times 3 \right. ,</LATEX> <LATEX>4 \times 4 ,</LATEX> <LATEX>5 \times 5</LATEX> would influence the LLM's 134 performance. To the best of our knowledge, there hasn't been human studies exploring how 135 the number of all possible spatial locations would impact behavioural performance. In light 136 of this, we didn't have specific assumptions for how the LLM would perform differently 137 under these scenarios.
sk5m | 138 4 Results
qws8 | 139 To analyse the model's performance on our experiments, we used 4 widely accepted performance metrics reported in numerous human behavioral studies:
877u | 141 Hit Rate: It is a performance measure used in various fields, including computer science, statistics,
rzhj | 142 and information retrieval. It represents the proportion of correct or successful outcomes out of the
bfax | 143 total number of targets or true positives. Mathematically, it is calculated by
f2y8 | Hit Rate = Number of True Positives + Number of False Negatives Number of True Positives (1)
o7qm | 144 False Alarm Rate: It quantifies the frequency at which a system or algorithm incorrectly identifies a
d52l | 145 negative outcome as positive. Mathematically, it is calculated by
qlbb | Number of False Positives
nhsg | False Alarm Rate = Number of False Positives + Number of True Negatives (2)
hy0l | 146 Accuracy: It is a commonly used performance metric that measures the correctness or reliability of a
4jmz | 147 system, model, or algorithm in making predictions or classifications. It represents the proportion of
b7cq | 148 correct predictions or classifications out of the total number of predictions or classifications made.
0b39 | 149 Mathematically, it is calculated by
qecd | Accuracy Number of Correct Responses Total Number of Trials
1o7p | (3)
cp13 | 150 Detection Sensitivity (d'): It is a statistical measure used to assess the ability of a diagnostic test
bgre | 151 or classification model to accurately distinguish between two groups or conditions. It quantifies the
57lp | 152 extent to which the test or model can correctly identify positive cases relative to negative cases while
ukth | 153 minimizing false positives and false negatives. Mathematically, it is calculated by
kpvt | d' = ZHit Rate - ZFalse Alarm Rate (4)
jie2 | 154 where ZHit Rate and ZFalse Alarm Rate represent the z-score of Hit Rate and False Alarm Rate, respectively.
d0ik | 155 In the current study, we did 50 blocks of tests for n = 1,2,3 in each experiment, which allows us to 156 calculate the standard error of mean (SEM) and draw error bars to visualise the reliability of our
0x0s | 157 findings (for further details on the statistics tests we performed, see Supplementary Material).
4exe | 158 4.1 Verbal n-back experiments
0myz | 159 In all versions of the task, we observed a performance pattern strikingly consistent with human participants, with the LLM's performance declining significantly when n increased from 1 to 3 5,
xh3i | 161 as shown in hit rate, accuracy, and d'. Compared to the base version, the verbal-with-noise variant
syiw | 162 significantly made the LLM's performance worse. We observe that while chain-of-thought prompting 163 has significantly improved the performance of the language models in verbal task variants, feedback 164 on whether the model has performed correctly in the previous task failed to meaningfully improve 165 performance.
kg3t | 166 4.2 Spatial n-back experiments
lvae | 167 In the four versions spatial tasks corresponding to the above verbal tasks, same patterns of performance 168 were basically replicated (Figure 6). CoT reasoning significantly made the LLM perform better,
o9sc | 169 adding noise made the model perform worse. But in all versions of the task, ChatGPT suffered significant declines in performance as <LATEX>n</LATEX> increases.
121u | 171 When further evaluated whether the LLM could conduct abstract spatial reasoning. The results confirmed so (Figure 7). In line with our prediction, the LLM performed worse when identical 172
zh03 | 173 locations are not defined a match, which means more abstract spatial reasoning would be required in
1mvw | 174 this scenario.
6d4s | 175 Our explorations on the effect of grid size on the model performance yielded interesting results, too.
mqah | 176 The LLM performed better when grid size was larger, especially as seen from the hit rate of d' results
xxr8 | 177 in Figure 8.
rl4j | 178 5 Discussion
vz32 | 179 We argue that our experimental results firmly point to the conclusion that ChatGPT has limited 180 working memory capacity similar to humans. Even various prompting techniques (such as the 181 provision of feedback and the use of state-of-the-art chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting [40]) may be 182 used to improve its performance, the trend of performance decline as a function of increasing n still 183 bears striking resemblance to human performance shown in numerous previous work. The consistent 184 pattern of performance declines thus might be reflecting a fundamental constraint emerged from the 185 architecture of the model, suggesting an possibility that the low-level working memory mechanism 186 of LLMs might be similar to human working memory at least in some aspects.
ncb0 | 187 In neuroscience, there are many unsolved problems on working memory, especially where and how working memory is encoded and maintained in the brain and why working memory capacity is 189 limited. We propose that, in light of the above observation, ChatGPT and or other large language models of similar calibre could be potentially used and tested as a modelling platform for studying human working memory, just as what neuroscientists have done in recent years using other artificial
8mp0 | 192 neural networks [32]. Furthermore, future efforts aimed at interpreting activity of artificial neurons
xjyk | 193 in LLMs [3] like ChatGPT would probably hold potential in informing the mechanisms of human 194 working memory.
mt0f | 195 Our work also has some limitations. It would be important to test other LLMs on the same task we 196 used here, to test whether they exhibit similar performance patterns and whether they have different
awab | 197 working memory capacity. It would also be helpful to test ChatGPT on other working memory span
ixcc | 198 tasks used in cognitive sciences [8, 12] to address the generalisability of n-back tasks as measurement tools.
