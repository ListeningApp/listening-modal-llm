You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

87vz | <LATEX>* P < 0 . 0 5 ,</LATEX> <LATEX>* * P < 0 . 0 1 .</LATEX> between the three types of flesh firmness and crispness retain- ability (Table S3). As expected, a clear transcriptomic signature of both the flesh firmness type I and the flesh crispness type I hybrids was the 2.18- to 56.19-fold high expression of cell wall degradation-related genes. These genes included MdBGL (MD00G1075400 and MD11G1023900), MdBGAL (MD15G1220900 and MD15G1221000) and MdBGLU (MD03G1215300) (Figure S6a,b; Tables S4 and S5). On the contrary, the expression of four cell wall-associated genes was significantly higher (2.26- to 9.10-fold difference) in flesh crispness retainable type III and type II hybrids than in crispness unretainable type I hybrids, that is MdPGIP12 (MD05G1002900), MdGLCAT14B (MD02G1033100), MdGWD1 (MD16G1097800) and a cellulolyase gene (MD17G1249600) (Figure S6b; Tables S4 and S5).
ym66 | Several ethylene-related DEGs were detected between flesh firmness type III or type II and type I hybrids. The expression of MdZAT12 (MD01G1123300 and MD07G1192900), MdERF110 (MD15G1334900) and MdACO1 (MD15G1205100) was 0.01- to 0.48-fold lower in type II and type III hybrids (Figure S6a; Tables S4 and S5). Similarly, the expression of MdACO2 (MD05G1354000), MdACO3 (MD02G1050800), MdEIN3 (MD15G1441000) and MdERF98 (MD06G1208700) was signifi- cantly low (0.01- to 0.47-fold difference) in flesh crispness retainable type III and type II hybrids (Figure S6b; Tables S4 and S5). A group of ethylene response genes, however, was expressed more actively (2.02- to 2514.55-fold difference) in firmness type III and type II hybrids than that in firmness type I hybrids, such as MdAGL24 (MD15G1384500), MdACO4 (MD16G1019900), MdACO4-like (MD16G1019800), and MdALD1 (MD15G1412200 and MD15G1412400).
l0a3 | High expression (2.95- to 37.14-fold difference) of some auxin- related genes, MdSAUR71 (MD10G1202100), MdSAUR40 (MD01G1106100) and MdARGOS (MD02G1000700), was observed in flesh firmness type I hybrids (Figure S6a; Table S4). In addition, a group of genes involved in abscisic acid (ABA) and gibberellic acid (GA) synthesis, transport, and response were differentially expressed between hybrid types of flesh firmness or crispness (Figures S6-S8; Tables S4 and S5). There were also DEGs detected between flesh firmness type III and type II hybrids, such as jasmonate (JA)-related genes (MD07G1242100, MD07G1243000, MD07G1244000 and MD07G1244600) (Fig- ure S6a; Tables S4 and S5). In summary, the above DEGs indicated the cell wall degradation, ethylene biosynthesis and signalling of ethylene, and other phytohormone were involved in flesh firmness and crispness retainability.
u8nw | To predict candidate genes associated with flesh firmness and crispness retainability from QTL regions, 1865 and 1278 genes were downloaded from the intervals of the 62 QTLs for flesh
l2v9 | firmness or crispness retainability, respectively. Then, 87 and 58 genes were selected according to the parental re-sequencing and RNA-seq data. These genes were functionally associated with fruit ripening and senescence (Table S6). From the QTL regions of F- F03.1/C-F03.2 and F-Z16.2, two ERF genes, MdERF3 (MD03G1194300) and MdERF118 (MD16G1043500), were pre- dicted as candidate genes for both flesh firmness and crispness retainability (Figure S5a,b; Table S6). MdERF3 and MdERF118 were also DEGs (Table S3).
afbe | Validation of candidate genes MdERF3 and MdERF118, and their interaction
78r8 | An 8-bp deletion (CTTAACTG) from -323 to -330 (Del323) prior to the ATG codon of MdERF3 of 'Red Fuji' was detected and validated using Sanger sequencing (Figure 2a). The Del323 genotypes of 'Red Fuji' and 'Zisai Pearl' were heterozygous Del323:del323 and homologus Del323:Del323, respectively. Bioinformatic analysis predicted that this deletion might damage the DOF5.3 binding motif.
320g | The expression of MdERF3 in 'Red Fuji' and three flesh firmness and crispness retainable hybrids (01-067, 11-169, and 17-138) with Del323:del323 genotype was significantly higher (2.1- to 2.9-fold difference) than that in 'Zisai Pearl' and three flesh firmness and crispness non-retainable hybrids (12-190, 17-103, and 14-107) with Del323:Del323 genotype during 6 to 18 weeks of cold storage (Figure 2b).
tp8g | ß-Glucuronidase (GUS) staining of transient transformed tobacco (Nicotiana benthamiana) leaves and the relative expres- sion of GUS in MdERFpro-Fdel323:GUS and MdERF3 pro-Fdel323- 2:GUS indicated that both the presence of Del323 from 'Zisai Pearl' and truncating off the corresponding fragment from 'Red Fuji' destroyed the promoter activity of MdERF3 (Figure 2c,d). In transgenic apple calli, the relative promoter activity was signifi- cantly lower in MdERF3 pro-F:GUS (Del323) than in MdERF3 pro -F: GUS (del323) (Figure 2e,f).
