You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

r5il | Proteins are one of the most fundamental compounds that build living organisms. Various side chains of amino acids (mers in these biopolymers) enable multiple intra- and intermolecular interactions such as the Coulombic and van der Waals forces and aromatic T-T and ion-mediated salt bridges. Interactions between proteins are combinations of several attractive and repulsive forces between chemical groups of amino acids oriented properly to maximize attractive forces and minimize repulsive ones. Protein interactions often result in a conformational change in the tertiary protein structure, which regulates enzyme activity, opening channels or enabling motor activity. Understanding these interactions and their description measurably and comparably is a continuous aim of biochemistry and molecular biology.
5gui | The reaction dissociation constant is widely used to describe the strength of interactions between biomolecules. In the biochemical convention, as opposed to in physical chemistry, Ka is presented with a unit (usually mole per liter with an appropriate prefix). Typical values of Ka of immunological complexes are usually in the nanomolar or micromolar range. Generally, Ka is determined using surface plasmon reso- nance." But there are also other kinetic-based methods which are applied for Ka determination, like bio-layer interferom- etry," 1,3,4 fluorescence correlation microscopy, thermal shift assay, nuclear magnetic resonance, gel chromatography,8 and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. .9

tzt3 | Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was initially proposed as an alternative to radioimmunosorbent test to examine antigen-antibody interactions.10-12 Later, this technique was developed and applied to the study of varied molecular interactions.In general, ELISA exhibits a low limit of detection, especially in its sandwich-like variant." There are a few variants of ELISA; the simplest are direct, indirect, sandwich, and reverse types. Nevertheless, thanks to a wide range of commercially available antibodies and kits, setting up an ELISA experiment is very flexible nowadays. In a typical ELISA, the signal (target-ligand binding) is amplified only by an enzymatic reaction. However, when M13 phages are used, the signal is amplified twice. Every five pIII-displayed ligands may interact with the target, and the binding of one phage particle via single ligand-target interaction provides about 2000 particles of pVIII protein (per virion) ready to be detected by secondary antibodies. In this way, phages provide about 10 000 fold (4 orders of magnitude) amplification of the signal, enabling detection of such a low phage amount as about

5746 | Indeed, the difference between monovalent binding affinity and multivalent binding avidity is well-known in the literature. However, in the case of phage-ligand complexes, the interactions between phage and ligands were described as 1:1 stoichiometry complexes, while they should be treated as polyvalent receptor-ligand systems, as presented in these studies. Antibodies are not monovalent because IgG and IgA immunoglobulins contain two active sites (antigen-binding sites), whereas IgM contains ten active sites exposed on the pentamer of dimers. Their ability to bind antigens is called avidity as opposed to affinity, which refers to the interactions between one antigen and one antigen-binding site. Omitting polyvalency of the receptor may lead to mistakes in the determination of the dissociation constant.19 The formation of non-covalent immunological (and immunological-like) com- plexes between peptides and proteins may be discussed as a reversible reaction, and a qualitative description could be presented based on chemical equilibrium laws.2021 To the best of our knowledge, the mathematical model presented here is the first which enables the calculation of Ka (affinity) from ELISA under the assumption of phage polyvalency. However, the proposed model does not take into account the variability of the valency of M13 phage particles. The number of pIII protein copies per virion depends on several parameters. Empirically determined pIII number varies between studies according to the applied methodology." V 22 - 25
7toz | As Ka is widely used to express the strength of interaction between proteins, it may be used to describe the strength of target protein binding by phage-derived peptides obtained via phage display. This technique is based on the application of genetically modified bacteriophages (like the Escherichia coli M13 bacteriophage) exposing artificial amino acids sequences on their coat proteins.2 A mixture of various variants of exposed peptides (called a library) may be screened for variants with desired properties like binding to a target protein. Within our studies, we have obtained a specific peptide as a selective receptor for human cardiac troponin T (TnT). We tried to measure the strength of the interaction between phage- exposed peptide and TnT via ELISA. However, we found a gap in the literature devoted to studying the interactions between ligands and polyvalent receptors, especially discussing their mathematical and physicochemical basis. Troponin T (TnT), next to troponin C (TnC) and troponin I (TnI), is part of the troponin complex that plays an essential role in muscle contraction.2 Even though the troponin complex is present in skeletal and cardiac muscle (but not in smooth muscle), cardiac isoforms of TnT and TnI are tissue-specific and may be distinguished from their skeletal isoforms. These two troponins are released into the bloodstream from myocytes for several reasons, e.g., after long-lasting ischemia of the muscle region.2 Increased concentration of cardiac troponins is one of the fundaments of the fourth universal definition of myocardial infarction approved by several renowned cardiol- ogist associations.29 Therefore, recognizing cardiac markers (TnT or TnI) in a highly efficient and selective manner is important for diagnosing myocardial infarction. Determination of Ka of isolated peptides enables a qualitative description of their affinity against TnT and, thus, the possibility of application in sensing devices.

v8uq | This paper proposes a mathematical model of interactions occurring during ELISA between a ligand (troponin T) and a non-monovalent receptor (M13 bacteriophage particle expos- ing TnT-specific peptides). The provided equations enable the calculation of the dissociation constant from ELISA experi- ments with the critical impact of polyvalency of a phage, which was not discussed in any publications previously. The applied method may also cover other systems where monovalent molecules interact with multiple active sites of receptor-like natural antibodies. In addition, the interaction between phage- displayed peptides and TnT molecules was discussed according to their chemical structures.

cwrw | Mathematical Model. The reaction between TnT and phage-displayed peptide may be treated as a reversible non- covalent complex formation. 20,21,30 According to the induced fitting model, the interaction between the ligand and its binding site on the protein surface requires energy to deform structures and fit them in proper orientation and distance.20 However, if the interaction is strong enough, the energy released during the process of complex formation is higher than the energy required for complex dissociation. The reaction scheme of a reversible complex formation may be written as eq 1.

h2l3 | According to the mass action law, increasing ligand concentration causes a rise in receptor saturation. In the case of a monovalent receptor (complex stoichiometry 1:1), the reaction of receptor saturation shown in eq 1 is sufficient, while polyvalency of the receptor imposes the existence of multiple stages. In order to represent the saturation of n-valent receptor n, equations have to be written as eq 2, where i refers to subsequent numbers from 1 to n. The exact formulas for each stage are given in the Supporting Information (eqs S1-S5).

awvu | In an equilibrium state, formation and dissociation reactions occur at the same rate. Therefore, concentrations of particular reagents remain constant. The ratio of products and substrates concentrations (as approximations of activities) is constant under defined conditions (pH, ion strength, temperature) and is called a reaction constant. For the reaction depicted in eq 1, the reaction constant may be written as eq 3 where Ka refers to the dissociation constant.

xmgs | According to the geometry of phage particle pIII end, if all peptides are properly synthesized and exposed, they should not affect each other. Currently, there is no evidence that any allosteric effect might be present between peptides. Therefore, each stage dissociation constant equals Ka of the isolated TnT- peptide complex defined in eq 3. Moreover, the cumulative dissociation constant of particular stage saturation may be

pxbq | After the assumption of varying saturation levels and complex stoichiometry, each complex concentration may be expressed by total phage concentration (c 13) and TnT- dependent saturation fractions. This equation is explained in the Supporting Information (eq S21 was obtained after combining S15, S17, and S19). In the case of the monovalent receptor, also presented by Friguet,21 eq 5 may be written as eq 6.

lq35 | ELISA is a widely applied technique in biochemistry that enables the determination of biomolecule concentration.11 ELISA may be used to determine M13 phage concentration using TnT-coated wells and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)- conjugated anti-M13 antibodies.16-18,21 The signal is gen- erated proportionally to the number of phages bound to surface-immobilized TnT. The presence of soluble TnT causes competition between this form and the surface-immobilized form, which leads to a signal decrease. If the signal measured with a predefined concentration of soluble TnT is called a and the signal of the same concentration of phages in the absence of TnT is a0, the fraction of occupied active sites (saturation) may be found (eq 7).

ex5k | An explanation of the derivation of Âª ratios is presented in the Supporting Information (eqs S24-S27). Equation 7 is derived in the Supporting Information as eq S29. This approach (first proposed by Friguet21) enables the comparison of a signal from total phage active sites and partially saturated phages. The ratio 4 (eq 7) refers to the ratio of the signal recorded for partially occupied phage's active sites in a mixture of TnT and phage (a) and the signal recorded in the absence of soluble TnT (a0) which may be interpreted as a signal from all active sites. Experimental determination of the Âª ratio is a0 necessary to calculate the [TnT] Ka ratio, which is crucial for further analysis.
