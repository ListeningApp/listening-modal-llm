You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

3rqe | All three kinds of look are predominantly masculine or associated with the male. Females are objectified by cinema as the object of desire. The audience identify with the male hero/protagonist's desire for the female (voyeuristically). In a world ordered by sexual imbalance, says Mulvey, pleasure in looking has been ordered along an active/male and passive/female divide. Women are simultaneously looked at and displayed. In an echo of Berger, Mulvey says that woman displayed as sexual object is the leitmotif of erotic spectacle, such that her very appearance is code for 'to-be-looked-at-ness'. The female as spectacle both plays to and constitutes male desire. Traditionally, the woman displayed has functioned as both erotic object for the characters within the film and as an erotic object for the spectator in the cinema.
nsi3 | But voyeurism is not the only pleasure that cinema offers. Cinematic stimulation also produces narcissistic pleasures - the spectator identifies with the object seen. The term 'narcissism' comes from Greek mythology. Narcissus was a beautiful youth who fell in love with his own image reflected in a pool. He pined away, rooting himself to the spot, becoming the flower that bears his name. The film spectator can likewise become enthralled by a fantasy of his own omnipotence, attractiveness and/or prowess. Much of the pleasure of cinema revolves around the vicarious pleasure of living 'through' our heroes, whilst remaining oblivious to the realities of our real lives. Both voyeurism and narcissism pursue indifference to perceptual reality, creating the fantasised, eroticised concept of the world that assuages the neurotic needs of the male ego while rejecting empirical objectivity.
nil3 | Females function within the classic film narrative as passive objects of the action. Just as pleasure in looking has been ordered along an active/male and passive/ female divide, so too has the narrative structure been divided into active/male and passive/female roles. The man's role is the active one of forwarding the story, making things happen. The man emerges in cinematic narrative as the representative of power. The story is typically structured around a main controlling figure with whom the spectator can identify.
68a1 | 'What counts is what the heroine provokes, or rather what she represents. She is the one, or rather the love or fear she inspires in the hero, or else the concern he feels for her, who makes him act the way he does. In herself the woman has not the slightest importance.' (Budd Boetticher in Mulvey 1975: 3)
seik | STUDYING FEMINIST FILM THEORY
oq7c | The spectator identifies with the main male protagonist, his screen surrogate, giving him a satisfying sense of omnipotence.
z4mi | Viewers identify with the male's active resolution of the narrative (narcissistically). Women are seldom essential to the plot or represented as capable of resolving the narrative conflicts unaided. Traditionally there are few instances of female characters actively driving the narrative and thus competing for the audience's narcissistic identification. The result is that the male view is the only perspective from which the narcissistic pleasure of narrative can be derived. Female audiences experience phallocentric pleasure. Women have to psychologically 'cross dress' when they go to the cinema.
hkft | Linda Williams (in Turner 1988: 118) has argued that many films do represent females as powerful, only to then punish them for making use of their power. Her examples are Psycho (1960) and Dressed to Kill (1980), but Thelma & Louise (1991) also conforms to this rule. Kill Bill: Vol. 1 (2003) and Vol. 2 (2004) exhibit extreme sadism towards the powerful female protagonist (as well as other powerful female characters), despite the fact that the female protagonist does eventually triumph over her male lover/rival. What is interesting here is the excessively high price she must pay in suffering to accomplish her victory. At one point she literally has to dig herself out of a grave, having been buried alive. But this is only one of the many unspeakable horrors inflicted on her body throughout the course of her ordeal. The message this sends to viewers, who narcissistically identify with the heroine, is that fighting against a man, if you are a woman, is a masochistic endeavour. In Thelma & Louise it is a fatal one.
jai3 | Mulvey herself has acknowledged that the representation of women is far more complex than she had recognised in her early theory. Melodrama is one genre in which she says women do have key roles as subjects rather than objects. Mulvey may be correct, but, as Warren Buckland writes, 'melodrama can be said to turn its female character into a victim' (1998: 81). One problem with Mulvey's theory is that it draws on Freudian psychoanalysis, which does seem to presuppose some sort of essentialist model of gender. This suggests that a male gaze is inherent in male nature, rather than in the institutional power that men exert in having dominated the representational media. If this were the case then women, even with institutional power, would probably not represent men in similar ways. But the case studies we will examine in this book suggest that it is possible for both male and female directors to 'reverse' the allegedly 'male' look. What this suggests, of course, is that the use of a particular form of power (via the 'look') has less to do with the sex of the director than with the power of the director to represent the world according to his or her fantasies and desires, and these are not necessarily intrinsic in nature. They are just as likely to be products of upbringing and culture.

u5ug | Conclusion
i9k5 | Neither of the above theoretical approaches can function as a thoroughgoing explanation of gender representation in art or cinema. In today's global film industry, new theoretical models might emerge that are better suited to aid our understanding of how gender representations work within and upon social and economic power relations. From today's perspective, we could probably find a handful of exceptions to the patriarchal modes of representation described above. Berger and Mulvey may seem a bit dated, but many of their insights still resonate with readers, and can be found and studied in the products of past eras, if not in our own. These are, of course, only theories, and summarised ones at that. But we will look in the following chapters at some of the ways in which the male gaze/male look and the power of patriarchal narratives have influenced cinema then and now.
20z2 | Chapter Summary
4cgs | · This book does not assume that a decontextualised evaluation of cinema is an adequate one. Sex is here examined not just as biological fact, but as a public concept, or set of ideas, about men, women, biology, the 'natural', the 'normal', the 'perverse', etc.
htre | . Since films are human artifacts, film-makers cannot avoid relating their works to the social, political, historical and visual culture in which they are situated. Traditions, popular forms, trends and styles develop through the imitation and repetition of certain elements. These common modes of representation become conventional or generic.
