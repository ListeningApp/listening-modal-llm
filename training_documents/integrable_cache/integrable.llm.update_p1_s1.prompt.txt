You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).

Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021.

otkr | Too Close to Integrable: Crossover from Normal to Anomalous Heat Diffusion
ibgs | Energy transport in one-dimensional chains of particles with three conservation laws is generically anomalous and belongs to the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang dynamical universality class. Surprisingly, some examples where an apparent normal heat diffusion is found over a large range of length scales were reported. We propose a novel physical explanation of these intriguing observations. We develop a scaling analysis which explains how this may happen in the vicinity of an integrable limit, such as, but not only, the famous Toda model. In this limit, heat transport is mostly supplied by quasi-particles with a very large mean free path l. Upon increasing the system size L, three different regimes can be observed: a ballistic one, an intermediate diffusive range, and, eventually, the crossover to the anomalous (hydrodynamic) regime. Our theoretical considerations are supported by numerical simulations of a gas of diatomic hard-point particles for almost equal masses and of a weakly perturbed Toda chain. Finally, we discuss the case of the perturbed harmonic chain, which exhibits a yet different scenario.
colo | After more than twenty years of theoretical research there is a general consensus that energy transport in one and two-dimensional systems is anomalous, meaning that Fourier's law is invalid [1-3]. Numerics [4-6] as well as hy- drodynamic [7, 8] and kinetic [9-11] theories consistently indicate that the nonlinear interactions of fluctuations of conserved quantities yield, in reduced space-dimension, non standard relaxation and transport properties, even in the linear response regime. The main signature of the anomaly is the divergence of the thermal conduc- tivity k with the system size L, i.e. a superdiffusive heat transport. In one-dimension, although this is a gen- uine many-body problem, it can be described effectively as an ensemble of Lévy particles, namely random walk- ers performing free ballistic steps with finite velocity for times that are power-law distributed [12]. This descrip- tion accounts quantitatively for several non-equilibrium properties, both transient and stationary [6, 13-15]. Re- markably, the phenomenon was shown to belong to the class of the famous Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation [16, 17], suggesting a universal behavior with implications for the theory of transport in nano-sized objects like in- dividual nanowires [18], nanotubes [19] or polymers [20]. In this general context, nanowires and single-walled nan- otubes have been analyzed to look for deviations from the standard Fourier's law [19]. Experimental evidence of such deviations has been reported for single-walled car- bon nanotubes [19, 21] (see also Ref. [22]). Non-trivial length dependence of thermal conductance has been also observed in molecular chains [23]. Transport anomalies can be even exploited to achieve optimal efficiency of thermal to electric energy conversion [24, 25].
d6r4 | Although the general framework is pretty well under- stood, there are still open issues that escaped so far a convincing explanation. For definiteness, we focus on anharmonic chains, represented by a Hamiltonian of the form
9mrz | H :
pk06 | n + U (qn+1 -qn)| , (1)
7wn9 | where mn, qn and pn are respectively the mass, dis- placement and momentum of the nth particle. For a generic potential U, this family of models should show superdiffusive heat transport in the KPZ universality class, as confirmed by several studies [26, 27]. How- ever, there is evidence of significant deviations of the dy- namical exponents in some models with hard-core poten- tial [28]. Moreover, chains allowing for bond dissociation (like e.g Lennard-Jones, Morse, and Coulomb potentials) unexpectedly display finite thermal conductivity [29, 30], while other similar potentials closely follow the prediction of anomalous scaling [31]. For the double-well poten- tial, an intermediate-energy regime with almost diffusive transport has been reported [32, 33].
wcd0 | Another, more surprising feature is the (apparent) normal diffusive heat transport observed at low ener- gies in asymmetric potentials [34] like the Fermi-Pasta- Ulam-Tsingou-aß (FPUT) chain, where mn = m and Uaß(y) = y2/2 + ay3/3 + By4/4. Yet, more compelling evidence of a seemingly normal transport has been found in a Toda lattice under the action of an additional con- servative noise [35] and in the diatomic Hard Point Gas (HPG) [36]. In the first context, successive studies
caos | demonstrated that the diffusive regime is a finite-size ef- fect, whereby anomalous behavior is recovered for <LATEX>L</LATEX> large enough [37, 38] (see also the discussion based on mode- coupling arguments in Ref. [39]).
qrvy | In this Letter we present a general explanation of the counter-intuitive normal transport, by tracing it back to the vicinity to an integrable limit. In this context, the kinetics is dominated by quasi-particles (those associated to the integrals of motion of the integrable regime, e.g., solitons) over a broad range of scales. In fact, this range extends beyond the very large quasi-particle mean free path, where a purely ballistic behavior is expected. More specifically, we proceed by first devising a finite-size scal- ing approach and then validating the theoretical argu- ments with the numerical analysis of a few test models.
pn9j | Let the parameter <LATEX>\varepsilon</LATEX> denote the distance from the in- tegrable limit <LATEX>\left( \varepsilon = 0 \right.</LATEX> corresponding to the perfectly in- tegrable regime). Building upon the intuition contained in Ref. [40], we propose that for small &, the heat flux <LATEX>J \left( L , \varepsilon \right)</LATEX> can be written as the sum of two terms,
1pmc | <LATEX>J \left( L , \varepsilon \right) = J _ { N } \left( L , \varepsilon \right) + J _ { A } \left( L , \varepsilon \right) .</LATEX> (2)

U _ { \beta } \left( y \right) = y ^ { 2 } / 2 + y ^ { 4 } / 4 \right)</LATEX> and models subject to conservative noise (e.g., the noisy harmonic [40, 41] or nonlinear [35, 42] chains). <LATEX>J _ { N }</LATEX> is a kinetic contribution, accounting for the energy transported by weakly inter- acting quasi-particles.
