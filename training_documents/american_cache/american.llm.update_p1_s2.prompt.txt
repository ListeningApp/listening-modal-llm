You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

xxr8 | chapter three MAPS, SPELLERS, AND THE SEMIOTICS OF NATIONALISM IN THE EARLY REPUBLIC
rl4j | After the Revolutionary war, it was a bitter irony for Anglo-Americans, eager to sever all representational ties with the for- mer imperial power, that their discussions about Independence and self- government were by necessity conducted in the very language of the for- mer oppressor. While some of the founders debated whether Hebrew or German should become the Republic's first language, diplomats at the Paris peace conference found it easy to imagine a future in which "the thirteen United States wou'd form the greatest Empire in the World" but also anticipated that such an American empire "from a similarity of Lan- guage, Manners and Religion . . . woul'd be English." The new American citizens also recognized English as the dominant language and lingua franca connecting the larger community of polyglot peoples living within the new national borders. However, the linguistic proximity to imperial England and its legacy of institutions, political practices, and concepts of national culture raised the question whether English, or for that matter any language, was truly capable of representing the new Republic and the meaning of independent citizenship.1
vz32 | If we turn to the political arena during the first decade after Indepen- dence, Federalists and Antifederalists alike frequently expressed concern about how their reliance on the medium of language obstructed the defi- nition of government. The Federalist James Madison questioned the effi- cacy of the spoken and written word for negotiating federal and state interests. Discussing the "arduous . .. task of marking the proper line of partition between the authority of the general and that of the State govern-
ncb0 | ments," he despairs that the use of "words" and "language" fails to convey "complex objects" (such as the idea of a federal union) via "human fac- ulties" to a self-interested people. He writes in Federalist No. 37:
8mp0 | The medium through which the conceptions of men are conveyed to each other adds a fresh embarrassment. The use of words is to express ideas. Perspicuity, therefore, requires not only that the ideas should be distinctly formed, but that they should be expressed by words distinctly and exclusively appropriate to them. But no language is so copious as to supply words and phrases for every complex idea, or so correct as not to include many equivocally denoting different ideas.
xjyk | Antifederalists seemingly shared Madison's sense of a linguistic crisis. "And where is the man," asked the voice of Denatus in the Virginia Inde- pendent Chronicle, "who can see through the constitution to its effects? The constitution of a wise and free people, ought to be as evident to simple reason, as the letters of our alphabet."2
mt0f | Self-consciously inhabiting a logocentric world that revolved around the English language and its alphabetic writing code, both sides were flustered by the fact that the Constitution as a verbal construct lacked transparency and immediate recognition. For Madison, the new Repub- lic's constitutional process was inherently threatened because its founda- tional document was "rendered dim and doubtful by the cloudy medium through which it is communicated." Similarly, those who opposed the idea of federal union feared that the Constitution's "dim" words ("Who can see through the constitution?") would become precisely the tool by which a central government would obfuscate the practices of power.3
awab | For the union to work at all, both the Federalist and Antifederalist voices asserted that the Constitution would have to display its meaning as did the spelling book or picture primer, the most basic of literacy tools. For its meaning to be evident to simple reason, the Antifederalists pro-
ixcc | posed the symbolic order of the letter alphabet. If we consider the Federal- ists' invocation of visual perception in relation to the medium of the word, their implied solution to ambiguous language invoked the picture peda- gogy of the eighteenth-century alphabet lesson. For Federalist and Anti- federalist alike, then, in the ideal world of post-Revolutionary communi- cation the Constitution would operate like a picture primer, displaying its subject matter like an alphabet lesson in which words become meaning- ful through the visual representation of objects. Such a pictorial language would disperse the fear of linguistic opacity and make the Constitution "evident to simple reason," that is, accessible at once to the literate and illiterate American. To expand on the idea of a constitutional primer even further, the two political factions hoped to discover in the Constitution a language teaching a lesson similar to that of the alphabet primer: instead of reading "A stands for apple," ideally the Constitution would convey the meaning of a "free and wise people" so that "A stands for American."
8p6h | The perceived linguistic crisis was resolved at least temporarily by the framers' shared culture of geographical literacy. When the time came to ratify the nation's founding document, the signers of the Constitution ceremoniously bypassed both the alphabet and the vexing ambiguity underlying the English language. As Robert A. Ferguson has pointed out: "The signers of the Constitution appear neither in alphabetical order, nor by presumed importance or seniority, nor in haphazard fashion. They are grouped, instead, by state with the states themselves appearing in geo- graphical order from north to south, starting with New Hampshire in the north and working in sequence through Georgia in the extreme south." "The United States thus appear," he continues, "on the page in familiar map form-the perfect icon in answer to Madison's fears about indistinct objects, imperfect perception, and faulty language." Neither the alpha- betically constructed word nor the collaboratively composed text of the Constitution, but the implied form of the national map thus capped at once the political debate over the Republic's new Constitution and the pervasive sense of language crisis that emerged from this debate.4
pmgl | The national map had become so integral to the early national linguis- tic consciousness that even the country's fundamental documents were innately structured by the diction and grammar of the national map.
90no | Thus, early on, the map entered into the national linguistic reform move- ment, and the textuality of the national map informed primers and ele- mentary lessons in print literacy in the early Republic. Many Americans self-consciously turned to the material form and rhetoric of the national map in order to negotiate and reconcile the competing interests laid bare by the Federalist crisis. Through geographical literacy, the new citizens adopted the national map as a proleptic text that enabled American politi- cians to ratify the Constitution and became a popular language by which ordinary citizens learned to imagine the contested idea of national unity.5
jt0y | Prompted by the Revolutionary momentum, educational, linguistic, and political theorists did their best to redesign the English language. Sev- eral authors sought to revise the most basic element of language, the alphabet. Devising a national alphabet, James Ewing and Abner Kneeland expanded the number of letters from twenty-six to thirty-three; in an effort to provide a proper transcript of American speech habits they designed new symbols that represented these distinctive sounds. Thomas Embree went so far as to substitute syllabic letter combinations with numbers, such as "2 aw, 3 ah, . . . 8 ezhay, 9 eng." At their extreme, linguistic reform efforts went beyond the building of lexicons, pronunciation, and orthog- raphy; William Thornton suggested the gradual revision of the alphabetic code itself. Making his case for a whole new script, he exhorted the Ameri- can audience, "You have corrected the dangerous doctrines of European powers, correct now the languages you have imported," which he then transcribed into print type as "Iu hav korektid 1 deendjra doktrinz ov Iuropiian pourz."6
