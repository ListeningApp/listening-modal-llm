Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document

  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

jc47 | In contrast to the pro-tumorigenic role of many GPCRs, GPCR-driven signalling has in some cases, been shown to play a tumor suppressive role, highlighting the complexity and the cell- context dependency of these signalling events. This is highly aligned with tumor suppressive roles for heterotrimeric G proteins in certain contexts as well. For example, inactivation of Ga13 signalling, either by inactivating mutations in the Ga13-coupled Sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 2 (S1PR2), or in Ga13 itself have both been identified to enhance tumor progression in diffuse large B cell lymphoma90. Moreover, the Kisspeptin receptor (KISS1R) has been widely

xek3 | implicated as a metastatic suppressor in numerous cancer types91,92. Similarly, GPR68 was first found to be a metastatic suppressor in prostate cancer and was found to be significantly downregulated in metastatic tumors; however, further work has shown that GPR68 is highly upregulated in pancreatic cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and represents an emerging drug target in this cancer type93-95 (Figure 1). In another case, targeting of dopamine receptors in cancer has been shown to have highly tumor-type specific effects, where both activation and antagonism have been found to have anti-tumor effects96. However, in the particular case of glioblastoma, targeting of the dopamine receptor DRD2 has shown to be a highly promising drug target, with the compound ONC201 being investigated in clinical trials96,97. Finally, ADGRB1-3, also known as the BAI family GPCRs, are silenced or mutated in numerous cancer types98 (Figure 1). See below (GPCRs and Genome Instability) for more details on the effect of BAI1 loss on genomic instability.
bbpr | Mutations in heterotrimeric G Proteins in Cancer
5zyf | The unanticipatedly high frequency of mutations in GPCRs coupled with their complex expression and mutation patterns in different cancer types highlight the previously underappreciated role of GPCR signalling in cancer. Detailed work on the functional impact of GPCRs in cancer, exploiting novel computational biology pipelines, structure-function predictions, and functional analyses of the impact of cancer-associated mutations in GPCRs will contribute to establishing GPCRs as cancer-specific drivers. In contrast, the presence of hotspot mutations in heterotrimeric G proteins defines them as driver oncogenes in specific cancer types. Here we will summarize the role of heterotrimeric G proteins in cancer and as cancer drivers.

bqfb | Signalling through Gaq G proteins- The GNAQ oncogenes
wwdt | The Gaq family of heterotrimeric subunits, encoded by GNAQ, GNA11, GNA14 and GNA15, and their coupled receptors, are responsible for transducing many of the mitogenic signals initiated by growth factors acting on GPCRs4,99. Members of the Gaq family activate phospholipase-CB (PLCB1-4), which cleaves PIP2 into diacyglycerol and inositol 1,4,5 triphosphate. Generation of these second messengers triggers the mobilization of cytosolic calcium and all together, elicit the activation of numerous downstream signalling events via regulated kinases and transcriptional networks8-11. Mutation of the Gaq subunit into a GTPase defective, constitutively active conformation was originally modelled based on previous studies examining mutations in the ras oncogene100. These Gaq mutants induced malignant transformation in NIH3T3 cells and were found to be tumorigenic in nude mice 100.

5vqw | Since this original discovery, aberrant Gaq activity has been found to be involved in diverse pathological conditions including congenital hemangiomas, leptomeningeal melanocytic lesions, Sturge Weber syndrome, and recent cancer sequencing efforts revealed that GNAQ and GNA11 are significantly mutated in uveal melanomas (UM) (MutSig2CV q-values = 6.08E-13) (Table S3). More specifically, activating mutations in Gaq or Ga11, predominantly at Q209, are collectively found in >90% of UM where they act as driver oncogenes101-105 (Table 1, Table S3, Table S4, Table S5). The Gaq family is also mutated in roughly 10% of skin cutaneous melanomas (Table 1, Table S5). UM is the primary cancer of the eye in adults, affecting roughly 2500 patients in the US each year106. Nearly 5% of UM patients who lack mutation in Gaq or Ga11, possess mutually exclusive activating mutations in other levels of the Gaq pathway, including in CYSLTR2, a Gaq- coupled GPCR (MutSig2CV q-value = 0.005), or PLCB4, a downstream effector of Gaq, firmly establishing hyper-activation of the Gaq-pathway as the oncogenic driver of UM107,108 (Table S3). UM caused by mutation and hyperactivation of CYSLTR2 remains one of the most striking examples of a GPCR-driven cancer type to date109 (Figure 1).
meyw | Studies investigating the mechanisms by which aberrant Gaq signalling drives tumorigenesis have revealed that compared to the transient stimulation of second messengers and mitogenic kinases after canonical Gaq stimulation, mutant Gaq requires a protein-protein interaction with the Rho-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) TRIO in order to sustain persistent signalling110. In in vivo UM models, knockdown of TRIO phenocopies reduction of Gaq expression based on cell proliferation assays, tumorigenic potential as well as activation of JNK, p38 and AP-1-mediated transcription110. Remarkably, this signalling circuitry was independent of PLCß, the best-known target of Gaq and led to the activation of YAP, a transcriptional co- activator regulated by the Hippo pathway. The Hippo pathway is a tumor suppressive pathway, broadly involved in cell proliferation and organ size control, and has been found to be frequently altered in cancer111. In UM, YAP activity was demonstrated to be necessary for tumor growth and proliferation112,113. Recently studies have shown that Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK), is a central mediator of the Gaq-driven oncogenic signalling circuitry by controlling the activation of YAP, thereby representing a potential therapeutic target for patients with UM114.

75y3 | Mutations in Gaq/11 at residue R183, the second most commonly mutated site in GNAQ have been found to cause Sturge-Weber Syndrome, a neurocutaneous disorder characterized by facial port-wine stains and ipsilateral occipital leptomeningeal angiomas, and are also sometimes found in UM patients104 (Figure 2A,B). Similar to Q209, R183 is located in the GTP-binding region of

cb7r | Gaq, whereby mutation interferes with the intrinsic GTPase activity and increases signalling activity; however, mutations at R183 have been found to be less potently activating than Q209 mutants104. Activating Gaq mutants have also been associated with congenital hemangiomas, and frequently found in a subset of other melanocytic neoplasms, including blue nevi, nevi of Ota, and primary melanocytic tumors of the central nervous system 103,105

hd35 | Gaq has also been found to play diverse roles in the immune system, where Gaq has been implicated to have a tumor suppressive role. Loss of GNAQ expression enhances both B and T cell proliferation in vivo and survival in vitro115-117. Strikingly, alteration of the Gaq pathway by loss of Gaq expression or recurrent loss of function (LOF) mutations at T96S or Y101, are found in roughly 25% of natural killer/T cell lymphoma (NKTCL), a malignant and highly aggressive subtype of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma118. Consistent with the impact of Gaq loss in other immune cells, NK-specific knockout of Gaq in mice imparted an intrinsic survival advantage of NK cells as compared to wild type NK cells. Moreover, expression of WT Gaq in Gaq-low NK cell lines promoted apoptosis, which could be ablated by concomitant expression of T96S Gaq suggesting T96S Gaq acts as a dominant negative mutant to promote NK cell tumorigenicity118. The proclivity of R183 and Q209 hotspot mutations in Gaq to solid tumors compared to the incidence of T96 and Y101 in hematopoietic malignancies suggests a complex relationship between the oncogenic or tumor suppressive function of these mutations and the cell context in which they originate, highlighting the complex molecular events underlying Gaq-driven oncogenic signalling.
2zpk | Signalling through Gas in cancer- The GNAS oncogene
epu7 | GNAS, encoding the Gas protein, is among the most frequently mutated G proteins in human cancer52. Mutation characterization across tumor types has revealed that GNAS is mutated in ~5% of sequenced tumors, enriched in appendix cancers (70%), pituitary tumors (27%)39. Across TCGA, GNAS is most frequently mutated in endometrial carcinomas (7.3%), stomach adenocarcinomas (5.7%), adrenocortical carcinomas (5.5%), pancreatic adenocarcinomas (5.6%), esophageal carcinomas (4.9%) and colorectal cancers (4.7%) (Table S4). The majority of Gas mutations occur at a hotspot residue (R201), resulting in expression of a constitutively active, GTPase defective form of the Gas protein119. A secondary hotspot can be found at Q227 but is less prevalent than R201 mutants (Figure 2C). The functional significance of the R201 residue was first suggested from studies examining the mechanism of action of cholera toxin. It was revealed that cholera toxin ADP-ribosylates R201 of Gas, irreversibly inhibiting its GTPase

b780 | activity, and resulting in its activation120-122. Crystallographic studies of Gas have since confirmed that the R201 residue lies in its GTP-binding pocket and facilitates GTP hydrolysis 123.
ccmb | Activation of Gas, either by stimulation of Gas-coupled GPCRs or by activating mutations, stimulates adenylyl cyclases, which leads to the production of cAMP and activation of protein kinase A (PKA) and subsequent signalling events39,124. The tumorigenic effects of Gas were first demonstrated in a subset of growth hormone-secreting pituitary tumors harbouring R201C/H mutations39,125,126. In these tumors, persistent signalling driven by mutant Gas bypassed the canonical requirement for stimulation by growth hormone, resulting in hormone-insensitive growth119. Indeed, the Gas subfamily (GNAS and GNAL) is mutated in nearly 7% of adrenocortical carcinomas in TCGA (Table 1, Table S5). Activation of the Gas pathway has been shown to cause numerous other syndromes with involvement of endocrine dysfunction including McCune-Albright syndrome, which is also characterized by fibrous dysplasia of the bone, in addition to Cushing's syndrome, Carney complex, and micronodular adrenocortical hyperplasia 127-129
ma93 | Strikingly, our recent study found that there is widespread activation of the Gas pathway across a large proportion of cancer types in TCGA with a remarkable enrichment in cancers of the gastrointestinal tract47. Consistent with this, the Gas subfamily is mutated in 5.24% of colorectal, 5.03% of pancreatic and 5.96% of stomach adenocarcinomas (Table 1, Table S5). Indeed, both GNAS and GNAL are significantly mutated in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (MutSig2CV q-values = 9.56E-04, and 1.77E-02 respectively) (Table S3). Remarkably, greater than 50% of colorectal cancer patients have aberrant activation of the Gs pathway, including activating mutation or gene amplification of GNAS, or in downstream effectors of Gas including PKA, and adenylyl cyclases, as well as by the activation of prostaglandin E2 receptors (PTGER2, 4), which are coupled to Gs, by inflammatory prostaglandins accumulating locally due to COX2 overexpression (described below)130-132. These genetic alterations and autocrine activation play a central role in the deregulation and activation of the PKA, Wnt and MAPK pathways in the intestinal epithelium and are likely to contribute to tumorigenesis and colorectal cancer progression133-135 (Figure 1).
c6hh | Interestingly, many Gas mutant cancers have been found to be highly mucinous. Aligned with this, GNAS expression has been found to induce expression of mucin genes136. In particular, GNAS mutations are highly prevalent in gastrointestinal mucinous neoplasms, including intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms, an invasive pancreatic cystic neoplasm that can

e8nr | Gas, and Gas-driven signalling also plays a critical role in stem cell populations, where it has been found to suppress self-renewal. In contrast to the pro-oncogenic effects of GOF mutations in Gas, in some stem-like cell states, Gas has a tumor suppressive role where LOF mutations, or Gas deletion has been found to drive tumor initiation and progression by de-repression of the Sonic Hedgehog and Hippo pathways142,143. In particular, the loss of GNAS, or low Gas expression is tightly linked to poor overall survival in a subset of aggressive medulloblastomas (MBs) with alterations and activation of SHH signalling, and in neuroblastoma144. Strikingly, deletion of GNAS in neural stem/progenitor cells consistently leads to MB-like tumors in mice by derepressing SHH signalling thus contributing to the development and malignancy of SHH- associated MB tumors144. In epidermal and hair follicle progenitor cell populations, conditional deletion of Gas leads to rapid formation of BCC by repressing PKA-mediated inhibition of SHH and YAP signalling78. Of note, activation of Gas in epithelial stem cells leads to exhaustion of hair follicle stem cells and subsequent hair loss, demonstrating the cell-context specific impact of Gas signalling78.
