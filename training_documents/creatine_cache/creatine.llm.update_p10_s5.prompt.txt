You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

l6t9 | There is a small body of research that has investigated the effects of creatine supplementation in younger fe- males. For example, Vandenberghe et al. [176] showed that creatine supplementation (20 g/day for 4 days followed by 5 g/day thereafter) during 10 weeks of resist- ance training significantly increased intramuscular con- centrations, muscle mass and strength compared to placebo in females (19-22 yrs). In elite female soccer players <LATEX>\left( 2 2 \pm 5 \mathrm { y r s } \right) ,</LATEX> creatine supplementation (20 g/day for 6 days) improved sprint and agility performance compared to placebo [177]. Hamilton et al. [178] showed that creatine supplementation (25 g for 7 days) aug- mented upper-body exercise capacity in strength-trained females (21-33 yrs) compared to placebo (19-29 yrs). Furthermore, in college-aged females (20 yrs), creatine supplementation (0.5 <LATEX>\mathrm { g / k } \xi</LATEX> of fat-free mass for 5 days) improved knee extension muscle performance compared to placebo [179]. In contrast, not all data show improved performance in females [89, 160, 161]. Additionally, Smith-Ryan et al. [180] reported no significant effects of creatine loading on neuromuscular properties of fatigue in young adult females. It is important to evaluate the benefit to risk ratio; as noted elsewhere in this docu- ment, there are minimal risks associated with creatine supplementation, particularly when it is evaluated against the potential benefits in females.
1ujy | Accumulating research over the past decade in post- menopausal females demonstrates that creatine supple- mentation during a resistance training program can improve muscle mass, upper- and lower-body strength, and tasks of functionality (30-s chair stand, lying prone- to-stand test, arm curl test) (for detailed review see Candow et al. [9]). Creatine supplementation appears to be a viable option for post-menopausal females to im- prove muscle quality and performance. In addition to its beneficial effects on aging muscle, creatine supplementa- tion may also have favorable effects on bone in postmen- opausal females, if combined with resistance training. For example, postmenopausal females who supple- mented daily with 0.1 g/kg/day of creatine during 52- weeks of supervised whole-body resistance training experienced an attenuation in the rate of bone mineral loss at the femoral neck (hip), compared to females on placebo during training [122]. Furthermore, 5 g/day of creatine supplementation during 12 weeks of resistance training in postmenopausal females resulted in a signifi- cant increase in muscle mass and upper- and lower- body strength, compared to placebo [181]. However, even without the stimulus of resistance training, there is some evidence that creatine supplementation can still be beneficial. For example, in aging females <LATEX>\left( n = 1 0 ; \right.</LATEX> 67 ± 6 yrs), acute creatine supplementation (0.3 g/kg/day
qzor | for 7 days) significantly improved lower-extremity physical performance (sit-to-stand test) [110], and fat- free mass and upper- and lower-body strength com- pared to placebo [86].
a0by | In summary, there is accumulating evidence that creatine supplementation has the potential to be a multifactorial therapeutic intervention across the lifespan in females, with little to no side effects.
u1ky | Are other forms of creatine similar or superior to monohydrate and is creatine stable in solutions/ beverages?
htm9 | Creatine monohydrate powder has been the most exten- sively studied and commonly used form of creatine in dietary supplements since the early 1990s [2, 125]. Cre- atine monohydrate was used in early studies to assess bioavailability, determine proper dosages, and assess the impact of oral ingestion of creatine on blood creatine and intramuscular creatine stores [35, 60, 182]. These studies indicated that orally ingested creatine monohy- drate (e.g., 3-5 g/day) increases blood concentrations of creatine for 3-4 hours after ingestion thereby facilitating the uptake of creatine into tissue through diffusion and creatine transporters [1, 183, 184]. Additionally, it is well established that ~99% of orally ingested creatine mono- hydrate is either taken up by tissue or excreted in the urine as creatine through normal digestion [60, 185, 186]. Short-term loading with creatine monohydrate (e.g., consuming 5 g, 4 times daily for 5-7 days) has been reported to increase intramuscular creatine stores by 20-40% and exercise performance capacity by 5-10% [2, 125]. Creatine monohydrate supplementation during training (e.g., 5-25 g/day for 4-12 weeks) has been re- ported to promoted gains in muscle mass, strength, and exercise capacity [2, 125]. Despite the known efficacy, safety, and low cost of creatine monohydrate; a number of different forms of creatine have been marketed as more effective with fewer anecdotally reported adverse effects [187]. These marketing efforts have fueled specu- lation that creatine monohydrate is not the most effect- ive or safest form of creatine to consume. This notion is clearly refuted by understanding the well-known physio- chemical properties of creatine monohydrate, as well as current creatine supplementation literature.
8hul | A number of different forms of creatine (e.g., creatine salts, creatine complexed with other nutrients, creatine dipeptides, etc.) have been marketed as more effective sources of creatine than creatine monohydrate [187]. However, there are no peer-reviewed published papers showing that the ingestion of equal amounts of creatine salts [188-191] or other forms of creatine like efferves- cent creatine [128], creatine ethyl ester [43, 192, 193],
87vz | Antonio et al. Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition
ym66 | buffered creatine [41], creatine nitrate [194, 195], creatine dipeptides, or the micro amounts of creatine contained in creatine serum [196] and beverages (e.g., 25-50 mg) in- creases creatine storage in muscle to a greater degree than creatine monohydrate [187]. In fact, most studies show that ingestion of these other forms have less physiological impact than creatine monohydrate on intramuscular cre- atine stores and/or performance and that any performance differences were more related to other nutrients that cre- atine is bound to or co-ingested with in supplement for- mulations. This makes sense given that these other forms contain less creatine per gram than creatine monohydrate and that 99% of ingested creatine monohydrate is absorbed into the blood, then taken up into muscle, or ex- creted in urine [187].
