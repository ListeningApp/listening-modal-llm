You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

5z6q | Once the activated iron center, whatever it may be, is dis- charged, product is released with concomitant formation of the diiron(III) form of the hydroxylase that enters another cycle in the catalysis (Scheme II). A peroxide shunt, analogous to that found in the P-450 enzyme, has been reported for the M. tri- chosporium OB3b MMO16 and confirmed by us in the present work. As indicated in Scheme II, the use of hydrogen peroxide permits hydroxylation reactions to occur in the absence of the coupling and reductase proteins. Addition of hydrogen peroxide to hydroxylase isolated from the M. capsulatus (Bath) organism, however, displays only 5-10% of the activity measured with the complete, three-protein system.59
yeoh | Mechanistic Considerations: The Hydroxylation Reaction. Scheme IV presents six possible mechanisms for substrate hy- droxylation following generation of the dioxygen-activated diiron center. In all cases except the last, O-O bond cleavage occurs prior to the C-H bond breaking step. The six possibilities are (A) direct insertion of the oxygen atom of a high-valent iron oxo species into a C-H bond; (B) concerted addition of the C-H bond to the high-valent iron oxo species to form a metal-carbon bond followed by reductive elimination of the alcohol; (C) heterolytic attack of a high-valent iron oxo species on the R-H bond followed by recombination to afford product; (D) homolytic attack of a high-valent iron oxo species on the R-H bond followed by return

hntf | of the hydroxyl group from iron to the alkyl radical, a so-called oxygen rebound step; (E) abstraction of a hydrogen atom from the substrate by hydroxyl or another radical within the active site to form an alkyl radical, which then adds to the iron-bound oxygen atom; and (F) electrophilic attack of an n2, n2-peroxide or related species (Chart II) on the substrate to form a carbon-oxygen bond followed by release of product. Mechanisms D and E involve transient formation of a substrate-derived alkyl radical, which could rearrange as shown in Scheme I, and it is these pathways that are directly addressed by the present investigation. The carbocation shown in mechanism C(2) could also rearrange, and its involvement in the hydroxylation reaction would similarly be revealed by our studies.
99fo | Experiments reported here and previously9,15 with MMO from M. trichosporium OB3b indicate that a radical is formed in the catalytic cycle, and a paper has recently appeared reporting results that are consistent with a radical or carbocationic intermediate.45 No ring-opened products are observed during the hydroxylation of substrate probes 1-4 with MMO from M. capsulatus (Bath), however. There are several possible explanations for these results. The simplest is that radicals and carbocations do not form and that pathways C(2), D, and E can be excluded for the reaction mechanism for MMO from this organism. Alternatively, radicals could form but recombine rapidly with the high-valent iron oxo moiety before they have a chance to ring open. Although this alternative is reasonable for probes 3 and, possibly, 4, it is not a viable explanation for 1 and 2 since it would require a radical rebound rate constant greater than 4 Ã— 1013 s-1. This conclusion is only valid, however, provided that the hydroxylase active site does not perturb the ring-opening rate constant of probes 1 and 2. Moreover, there are other potential problems arising in probe substrate oxidations within enzyme active sites, as delineated in a recent report of cytochrome P-450 dependent enzyme oxida-

The solid square is the experimental rate constant for cyclopropylcarbinyl radical ring opening, and the hollow square is that for the radical derived from 1.

hvhm | tions.22 In that study, two "poorly behaved" probes gave much less than the expected amount of rearranged product. In addition to decreasing the rate constant for radical rearrangement owing to steric effects, the low yields of rearranged products might arise from a possible change in mechanism, for example, the onset of an insertion reaction, an increase in the rate constant of oxygen rebound, or reaction of the rearranged radical with another site on the enzyme.
863b | Two of these potential problems can be excluded as the reason for the failure to detect ring-opened alcohols in the present study. Because the rearrangement of radical U' to R' (Scheme I) is fast enough to compete with any other process, it is not possible that acceleration of the oxygen rebound step without a diminution in the rate constant for the radical rearrangement could subvert the rearrangement. Furthermore, if ring-opened radicals were to react with another position in the enzyme active site, then the probe would most likely have deactivated the enzyme as a suicide substrate inhibitor. Although an extensive analysis of enzyme activity was not conducted for these substrates, there did not appear to be a noticeable loss of activity over the 15-min time course in these studies.
fj24 | The other possibility, that constraints of the enzyme active site alter the rate constant for radical rearrangement, is subtle and cannot be excluded. It is possible, for example, that the orientation of the phenyl group in enzyme-bound probe 1 is controlled by the steric confinement of the active site so as to preclude coalignment of the 7-system of the phenyl ring with the bond of the cyclo- propane ring that is cleaved. The imposition of such a stereoe- lectronic effect on the ring-opening reaction might result in a marked reduction in the rate constant for ring opening of the radical derived from 1. In the extreme case where the T-system of the phenyl ring is oriented perpendicularly to the cyclopropyl ring bond that is opened, the contribution of a phenyl resonance effect to the cyclopropyl-carbinyl bond breaking step would be eliminated, leaving only an inductive effect.
uz3c | The manifestation of an active site constraint enforced ster- eoelectronic effect on the kinetics of ring opening can be estimated semiquantitatively via Marcus theory.60-62 We have shown42 that the rate constants for reactions of the parent system, ring opening of the cyclopropylcarbinyl radical (5) to the 3-butenyl radical (6) and cyclization of radical 6, can be used to predict rate constants for ring openings of substituted cyclopropylcarbinyl radicals. In brief, the rate constant for ring opening of 5 at 25 â„ƒ (k, = 5 Ã— 107 s-1 for cleavage of one bond)64-67 and that for cyclization

y219 | Comparisons of standard bond dissociation energies (BDEs) can be used to estimate the exergonicity of the cyclopropylcarbinyl ring-opening reactions. The BDE for a benzylic hydrogen in toluene is 10-11 kcal/mol smaller than that of a primary C-H bond in ethane or propane.71,72 For the benzylic position in ethylbenzene, the BDE is reduced by approximately 2.5 kcal/mol from that of toluene.71,72 Thus, the ring opening of the radical derived from 1 is expected to be about 12.5-13.5 kcal/mol more exergonic than that of 5, giving a value of <LATEX>\Delta G ^ { \circ } = - 1 8 . 2 \mathrm { k c a l } / \mathrm { m o l } .</LATEX> If we assume that the full overlap of the x-system of the phenyl ring is available in the transition state for ring opening of the radical derived from 1, then the predicted rate constant for ring opening of this radical at 25 â„ƒ is <LATEX>1 \times 1 0 ^ { 1 1 } s ^ { - 1 } .</LATEX> Given the crude nature of the analysis, this value compares favorably with the observed rate constant of

When the latter is orthogonal to the breaking bond <LATEX>\left( \theta = 9 0 ^ { \circ } \right) ,</LATEX> the effect of the phenyl group would be reduced to approximately that of the inductive effect of an alkyl group. In this extreme case, the appropriate model reaction for the Marcus analysis would be one in which the exergonicity of the ring-opening reaction is only about 2.5-3 kcal/mol greater than that of 5 on the basis of the differences in BDE between primary and secondary alkane <LATEX>C</LATEX> <LATEX>C - H</LATEX> bonds.71 This <LATEX>s ^ { - 1 }</LATEX> value gives a predicted rate constant at 25 â„ƒ of about

Thus the absence of 1b from oxidation of probe 1 could result from an extreme alteration in the rate constant for ring opening of the derived cyclopropylcarbinyl radical in the enzyme active site.73,74

xags | Although the Marcus analysis demonstrates that a stereoe- lectronic reduction in the rate constant for ring opening of a radical derived from 1 is a possible explanation for the absence of ring- opened alcohol 1b, it should be recalled that no ring-opened product formed in the hydroxylation of the closely related substrate 2. A significant reduction in the rate constant for ring opening of the radical derived from this substrate probe due to steric effects in the active site is less likely. In this case, both phenyl groups must be held such that their <LATEX>\pi</LATEX> T-systems are virtually orthogonal to the breaking bond in order to reduce resonance stabilization in the transition state for opening, a much less probable situation. Moreover, such an arrangement would require that the phenyl groups approach coplanarity with one another, a geometry that would increase steric interactions between them. The results from probe 2 therefore suggest that a radical or carbocation is not formed and that the hydroxylation mechanism involves one of the alternative pathways A, <LATEX>B ,</LATEX> <LATEX>C \left( 1 \right) ,</LATEX> or <LATEX>F</LATEX> in Scheme IV.
jc47 | There is another factor to consider with regard to the results with probe 1. The discussion of steric effects on the rate constant for ring opening of substrate-derived radical ignored the fact that two enantiomers of this substrate were allowed to react with the chiral enzyme. If sterics-enforced stereoelectronic effects were operative, it is unlikely that both enantiomeric radicals derived from the enantiomers of the probe would suffer similar ring- opening rate retardations. The formation of aryl hydroxylated product in amounts comparable to the amount of alcohol la produced complicates the analysis, however. As indicated above, it is likely that the two different products are derived from the two different enantiomers of the probe substrate. Further studies with enantiomerically pure probes are planned to resolve this question.
