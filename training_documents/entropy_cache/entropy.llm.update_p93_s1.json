        "content": "9shl | THE WAVELENGTH OF A WARM PARTICLE\nrur1 | In thermal equilibrium, the average energy of a classical free particle in three-dimensional space is\n7ai3 | (E) = CkT three\nxoe3 | where T is the temperature and k is Boltzmann's constant.\nldca | If the particle has mass m,\npten | E equals m v squared, p equals m v  equals p equals square root two m E equals square root three m k T\n2aah | In quantum mechanics, a particle of momentum p has wavelength X equals h over p where h is the unreduced Planck's constant. So, at temperature T, the typical wavelength of a free particle of mass m is roughly\n5ww2 | square root three m k T\n89h3 | Particles are waves! Their wavelength is shorter when their momentum is bigger. And the warmer they are, the bigger their momentum tends to be. So there should be a formula for the typical wavelength of a warm particle. And here it is! It helps us visualize the world: particles are a bit blurry, with a characteristic wavelength that depends on temperature.\ntbgj | We get this formula from a blend of ideas. Classical mechanics says kinetic energy is E equals p squared over two m. Classical statistical mechanics says E equals two k T. Quantum mechanics says X equals h over p. It's pretty optimistic to put these formulas together and see what we get. But the result is approximately correct, though subject to limitations.\nba14 | We derived E equals k T using classical statistical mechanics. But it's close to correct for a single quantum particle in a big enough box at high enough temperatures. Otherwise quantum effects kick in.\n72rs | Another problem is that (E) equals two k T and E equals p squared over two m do not imply (p) equals square root three m k T, even if p here means the magnitude of the momentum vector. The arithmetic mean of a square is not the square of the arithmetic mean! Really the 'root mean square' of p is square root three m k T. Similarly, even if the root mean square of p is square root three m k T and quantum mechanically X equals h over p, we cannot conclude that the root mean square of X is h over square root three m k T. Again, you cannot pass a root mean square through a reciprocal!\nkb97 | So, our derivation above is dodgy- but it's okay as an order-of-magnitude approximation for a warm enough particle in a big enough box.\n1jn0 | THE PARTITION FUNCTION AND THE THERMAL WAVELENGTH\n8q4r | The partition function of a classical free particle of mass m in a one-dimensional box of length L is\ny60y | Z equals integral negative infinity to infinity e to the power of negative beta p squared over two m\n14cu | d p d q over h\nsxgl | equals L\nv1id | square root two pi m over beta\nospk | where\nayzb | lambda equals h over square root two pi m k T\nyid2 | square root two pi m over k T\n0tro | is called the 'thermal wavelength'.\nfkdd | Last time we saw that at temperature T, the typical wavelength of a free particle of mass m is roughly\negd7 | h over square root three m k T\num9s | But the partition function of a classical particle of mass m in a box simplifies a lot if we introduce a slightly different distance scale, which people call the thermal wavelength.\nit25 | lambda equals h over square root two pi m k T\n3mfz | Then the partition function is just the length of the box divided by lambda. The thermal wavelength lambda is a bit smaller than the previous calculation: we have lambda approximately equals zero point sixty-nine times the previous value. But we probably shouldn't worry about this too much, since our calculation of the previous value was so rough. Of course all these details are worth thinking about. But the thermal wavelength will turn out to be very useful!\nrf9l | FREE ENERGY AND THE THERMAL WAVELENGTH\nhycc | In thermal equilibrium, a classical free particle of mass m in a one-dimensional box of length L has free energy\nl8ni | F equals negative k T ln\nipcw | L over lambda\nadu9 | plus k T times pi\npq8y | beta\n8fpu | F equals negative k T ln\nkd2r | where\nwda6 | lambda equals h over square root two pi m k T\n862o | is the thermal wavelength.\noy6e | Since the partition function of the classical free particle in a one-dimensional box is\nvtgu | and free energy is related to the partition function by\nc1go | F equals negative k T ln Z,\n3kye | we have\nou3n | Expressing this in terms of temperature rather than coolness, we have\nd3bu | F equals negative k T ln\numpv | ENTROPY AND THE THERMAL WAVELENGTH\n1sha | In thermal equilibrium, a classical free particle of mass m in a one-dimensional box of length L has expected energy\nbw9p | (E) equals k T\nwuha | and free energy\neei5 | F equals negative k T ln lambda over L\ntzc8 | where lambda equals h over square root two pi m k T is the thermal wavelength.\nb6at | But entropy S is (expected energy minus free energy) over T, so\ntak4 | S equals k ln\nkish | Now that we have clean formulas for the expected energy and free energy of the classical free particle in a one-dimensional box, we can get a nice formula for its entropy. This is equivalent to the formula we saw before, but it's easier to understand. It's a sum of two terms:\n6i4k | S equals k (ln lambda over L plus two).\nwenx | Let's make sure we understand this! We've seen that for any system in thermal equilibrium, the entropy is the sum of two parts:\ndzhw | One. The free energy part. For the classical particle in a one-dimensional box, this is\ng50k | S equals k ln lambda over L\n260v | plus\n3v9q | Two. The expected energy part. For the classical particle in a one-dimensional box, this is\nb3q6 | (E)\nf7n0 | equals two k.\nqb6z | The free energy part is always k times the logarithm of the number of accessible states, and for the particle in a one-dimensional box the number of accessible states is L over lambda. The expected energy part is two k, by the equipartition theorem, because the particle's expected energy depends on one degree of freedom.\nwt9j | Let us think a bit more about why the number of accessible states is L over lambda. The most rigorous approach is simply to compute the number of accessible states that is,\nl4y1 | the partition function:\nrdhl | Z equals\nlgqb | zero to L\nm5n9 | equals L over lambda\n94av | equals L over lambda.\nzfsc | A more hand-wavy approach is to imagine the space of states of the particle, meaning the space of position-momentum pairs (q, p) in the range zero to L times R. When it comes to counting accessible states, each region of area h holds one state. The 'accessible' states are those where the energy is not too big compared to k T, so the probability density e to the power of negative E over k T is fairly large. This is a bit vague, as it must be, because 'accessibility' is not really a yes or no matter. But let's just pretend it is, and demand E less than or equal to k T. Then the 'accessible' region of state space is where p squared over two m is less than or equal to k T, or\ntd4d | p is less than or equal to square root two m k T over m.\n8etc | This region is\nj4fi | {(q, p) | zero is less than or equal to q which is less than or equal to L, negative square root two m k T over m is less than or equal to p which is less than or equal to square root two m k T over m} in the range [0, L] times R.\n73ie | It has area L times square root four m k T over m, so the number of states it holds is this divided by h, or\n7ml0 | two L\nr2i6 | times square root two m k T over h.\nsgha | This is just thirteen percent more than the exact value of Z. More importantly, I hope this calculation gives you a mental picture of number of accessible states for the particle in a one-dimensional box. A mental picture can be helpful even if it's oversimplified. I like to imagine counting the little rectangles of area h that can fit into the 'accessible' region of state space.\ny3c5 | In fact this idea is related to Bohr and Sommerfeld's early approach to quantum physics, the 'old quantum theory', which was later subsumed by the theory of 'geometric quantization'. In Bohr and Sommerfeld's approach, when we quantize a classical system with one position and one momentum degree of freedom, there should be approximately one quantum state for each region of area h in the q p plane. More generally, when we quantize a classical system with n position and n momentum degrees of freedom, there should be approximately one quantum state for each region R in R to the power of two n with\n10g0 | R times Δ p times Δ q equals h to the power of n.\nnl64 | PARTICLE IN A THREE-DIMENSIONAL BOX: PARTITION FUNCTION\na6si | The partition function of a classical free particle of mass m in a three-dimensional box B of volume V is",
