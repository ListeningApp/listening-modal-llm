You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

Let us therefore introduce a reference temperature <LATEX>T _ { 0 }</LATEX> and a dimensionless parameter <LATEX>\Upsilon</LATEX> which allows us to dial the temperature around <LATEX>T _ { 0 } .</LATEX> Writing <LATEX>D = D _ { 0 } \Upsilon ,</LATEX> we further define dimensionless variables

y4mj | A. The Brownian Motion Path Integral
vpgq | In order to bring the tools of Quantum Field Theory [11, 17] to bear, we will need to reformulate the stochas- tic differential equation (8) in terms of a path integral. In this subsection we will outline one known way to obtain this path integral, aiming to link this to Supersymmet- ric Quantum Mechanics. Our final expression, and the starting point of our subsequent analysis, is the Brownian Motion transition probability (24), expressed in terms of an integral over possible histories weighted by the action (25), to which the busy reader may progress if uninter- ested in the details of the derivation. We will be using a condensed functional notation of infinite dimensional functional integrals but all expressions can be considered as limits of finite, high dimensional ordinary integrals. This derivation is based on the path integral reformula- tion by De Dominicis, Peliti and Janssen [18-20] of the well known Martin-Siggia-Rose approach for stochastic dynamics, first developed in [21]. More details on these path integrals, including the corresponding finite discreti- sation of the stochastic process can be found in [22] - see also [23] for a pedagogical exposition.
ousl | The dynamics of the (dimensionless) Langevin equa- tion (8) can be captured in terms of the Probability Dis- tribution Function (PDF) <LATEX>\mathcal{P} \left( x _ { f } | x _ { i } \right)</LATEX> of observing the par- ticle <LATEX>x _ { f }</LATEX> <LATEX>t = t _ { f }</LATEX> given that initially, at <LATEX>t = t _ { i } ,</LATEX> the particle was at <LATEX>x _ { i } .</LATEX> By definition this can be expressed as:
m4ju | <LATEX>\mathcal{P} \left( x _ { f } | x _ { i } \right) = \langle \delta \left( x \left( t _ { f } \right) - x _ { f } \right) \rangle</LATEX> (10)
a0mb | where the expectation value is taken over all possible re- alisations of the noise <LATEX>\eta \left( t \right)</LATEX> and <LATEX>\delta \left( x \left( t _ { f } \right) - x _ { f } \right)</LATEX> is the Dirac delta function. Put another way, <LATEX>x \left( t _ { f } \right)</LATEX> is the position at <LATEX>t _ { f }</LATEX> for a given noise history <LATEX>\eta \left( t \right)</LATEX> and the brackets indicate averaging over all possible noise histories, or stochastic paths, which start at <LATEX>x _ { i }</LATEX> and end up at <LATEX>x \left( t _ { f } \right) = x _ { f }</LATEX> at <LATEX>t _ { f } .</LATEX> To express this in a path integral form, we can rewrite the PDF using a Gaussian measure for the <LATEX>n o i s e \left( 5 \right) a n d</LATEX> express the average as
ki8m | <LATEX>\mathcal{P} \left( x _ { f } | x _ { i } \right) = \int \mathcal{D} \eta \left( t \right) \delta \left( x \left( t _ { f } \right) - x _ { f } \right) \exp \left[ - \int \mathrm { d } t \frac { \eta ^ { 2 } \left( t \right) } { 2 \Upsilon } \right]</LATEX> (11)
km8w | where each noise history is weighted by the exponential factor in the above expression. We now consider the iden-
wzno | tity (see e.g. [15]):
xagm | <LATEX>1 = \int d x _ { f } \int _ { x _ { i } } ^ { x _ { f } } \mathcal{D} x \left( t \right) \delta \left( x \left( t \right) - x _ { \eta } \left( t \right) \right) .</LATEX> <LATEX>= \int d x _ { f } \int _ { x _ { i } } ^ { x _ { f } } \mathcal{D} x \left( t \right) \delta \left( \dot { x } + V _ { , x } - \eta \left( t \right) \right) d \mathrm { e } t \mathrm { M }</LATEX> (12)
iwn5 | <LATEX>= \int _ { x _ { j } } \mathcal{D} x \left( t \right) \delta \left( \dot { x } + V _ { , x } - \eta \left( t \right) \right) \det \mathrm { M }</LATEX> (13)
uooz | where the matrix <LATEX>\mathrm { M } \left( t , t ^ { \prime } \right)</LATEX> is:
pxbq | <LATEX>\mathrm { M } \equiv \frac { \delta \left[ \dot { x } + V _ { , x } - \eta \left( t \right) \right] } { \delta x \left( t ^ { \prime } \right) } = \left( \frac { d } { d t } + V _ { , x x } \right) \delta \left( t - t ^ { \prime } \right) . \left( \right.</LATEX> This identity expresses the obvious fact that, if the par- ticle starts at some <LATEX>x _ { i }</LATEX> and follows a particular history <LATEX>x _ { \eta } \left( t \right)</LATEX> dictated by the Langevin equation without disap- pearing, it will end up somewhere after time <LATEX>t _ { f } .</LATEX> We have used the standard subscript notation to denote derivative with respect to that variable e.g. <LATEX>V _ { , x x } = \partial _ { x x } V .</LATEX> Note that the path integral in (13) is over all paths starting at <LATEX>x _ { i }</LATEX> at <LATEX>t _ { i }</LATEX> and ending at <LATEX>y x \text { at } t _ { f } .</LATEX> Inserting this 'fat unity' factor (13) into (11) and noting that the delta function there restricts <LATEX>x \left( t _ { f } \right)</LATEX> to be <LATEX>x _ { f }</LATEX> we obtain:
jfsr | <LATEX>\mathcal{P} \left( x _ { f } | x _ { i } \right) = \int _ { x \left( t _ { i } \right) = x _ { i } } ^ { x \left( t _ { f } \right) = x _ { f } } \mathcal{D} \eta \mathcal{D} x \delta \left[ \dot { x } + V _ { , x } - \eta \right] \det \mathrm { M }</LATEX> <LATEX>\times \exp \left[ - \int d t \frac { \eta ^ { 2 } \left( t \right) } { 2 \Upsilon } \right]</LATEX> (15)
u15r | where the <LATEX>\mathcal{D} x \left( t \right)</LATEX> integral is taken over all paths beginning at <LATEX>x _ { i }</LATEX> and ending at <LATEX>x _ { f } .</LATEX> We can rewrite the delta function as a functional Fourier transform using a new variable <LATEX>\widetilde { x }</LATEX> which is usually called the response field:
lq35 | <LATEX>\delta \left[ \dot { x } + V _ { , x } - \eta \right] = \int \mathcal{D} \widetilde { x } \exp \left[ i \int d t \widetilde { x } \left( \dot { x } + V _ { , x } - \eta \right) \right]</LATEX> (16)
3g9w | There are a couple of standard ways we can incorporate detM into an exponential. We can formally write
d09o | <LATEX>\mathrm { M } = \left( \frac { d } { d t } \right) \left( 1 + \left( \frac { d } { d t } \right) ^ { - 1 } V _ { , x x } \right) \equiv \left( \frac { d } { d t } \right) \widetilde { \mathrm { M } } ,</LATEX> (17)
ylhz | where
a3td | <LATEX>\left( \frac { d } { d t } \right) ^ { - 1 } \left( t , t ^ { \prime } \right) = \lambda \Theta \left( t - t ^ { \prime } \right) - \left( 1 - \lambda \right) \Theta \left( t ^ { \prime } - t \right) .</LATEX> (18)
ex5k | Imposing retarded (causal) boundary conditions, which are appropriate for the problem at hand, requires that we set <LATEX>\lambda = 1</LATEX> and we find
9d4o | <LATEX>\det \mathrm { M } = \det \left( \frac { d } { d t } \right) \times \mathrm { d e t } \widetilde { \mathrm { M } } \propto \exp \left[ \mathrm { T r } \log \left( \widetilde { \mathrm { M } } \right) \right]</LATEX> <LATEX>\propto \exp \left[ \frac { 1 } { 2 } \int d t V _ { , x x } \right]</LATEX> (19)
cjq2 | 4
5esx | where we used the Stratonovich prescription <LATEX>\left( \theta \left( 0 \right) = \right.</LATEX> <LATEX>\left. 1 / 2 \right) .</LATEX> Alternatively, and to make the link with SUSY, we can use anticommuting Grassmann variables c and <LATEX>\bar { c }</LATEX> such that:
m5ka | <LATEX>\det \mathrm { M } = \int \mathcal{D} c \mathcal{D} \bar { c } \exp \left[ \int \mathrm { d } t \bar { c } \left( \partial _ { t } + V _ { , x x } \right) c \right]</LATEX> (20)
byu8 | The determination of <LATEX>\det \mathrm { M }</LATEX> then requires appropriate boundary conditions for <LATEX>\bar { c }</LATEX> and c, which are
76b0 | <LATEX>c \left( t _ { \mathrm { i n } } \right) = 0 , \quad \bar { c } \left( t _ { \mathrm { f } } \right) = 0 .</LATEX> (21)
zxz6 | Other choices are possible but lead to determinant val- ues that are different from (19), corresponding to non- causal boundary conditions for the stochastic problem. The boundary condition (21) is implied by the discretised form of the path integral, see [23]. Its appropriateness is verified by direct computation in Appendix <LATEX>\mathrm { C } .</LATEX> The dis- cretised path integral can also be consulted to infer that we must further impose
