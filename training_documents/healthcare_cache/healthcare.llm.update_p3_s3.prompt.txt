You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

e8nr | opment" as "meet(ing) the needs of the present with- out compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs."34 Although there are critiques of both the possibility and legitimacy of the term, 35 "sustainability" remains a key concept in environmen- tal and biomedical ethics.
k78w | It should be noted that sustainability does not imply a constant level of resource use or carbon emissions if that level is toxic, harmful, or unjust. In rural Ghana, a sustainable health care system may need to increase, expand, and accelerate medical access. In the United States, a sustainable health care system will need to reduce carbon emissions and minimize resource use. Sustainable health care can be achieved through poli- cies, laws, or initiatives.
g9du | "Green" initiatives may be identified by either their ideological intention to make health care more sustainable or by their functional outcome in actual reduction of health care resources.36 In environmental ethics, as with many social movements including civil rights, feminism, and LGBT liberation, there are phil- osophical debates as to the preferability of ideological ethics which promote a value, versus functional ethics that produce the desired result, often through law. The former attempts to transform morality by appealing to the intrinsic rightness of the action. The latter is less

li1k | concerned with the motivation because the outcome benefits the cause.37
pbea | In sustainable health care, an "ideological green ini- tiative" may have the intention of carbon reduction, but in actuality may be impotent to reduce the emissions of health care because it is poorly-designed, or unsus- tainable once implemented, or because of positive net emissions. For instance, sending out medical sharps for sterilization may reduce the use of syringes, but the processing and shipping impact may result in more environmental waste. Of course, many ideological green initiatives actually do reduce carbon emissions.38
ccpt | On the other hand, "functionally green initiatives" will save resources and reduce carbon emissions of health care, but may have no environmental commit- ment attached to them.39 For instance, a health care system that purchases the most economical plastic-
0fpw | ware may incidentally find that these are also the least resource intensive. Moreover, a functionally green initiative may be unethical. Barriers to care because of medical deserts are certainly "green" in that fewer people will use health care resources in a particular area, but they are morally problematic. Of course, a functionally green initiative might have a very strong environmental commitment behind it.
dqn8 | This article recognizes the overlap between ideolog- ical and functionally green initiatives and will high- light both in order to provide the widest base of out- lets towards sustainability. The distinction between ideological and functionally green initiatives ought to be employed in any discussions of green health care reform. Without a shared understanding of how the term "green" is being used, the potential or actual effi- cacy of the initiative will be difficult to evaluate.
cop0 | Having thus defined sustainability and the param- eters of green initiatives, this section will examine patient and doctor participation of green initiatives in the United States. Patients participate in green initiatives through education, carbon awareness, and ecotherapy. Physicians participate in green initiatives through activism, green health centers, green teams, continuing education, and green prescriptions. These are representative, but not comprehensive, initiatives.
lhkq | A. Patients
82ju | Many people are adapting to climate change through concerted efforts to be more sustainable. Just as res- taurant patrons are encouraged to ask where their food comes from, opening a dialogue about climate change is on the agenda of doctor's visits.40 Becom- ing educated about sustainability in health practices may help patients be more active in their health care.41 Green education gives patients a valuable tool for advocating sustainability in other areas of medicine. For instance, if a patient knows that sterilization and reuse of instruments reduces resource use at the oph- thalmologist, they can then be empowered to ask for sterilized instead of disposable tools at their next pri- mary care check-up. Making this request is a reflec- tion of autonomous decision-making and informed consent.
y2qo | 2. CARBON AWARENESS
1piq | Carbon emissions and resource use are familiar terms in the lexicon of environmentally aware citizens and thus environmentally aware patients. As patients educate themselves about sustainable practices, they may use carbon calculations to determine the car- bon impact and alternatives, of medical treatments.42 Increasingly, studies are published on the carbon emissions of individual medical procedures. Data is available on cataract operations,43 heart bypass opera- tions,44 conventional hemodialysis,45 caesarian sec- tions and vaginal childbirth,46 reproduction,47 hys- terectomies,48 Critical Care Unit stays,49 randomized controlled trials,50 and a variety of dental51 and men- tal health52 services. Carbon calculations are a valu- able tool in determining the environmental effects of health care, while also meeting the desires that many patients have to understand the impact of their health choices on the environment. Although patients might not always opt for lower carbon procedures, just as they may not choose sustainable transportation, they may balance their medical consumption with being intentionally more sustainable in other areas of life, like diet or family planning.53
7fqw | 3. ECOTHERAPY
rhaz | In addition to carbon awareness in traditional health care, patients may seek unconventional ecotherapy. Ecotherapy is not necessarily sustainable, but it has environmental resonance.54 Ecotherapy may encom- pass "prescriptions for nature"55 such as walks in a for- est, going outside more,56 attending a nature retreat, or participating in other forms of open-air recreation.57 While the medicalization of nature is problematic, as it may lead to instrumentalization, many patients find
wak1 | medical legitimacy through the word "therapy" and retain use of the term. To be sure, patients may still utilize traditional medicine and may not be concerned with reducing their impact on the environment. In fact, if ecotherapy is used as a conjunctive to tradi- tional medicine it can require more total resources. This inconsistency is part and parcel of health care; even as some patients try to be healthier in one area of life, such as not smoking, they may flout health care wisdom in other areas, like physical activity.
