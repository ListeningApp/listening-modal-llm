        "content": "6d4s | In order to bridge the span between DSM-Four and DSM-Five, a text revision of the fourth edition of the DSM was undertaken in two thousand. The main goals were to \"maintain the currency of the DSM-Four text\" and to correct any errors identified in the DSM-Four text. \"Thus, most of the major changes in DSM-Four-TR were confined to the descriptive text.\" The definition of ADHD has therefore not been changed. A new edition of the DSM is in progress. Critics have called for a validation of ADHD in adults. Since the DSM-Four field trials for ADHD included only children and adolescents up to the age of seventeen, the utility of the DSM-Four criteria in the diagnosis of adults with ADHD has been challenged. The publication of the fifth edition of the DSM is not scheduled until two thousand twelve.\nmqah | DSM-Four and ICD-Ten have adopted almost identical criteria for the identification of inattentive, hyperactive, and impulsive symptoms. However, significant differences are still evident in the number of criteria in each domain required for a diagnosis, the importance of inattention and the handling of comorbidity. In comparison with DSM-Four, ICD-Ten is more demanding about cross-situational\nxxr8 | pervasiveness and requires that all necessary criteria be present, both at home and at school or other situations.\nrl4j | Future directions",
