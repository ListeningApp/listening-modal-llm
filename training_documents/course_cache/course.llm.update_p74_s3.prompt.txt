You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

3mf9 | · As habitat heterogeneity increases and more bird species are added, these have to separate on an increasing number of niche dimensions, particularly:
z2rd | > Food type, Foraging techniques, Foraging height, Micro-habitat type
vqld | Biogeography - The Species-Area Model (1)
ljmz | · When increasing the area (A) from which one samples various species populations, the total species number (S) increase in a positive way according to the following logarithmic deterministic model: S = C.AZ (Areas = Oceanic islands or Habitat islands on mainlands)
en1l | . Factors that specifically contribute to the S-Area relationship are:
45gx | 1. Large islands are also subject to larger sampling sizes of individuals (N) from species populations thereby increasing the probability of encountering new species; hence a mere sampling phenomenon or artefact of more effective species sampling as N increases
xgur | 2. As the island size increases, the probability of encountering different habitat types also increases: High landscape heterogeneity: Lakes, mountains, valleys, swamps, oases etc., and such features contain more potential niches that can be filled by species
iz66 | Biogeography - The Species-Area Model (2)
dndq | 3. Large islands inevitably also contain large populations, and large populations are less vulnerable to local extinction phenomena (e.g. predation, parasites, pathogens)
xzce | 4. Large island populations also have higher speciation potentials due to higher population variability contained herein (high polymorphism and resource use diversity
w4vd | 5. Large islands inevitably represent larger targets for colonizing species (immigration) as the probability of encountering the area increases with size
cuh0 | Biogeography - The Species-Area Model (3)
k36t | · The normal range of Z is 0.20 - 0.40 for true (oceanic) islands and often around 0.25.
z1wx | · Z is only 0.1 - 0.25 for recently isolated habitat islands (e.g. forest surrounded by farms, a lake, a gap in the forest, or an oasis).
o6gf | · Z > 0.26 for long-term isolated habitats on the mainland or very large islands such as Australia.
0hs6 | · As habitat connectivity increases, the S-Area relationship is reduced => Low z-value
m05x | · Habitat connectivity is related to habitat diversity and as oceanic islands are more isolated than mainland habitat islands, they display stronger S-Area relationship (high z-value)
ds29 | Biogeography - The Species-Area Model (4)
qcmr | · Logging both sides of the S-Area power function:
7c6p | log S = log C + z log A
d1ee | · C and Z are constants depending on both habitat type, animal community and is specific to variability in dispersability and mobility of the species herein.
itx4 | . In a x-y logarithmic plot, log C is the intercept on the y-axis, and z denotes the graph slope.
vwrs | . The z-value denotes how strong the S and A relationship is (= positive correlation).
xjkw | MacArthur-Wilson's Equilibrium Theory (1)
wght | · Modelling species number (S) on true islands: S depends on two independent variables: 1. Immigration rate (I) 2. Extinction rate (E)
3lgb | · S is determined when an equilibrium between I and E rates is obtained
ttwt | · As S 1, I rate is lowered (1) as potential niche space is occupied (saturation 1)
x5l2 | . In contrast when S î then E rate 1 due to increased interspecific competition
ilrs | . Small islands have high E and low I rates: They are small targets and have small vulnerable populations; the opposite is the case for large islands; high I and low E
0a03 | Immigration rate (I)
auae | · Distance to mainland also a factor for I rate: Distance islands have low I and close islands have higher I.
5b6y | . Thus, S is highest on large islands nearby mainland (D), and smallest on small islands far from the mainland (A)
1y10 | MacArthur-Wilson's Equilibrium Theory (2)
6mnx | . Extinction Rate: Depends on 1) Island Size, 2) Distance to mainland (isolation degree)
tynp | · Island Size: Large islands have larger populations, hence genetic population variability is high and populations therefore more resilient towards predators, diseases, and stochastic detrimental events: e.g. storms, tsunamis, floods, drought etc.)
ob0u | · Distance to mainland: If close to mainland, extinctions may be delayed by regular immigration, thus compensating for the species loss over time
50o1 | MacArthur-Wilson's Equilibrium Theory (3)
cw76 | · Immigration Rate: Depends on 1) Island Size, 2) Distance to mainland
lkk5 | · Island Size: A large island represents a greater target for colonisers => higher probability of colonization.
molj | · Distance to mainland: If the distance is short, the likeliness of species colonizing from the mainland is higher than for more remote islands, to which many species may have difficulties in reaching successfully (depends on mobility and dispersability of animals).
5pto | · In effect species number is highest on large islands close to the mainland (CL) and smallest on small islands far away (remote/ isolated) from the mainland (DS)
mo6k | Modelling Species Number on Habitat Islands
zh6q | . On habitat islands, species numbers depend on: 1) Speciation rate and 2) Extinction rate
kp04 | · Immigration plays a minor role on the large scale and is replaced by speciation processes.
3e8r | . However, if habitat connectivity is high between islands, immigration from species rich areas is important in ecological time frame; speciation only evolutionary time frame
8g7g | Speciation Rate
5j4f | · Fewer empty niches reduce the chances of adaptive radiation by virtue of reducing character displacement processes
4xe7 | Extinction Rate
pg4b | As species saturation increases interspecific competition • increases extinction rate through the competitive exclusion principle (similarly to true islands)
b0d0 | Summary - Niche Partitioning & Species Richness (1)
d7eu | 1. Species richness and the niche concept are interrelated and determined by:
xndr | . Niche dimensionality and differentiation: Related to habitat heterogeneity
m6hi | . Niche width and shape: Narrow and leptokurtic niches increase diversity
vpkf | · Niche overlap and competitive coefficient: Complementarity increase S
4d67 | 2. Species richness and niches also interrelated with the habitat
