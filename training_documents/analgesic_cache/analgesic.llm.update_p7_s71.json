        "content": "4exe | ovariohysterectomy postoperative pain. Although monotherapy with dipyrone or an NSAID is indicated for mild pain only, an experienced surgeon performing ovariohysterectomy in young animals with an ideal body condition score may produce less surgical trauma and thus mild pain, corroborating the findings of previous studies.\n0myz | To find the lowest effective analgesic dose yielding the least adverse effects, a low dose (twelve point five milligrams per kilogram) was tested and compared with the commonly used dose for dogs and cats. There were no significant differences among groups regarding the need for rescue analgesia (forty percent, twenty percent and twenty percent in D twenty-five, D twelve point five and M, respectively), similar to a study in dogs undergoing ovariohysterectomy administered either dipyrone, meloxicam or a combination of these drugs. The administration of tramadol as rescue\nxh3i | analgesia was adequate to reduce scores in all pain scales in the present study.\nsyiw | The four subjective pain scales were used to measure postoperative pain more precisely and to analyze correlations among them. All cats requiring rescue analgesia were assigned scores above the cut-off value for rescue in all scales and a moderate (VAS by MCPS) to very strong (VAS by CSU-FAPS) correlation among them was found. A strong association between validated scales, MCPS and CMPS-FS scores, was observed, corroborating the findings of Steagall et al. However, only VAS displayed a significant difference between baseline and four hours, when two cats in group D twelve point five needed rescue analgesia.\nkg3t | This study had limitations. First, because the surgical procedure was performed by an experienced surgeon, results may not be extrapolated for the same surgery performed under",
