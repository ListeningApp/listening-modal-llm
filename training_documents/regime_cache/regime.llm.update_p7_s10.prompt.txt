You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

jjgp | Assumptions 1 through 4 are natural for overdamped Langevin and Langevin dynamics, which we present in the next two sections.
df4g | 2.1.2. Overdamped Langevin dynamics. One typical dynamics used in mo- lecular dynamics is overdamped Langevin dynamics, which evolves only the positions <LATEX>q</LATEX> of the system.
qc2j | Reference dynamics. Mathematically, the overdamped Langevin dynamics corre- sponds to the following SDE with nondegenerate noise:
x3oh | β 2 dWt,
fqvx | (2.11) dqt = - VV (qt) dt + V
viae | where B > 0 is proportional to the inverse temperature, and V is a smooth potential. The generator associated with (2.11) is given by
p8u9 | (2.12) Lo = - VTV + -A,
49ky | with L2(X)-adjoint
p5wo | Ch = div(VV.) + BA.
74rp | The dynamics (2.11) admits the Gibbs measure with density
oolg | 40(4) - 20-BV(a), 2 Z = 1x x e-BV(I)dq < +00
3ewf | as its unique invariant probability measure. It can indeed be checked that Lovo = 0, so that yo is a stationary solution to the Fokker-Planck equation. Here and in the remainder of this work, we assume that e-BV E L1(X). Note that the generator (2.12) is self-adjoint on the Hilbert space L2(0), as Lo =- B-1V*V.
5iea | Nonequilibrium perturbation. The perturbed overdamped Langevin dynamics cor- responding to (2.4) reads
62l5 | (2.13) dqf =(-VV(q")+nF(q"))dt+ V β
shub | It has generator Cn = Lo + ne phys, where Cphys = FTV. Recall that F is assumed to be nongradient, so that in general there is no explicit expression for the invariant probability measure of (2.13) when such a measure exists.
zjn5 | Remark 2.1. One of the only cases where a closed form for y, is known is the one- dimensional case for overdamped Langevin dynamics, where the associated Fokker- Planck equation is directly solvable, as discussed for instance in [13], which generalizes the computations of [39, Section 2.5].
w8ia | Conditions for assumptions to be satisfied. We now discuss the conditions under which Assumptions 1 through 4 are satisfied for the perturbed overdamped Langevin dynamics (2.13), which correspond to standard results in the literature.
4vej | . If the space X is compact, then it is trivial to satisfy the Lyapunov condi- tion (2.8) by choosing Kn = 1. In the case of unbounded spaces, a typical choice is Kn = 1 + |q|", with the condition that there exist A > 0 and B E R such that
8ut1 | (2.14) qTVV (q) ≥ Alq|2 - B.
6o35 | Condition (2.14) is satisfied for potentials V(q) that behave as |q|k for k ≥ 2 at infinity. This ensures that the dynamics returns to some compact region around the origin.
8r63 | EXTENDING LINEAR RESPONSE WITH SYNTHETIC FORCINGS
qze0 | · Assumption 1 can be shown to hold using Lyapunov techniques and a mi- norization condition [34, 40, 24]. It can thus be shown that the dynam- ics (2.13) has a unique invariant probability measure with positive density with respect to the Lebesgue measure, and therefore that trajectorial ergod- icity holds.
o3m2 | · Assumptions 2 and 3 hold under some conditions on the potential <LATEX>V ,</LATEX> which include (2.14); see [24] for a precise discussion.
