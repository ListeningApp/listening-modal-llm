        "content": "0sc2 | Once you succeed, you become archetype Two, entrepreneurs at minimum between three million and ten million dollars in yearly revenue. Once you get there, or if that's you now, I'd be honored to invest in your business and help you cross thirty million, fifty million, or one hundred million dollars plus. I don't sell coaching, masterminds, courses, or anything like that. Instead, I have a portfolio of companies I take an equity interest in. I\nyufa | use the infrastructure, resources, and teams of all my companies to fast track their growth. But don't believe me yet ... we just met. If you're curious, my business model is simple, just like the four-piece pyramid logo:\n4ggu | One. Provide value at no cost far in excess of what the rest of the marketplace charges for.\nvbg6 | Two. Have entrepreneurs use materials that actually work and make money helping more folks\no5y1 | Three. Earn the trust of the hyper-executor business owners who use the frameworks to scale their businesses to three million to ten million dollars per year and beyond\ngxus | Four. Invest in those businesses to make more impact at scale while helping everyone else for free.\nkfy5 | If you look carefully, the process reverse-engineers success. I think it's pretty cool. Here's how: I know these business owners can execute the frameworks I have without hand-holding, and therefore, would be very likely to succeed with the next set of frameworks (getting to thirty million, fifty million, one hundred million dollars looks different than getting to three to ten million dollars). They know that my style works for them, because it already has. So we operate on shared trust - I trust they can execute, and they trust that our stuff works - again, because it already has .... all while helping everyone else .... for free. So it allows me to preemptively avoid failures and dramatically increases success likelihood. Let me show you how much ....\neg1f | At the time of this writing, every business I have started since March of twenty seventeen has achieved a one million five hundred thousand dollars per month run rate. According to the Small Business Administration, the odds of a single business even achieving ten million dollars per year in revenue are point four percent, or one in two hundred fifty. Having it happen four times in a row is point four percent times point four percent times point four percent times point four percent equals very very low probability that it was luck. As such, I can say with conviction that we know how to recreate success using the frameworks I share over and over again. They work because they are timeless business principles.\n4npi | I actively visualize, every day, how it felt to wake up in the middle of the night in cold sweats, wondering how I'd make payroll. That gut-wrenching \"meditation\" keeps me hungry as an entrepreneur but also grateful for my security and peace of mind. I want the latter for you and anyone else that gives a damn about what they do.\nq93a | Fair enough?\ngxvi | Cool. So let's get to it.\nigdg | Basic Outline of This Book\n3u7c | This book is intended to be a resource. As a resource, I mean it will be something you will read through and then keep in your toolbox, coming back to it again and again. Why? As Einstein says, \"never memorize anything you can look up.\" Business is not a spectator sport. You're not cramming for some midterm, and you're not some limp-wristed philosopher.\ncx2c | You do work. And to work, you need tools. This, my friend, is one of those tools.\nuoim | General Outline\ndwsl | · Section One: How We Got Here (You Just Finished It)\nlpnq | · Section Two: Pricing: How To Charge Lots of Money For Stuff\nc0cp | · Section Three: Value: Create Your Offer: How To Make Something So Good People Line Up To Buy\nvm3e | · Section Four: Enhancing Your Offer: How To Make Your Offer So Good They Feel Stupid Saying No\nky8f | · Section Five: Next Steps: How To Make This Happen In The Real World\ngtxr | Section Two: Pricing\nehqu | How To Charge Lots Of Money For Stuff\n5hiy | Section Two: Pricing\nghiq | Section One: How We Got Here\nytlm | Section Two: Value Offer\nfg9j | Problems Solutions _> Bundle\nwt58 | Section One: Execution\ngcgx | Section Three: Enhancing\nxeng | Pricing: The Commodity Problem\njf2c | What this means is, if your company isn't growing, it's dying. This is a sobering reality for many of us. I learned the hard way, and my businesses suffered for a long time because of it.\n9qk9 | Let me explain. The market is continuously growing. The stock market grows at nine percent per year. If we aren't growing at nine percent per year, we are falling behind. \"Maintenance,\" in the most generic sense, would be nine percent growth year over year.\nmki0 | Furthermore, if you're in a growing marketplace, then you might have to grow at twenty to thirty percent per year, just to keep up, or risk falling behind. So you can see how maintenance is a myth.\ndin5 | So, then, what does it take to grow? Thankfully, just three simple things:\nqc24 | One. Get more customers\nktw4 | Two. Increase their average purchase value\n0wr0 | Three. Get them to buy more times\n01xg | That's it.\ni6d2 | Sure, there are lots of ways to acquire customers and zillions of ways to increase order value and purchase frequency, but, simply put, that's it. Those are the only three ways to grow.\nlg8p | Example: If I sell ten clients a month, and a client is worth one thousand dollars to me over their lifetime (through average cart value times average number of purchases), then my business will cap at ten thousand dollars per month (ten times one thousand dollars).\n3fo4 | Ten New Clients per month times One Thousand Dollars Lifetime Value equals Ten Thousand Dollars per month max revenue.\nbs9g | If you want to grow, you've got to either sell more clients every month (while maintaining suitable margins) or have them be worth more (by increasing the profit per purchase or number of times they buy). That's it.\nwyx9 | Author Note - Only Two Ways to Grow\nlmig | To simplify this concept even more. There are really only two ways to grow: get more customers, and increase each customer's value. \"Increasing each customer's value\" has two sub-buckets: One. Increasing profit per purchase Two. Increasing the number of times they buy. For the purpose of this book, I highlight both of those sub-buckets as individual growth paths. I did this because I think it will be easier to understand the money models that will come in Volume Three. All three - getting more customers, increasing their average purchase value, and getting them to buy more - are repeated themes in this book. But if you seek simplicity, both increasing average purchase value and increasing the number of times a customer buys results in one outcome: increasing each customer's value.\n63vd | Business Terms\nihsk | Before going any further, and to better flesh out the concepts that follow, we should take a second to define and better understand some key business concepts. When I stood in that Las Vegas penthouse in my \"beast mode\" t-shirt I was clueless about such terms. Let me help you be better than, well, me.\nyohk | Gross Profit: The revenue minus the direct cost of servicing an additional customer. If I sell lotion for ten dollars and it costs me two dollars, my gross profit is eight dollars or eighty percent. If I sell agency services for one thousand dollars per month and it costs me one hundred dollars per month in labor to run that client's advertising, then my gross profit is nine hundred dollars or ninety percent. Note: This is not net profit. Net profit is what's left over after all expenses are paid, not just the direct costs of fulfillment.\n0qgi | Lifetime Value: The gross profit accrued over the entire lifetime of a customer. This is gross profit multiplied by the number of purchases an average customer will make over their lifetime. Using the example above, if the average customer stays five months, and they pay one thousand dollars per month while it costs me one hundred dollars per month to fulfill, then their lifetime value is four thousand five hundred dollars.",
