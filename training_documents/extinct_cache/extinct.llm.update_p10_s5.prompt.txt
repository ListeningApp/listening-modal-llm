You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

emgw | In the previous sections, we have mainly focused on what is commonly termed an analytical moral philosophical approach to the ethics of extinction. Yet, several other philosophical perspec- tives on extinction and contributions from outside of the fields of moral philosophy and the philosophy of biology also provide insights that are pertinent for thinking about the ethics of extinction that complement and enrich some of the discussions considered throughout this article. For example, there is a vibrant sub-debate in the conservation literature according to which ethical concepts and values should be supplemented or replaced by aesthetic concepts and values (e.g. Passmore, 1974; Sober, 1986/1995; Hargrove, 1989; Thompson, 1995; Tribot et al., 2018). Thus, one could claim that a species extinction is analogous to the loss of a great work of art.
xaqt | A particularly notable further area of debate is the philosophical contributions in the interdisciplinary overlap with the environmen- tal humanities and social sciences (e.g. Barad, 2007; Haraway, 2008; Sodikoff, 2012; Tsing, 2015; Guasco, 2021) in a broad research area called 'extinction studies' (e.g. Chrulew et al., 2017). Before con- cluding, we will highlight some elements of this perspective to find areas of convergence and divergence between these different intel- lectual traditions working on the ethics of extinction.
5rcb | Scholars working within the extinction studies framework tend to emphasise an understanding of extinctions as a biocultural phenomenon (van Dooren et al., 2017; van Dooren, 2018) that cuts across reality, inviting a vision of existence that recognises the deep interwoven nature of multispecies communities, experiences and collaborations. In line with this understanding, some writers have conceptualised extinctions as the loss of ways of life, underlining the fact that extinctions represent the demise of distinct forms of mating, nurturing, intergenerational learning, educating, interact- ing and so on (Rose, 2011; Crist, 2013; van Dooren, 2014; Despret, 2017; Hatley, 2017).
524j | Influenced by the work of philosophers such as Edmund Hus- serl, Maurice Merleau-Ponty and others, this perspective empha- sises a phenomenological approximation to extinction, opposing a mere behavioural approach to the nonhuman world and, instead, stressing the importance of attentiveness and lived experience in our interactions with the natural world (Lestel et al., 2014). A key point of this approximation is to underline the experiences of those affected by extinction rather than focusing on the abstract dis- appearance of species. This speaks to the idea that the very experi- ence of living on a biologically impoverished earth is understood as a source of deep concern (Crist, 2019). This methodological emphasis, in turn, motivates the interest of extinction studies in individual stories of extinction (e.g. van Dooren, 2014) investigated through the tools of so-called field philosophy (Buchanan et al., 2018) and other alternative methods (e.g. Masco, 2017).
xd3m | Another important aspect of this perspective on analysing extinctions is the idea that the consideration of processes and occurrences of extinction cannot be separated from a critique of various forms of colonialism, imperialism and capitalism that
8qb6 | inform our extinction-related practices and concepts (Dawson, 2016; Salazar Parreñas, 2018). To illustrate, returning to themes introduced in section "Defining extinction", while extinction stud- ies do not attribute a single, all-encompassing meaning to extinc- tion (De Vos, 2007), this phenomenon is regarded as the result, amongst other things, of complications derived from concepts used hegemonically, including the terms 'species', 'biodiversity', 'extinc- tions' and 'scientific knowledge', amongst other notions. It is argued that these concepts represent a conventional classification of the natural world that is tinted by colonialist and anthropocentric biases that universalise Western scientific perspectives, thus priv- ilege some organisational hierarchies over others and naturalise distinct power relations within dominant biodiversity conservation paradigms (Theriault et al., 2020). These terms employed with the purpose of organising reality 'exclude myriad forms of life and relations and draw sharp boundaries between "living" and "dead" that confound the basic principles of so many living cosmologies' (Mitchell, 2016b).
wkbn | When thinking about responses to extinction - for example as an 'ethos of responsiveness towards the phenomenon of mass extinction' (Michell, 2016a, 39) - also in extinction studies, there is a general scepticism towards de-extinction projects as shared by the approaches introduced above (see section "De-extinction"). If extinctions are understood not as the demise of the last individual of a population, but as the disappearance of a way of life, de-extinction projects are doomed to fail, because they do not seem capable of capturing the deeply relational nature of life (Friese, 2013; Jørgensen, 2013). This is interestingly complementary to some of the views discussed in the previous sections that, when examining the wrongness of extinctions and the problems of technological solutions such as de-extinction, emphasise the relevance of eco- logical and cultural relationships as the basis for what has value. Confronted with the failure of preventing extinctions and the magnitude of the biocultural losses produced by the disappearance of these ways of life, some extinction studies scholars emphasise the importance of mourning and remembrance as a proper response to extinction (van Dooren and Rose, 2017; de Massol de Rebetz, 2020). Rather than undoing loss, the moral significance of reflecting - remembering, mourning, grieving and imagining - the disappear- ances of deeply interwoven ways of life is underlined, giving rise to a moral psychology aspect to extinction.
ftfg | Conclusion
7xi5 | This overview of the ethics of species extinctions has not attempted to spell out or critically discuss all topics or argumentative positions in detail. More humbly, our aim has been to provide an initial glimpse into some of the themes relevant for thinking about extinc- tion that are being discussed in the literature of environmental ethics. For that purpose, we have given special attention to the possible philosophical grounds for Michael Soulé's assertion that the untimely 'extinction of populations and species is bad', which does not answer what should be done to prevent extinctions.
w8r5 | While there is no simple or straightforward answer to the question of why anthropogenic extinctions are 'bad' or morally wrong, there is clearly largely agreement on the issue that anthropo- genic extinctions are in most cases wrong, except for the contro- versially discussed cases of planned species extinctions in support of human (and nonhuman) health, such as with respect to vector- borne diseases. In such cases, anthropogenic extinctions might even be morally required. Besides such special cases, there is a broad
ybik | plurality of arguments and perspectives underlying and supporting the need to pursue expansive biological conservation policies. Which conservation strategies and practices should be pursued (and which should not), in turn, remains an additional matter of debate, the subject of the ethics of conservation that supplements the ethics of extinction.
