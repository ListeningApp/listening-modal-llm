You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

0x0s | science, agricultural and biological science, Earth and planetary science, economics, econometrics and finance, energy, "multidisciplinary," and decision sciences. We excluded environmental education because the overlaps with the health and psychological literature produced a lot of nonrelevant studies. Further, we restricted our search to journals, books, and book series, and to publications in English, and items published or in press. Our final search, conducted on 22 July 2015, yielded a result of 5222 documents. In addition to the abstracts and (index and author) key words, we downloaded the year published, journals published in, number of citations, and the institutions and geographical locations of authors.
4exe | First screening and coding
0myz | The next step was to screen abstracts for inclusion or exclusion in the study. We characterized papers as follows:
xh3i | · Review: a review of papers about SES, theoretical concepts, and/or frameworks;
syiw | · Framework: papers that explicitly proposed a framework for understanding SES;
kg3t | · Framework and place-based: papers that proposed a framework, and also used this framework to analyze a place- based system;
lvae | · Theory: articles that did not propose a framework, but focused on understanding an aspect of thinking about SES, or developing SES theory, without focusing on a particular place-based SES;
o9sc | · Place-based article: empirical studies that focused on placed- based SES;
121u | · Irrelevant: studies that very clearly did not make reference to SES as integrated social and ecological systems and were not relevant to the focus of this study, e.g., studies focusing on the psychological social-ecological theories that were not filtered out in the initial search. These articles (124) were not further considered in our review. Removing these articles brought our total database to 5098 records.
zh03 | Second screening and document analysis
1mvw | In the second screening of abstracts, we focused only on the documents that were classified as place-based articles (4479 articles). Of these 4479, 37.4% contained the term "social- ecological" in their title, abstracts, and key words, while 61.4% contained the term in their full texts. To keep the analysis manageable, we randomly selected 2000 of these place-based articles, and read the abstract, title, and key words. For each article, we recorded the scale of the SES studied (local, regional, national, multinational, and global), as well as research methods used (as could be derived from the abstract and key words). We did not classify articles where we could not infer methods used from the abstract (293 of the 2000 surveyed documents). This left 1707 read and classified articles. Scopus records the research affiliations and countries of researchers affiliated with papers; we thus had these data for the full dataset, i.e., 4479 articles. However, we also recorded, in the subset of data (n = 1707), the names of countries mentioned in the abstract and key words, i.e., the location where the research took place.
6d4s | Data analysis
mqah | Growth and types of SES research
xxr8 | To track the development of the SES research field, we analyzed the growth of all SES publications (n = 5098) as a proportion of the total number of publications in Scopus within the same disciplines. We investigated the significance of the relationship between year and relative publications with a Spearman-rank test, and used both change point analysis (R package "changepoint"), and Bayesian change point analysis, to detect significant inflection points. We used a chi-squared test to statistically analyze the different types of SES papers (namely "theory," "framework," "place-based research," "review") across all years, against a null hypothesis of equal proportions.
rl4j | Hotspots of SES research
vz32 | From the full place-based data set (n = 4479), we used the names of countries and institutions associated with each research paper (as denoted by Scopus) to calculate the number of SES publications produced by each country and research institution over time. We weighted these totals by a notional research capacity for each country (number of universities per country as reported in the database of the International Association of Universities (IAU; http://www.whed.net/home.php). We compared the average research output/capita per year using ANOVA tests.
ncb0 | To identify hotspots of SES research sites, we calculated the number of place-based studies conducted in each country (n = 1707). We created a graduated heat map in ArcGIS 10.5 (ESRI 2017) using raw frequencies, as well as normalized frequencies, accounting for surface area. Countries were assigned to regions. After normalization of country frequencies, data were normally distributed, and we performed a one-way ANOVA to test for statistical significance between regions.
8mp0 | Popularity of journals over time
xjyk | To assess the development of journals publishing SES research over time, we focused on the five most popular journals over all years. Here we used the full dataset (n = 5098). We recorded the proportion of total publications in each time period (1990-1990, 2000-2008, 2009-2012, 2013-2015). Time periods were informed by the results of the change point analysis. We performed a Kruskal-Wallis test to analyze differences in average annual number of SES publications between journals.
mt0f | Thematic topics in SES research
awab | We used word cloud and frequency analysis of author key words to extract major topics of SES research. We removed all spaces between words of key word terms (e.g., "ecosystem services" became "ecosystemservices"), so that we could run word cloud analysis on terms, rather than single words, using the wordCloud package in R (v3.01). We extracted the most frequent terms (see Appendix 2) from which we constructed a list of thematic topics for place-based SES research. We then searched the abstracts and author key words of all 4479 place-based studies to obtain the frequency with which these terms were used in the abstracts and key words of studies in our dataset. Finally, we constructed a two- by-two matrix of methods, highlighting main associations.
ixcc | Method extraction and categorization
8p6h | We manually screened key methods from 2000 abstracts of place- based SES studies, 1707 of which mentioned a research method.
pmgl | Abstracts varied in the number and detail of methods provided, for example, some would note that they had employed "modeling," while others detailed the type of models they used. This was particularly true for statistical methods, and data collection. In the first instance, we listed methods as they were listed in the abstract. We cleaned the resulting method list (632 individual methods, after removing of duplicates) by merging very similar methods. We also removed "methods" that we considered broader approaches, e.g., resilience assessment, adaptive management, transdisciplinary. This process produced a list of 311 methods (see Appendix 3).
