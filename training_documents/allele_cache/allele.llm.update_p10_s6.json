        "content": "u1ky | Next, there is rs one seven two nine three six three two, C to T, that serves as a Ref-ASB for twenty-five different TFs and was previously reported to affect the chromatin accessibility in the adjacent region. rs one seven two nine three six three two is associated with Crohn's disease. This SNP is located in SMAD three intron and overlaps an eQTL targeting SMAD three, AAGAB, and PIAS one genes. Interestingly, a variant of SMAD three is also associated with Crohn's disease, particularly, with increased risk of repeated surgery and shorter relapse. Among the TFs displaying ASBs, there are JUN/FOS proteins with the ASB-concordant motif annotation. The AP one pioneer complex of JUN/FOS likely serves as a \"driver\" for changes both in gene expression and chromatin accessibility, and is likely to cause ASB of all twenty-five TFs.\nhtm9 | Apart from multi-TF ASBs which are linked to local chromatin changes, non-trivial cases can be found among TF-switching ASBs. For example, SNP rs five eight seven two six two one three is associated with psoriasis and is ASB of CREB one, reference allele preference, concordant with motif, and JUN, alternative allele preference. rs five eight seven two six two one three is located in the STX four intron or upstream region depending on a transcript variant. STX four is significantly downregulated in psoriasis, and, according to GTEx, rs five eight seven two six two one three serves as an eQTL of STX four and HSD three B seven; the latter is also reported as psoriasis susceptibility locus.\n8hul | Another example is SNP rs one one two five seven six five five that is associated with type two diabetes. rs one one two five seven six five five is reported to be located in the CDC one two three regulatory region and exhibits ASB of FOXA one, alternative allele preference, concordant with the sequence motif,\n87vz | ESR one, reference allele preference, and three other TFs, SPI one, STAT one, and SMC three. According to UniProt, FOXA one is involved in liver and pancreas development, and in glucose homeostasis. At the same time, polymorphisms in the ESR one gene are associated with type two diabetes and with fasting plasma glucose.\nym66 | Thus, ASBs highlight the cases where phenotype-genotype associations arise with different mechanisms, either from protein structure variation, or due to altered gene expression caused by nucleotide substitutions in the gene regulatory region.\nl0a3 | Discussion\nu8nw | The functional annotation of noncoding variants remains a challenge in modern human genetics. Phenotype-associated SNPs found in GWAS are usually located in extensive linkage disequilibrium blocks, and reliable selection of causal variants cannot be done purely by statistical means. Additional data for the identification of causal variants come from functional genomics. In particular, an important class of causal variants consists of regulatory SNVs affecting gene transcription. For those variants, there are various approaches, e.g., parallel reporter assays, to obtain high-throughput data on molecular events caused by particular nucleotide substitution. Another common strategy is to check if a variant of interest falls into a known gene regulatory region detected by chromatin immunoprecipitation or chromatin accessibility assay followed by deep sequencing. By assessing the allele specificity, it is possible to further profit from these data through direct estimation of the effect that a particular allele has on the binding of relevant regulatory proteins or chromatin accessibility.\nl2v9 | In this meta-study, for each SNV, we integrated the data by considering a TF bound to SNV in different cell types or a cell type and different TFs bound to the same SNV. Surprisingly, ASB identification through data aggregation had better sensitivity than standard ChIP-Seq peak calling at the level of individual data sets. Particularly, in GTRD, the ChIP-Seq peak calls were gathered from four different tools, MACS, SISSRs, GEM, and PICS, but only eighty-five to ninety percent of significant ASBs were detected within peak calls, one hundred ninety-nine thousand eight hundred nineteen of two hundred thirty-three thousand two hundred ninety and three hundred twenty-four thousand eight hundred ninety of three hundred fifty-one thousand nine hundred sixty-five for TF-centric and cell type-centric aggregation, suggesting that up to fifteen percent of ASBs could be lost if the ASB calling was restricted to the peak calls only.",
