On the other hand, the agreement with the experimental data at P H equals one can be significantly improved if we adjust K one. Moreover, the slight increase of the P H equals five curve in Figure five A at around negative zero point two volts versus N H E does not appear when a larger Å»EPT is used. Figure five B shows the apparent maximum rate constant as a function of P H. Here, the apparent maximum rate constant is defined at the lowest potential reached in the experiment, E equals negative zero point one volts, instead of E equals zero zero, because not all channels reach saturation in the experimental potential range. Using the same parameters as in Figure five A, we predict that the apparent maximum P C E T rate constant will become P H-independent at high P H. This prediction is confirmed by experimental measurements, as discussed below.\nmqah | To understand the origin of the weak P H dependence of K max app, we analyzed the contributions of each channel at P H equals one, three, and five as a function of potential. With the equilibrium assumption, when P H is less than P K a Red, any Ru three plus O H Red formed through E T two will nearly instantaneously be protonated to form Ru three plus O H two Red H. Therefore, E T two is a P C E T channel occurring by the E T P T mechanism. In principle, E T one is associated with a P C E T channel occurring by the P T E T mechanism, where the protonation occurs via a pre-equilibrium process. The contribution of each channel to the total rate constant is determined by both the mole fractions\nxxr8 | Article\nrl4j | of the reactant forms Xox and their corresponding rate constants. For this system, our previous work showed that the total reorganization energy is significantly larger for E P T than for E T, as discussed above, leading to a higher free energy barrier for the E P T steps. As a result, the E T rate constants are significantly larger than the E P T rate constants at a given electrode potential. Moreover, at a given potential, E T one is faster than E T two because it has a more positive reduction potential, that is, a larger driving force.\nvz32 | At P H equals one, the E T one channel dominates over the entire range of potentials considered. The concentration of Ru three plus O H minus Ox is much smaller than Ru three plus O H two Ox H plus over this potential range because the potential-dependent P K a Ox is always greater than the P H. Therefore, the E T two, E P T one, and E P T two channels are not accessible due to the low concentration of Ox, especially at negative potentials. Thus, the E T one channel dominates at P H equals one.\nncb0 | At P H equals three, the E T one channel still dominates, although the E T two P T channel also contributes to a smaller extent at less positive potentials. The concentration of Ru three plus O H two is negligible at one point one volts versus N H E because P K a Ox equals one point two at this potential, thereby inhibiting contributions from the E T one channel at this potential. Assuming the potential dependence of P K a Ox given in equation thirteen, however, the concentrations of Ru four plus O H two and Ru three plus O H become comparable at less positive potentials. Since E T one is much faster than the other\n8mp0 | channels for reasons discussed above, the E T one channel dominates the reduction at P H equals three. The E T two P T channel contributes in the region of potential at which F of E is approximately equal to negative lambda E T due to the error function form of the rate constant in equation fourteen.\nxjyk | At P H equals five, the E T two P T channel dominates over the entire range of potentials considered. The concentration of Ru three plus O H two at this P H is much smaller, virtually eliminating the contribution from the E T one channel. The E P T one channel is also not accessible because the mole fraction of Ru three plus O H minus H three O plus is negligible at this P H. Moreover, E T two is much faster than E P T two due to its smaller reorganization energy. For these reasons, the E T two P T channel is dominant at",
