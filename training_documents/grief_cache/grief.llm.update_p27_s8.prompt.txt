You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

e9xj | Shock occurs most often in the case of a sudden death. Someone picks up the telephone and learns that a loved one or friend is dead. Even when the death is expected and follows a progressive deteriorating ill- ness, when the phone call finally comes, it can still cause the survivor to experience shock and disbelief.
9vl6 | Yearning
c2fd | Yearning for the lost person is what the British call pining. Parkes (2001; Parkes & Prigerson, 2010) has noted that pining is a common experi- ence of survivors, particularly among the widows he studied. Yearning is a normal response to loss. When it diminishes, it may be a sign that mourning is coming to an end. When it does not come to an end, it may be a clinical sign indicating complicated mourning (W. Stroebe, Abakoumkin, & Stroebe, 2010). See Chapter 5 for a discussion of pro- longed grief as one of the complications of mourning, and the place of yearning in its diagnosis (Robinaugh et al., 2016).
jzvp | Emancipation
f71y | Emancipation can be a positive feeling after a death. I worked with a young woman whose father was a real potentate, a heavy-handed,

40ry | unbending dictator over her existence. After his sudden death from a heart attack, she went through the normal grief feelings, but she also expressed a feeling of emancipation because she no longer had to live under his tyranny. At first, she was uncomfortable with this feeling, but later she was able to accept it as the normal response to her changed status.
d1j2 | Relief
wstc | Many people feel relief after the death of a loved one, particularly if the loved one suffered a lengthy or particularly painful illness. "The know- ing that his suffering, both physical and mental, is over helps me cope," said one elderly widow. This can also occur when the death involves a person with whom the mourner has had a particularly difficult and often lifelong relationship. Sometimes relief is the reaction following a completed suicide after a long series of suicide attempts. However, a sense of guilt often accompanies this sense of relief.
ba1e | Numbness
en95 | It's also important to mention that some people report a lack of feel- ings. After a loss, they feel numb. Again, this numbness is often expe- rienced early in the grieving process, usually right after the person learns of the death. It probably occurs because there are so many feel- ings to deal with, that to allow them all into consciousness would be overwhelming, so the person experiences numbness as a protection from this flood of feelings. Commenting on numbness, Parkes and Weiss (1983) have said, "We found no evidence that it is an unhealthy reaction. Blocking of sensation as a defense against what would oth- erwise be overwhelming pain would seem to be extremely 'normal'" (p. 55).
l3do | As you review this list, remember that each of these items listed represents normal grief feelings and there is nothing pathological about any one of them. However, feelings that exist for abnormally long peri- ods of time and at excessive intensity may portend a complicated grief reaction. This is discussed in Chapter 5.
u9bo | Physical Sensations
7avo | One of the interesting things about Lindemann's paper is that he describes not only the emotions that people experienced, but also the physical sensations associated with their acute grief reactions. These sensations are often overlooked, but they play a significant role in the
uzo6 | 1 Attachment, Loss, and the Experience of Grief
89b4 | grieving process. The following is a list of the most commonly reported sensations experienced by the people we see for grief counseling:
5f7e | 1. Hollowness in the stomach
h83u | 2. Tightness in the chest
kjoa | 3. Tightness in the throat
wb1c | 4. Oversensitivity to noise
ak13 | 5. A sense of depersonalization: "I walk down the street and nothing seems real, including me."
s7el | 6. Breathlessness, feeling short of breath
0lfu | 7. Weakness in the muscles
cnjl | 8. Lack of energy
rtdl | 9. Dry mouth
norp | Many times, these physical sensations are of concern to the survi- vor, and he or she may come to the physician for a checkup. If so, physi- cians need to inquire about deaths and losses as part of their diagnostic evaluation.
chx3 | Cognitions
sfcf | There are many different thought patterns that mark the experience of grief. Certain thoughts are common in the early stages of grieving and usually disappear after a short time. But sometimes thoughts persist and trigger feelings that can lead to depression or anxiety.
nuxs | Disbelief
umx0 | "It didn't happen. There must be some mistake. I can't believe it hap- pened. I don't want to believe it happened." These are often the first thoughts to occur after hearing of a death, especially if the death was sudden. One young widow said to me, "I keep waiting for someone to wake me and tell me I'm dreaming." Another said, "The passing of my husband came as a shock although he had been sick for some time. You are never quite ready for it."
o306 | Confusion
qm1b | Many newly bereaved people say their thinking is very confused, they can't seem to order their thoughts, they have difficulty concentrating, or they forget things. I once went out for a social evening in Boston and took a cab home. I told the driver where I wanted to go and sat back while he proceeded down the road. A little later he asked me again
n9ms | Grief Counseling and Grief Therapy
icdp | where I wanted to go. I thought maybe he was a new driver and did not know the city, but he commented to me that he had a lot on his mind. A little later he asked again and then apologized and said that he was feeling very confused. This happened several more times, and finally I decided it would not hurt to ask him what was on his mind. He told me that his son had been killed the week before in a traffic accident.
wtse | Preoccupation
bm7g | Preoccupations can be obsessive thoughts about the deceased. These often include obsessive thoughts about how to recover the lost per- son. Sometimes preoccupation takes the form of intrusive thoughts or images of the deceased suffering or dying. In our Harvard Child Bereavement Study, surviving parents with the highest levels of intru- sive thoughts were those who unexpectedly lost a spouse with whom they had a highly conflicted relationship (Worden, 1996). Rumination is another form of preoccupation. People engaging in ruminative coping think persistently and repetitively about how bad they feel and about the circumstances that precipitated their feelings (Eisma et al., 2015; Nolen-Hoeksema, 2001).
jr68 | Sense of Presence
axix | This is the cognitive counterpart to the experience of yearning. The grieving person may think that the deceased is somehow still in the cur- rent area of time and space. This can be especially true during the time shortly after the death. In our study of bereaved children, 81% of the children felt watched by their dead parent 4 months after the death, and this experience continued for many of the children (66%) 2 years after the death. Some found this sense of presence comforting, while others did not and were scared by it (Worden, 1996).
05y4 | Hallucinations
2fb0 | Hallucinations of both the visual type and the auditory type are included in this list of normal behaviors because hallucinations can be a frequent experience of the bereaved. They are usually transient illu- sory experiences, often occurring within a few weeks following the loss, and generally do not portend a more difficult or complicated mourn- ing experience. Although disconcerting to some, many others find these experiences comforting. With all the interest in mysticism and spiritual- ity, it is interesting to speculate whether these are really hallucinations or possibly some other kind of metaphysical phenomenon (Kersting, 2004).
