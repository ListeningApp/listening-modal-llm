That list led into a talk, which has since led to this book. Thank you, Corey! Thank you, clients!\nix7t | Many nonmonogamous people have secure, loving, healthy relationships with multiple partners, and this book is my attempt at lifting the lens of monogamy from attachment research so that we can apply all this wonderful knowledge about human connection and bonding to a nonmonogamous context. As far as my editors and I know, this is the first book to explicitly translate the principles of attachment theory to nonmonogamous relationships.\na46e | Part One covers an overview of attachment theory and trauma. In Chapter One, I offer a general description of attachment theory and how different childhood experiences relate to the four different attachment styles that people can develop. Chapter Two explores some aspects of attachment that are less commonly discussed in the mainstream attachment literature. Here we take a look at the different dimensions of attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance as a more precise way to understand the four different attachment styles. I also reframe the attachment styles based on their strengths and desires (not just their dysfunctions), highlighting how insecure attachment styles can also be expressions of the healthy drives for autonomy and connection. I also discuss the importance of the relationship between attachment styles, boundaries and the giving and receiving of love. In Chapter Three, I present the nested model of attachment and trauma, which I developed to further expand the ways in which we conceive of and discuss attachment and trauma. Attachment and trauma occur over multiple levels or dimensions of our human experience, and here I explore these different levels and how they relate to attachment and trauma.\nozpq | Part Two looks at the interaction of nonmonogamy and attachment. In Chapter Four, I explain the different reasons why people engage in nonmonogamy and describe the different types of nonmonogamy based on where people identify their level of sexual exclusivity or non-sexual exclusivity intersecting with how\n22sy | emotionally exclusive or emotionally non-exclusive they are. Chapter Five reviews what the current attachment research says about nonmonogamy, and I share my critique of attachment theory from a nonmonogamous perspective. In Chapter Six, I present the observations and insights into nonmonogamy and attachment that I've gained from my therapeutic and coaching practice. At the end of this chapter I apply the nested model of attachment and trauma to illustrate some of the specific and unique ways that people who practice nonmonogamy experience attachment ruptures and trauma at each of the different levels.\nkuwj | Part Three switches modes into a more practical look at what you and your partners can do to cultivate secure attachment in attachment-based polyamorous relationships. Chapter Seven asks you to get clear about whether or not you are on board for attachment-based relationships and then covers what being a safe haven and secure base might look like for you and your partners. Chapters Eight and Nine guide you through the HEARTS of being polysecure-this acronym articulates six specific things you can do to cultivate secure attachment in your multiple relationships. Chapter Eight focuses on the HEART in HEARTS, looking at how you can enhance your attachment security within and among your relationships, and Chapter Nine focuses on having secure attachment with yourself, an imperative and often overlooked aspect of attachment that I find crucial for nonmonogamy. The book closes with Chapter Ten, where I answer some frequently asked questions and offer my parting words. It is my hope that this book will offer a broader alternative perspective on the application of attachment theory and that as more and more people move forward into the frontiers of nonmonogamy, these mostly uncharted territories will be traversed ethically, lovingly, skillfully and, of course, securely.\nb3n9 | Part One\nev9d | The first section of this book provides an overview of attachment theory, the four secure and insecure attachment styles, the different dimensions of attachment, and the nested model of attachment and trauma. The descriptions of the different attachment styles used in this book have been adapted from and inspired by the work of Diane Poole Heller, Daniel Siegel, Lisa Firestone, Daniel P. Brown, Mario Mikulincer and Phillip R. Shaver.\nsroj | O\nn8ae | CHAPTER ONE AN OVERVIEW OF ATTACHMENT THEORY\nojx4 | HEALTHY ATTACHMENT IS A DEEP BOND and an enduring emotional closeness that connects people to one another across space and time. As human infants, we are born into this world with an attachment system that wires us to expect connection with others. The creator of attachment theory, John Bowlby, called this innate expectation the attachment behavioral system and explained that it is one of several behavioral systems that humans evolved to ensure our survival. As infants, we can't yet meet any of our own needs. So, in order to survive, we have to bond and attach to caretakers who can provide us with food and shelter, as well as meeting our biological and psychological needs for emotional attunement, warm responsiveness and calming physical touch. Popular parenting culture often calls this \"skin time,\" and it's known to be a crucial part of early childhood development.\nskze | When an infant feels fear, distress or discomfort, their attachment system is activated. This prompts them to quickly turn towards their caretakers or use proximity-seeking behaviors such as crying, reaching for, calling out or, later, crawling and following their attachment figure. All these behaviors are attempts to restore feelings of safety, and in many cases to restore actual safety, too. If the child receives the support, reassurance and comfort they need from their caretaker, their nervous system then returns to a state of calm homeostasis. Infants and children who can't yet fully regulate their own emotional states depend on their caretakers to co-regulate for them. Being close with another human helps children to feel calm. Further, being connected to and soothed by their caretakers over time teaches them how to self-soothe and regulate their own emotional states. As children, we want to know that our attachment figures are nearby and accessible. We need to know that they will provide us with a safe haven to turn to when we need them, which then gives us a secure base from which we can explore our environment. Bowlby called this the exploratory behavioral system. When our attachment needs are being met, this system enables us to feel comfortable and free to explore\ns807 | ourselves, others and the world around us.\n9c3r | John Bowlby and Mary Ainsworth's research shows that children develop attachment styles that are more secure or more insecure, depending on how well their parents are able to be a connected and responsive safe haven for them. If their caretakers are able to meet most of their needs enough of the time, children usually have a secure attachment. But if they experience their parents as inconsistent, inaccessible, unresponsive or even threatening and dangerous, they adapt by developing more insecure attachment styles. If our attachment figures were absent or scary to us as children, we didn't develop our ability to freely explore and to learn about the world and about our own abilities. When this happens, we develop insecure strategies for engaging with others-we may become more vigilant and anxious or more avoidant and dismissive.\n```",
