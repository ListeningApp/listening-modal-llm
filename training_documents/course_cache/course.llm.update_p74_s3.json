Areas equals Oceanic islands or Habitat islands on mainlands.\niz66 | Factors that specifically contribute to the S-Area relationship are:\ndndq | One. Large islands are also subject to larger sampling sizes of individuals from species populations thereby increasing the probability of encountering new species; hence a mere sampling phenomenon or artefact of more effective species sampling as N increases\nxzce | Two. As the island size increases, the probability of encountering different habitat types also increases: High landscape heterogeneity: Lakes, mountains, valleys, swamps, oases etc., and such features contain more potential niches that can be filled by species\nw4vd | Biogeography - The Species-Area Model (two)\ncuh0 | Three. Large islands inevitably also contain large populations, and large populations are less vulnerable to local extinction phenomena\nk36t | Four. Large island populations also have higher speciation potentials due to higher population variability contained herein\nz1wx | Five. Large islands inevitably represent larger targets for colonizing species as the probability of encountering the area increases with size\no6gf | Biogeography - The Species-Area Model (three)\n0hs6 | The normal range of Z is zero point two zero to zero point four zero for true oceanic islands and often around zero point two five.\nm05x | Z is only zero point one to zero point two five for recently isolated habitat islands.\nds29 | Z is greater than zero point two six for long-term isolated habitats on the mainland or very large islands such as Australia.\nqcmr | As habitat connectivity increases, the S-Area relationship is reduced â€”> Low z-value\n7c6p | Habitat connectivity is related to habitat diversity and as oceanic islands are more isolated than mainland habitat islands, they display stronger S-Area relationship\nd1ee | Biogeography - The Species-Area Model (four)\nitx4 | Logging both sides of the S-Area power function:\nvwrs | log S equals log C plus z log A\nxjkw | C and Z are constants depending on both habitat type, animal community and is specific to variability in dispersability and mobility of the species herein.\nwght | In a x-y logarithmic plot, log C is the intercept on the y-axis, and z denotes the graph slope.\n3lgb | The z-value denotes how strong the S and A relationship is\nttwt | MacArthur-Wilson's Equilibrium Theory (one)\nx5l2 | Modelling species number on true islands: S depends on two independent variables: One. Immigration rate. Two. Extinction rate.\nilrs | S is determined when an equilibrium between I and E rates is obtained\n0a03 | As S increases, I rate is lowered as potential niche space is occupied\nauae | In contrast when S increases then E rate increases due to increased interspecific competition\n5b6y | Small islands have high E and low I rates: They are small targets and have small vulnerable populations; the opposite is the case for large islands; high I and low E\n1y10 | Immigration rate\n6mnx | Distance to mainland also a factor for I rate: Distance islands have low I and close islands have higher I.\ntynp | Thus, S is highest on large islands nearby mainland, and smallest on small islands far from the mainland\nob0u | MacArthur-Wilson's Equilibrium Theory (two)\n50o1 | Extinction Rate: Depends on One. Island Size, Two. Distance to mainland\ncw76 | Island Size: Large islands have larger populations, hence genetic population variability is high and populations therefore more resilient towards predators, diseases, and stochastic detrimental events.\nlkk5 | Distance to mainland: If close to mainland, extinctions may be delayed by regular immigration, thus compensating for the species loss over time\nmolj | MacArthur-Wilson's Equilibrium Theory (three)\n5pto | Immigration Rate: Depends on One. Island Size, Two. Distance to mainland.\nmo6k | Island Size: A large island represents a greater target for colonisers with higher probability of colonization.\nzh6q | Distance to mainland: If the distance is short, the likeliness of species colonizing from the mainland is higher than for more remote islands, to which many species may have difficulties in reaching successfully.\nkp04 | In effect species number is highest on large islands close to the mainland and smallest on small islands far away from the mainland\n3e8r | Modelling Species Number on Habitat Islands\n8g7g | On habitat islands, species numbers depend on One. Speciation rate and Two. Extinction rate.\n5j4f | Immigration plays a minor role on the large scale and is replaced by speciation processes.\n4xe7 | However, if habitat connectivity is high between islands, immigration from species rich areas is important in ecological time frame; speciation only evolutionary time frame\npg4b | Speciation Rate\nb0d0 | Fewer empty niches reduce the chances of adaptive radiation by virtue of reducing character displacement processes\nd7eu | Extinction Rate\nxndr | As species saturation increases interspecific competition increases extinction rate through the competitive exclusion principle.\nm6hi | Summary - Niche Partitioning & Species Richness (one)\nvpkf | One. Species richness and the niche concept are interrelated and determined by:\n4d67 | Niche dimensionality and differentiation: Related to habitat heterogeneity\ne7j2 | Niche width and shape: Narrow and leptokurtic niches increase diversity\nlqzt | Niche overlap and competitive coefficient: Complementarity increase S\n1ocm | Two. Species richness and niches also interrelated with the habitat.\n527v | Habitat complexity: Both vertical and horizontal heterogeneity increase S\nlrri | Habitat area: Large and interconnected habitat areas increase richness\n5cl9 | Summary - Niche Partitioning & Species Richness\nu7a3 | Three. The species-area model explains the number of species on islands\nw409 | True islands: z-value higher than on mainland islands\nm04y | z equals zero point two zero to zero point four zero, z approximately zero point two five. Mainland islands: Lower than for true islands, z greater than zero point two six, Lakes: Similar to mainland islands but largely depends on connecting rivers.\n23jk | Four. The theory of island biogeography and species richness depend on\noa63 | Area size: Large size has larger populations and higher habitat heterogeneity\ne3lv | Distance to mainland: Nearness leads to higher colonization rate\nrqv6 | S increases Habitat connectivity: Low connectivity means lower colonization rate\noa48 | Speciation-extinction dynamics: Related to time and population size or area\n3fp1 | Lecture Seven - Foraging Theory\n557x | What is Optimal Foraging Theory, O P T?\nep8e | It is a behavioral ecology model that helps predict how an animal behaves when searching for food\n7mv3 | Aim of the Optimal Foraging Theory\nder6 | To predict the foraging strategy of a forager or predator to be expected under specified condition\n8xg2 | Important terminologies\nnjvp | Ideal Free Distribution theory - theory which makes a case of uniform distribution of food for predators such that there is no need for foragers to switch foraging patches.\ns8b5 | Functional response - deals with a predator's intake rate in response to variation in prey distribution and densities\n```",
