        "content": "yhb2 | And there is another, Himalayan block, which we scarcely consider. It is that for two thousand years the West has been under a most terrible tyranny, the Christian religion. I am aware that at this point, readers are sighing, thinking vaguely, 'How very nineteenth century.' But it was, historically speaking, an extremely short time ago. I have met people who came into conflict with the churches, when all they wanted was to opt out of certainties and dogma into agnosticism. Wives and husbands left them, they lost jobs, were socially ostracised, were cast off from families - and went to the colonies. There I met them, as a child. Now the churches have a benevolent, harmless aspect, half social agency, half genial bully; they cajole people into thinking that they really have to be born again, or belong to something or other. But for two thousand years we were kept in a mental straitjacket, and even the most limited rebellion was horribly punished. Luther's was limited. He said, I insist on the right to talk with God directly, without the mediation of the church. He did not say, For many thousands of years\n4f8w | there have been people in this world who have had the techniques, the information, to enable those with sufficient preparation to make use of these tools, to achieve states of mind, or of spirit, that the churches know nothing about. But at this point I have to make it clear that Sufism respects all religions, saying that the Truth is at the core of each. It is the tyrant, benevolent or wicked, who has to be exposed. What I would like to know is this: how is it that, understanding that our culture has had two millennia of a certain kind of indoctrination, we, our scientists, are not researching the effects on our mental processes? For these effects are there; once you begin thinking on these lines, they are very evident. It is as if the ban, the ukase, the no of the churches into thinking about, for instance, what Jesus and his associates were really thinking (for the Sufis claim Jesus as one of the real Teachers of mankind, whose message has been obliterated by institutions) had been absorbed into the very stuff of our minds, making it impossible for us to look in certain directions.\nvusg | And this no can operate in the minds of scientists as strongly as in anyone's.\nzde4 | What I am sketchily, inadequately, outlining here is a whole series of blocks and impediments that amount to a mental prison. Well, the Sufis say we live in such a prison, and it is their concern to give us the equipment to free ourselves. We are all conditioned, as we now claim so easily and trippingly; but perhaps being able to say that it is not enough to enable us to see how.\n5dpg | If we want to approach the Sufis, their ways of looking at life, at some point it is necessary to swallow the unpalatable fact that they think of us as backward, barbarian, ill-equipped, ill-informed, and primitive, with closed minds in areas where it is vital to our futures that we open them.\nye74 | Meanwhile, Shah most patiently answers the questions he has been asked, waiting and hoping for questions that are more educated, more sophisticated, based on better information and self-understanding.",
