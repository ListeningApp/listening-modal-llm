You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

dixj | Romantic relationships in Western society are still fraught with prescriptions and restrictions that inhibit nontraditional expressions of love, and many of us suffer greatly from this. As the landscape of romantic love continues to expand and monogamy is no longer the only possible course of action that a relationship can take, our societal notions, as well as our psychological models of love and part- nership, also need to grow and include relationship structures beyond the monog- amous norm.
a3t5 | Attachment theory offers an important-even revolutionary-framework for understanding the biological and psychological necessity of being securely bonded to others. The psychological model also allows insight into how disruptions in
jlbs | attachment can create significant challenges in the giving and receiving of the love and affection we so desire with our partners. Research has consistently demon- strated that understanding our different attachment styles and using this knowl- edge to move into more secure functioning with a partner is an important compo- nent in creating fulfilling and sustaining relationships. Attachment theory was developed in the 1960s by British psychologist John Bowlby,2 but in the past sev- eral years, it has expanded its reach outside of the academic and therapeutic spheres, becoming more popularized in general public discourse regarding per- sonal healing, parenting, dating, marriages and relationships.
6aui | Many people who practice ethical nonmonogamy (who often proudly describe themselves as relationship geeks) have been drawn to attachment theory as a way to further enhance their general knowledge about relationships. The theory is also more specifically used to support nonmonogamous people in comprehending and working with the distinct challenges and patterns that arise when someone has multiple partners. While therapeutic practices based on attachment theory have be- come some of the most effective and well-researched modalities for couples ther- apy, how it applies to nonmonogamous relationships can be unclear. To no sur- prise, the majority of resources and advice available on how to create securely at- tached romantic relationships assume monogamy. Whether intentionally or not, these resources encourage highly mononormative practices, often leaving people who are nonmonogamous at a loss in how to create secure bonds with their mul- tiple partners.
y7r5 | Several years ago, I was in a polyamorous relationship with a partner named Corey. At that time, I lived with my husband and our child, and Corey lived in a nearby town with his primary partner. One day Corey admitted to having an anx- ious attachment style. We both wanted our relationship to be a close and con- nected one, but we also knew that living together and blending our families was not in the cards for us, so we began to wonder how we could establish more se- cure functioning together without the boost in security that comes from either liv- ing with a partner, being primaries, sharing finances or having a child together.
nhpx | We began to listen to an audio version of one of the better books on attach- ment, eagerly jumping ahead to the section instructing us on the specific things we could do to build secure attachment in our romantic relationship. Being someone who is a minority in several areas of my life, I was already habitually accustomed to having to reinterpret information and advice, automatically translating the typical normative discourses in whatever I was reading to garner any and all kernels of wisdom that I could actually apply to my own life. Corey, however, was not used to having to code switch like this. Taking a more literal read on the chapter, he was left discouraged and concluded that he and I would never achieve secure attach- ment since we were unable to do over half of the suggested attachment behaviors. I was initially surprised by this because when I read the very same section I had been hopeful. When I paused to consider why I had such a different take on the very same chapter, I realized that my optimism didn't actually come from the au- thor's encouragement, but because I was quick to sift the useful from the useless and the relevant from the irrelevant to our nonmonogamous context. But Corey's perspective was illuminating for me because he was right-if we couldn't do the majority of the advised activities, what were we really left with?
2yc2 | Around the same time, several of my nonmonogamous clients also began ex- pressing similar grievances. Like me and Corey, they wanted secure attachment with all of their partners, but they felt demoralized and even pathologized when they read about attachment. They were unable to find themselves or fit themselves into the mononormativity of the literature on attachment, since they were unable to partake in many of the behaviors that experts recommend as required for secure relationships. Even though I was able to translate, sift through and reframe what I was reading from the mainstream books and audio programs in order to apply it to my polyamorous relationships and nonmonogamous clients, I realized that this didn't mean that others-even highly intelligent others like Corey or my clients- could or would do the same. And they shouldn't have to, because secure attach- ment is not just for the monogamous. So, I took on Corey's and my clients' under- standable discouragement as a personal and professional challenge. I promised
eehg | Corey that I would at least come up with a list of things that we could do to cultivate a secure attachment that didn't require us to live together, be exclusive or even be each other's primary partner. That list led into a talk, which has since led to this book. Thank you, Corey! Thank you, clients!
ght4 | Many nonmonogamous people have secure, loving, healthy relationships with multiple partners, and this book is my attempt at lifting the lens of monogamy from attachment research so that we can apply all this wonderful knowledge about human connection and bonding to a nonmonogamous context. As far as my edi- tors and I know, this is the first book to explicitly translate the principles of attach- ment theory to nonmonogamous relationships.
