        "content": "hx9e | Aaron Lazare, an early colleague at Massachusetts General Hospital, talked about two kinds of loss that are directly related to this concept of disenfranchised grief. Socially negated losses are those losses that society treats as nonlosses. An example of this would be pregnancy loss, either spontaneous or induced. The second kind of loss related to disenfranchised grief would be socially unspeakable losses. These are specific losses about which the mourner has a difficult time talking. Common examples would be death by suicide and death by AIDS. Both of these losses carry some stigma in the broader society. One intervention that can be helpful to those experiencing these types of losses is assisting them in talking about them and exploring their thoughts and feelings about the death. Re-enfranchising suggestions for these types of losses can be found in Chapter Seven of this volume.\nywn2 | Introduction\na63r | CONTINUING BONDS\ndqvj | Attachments to the deceased that are maintained rather than relinquished have been called continuing bonds. This is not an entirely new concept. Shuchter and Zisook noted that widows in their seminal conjugal bereavement studies in San Diego maintained a sense of their loved ones' presence for several years after the death. In the Harvard Child Bereavement Study, Silverman, Nickman, and Worden observed ongoing connections with the deceased parent among a large number of these bereaved school-age children. For most it was a positive experience; for some it was not. The book by Klass, Silverman, and Nickman titled Continuing Bonds: New Understandings of Grief pulled together information from our study and several others to promote the notion that some people stay connected with the deceased rather than emotionally withdrawing, as was the notion previously promoted by Freud.\nr17u | This new concept was not embraced by all and questions soon arose as to whether continuing bonds can be adaptive for some and maladaptive for others. Are continuing bonds actually associated with a healthy ongoing life? A lot of this controversy is based on the lack of good research evidence for the efficacy of continuing bonds. As more research is done, some of these questions will be resolved. Essentially, the questions center around four main issues: What types of bonds are the most helpful in the adaptation to loss? These would include objects from the deceased (linking and transitional objects, keepsakes), a sense of the deceased's presence, talking to the deceased, introjecting the deceased's beliefs and values, taking on characteristics of the deceased, and the like. For whom are continuing bonds helpful, and for whom are they not? This necessitates the identification of subgroups of mourners; the concept should not be applied to everyone. One promising approach to this is to look at the mourner's attachment style in relationship to the deceased. In the case of anxious attachments that can lead to chronic grief, holding onto the deceased may not be adaptive. Some mourners need to relinquish and move on. In what time frame are continuing bonds the most adaptive and when are they less adaptive-closer to the loss, farther from the loss? What is the impact of religious and cultural differences on maintaining healthy bonds? This would include beliefs and rituals that promote a connection and memorialization of the deceased cross-culturally in various societies. More on bonds can be found in Chapter Two.\n3c47 | Grief Counseling and Grief Therapy\ng345 | MEANING MAKING\nsvhz | Meaning reconstruction and meaning making, concepts introduced and promoted by psychologist Robert Neimeyer, have been an important emphasis in the field over the past twenty years. He sees meaning reconstruction as the central process faced by bereaved individuals. This reconstruction is primarily accomplished through the use of narratives or life stories. When unanticipated or incongruous events such as the death of a loved one occur, a person needs to redefine the self and relearn ways to engage with the world without the deceased. The person cannot return to a pre-loss level of functioning but learns how to develop a meaningful life without the deceased loved one. This is central to my third task of mourning, in which the mourner must learn to adjust to a world without the deceased. Death can challenge one's assumptions about the world (spiritual adjustments) and one's personal identity (internal adjustments). Bereaved individuals have serious questions such as: \"What will my life look like now?\" \"What did the deceased's life mean?\" \"How can I feel safe in a world such as this?\" and \"Who am I now that this death has occurred?\".\noaen | I think it is important to note, however, that some deaths do not challenge personal meaning making in any fundamental way. Davis, Wortman, Lehman, and Silver conducted research on two different bereaved populations and found that twenty percent to thirty percent of the bereaved individuals appeared to function well without engaging in the process of meaning making. Of those who searched for meaning, fewer than half of the individuals found it even over a year after the death. Those who did find meaning, however, were better adjusted than those who searched and did not find it. But, interestingly, for some, the quest to understand continued even after meaning was found.\n5u67 | Neimeyer, commenting on the Davis research, makes note that the majority in the studies were struggling with meaning making and these should be helped with this process. But, he cautions the counselor about initiating this process if it does not occur spontaneously. He concludes his comments with an important distinction: meaning making is a process, not an outcome or achievement. The meanings associated with death loss are constantly revised. We see this clearly in our work with bereaved children, who, as they age and pass through new developmental stages, ask: \"What would my parent be like now?\" and \"What would our relationship be like now that I am graduating college, getting married, etc.?\". More on meaning making as a task of mourning can be found in Chapter Two.\ndvms | Introduction\nqrd3 | RESILIENCE\nrxrg | When Phyllis Silverman and I studied one hundred twenty-five parentally bereaved children over a two-year period after the death, we noted that children fell into one of three groups. The first was the group of children (approximately twenty percent) who were not doing well during the two years after the death. Since our research grant came from the National Institute of Mental Health for a study intended to identify bereaved children at-risk and prevent problem outcomes, this group became a major focus of our study. Could we identify at-risk children early after the loss so that early intervention might be offered to prevent later negative sequelae from the death? However, we also noticed a second smaller group of children who seemed to be doing very well, and we identified them as resilient children. Their academic performance, social life, communication about the deceased, self-worth, sense of control, and healthy identification with the deceased parent were all on the high side. The third and largest group was the group making do during the first two years of bereavement.",
