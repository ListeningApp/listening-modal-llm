        "content": "cp13 | As expected, the cross section of the FP state in Figure seven C is isotropic and exhibits a single broad peak centered at Q equals zero mainly caused by the component S sub Z Z parallel to the external field. The contributions in S sub alpha beta left-brace X comma Y right-brace comma left-brace beta in left-brace X comma Y comma Z right-brace right-parenthesis are attributed to finite-size effects, caused by a helical winding of angle bracket S sub R angle bracket near the boundaries due to the strong DMI interaction (see Figure two). The azimuthal average of the cross section in Figure seven C, defined as left-parenthesis two pi right-parenthesis to the power of negative one integral from zero to two pi D phi left-parenthesis D sigma over D omega right-parenthesis can be well described by the form factor of a uniformly polarized thin circular disk with a radius R corresponding to the cluster radius, i.e., D sigma over D omega left-parenthesis Q right-parenthesis proportional to left-bracket two J sub one left-parenthesis Q R right-parenthesis over left-parenthesis Q R right-parenthesis right-bracket squared , where J sub one left-parenthesis Z right-parenthesis the first-order Bessel function. To highlight this play the first two minima of left-bracket J sub one left-parenthesis Q R right-parenthesis over left-parenthesis Q R right-parenthesis right-bracket squared for R equals four A by dotted white lines in Figure seven C and find a very good agreement to the numerical data of the discrete system. The HS state in Figure seven A is characterized by a superposition of spin spirals with wave vectors Q not equal to zero, resulting in six pronounced Bragg peaks in S sub Z Z left-parenthesis Q right-parenthesis period. We observe in the SK phase a superposition of the two extreme limits: In particular, we find a Bragg peak at Q equals zero, together with an off-diagonal Bragg ring caused by the radial polarization winding of the skyrmion [see Figure seven B]. The radius of the skyrmion can be as R sub zero equals Q sub zero to the power negative one approximately three A with Q sub zero approximately equal to one over left-parenthesis three A right-parenthesis the momentum Q not equal to zero ring, consistent with the estimate given in Figure three. Hence, the predicted quantum skyrmion profile yields a distinct signature in the measurable neutron scattering cross section and allows a determination of its size. We want to stress that a classical spin\nbgre | profile compatible to the normalized quantum mechanical expectation values can lead to a cross section in qualitative agreement with the ones reported here. However, quantitative deviations are expected because, for classical systems, the spin-spin correlation functions factorize since the zero temperature configuration is nondegenerate for B equals zero. Therefore, a direct measurement of the connected spin-spin correlation function left-parenthesis a comma R O beta comma R right-parenthesis minus left-parenthesis a comma R right-parenthesis left-parenthesis O beta comma R right-parenthesis will differentiate classical from quantum skyrmion states at zero temperature. Classical and quantum states also differ locally in the spin norm, which is not necessarily conserved in general | S sub R | less than or equal to one-half. We find that the domain wall spin norm at the outer rim of the skyrmion, where the concurrence is large, is about four percent lower compared to the field-polarized environment.\n57lp | Six. QUANTUM SKYRMION LATTICE PHASE\nukth | After having discussed the properties of individual quantum skyrmions in the preceding paragraphs, we now turn to the phase diagram of the system. Our numerical technique makes it possible to reach system sizes much larger than that of individual skyrmions, which in principle allows us to extrapolate toward a phase diagram in the thermodynamic limit. While the HS and the FP phase remain unchanged when increasing the system size, at intermediate magnetic fields, the ground state for large lattices features a regular lattice of quantum skyrmions, labeled S K X. Similarly to their classical analogs, the individual skyrmions form a dense packing, and for larger system sizes, we thus find quantum skyrmion chains and lattices, for which we plot examples in Figure eight.\nkpvt | We elucidate the appearance and robustness of quantum skyrmion lattices as a function of the external magnetic field, the strength of DMI, and perturbations of the form Equation two due to uniaxial anisotropy. For this calculation, we have concentrated on a triangular lattice with disk boundary conditions of diameter L equals nine sites, for which we obtain a single centered skyrmion for B equals J equals negative zero point five D in the unperturbed case K equals zero [see Figure two E]. We relax the fine-tuned parameter lines of Figure two by variations of B, J, and consider nonzero uniaxial anisotropies for J less than zero by varying K.\njie2 | Based on our simulations, we predict the existence of at least three distinct quantum phases of our model: (i) a region hosting HS states for weak field amplitudes, (ii) a valley for field strengths of the order of B approximately negative zero point five D, which features a lattice formed by quantum skyrmions of radius R approximately three A labeled S K X three A, and (iii) an FP phase where spins align parallel to the external field.",
