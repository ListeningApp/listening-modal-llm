Upon D A release from the soma and dendrites, D A binds to somatodendritic D two receptors, which activates hyperpolarizing G protein-gated inwardly rectifying potassium channel, or G I R K, currents resulting in reduced firing rate and excitability of V T A D A neurons. While both axonal and somatodendritic D two receptors reduce D A signalling onto medium spiny neuron in the N Ac, it is unclear how regulation of D A signalling via axonal and somatodendritic D two receptors is intertwined and whether treatments, that change efferent axonal D A release, also cause similar changes in local somatodendritic D A release. Additionally, neuronal D A signalling is modulated by surrounding astrocytes, along with microglia and oligodendrocytes, which are important for the homeostasis of the brain microenvironment.\nojro | One point three. Operationalization of dopamine-dependent reward behaviour\nl6t9 | As a result, D A signalling between V T A and ventral striatum portrays two specific signals, both of which are affected by a plethora of regulatory influences equally important to guide reward-seeking behaviour and: One, D A functions as a learning signal by encoding the difference between an expected and received reward guiding future reward-seeking behaviour and Two, it encodes motivation to approach a possible reward. With both signals combined, D A conveys the decision variable \"available reward for investment of effort\", which is employed for both learning and motivational functions. Studies assessing reward-seeking behaviour encoded by the D A midbrain in animals or humans employ many different tasks, each addressing a combination of the different aspects of reward-seeking behaviour guided by learned associations. In animals, food, in particular palatable food high in sugar and fat, or addictive drugs are often used as rewards, the approach thereof, its retrieval and consumption as well as the effort exerted to obtain the reward (lever pressing) are measured to quantify motivation. Place preference conditioned by reward-predicting stimuli and learning of reward magnitude, such as indicated by size of lick bursts in a reward licking task, and reward retrieval, such as in a T-maze or three chamber arena, are widely used to analyze learning behaviour. In humans, self-report questionnaires, a variety of motivation and learning tasks in combination with functional magnetic resonance imaging or f M R I or positron emission tomography or P E T have been leveraged to disentangle the underlying mechanisms. While we here focus on D A-encoded reward-responsiveness, it needs to be kept in mind, that apart from the difficulty of deciphering the many aspects of reward-seeking behaviour and the varied molecular regulators, reward-seeking behaviour is also affected by further cell types in the V T A and N Ac, such as the V T A glutamate neurons, G A B A neurons and local opioid signalling.\n1ujy | Two. Insulin signalling in the brain\nqzor | Motivated behaviour - particularly food-seeking - critically depends on an organism's metabolic need and energy storage (e.g. an apple appears more valuable when we are hungry than when we just had lunch). Therefore, homeostatic information is integrated with external cues in the midbrain D A system through multiple pathways to ensure goal-directed adaptive behaviour. One of these pathways comprises metabolic hormones, which bind to their respective receptors in the D A midbrain to convey the current homeostatic state. In particular, insulin receptors are densely expressed in D A circuits.\na0by | Secreted in the pancreas, insulin reaches the C N S through the bloodstream and crosses the blood-brain barrier through a saturable\nu1ky | transport system. Rodent studies indicate that a small proportion of insulin is also directly synthesized in the brain, predominantly by neurons and neuronal progenitor cells of the olfactory bulb and the hippocampus. In particular, G A B A-ergic neurogliaform cells have been identified as potential producers of insulin in the C N S. However, whether this C N S-derived insulin is physiologically relevant is still controversial and, so far, there is no evidence for local insulin production in the human brain.\nhtm9 | In the brain, insulin receptors are ubiquitously expressed on neurons and glial cells, with the highest density in the olfactory bulb and the limbic areas. In contrast to adult peripheral tissues, where the long receptor isoform B predominates, neurons almost exclusively express the short isoform A, lacking twelve amino acids within the C-terminus of the alpha-subunit, but glial cells primarily express I R-B. In contrast to I R-B, I R-A has a two-fold higher sensitivity for insulin and can also bind I G F-One.\n8hul | Two point one. Intracellular pathways activated by insulin\n87vz | Insulin unfolds its action by binding to the extracellular alpha-subunit of the insulin receptor, which causes dimerization and autophosphorylation of the intracellular beta-subunit.\nym66 | This induces two canonical signalling pathways: One, the P I three K slash A K T pathway via tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate proteins, or I R S, supported by the adaptor molecule S H two B one and Two, the mitogen-activated protein kinase or M A P K pathways via phosphorylation of Shc and or I R S.\n```",
