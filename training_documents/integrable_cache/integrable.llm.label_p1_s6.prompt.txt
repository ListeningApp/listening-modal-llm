  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

o2kr | Too Close to Integrable: Crossover from Normal to Anomalous Heat Diffusion
v6sk | Energy transport in one-dimensional chains of particles with three conservation laws is generically anomalous and belongs to the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang dynamical universality class. Surprisingly, some examples where an apparent normal heat diffusion is found over a large range of length scales were reported. We propose a novel physical explanation of these intriguing observations. We develop a scaling analysis which explains how this may happen in the vicinity of an integrable limit, such as, but not only, the famous Toda model. In this limit, heat transport is mostly supplied by quasi-particles with a very large mean free path l. Upon increasing the system size L, three different regimes can be observed: a ballistic one, an intermediate diffusive range, and, eventually, the crossover to the anomalous (hydrodynamic) regime. Our theoretical considerations are supported by numerical simulations of a gas of diatomic hard-point particles for almost equal masses and of a weakly perturbed Toda chain. Finally, we discuss the case of the perturbed harmonic chain, which exhibits a yet different scenario.
1wj6 | After more than twenty years of theoretical research there is a general consensus that energy transport in one and two-dimensional systems is anomalous, meaning that Fourier's law is invalid [1-3]. Numerics [4-6] as well as hy- drodynamic [7, 8] and kinetic [9-11] theories consistently indicate that the nonlinear interactions of fluctuations of conserved quantities yield, in reduced space-dimension, non standard relaxation and transport properties, even in the linear response regime. The main signature of the anomaly is the divergence of the thermal conduc- tivity k with the system size L, i.e. a superdiffusive heat transport. In one-dimension, although this is a gen- uine many-body problem, it can be described effectively as an ensemble of Lévy particles, namely random walk- ers performing free ballistic steps with finite velocity for times that are power-law distributed [12]. This descrip- tion accounts quantitatively for several non-equilibrium properties, both transient and stationary [6, 13-15]. Re- markably, the phenomenon was shown to belong to the class of the famous Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation [16, 17], suggesting a universal behavior with implications for the theory of transport in nano-sized objects like in- dividual nanowires [18], nanotubes [19] or polymers [20]. In this general context, nanowires and single-walled nan- otubes have been analyzed to look for deviations from the standard Fourier's law [19]. Experimental evidence of such deviations has been reported for single-walled car- bon nanotubes [19, 21] (see also Ref. [22]). Non-trivial length dependence of thermal conductance has been also observed in molecular chains [23]. Transport anomalies can be even exploited to achieve optimal efficiency of thermal to electric energy conversion [24, 25].
936l | Although the general framework is pretty well under- stood, there are still open issues that escaped so far a convincing explanation. For definiteness, we focus on anharmonic chains, represented by a Hamiltonian of the form
06yq | H :
dpv6 | n + U (qn+1 -qn)| , (1)
8r5j | where mn, qn and pn are respectively the mass, dis- placement and momentum of the nth particle. For a generic potential U, this family of models should show superdiffusive heat transport in the KPZ universality class, as confirmed by several studies [26, 27]. How- ever, there is evidence of significant deviations of the dy- namical exponents in some models with hard-core poten- tial [28]. Moreover, chains allowing for bond dissociation (like e.g Lennard-Jones, Morse, and Coulomb potentials) unexpectedly display finite thermal conductivity [29, 30], while other similar potentials closely follow the prediction of anomalous scaling [31]. For the double-well poten- tial, an intermediate-energy regime with almost diffusive transport has been reported [32, 33].
2taz | Another, more surprising feature is the (apparent) normal diffusive heat transport observed at low ener- gies in asymmetric potentials [34] like the Fermi-Pasta- Ulam-Tsingou-aß (FPUT) chain, where mn = m and Uaß(y) = y2/2 + ay3/3 + By4/4. Yet, more compelling evidence of a seemingly normal transport has been found in a Toda lattice under the action of an additional con- servative noise [35] and in the diatomic Hard Point Gas (HPG) [36]. In the first context, successive studies
o3ya | demonstrated that the diffusive regime is a finite-size ef- fect, whereby anomalous behavior is recovered for <LATEX>L</LATEX> large enough [37, 38] (see also the discussion based on mode- coupling arguments in Ref. [39]).
r5il | In this Letter we present a general explanation of the counter-intuitive normal transport, by tracing it back to the vicinity to an integrable limit. In this context, the kinetics is dominated by quasi-particles (those associated to the integrals of motion of the integrable regime, e.g., solitons) over a broad range of scales. In fact, this range extends beyond the very large quasi-particle mean free path, where a purely ballistic behavior is expected. More specifically, we proceed by first devising a finite-size scal- ing approach and then validating the theoretical argu- ments with the numerical analysis of a few test models.
5gui | Let the parameter <LATEX>\varepsilon</LATEX> denote the distance from the in- tegrable limit <LATEX>\left( \varepsilon = 0 \right.</LATEX> corresponding to the perfectly in- tegrable regime). Building upon the intuition contained in Ref. [40], we propose that for small &, the heat flux <LATEX>J \left( L , \varepsilon \right)</LATEX> can be written as the sum of two terms,
82qc | <LATEX>J \left( L , \varepsilon \right) = J _ { N } \left( L , \varepsilon \right) + J _ { A } \left( L , \varepsilon \right) .</LATEX> (2)
ls7d | <LATEX>J _ { A } \text { is the }</LATEX> hydrodynamic contribution, arising from the mutual interaction among density, energy, and momen- tum fluctuations, and responsible for the asymptotic su- perdiffusion. For <LATEX>L \rightarrow \infty ,</LATEX> <LATEX>J _ { A } \approx L ^ { \eta - 1 }</LATEX> with <LATEX>\eta = 1 / 3</LATEX> in systems belonging to the KPZ class [16, 17], while <LATEX>\eta = 1 / 2</LATEX> in some special cases, like models with sym- metric interaction potentials (e.g, <LATEX>\mathrm { F P U T } - \beta</LATEX> chain with potential <LATEX>\left. U _ { \beta } \left( y \right) = y ^ { 2 } / 2 + y ^ { 4 } / 4 \right)</LATEX> and models subject to conservative noise (e.g., the noisy harmonic [40, 41] or nonlinear [35, 42] chains). <LATEX>J _ { N }</LATEX> is a kinetic contribution, accounting for the energy transported by weakly inter- acting quasi-particles.
tzt3 | On the basis of standard kinetic arguments, <LATEX>J _ { N }</LATEX> is ex- pected to be a function of a single compound variable, the effective length <LATEX>\xi = L / \ell</LATEX> expressed in units of the mean free path <LATEX>\ell</LATEX> of the quasi particles,
t8vv | <LATEX>J _ { N } \left( L , \varepsilon \right) = j _ { N } \left( L / \ell \right) .</LATEX> (3)
qvnu | For <LATEX>\xi \gg 1 ,</LATEX> we expect <LATEX>j _ { N } \left( \xi \right) \propto 1 / \xi ,</LATEX> meaning that the flux is the result of a standard diffusive process, while <LATEX>j _ { N } \left( 0 \right)</LATEX> is a finite value, meaning that the process is ballistic for system sizes smaller than the mean free path <LATEX>\left( \xi \ll 1 \right) .</LATEX> <LATEX>j _ { N } \left( \xi \right)</LATEX> dependence is captured by the simple effective formula
kggw | <LATEX>j _ { N } \left( \xi \right) = \frac { j _ { 0 } } { r + \xi }</LATEX> (4)
xrd1 | where <LATEX>r</LATEX> is a constant accounting for the boundary resis- tance [43] and <LATEX>j _ { 0 }</LATEX> is a suitable additional constant.
5746 | The vicinity to the integrable limit manifests itself as a divergence of the mean free path, which we account for by assuming <LATEX>\ell \approx \varepsilon ^ { - \theta } ,</LATEX> where <LATEX>\theta > 0</LATEX> is a system-dependent
7toz | exponent. As long as <LATEX>J _ { A } \left( L , \varepsilon \right)</LATEX> does not display any singu- larity for <LATEX>\varepsilon \rightarrow 0</LATEX> (we return to this point in the final part of the Letter), we can neglect its dependence <LATEX>\mathrm { o n } \varepsilon \left( \mathrm { f o r } \right.</LATEX> <LATEX>\varepsilon \ll 1</LATEX> 1). Therefore, for large <LATEX>L ,</LATEX> Eq. (2) can be rewritten as
j346 | <LATEX>J \left( L , \varepsilon \right) \approx \frac { c _ { N } } { L \varepsilon ^ { \theta } } + \frac { c _ { A } } { L ^ { 1 - \eta } } ,</LATEX> , (5)
v8uq | where CN and <LATEX>c _ { A }</LATEX> are two suitable parameters. Accord- ingly, the anomalous contribution prevails only above the crossover length <LATEX>\ell _ { c } \approx \varepsilon ^ { - \theta / \eta } .</LATEX> For <LATEX>L \leq \ell _ { c } ,</LATEX> heat conduc- tion is dominated by the <LATEX>j _ { N } .</LATEX> In particular, within the range <LATEX>\left[ \ell = \varepsilon ^ { - \theta } , \ell _ { c } \right]</LATEX> an apparent normal conductivity is expected, which is nothing but a finite size effect.
x972 | Now, we start the numerical analysis, focusing on mod- els of the class (1). More specifically, we shall consider the chain [47, 48] with inter-
cwrw | <LATEX>U _ { T } \left( y \right) = \left( e ^ { - y } + y - 1 \right) .</LATEX> The HPG dynamics consists of successive tween neighboring particles according to the kinematic rules
4i0e | <LATEX>u _ { i } ^ { \prime } = \frac { m _ { i } - m _ { i + 1 } } { m _ { i } + m _ { i + 1 } } u _ { i } + \frac { 2 m _ { i + 1 } } { m _ { i } + m _ { i + 1 } } u _ { i + 1 } \quad ,</LATEX> <LATEX>u _ { i + 1 } ^ { \prime } = \frac { 2 m _ { i } } { m _ { i } + m _ { i + 1 } } u _ { i } - \frac { m _ { i } - m _ { i + 1 } } { m _ { i } + m _ { i + 1 } } u _ { i + 1 } ,</LATEX> (6)
h2l3 | where <LATEX>u _ { n } = \dot { q } _ { n }</LATEX> and the primed variables denote the values after the collision. Simulations are very efficient since they only require keeping track of the collisions [46].
dfzb | For equal masses <LATEX>\left( m _ { n } = m \right) ,</LATEX> both models are com- pletely integrable: in the HPG, the constants of motion are the initial velocities, while in the Toda model the conserved actions are given functions of positions and momenta [49, 50]. Both models can be seen as gases of quasi-particles: velocitons for HPG [51] and solitons for Toda [47]. Transport is ballistic: <LATEX>\kappa \left( L \right)</LATEX> is proportional to <LATEX>L</LATEX> and the energy-current correlation function does not decay to zero at large times [52, 53]. Note that, accord- ing to the classification of Ref. [54], the two models are noninteracting and interacting, respectively.
u6ty | Here below, we consider two different ways of break- ing integrability (i.e. to induce interactions among the quasi-particles): (i) different masses, such as a diatomic arrangement whereby <LATEX>m _ { n } = m _ { 1 } = \frac { M } { 2 } \left( 1 - \delta \right)</LATEX> <LATEX>\left( m _ { n } = \right.</LATEX> <LATEX>\left. m _ { 2 } = \frac { M } { 2 } \left( 1 + \delta \right) \right)</LATEX> for odd (even) n [44-46]; (ii) a con- servative noise through random collisions exchanging the momenta of neighboring particles at a given rate <LATEX>\gamma</LATEX> [35] (see also a related model in Ref. [55]). In the former (latter) case <LATEX>\delta \left( \gamma \right)</LATEX> plays the role of the above mentioned closeness parameter &. In either case, only three con- servation laws survive, momentum, energy and stretch, yielding anomalous transport and dynamical scaling [56]. For large enough ô-values, there is overwhelming evidence that both the diatomic HPG and Toda [45] belong to the KPZ universality class. For the randomly perturbed Toda evidence of a diverging conductivity is solid, yield- ing <LATEX>\eta \approx 0 . 4 4</LATEX> for a large collision rate <LATEX>\gamma = 1</LATEX> [35].
