Silvio Gutkind\ng8m3 | Abstract\na9av | G protein coupled receptors and heterotrimeric G proteins play central roles in a diverse array of cellular processes. As such, dysregulation of G protein coupled receptors and their coupled heterotrimeric G proteins can dramatically alter the signalling landscape and functional state of a cell. Consistent with their fundamental physiological functions, G protein coupled receptors and their effector heterotrimeric G proteins are implicated in some of the most prevalent human diseases, including a complex disease such as cancer that causes significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. G protein coupled receptor and G protein-mediated signalling impacts oncogenesis at multiple levels by regulating tumour angiogenesis, immune evasion, metastasis, and drug resistance. Here, we summarize the growing body of research on G protein coupled receptors and their effector heterotrimeric G proteins as drivers of cancer initiation and progression, and as emerging antitumoral therapeutic targets.\n73l3 | Artic\nornm | Keywords:\nu2z1 | Abbreviations:\natmh | aG Protein Coupled Receptor: Adhesion G protein coupled receptor\n7hgg | ATP: Adenosine triphosphate\nxwsv | bFGF: Basic fibroblast growth factor\n756b | BMR: Background mutation rate\n6bx7 | cAMP: Cyclic adenosine monophosphate\nspl6 | CNV: Copy number variation\n7wzm | COSMIC: Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer\ne9xj | COX: Cyclooxygenase\n9vl6 | GAP: GTPase-accelerating protein\nc2fd | GDP: Guanosine diphosphate\njzvp | GEF: Guanine nucleotide exchange factor\nf71y | GOF: Gain of function\n31e1 | G Protein Coupled Receptor: G protein coupled receptor\n40ry | GTP: Guanosine triphosphate\nd1j2 | IAP: Islet activating protein\nwstc | LOF: Loss of function\nba1e | LPA: Lysophosphatidic acid\nen95 | LRR: Leucine-rich repeats\nl3do | MAPK: Mitogen-activated protein kinase\nu9bo | MMP: Matrix metalloproteinase\n7avo | NAM: Negative allosteric modulator\nuzo6 | NGF: Nerve growth factor\n89b4 | ORF: Open reading frame\n5f7e | PAM: Positive allosteric modulator\nh83u | PG: Prostaglandin\nkjoa | PSA: Prostate specific antigen\nwb1c | RGS: Regulators of G protein signaling\nak13 | ROS: Reactive oxygen species\ns7el | RTK: Receptor tyrosine kinase\n0lfu | SRE: Serum response element\ncnjl | TSH: Thyroid stimulating hormone\nrtdl | TCGA: The Cancer Genome Atlas\nnorp | VEGF: Vascular endothelial growth factor\nchx3 | VGPCRs: Viral G protein coupled receptor\nsfcf | Introduction\nnuxs | G protein coupled receptors represent the largest family of cell-surface receptors, with over eight hundred G protein coupled receptors and thirty-five heterotrimeric G protein subunits involved in transduction of diverse signalling cascades. G protein coupled receptors are characterized by a distinctive seven-transmembrane domain structure with an extracellular amino terminus and an intracellular carboxyl terminus, and by their ability to couple to heterotrimeric G proteins, comprised of alpha, beta, and gamma subunits, which activate a diverse array of downstream signalling pathways. G protein coupled receptors play key roles in many cellular and physiological functions, including in neurotransmission, cardiac response and blood pressure regulation, vision, olfaction, tissue development and immune regulation.\numx0 | The human G protein coupled receptor superfamily can be phylogenetically grouped into five subfamilies based on distinct structural features- Class A (rhodopsin), Class B one (secretin), Class B two (adhesion), Class C (glutamate), and Class F (frizzled/taste). Most G protein coupled receptors activate one or multiple G alpha proteins, which bind guanine nucleotides-guanosine diphosphate in their inactive form and guanosine triphosphate in their active form. G alpha proteins are subdivided into four major families: G alpha i, G alpha twelve, G alpha s, and G alpha q, with each family activating a distinct repertoire of signalling mechanisms. G protein coupled receptor activation is initiated by the binding of an agonist ligand to the extracellular domain of the receptor which induces a rapid conformational change in the extracellular and intracellular loops of the receptor. This transition into the active conformation of the receptor results in coupling to the heterotrimeric G proteins and triggers the exchange of guanosine diphosphate for guanosine triphosphate on the G alpha subunit, promoting its dissociation from G beta gamma dimers. Both G alpha-guanosine triphosphate bound and G beta gamma subunit complexes then stimulate downstream signalling cascades, including the rapid generation of multiple second messengers by modulating the activity of ion channels, phospholipases, phosphodiesterases, and adenylyl cyclases. These second messenger generating systems and their downstream regulated kinases cascades are responsible for most of the rapid physiological responses elicited by G protein coupled receptors. In tandem to these processes, Regulators of G protein Signalling proteins enhance the GTPase activity of the G alpha subunit, enabling the reassociation of the G alpha and G beta gamma subunits into a bound heterotrimeric G protein, and returning the protein complex to a guanosine diphosphate-bound inactive state. Moreover, arrestins are recruited to activated G protein coupled receptors to promote receptor endocytosis and can participate in downstream signalling as scaffolds for signalling complexes, and as molecular rheostats of G protein-driven signal transduction. This model of G protein coupled receptor function has been improved over the recent years to encompass various classes of ligands, including agonists, partial agonists, inverse agonists and allosteric modulators, and the detailed structure features of the corresponding G protein coupled receptor conformations that can be stabilized upon binding.\no306 | As G protein coupled receptors and their associated heterotrimeric G proteins are involved in a diverse array of signal transduction pathways and cellular processes, dysregulation in either can have significant impacts on cellular behaviour and the initiation of pathogenic processes. This is highlighted by large body of drugs in the market targeting G protein coupled receptors. Indeed, thirty-four percent of all FDA approved drugs currently on the market target G protein coupled receptors directly or indirectly. This review will summarize the growing body of information establishing G protein coupled receptors and heterotrimeric G proteins as drivers of cancer and their roles in cancer initiation and progression.\nqm1b | Historical Perspective",
