You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

06yq | Microdosing with psychedelics to self-medicate for ADHD symptoms in adults: A naturalistic study

2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

63p4 | Any careful study of academic work will show how surprisingly often there is an unawareness, for instance, of the difference be- tween polemic and informational communication.
lvik | The Sufi's opposition to the scholar is not any opposition to scholarship. It is an opposition to regarding scholarship as some- thing which it is not. If, for instance, one were to believe that bread and milk were the only true and valuable forms of food, it could mean that those who ate bread and milk might imagine that they had perceived and were operating at the apogee of nutrition. On the other hand, where there are other nutritions available, and when these are superior in some or many respects to those which are only supposed to be the solitary or best ones, a critical situation exists.
16a3 | The other objection which the Sufi traditionally makes is in the best interests of the scholar and his followers. It is widely known that an erroneous belief about oneself, particularly a fantasy that one is more important than one really is, can have an un- pleasant and destructive effect upon an individual and on those who may rely upon him. To ignore such scholastic imaginings
49ye | 217
850s | when in a position to comment upon them in a salutary manner is tantamount to allowing a person to damage himself and others- whether this damage arises through ignorance or malice. All social requirements of virtually all communities are unanimous in disallowing such a situation as this to pass unremarked, once it has been observed.
yusd | If the means to deter people from this course of irresponsibility do not exist (or cannot be made use of) the role of the Sufi is to make available the information upon the basis of which others may be able to preserve themselves from the spread of the disability. Or he might otherwise contribute towards redressing the imbalance.
noq3 | Protection and guidance is a function of the Sufi which takes precedence over any psychotherapeutic role. Yet it is easier for the Sufi to do his own job than it is for the afflicted to see his own situation, because the victim can sustain and maintain his disease only by dogmatic activity and constant effort, propaganda and so on. He continues to fuel his own morbid condition because he has lost touch with the fact that the ailment is not really a part of himself at all. He therefore fears to lose it, since he now imagines that such a loss would mean a loss of himself or a part of what he takes to be himself.
kdhu | When the malaise is further linked with the desire to maintain social or other prestige, or to secure his bread and butter, the inadequate academic's position is tragic indeed.
o8es | This is the condition described by ancient authors in their own language, when they tell of people who are infested by demons and imagine that the demons are themselves.
2k63 | The opposition of Sufis and scholars, like that of literalists and experientialists throughout the human community at all times, also has another face, one which is extremely interesting.
p1p2 | Many-perhaps the majority-of the scholars who initially opposed our books on traditional psychology, have become warm supporters of the concept of extra dimensions in learning, and I count many of them among my personal friends. In the past ten years there have been several books and numerous monographs in which scholars have shown this change of heart. How does this come about?
muok | You should note that it is a matter of sociological evidence that
qozi | 218
801o | people who make the best friends are not those who are attracted to one another, or to each others' ideas, at first. On the contrary, it has been shown that the person who opposes you is likely to become a firmer friend than one who becomes your friend immediately. This may seem odd: it is certainly something which has been known for centuries to thinkers and experientialists, as I shall illustrate in a moment.
6u6r | On the perceptual, as distinct from the superficial, level, there is a communication which leads to harmony between nominally opposed people or attitudes. Were this not so, we would never get agreement following disagreement. But there is a stronger indica- tion than that.
8jhi | The first illustration we can use, in order to offer this phenom- enon in terms somewhat familiar to our present audience, is the saying of Jalaluddin Rumi to the effect that 'things which are apparently opposed may in reality be working together'. The reason why people do not ordinarily link this with the essential harmony of opposites is that they are using only the secondary self to assess the saying. Since they do not perceive this co- operation of opposites when it starts, they think that the opposi- tion which they feel is the central factor.
n2bw | Secondly, if you cast your mind back to the New Testament, where Jesus is credited with saying that you should 'love your enemy', you will see that, from this point of view, you might as well harmonise with someone who opposes you, because this opposition is quite possibly the beginning of friendship, however it may appear on the surface. 'Love your enemy', therefore, is not to be regarded as a noble sentiment which makes you a better person, especially: but as an injunction which actually describes the deeper dimensions already existing in the relationship.
lrko | Although hard to illustrate for those who have not experienced > this parallelism between paradoxical homilies and essential fact is encountered in conditions of deeper understanding. Difficult to illustrate in personal terms, especially where individual disputes are concerned, it can be determined as existing in social contexts, where the superficial self is not operating. Reconciliation, familiar to all of us in personal and community terms, is not so much the unification of opposites as the uncovering of the basic truth of the
pe0m | 219
d3h0 | situation, masked by subjectivities.
vb88 | Sufis and scholars seem to oppose one another. But when they know one another's approaches and knowledge, this 'opposition' disappears.
0dzg | THE SHARPSHOOTING SCHOLARS
qrj3 | Scholars themselves know a great deal about the besetting sin of their profession, that of over-specialisation and blinkered dogma- tism. Here is a story about the whole matter, told me by a scholar who himself admitted, unlike many others, that he knew that be was like one of the characters in the tale: but that there was nothing, he believed, that he could do about it:
erv1 | A number of academics, it appears, were enrolled in time of war into the infantry. After training they all proved to be crack shots, capable of hitting the bullseye far more often than any other recruits.
4u8c | The time came for them to be sent into battle. As the enemy advanced, the order was given to fire. Nobody moved. 'For good- ness' sake', shouted the commanding officer, 'why don't you shoot?'
m3ho | 'How can we, you fool?' roared back one of the scholars, 'When we haven't been trained to fire at people?'

9wyj | An Enterprise is measured by Intention, not by Appearance
hmko | Q. Can you comment on the statement: 'The Success of an Enterprise is measured by its intention, not its appearance'?
tsxi | A: This statement is simpler than it looks, although it conceals some of the misunderstandings of the past.
fidk | If someone is trying to dig a hole, the intention is to dig a hole. The success of the digging of the hole will be whether the hole is actually dug. But, in appearance, the man may be trying to find gold. If the observer thinks that the intention is to find gold, he will call the hole 'a failure'.
ju2k | It is the same with teachings, institutions, theories and so on. Many have been successful which appeared to be failures. Many failures have appeared to be successes, because the intention be- hind them was not widely known.
wldo | The danger in this situation is twofold :-
ct9a | 1. That self-appointed observers may completely misunderstand intentions.
rh8p | 2. That people, originally intending success in one range, may yield to the temptation to produce what can easily be called 'a success' in some other range.
vopc | The psychological mechanism exists whereby an individual can convince himself that he was really trying to do something other than he really was, so that he can harvest the 'success'; and this is equally true of societies.
k4qz | Human progress is slowed down or halted when people aim for evident success (success measured by what people can easily describe as success) and lose impetus for success of in- tention.
k3w9 | 221
lijr | Example: 'False Success' :-
43dz | When Mulla Nasrudin, falling off his donkey and laughed at as a result by schoolboys, says: I meant to fall off, anyway'.
fyrt | Example: 'True success' :-
2nsv | When a team of doctors succeeded in inoculating a whole popula- tion against some endemic organism, whether or not the inhabi- tants think they are performing a magical ritual.
uqlj | Example: 'Possible ingredient of success, not essential to it": - When some, or even all, of the inoculated people learn the back- ground and purpose of the inoculation.
013l | 222
4flw | Sufi Organisations
pzyx | Q: Can you say anything about Sufi organisations, today and yesterday?
qc4k | A: Sufi organisations come into being from time to time. Among their purposes is the attraction, concentration and transmission of certain perceptions.
btsb | These organisations may or may not have what is ordinarily taken in conventional societies to be an outwardly spiritual or 'esoteric' shape.
s1u0 | This surface aspea is not necessarily important.
ju0a | A major objective of Sufi activity is sometimes expressed as aiding the human transformation process.
e4y0 | This process can take place only if the organisation, visible, identifiable or otherwise, is adequately attuned to the human being.
kpra | This attunement itself may impose 'unlikely' externals upon an organisation.
egbi | All such entities are temporary forms. When they have com- pleted their effective lifespan, others take their place.
bnhs | The outward form or husk may, however, persist and contrive to perform social or other comparatively less significant functions. The inheritors of these forms seldom, if ever, realise that the entity is 'organically dead'.
ktv2 | This is why almost the last place in which to seek the continua- tion of a transmission such as the one being discussed is in apparently well-established traditionalistic bodies. These are more efficiently described as archaeological relics, easily recognisable as such by those who know their original extent, purpose and vitality.
woy6 | They develop a sort of quasi-adaptability, or else a rigidity - or a combination of these. The consequence of these characteristics is to cause them either to seek support from new formulations or else to try to fight them. They always, however, lack real adaptability, consistent with contemporary needs.
6xev | 223
u2ud | This peculiarity arises when there is a pre-occupation with preservation of archaic, anachronistic forms. Effective higher teaching, in contrast, always seeks to employ any form within which it can complete its mission.
3qum | THE CAUSE AND THE EFFECT
obst | Understanding Sufi organisations involves knowing what lies be- hind appearances. As Rumi says in his Fihi ma Fihi, 'In it what is in It':
3mg9 | If a sleeve moves, the hand has moved it. But if the hand moves, the sleeve does not need to move, necessarily. So, if you look at the caused and do not know the cause, you imagine that 'sleeve' is something with a life of its own!
4j8f | Not even a King is immune from the rule that people jump to conclusions based on superficialities. This can happen with tech- nology in the scientifically-based West:
e3ba | The English King Edward VII saw a hissing vehicle lurch- ing towards him. "What the devil is that?' he exclaimed, then gasped: 'Good God! It is the Devil!'

2u5k | 8 Sufi Studies
f8wg | Coming Together
hgz1 | Q: What is the harmonisation- of a community through what is called the 'Coming-Together' method?
khf5 | A: The Kernel of the visible aspect called 'Sufism' is the basic human unit: the members who meet together and carry on the studies prescribed for them by a contemporary teacher.
ya4d | This is necessary to the realisation which comes from being a Sufi. It may be called community, communion, meeting. It is unimportant what it is called, what is important is to see how every form of human search which later becomes a system, a 'religion', or an enterprise of any kind, originally depends upon this coming-together. It is often called the Jam - coming together; pronounced as if to rhyme with 'hum'.
dzub | Meeting for worship, teamwork of all kinds, learning in groups, all are derivations and usually diluted ones, of this basic factor.
oidq | It is the Sufis, the real Sufis, who preserve the original means of operating in this Jam. As time passes, in ordinary communities without special safeguards, the working of this coming-together becomes less and less effective, more and more formalised or generalised, until the Jam no longer exists. What takes its place is social 'togetherness', or emotional enthusiasm, or conditioned response to being in a collection of people.
fp0u | No higher attainment is possible to man unless the circumstances of the coming-together are correct; unless it is a communion including the right people, at the right time, in the right place. Impatience, ignorance, sentimentality, intellectualism tend to cause people to convert the true 'Jam' situation until it becomes some- thing else.
34lv | This essential knowledge has always existed amongst humanity, and continues to exist. But superficial and in general popularised thinking have obscured the real working of this coming-together, until people can only see innumerable forms of deteriorated 'Jam' - which they accept or reject according to whether they seem
gmoh | 227
2xvo | attractive, plausible or 'true'.
fhh2 | It may often be impossible to re-form a degenerated coming- together community. It will then be possible to regenerate it only by breaking old habit-patterns and regrouping people who can really be harmonised. This may cause a very different - and perhaps unacceptable - appearance of the whole effort to those who have become accustomed to a false situation. The selection of participants on the basis of their capacity and not their assumed importance always causes discontent in those who have lost the power to adapt. This kind of lack of flexibility is, in turn, an inevitable characteristic of people and groups which have been running on automatistic patterns and which need revivifying.
c2q0 | It is an evident fact that true communities and organisations 'run down' and develop peculiarities other than were present in their origins. They may do this because of the ascendancy of undesirable characteristics in the participants, or because there is a widespread tendency for people and groups to attempt to stabilise themselves by using the nearest available organisation, irrespective of whether this kind of stabilisation loses more than it gains.
4wwg | This is the major perennial reason for the cyclic emergence of living teachers. It is they alone who can restore harmony and balance in circles and individuals which have sacrificed these things in the search for continuity and reassurance in the hope of stabili- sation.
ix7t | Were it possible to attain the object in a systematised way, the means to do so would have been enunciated and recorded many thousands of years ago: just as the laws of ordinary material stability and performance are recorded and employed in physics or in applied arts.
a46e | The reactions of an audience to the efforts of a real teacher to redress the balance of an organisation are always predictable. They will include despair, confusion, desire for stimulus, fear that some- thing might be taken away, rejection, and a desire to accept in order to profit by the 'new phase'.

22sy | THE SHIP IN A STORM
kuwj | Mulla Nasrudin objected to the captain of a ship making fast the sails aloft, when as he said: 'Can't you see that the trouble is at sea-level !'
b3n9 | The teacher, however much he may regret it, can never escape the necessity of saying that it is he who has the technical know- ledge: who decides whether the sails or the hull have to be attended to.
