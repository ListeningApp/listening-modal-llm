You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

1wj6 | The Tara Pacific expedition-A pan-ecosystemic approach of the "-omics" complexity of coral reef holobionts across the Pacific Ocean
936l | Abstract
06yq | Coral reefs are the most diverse habitats in the marine realm. Their productivity, structural complexity, and biodiversity critically depend on ecosystem services provided by corals that are threatened because of climate change effects-in particular, ocean warming and acidifica- tion. The coral holobiont is composed of the coral animal host, endosymbiotic dinoflagellates,

2taz | associated viruses, bacteria, and other microeukaryotes. In particular, the mandatory photo- symbiosis with microalgae of the family Symbiodiniaceae and its consequences on the evolu- tion, physiology, and stress resilience of the coral holobiont have yet to be fully elucidated. The functioning of the holobiont as a whole is largely unknown, although bacteria and viruses are presumed to play roles in metabolic interactions, immunity, and stress tolerance. In the context of climate change and anthropogenic threats on coral reef ecosystems, the Tara Pacific project aims to provide a baseline of the "-omics" complexity of the coral holobiont and its ecosystem across the Pacific Ocean and for various oceanographically distinct defined areas. Inspired by the previous Tara Oceans expeditions, the Tara Pacific expedition (2016- 2018) has applied a pan-ecosystemic approach on coral reefs throughout the Pacific Ocean, drawing an east-west transect from Panama to Papua New Guinea and a south-north tran- sect from Australia to Japan, sampling corals throughout 32 island systems with local repli- cates. Tara Pacific has developed and applied state-of-the-art technologies in very-high- throughput genetic sequencing and molecular analysis to reveal the entire microbial and chemical diversity as well as functional traits associated with coral holobionts, together with various measures on environmental forcing. This ambitious project aims at revealing a mas- sive amount of novel biodiversity, shedding light on the complex links between genomes, tran- scriptomes, metabolomes, organisms, and ecosystem functions in coral reefs and providing a reference of the biological state of modern coral reefs in the Anthropocene.
o3ya | Introduction
r5il | The 20th century has seen the earth enter into the now widely called Anthropocene [1]. Anthropogenically induced changes are happening on both global and local scales and are altering the physiology of organisms and ecosystems by modifying the entire earth's physical, chemical, and biological processes [2]. Among marine ecosystems, coral reefs have the unfor- tunate privilege of being highly sensitive to these environmental modifications [3]. In particu- lar, the thermally mediated process of coral bleaching-i.e., the loss of the obligate photosynthetic microalgal endosymbionts-is increasingly decimating corals. Projections esti- mate that approximately 25% of reefs have already been lost, and up to 99% will be threatened and dramatically transformed by 2050 [4]. Even though they cover only approximately 0.2% of the ocean's surface [5], coral reefs harbor approximately 30% of ocean biodiversity [6], provid- ing ecological services (fisheries, tourism, coastal protection) to nearly 1 billion people [7], and are estimated to be worth USD 30 billion per year [8].
5gui | The late 20th century has also seen our world entering into the "-omics" revolution sparked by the development of high-throughput analyses of DNA, RNA, proteins, and metabolites. This revolution has changed our approach to investigate organisms, and it is about to change the descriptions of ecosystems as genes-to-ecosystem modeling improves [9]. It will advance our capabilities to investigate the biodiversity and functioning of our oceans in a holistic way. Holistic approaches, interrogating components across the various levels of organization of an ecosystem, appear accessible today, as exemplified in the Tara Oceans project [10], which con- tinues to decipher biodiversity and structural networks across all plankton organisms in the ocean [11].

qvnu | started with the contribution of Charles Darwin during "the voyage of the Beagle" (1831- 1836), when Darwin explored many reefs in the Indian and Pacific Oceans and established his biophysical theory of the formation of coral reefs and atolls [12]. He also highlighted the paradoxical high diversity of reef organisms living in a nutrient-poor system. Later, the Great Barrier Reef Expedition (1928-1929) led by Charles Yonge was a landmark in coral reef research, as it established the scientific basis of coral physiology (nutrition, symbiosis, growth, etc.). The "polypifers," later called coral polyps, were then demonstrated to host a large population of organisms (protists, viruses, bacteria, archaea, and all sorts of unicellular and multicellular eukaryotes), which are intimately involved in the physiology of the coral animal host in a complex and still mysterious system named the holobiont [13].
kggw | The Tara Pacific expedition has built on these early tracks, applying the most recent tech- nologies to map the "-omics" complexity of the coral holobiont within its ecosystem and across the Pacific Ocean. Through the exploration of marine biodiversity at scales spanning from organisms to genes to biomolecules, Tara Pacific is undertaking the first pan-ecosystemic study of coral reef diversity across an entire ocean basin (Fig 1). Given that a holistic approach integrating all components of the reef biota is unrealistic, the Tara Pacific expedition focuses its approach on widely distributed coral and fish holobionts and their contextual biological (plankton) and physicochemical environment, including modifications in the context of global changes (Fig 2).
xrd1 | The geographic and sequencing extent of Tara Pacific will bring an exceptionally compre- hensive description of coral holobionts, together with the surrounding fish and plankton biota. Such unprecedented sequencing coverage and depth will place coral reefs among the first eco- systems with a comprehensive description of their hologenomic diversity (i.e., the totality of genomes making up the coral holobiont) across their natural environments. We will go beyond the mere description of species composition to investigate in detail the gene content and gene expression of these communities, as well as the interconnectedness with their hosts and habitats. Broad emerging patterns will then be accessible through large-scale data mining and network analyses.

7toz | The coral host
j346 | Scleractinian corals evolved over 450 million years ago [14] and belong to the phylum Cni- daria, animals located close to the root of the metazoans. Because of their place in the early Eumetazoa and as a sister group of bilaterians, the cnidarians allow interesting evolutionary analyses regarding the origins of animal complexity and the coevolution of early animals with microbes. Shinzato and colleagues [15] were the first to show that the coral genome is as com- plex as the one of vertebrates and that it has retained many ancestral genes lost in other line- ages. Subsequent studies confirmed the deep genomic differences between coral taxa [16]. Moreover, the exceptional longevity of corals, reaching several hundred to thousands of years, makes them attractive emerging models for aging studies.
v8uq | The coral endosymbiont microalgae
x972 | Reef corals host symbiotic unicellular algae of the family Symbiodiniaceae inside their endo- dermal cells [17], raising intriguing questions on animal-plant interactions, photosymbiosis, coevolution, and speciation [18]. The divergence and genetic variation within and between populations of coral species is also investigated, allowing us to firmly ground the exact taxo- nomic status of each coral host [19].

awvu | The coral microbiome
on9b | In addition to the Symbiodiniaceae, corals host diverse groups of microorganisms, bacteria, archaea, fungi, and protists, together forming the so-called coral holobiont [13]. The impor- tance of the microbiome in the normal steady-state functioning of corals or during environ- mental stress is not well understood, but recent research suggests that microbiome structure aligns with and contributes to stress resilience [20, 21, 22] (in particular, bleaching [23, 24]), as seen in humans [25]. Recent work provides evidence that corals have coevolved with certain groups of microbes [26-28], but the exact nature of these host-microbe symbioses and their involvement in coral resilience remains unclear. Therefore, Tara Pacific will draw, using

m047 | The coral virome
gy8c | Viruses infect all known cellular organisms and are the most abundant biological entities on our planet [29]. Yet even the basic diversity of viruses associated with marine species and habi- tats is shockingly unknown. This is particularly true in tropical reef systems, where research on viral abundance, diversity, and dynamics is still in its infancy (for review, see [30]). Tara Pacific is using metagenomics and microscopy to interrogate the diversity of viruses across Pacific waters and within the foundation species of coral reefs.
y4mj | Research objectives of Tara Pacific
vpgq | Our goal is to unveil the entire organismal diversity of eukaryotes, prokaryotes, and viruses associated with the targeted coral and fish holobionts and their surrounding waters and to assess variation across the explored ecological and geographical gradients. The main objectives of Tara Pacific are as follows:
ousl | · Draw a near-exhaustive census of the biodiversity composing and surrounding coral holo- bionts. This includes the coral hosts, their endosymbiotic microalgae (zooxanthellae of the family Symbiodiniaceae), and the associated microeukaryotes, bacteria, archaea, and viruses found either as endo- or exosymbionts, or in the plankton in surrounding water, using a metabarcoding approach.

km8w | · Determine the spatial patterns of the holobionts and the environmental diversity within coral reefs throughout the Pacific Ocean and derive large-scale biogeographic patterns to be compared with macrofauna patterns of diversity (i.e., the Pacific biodiversity gradient).
wzno | · Compare metatranscriptomes and metagenomes of coral reefs throughout the Pacific Ocean and elucidate the contribution of microbial diversity to local versus basin-scale adaptation in response to climate change. Importantly, the entire plankton community surrounding the corals and the islands has been sampled and integrated with physicochemical contextual data, providing critical context to advance our understanding of the environmental contri- bution to coral reef resilience.
xagm | · Investigate divergence and standing genetic variation within and between populations of the targeted coral species and their Symbiodiniaceae symbionts across the Pacific Ocean basin via marker gene barcoding as well as genome and transcriptome sequencing (population genomics using SNPs). Extensive metadata resources collected during Tara Pacific will allow the coral holobiont composition to be modeled, taking environmental and coral trait data into account (e.g., temperature, pH, bleaching, symbiont acquisition, reproduction cycle, etc.) to identify drivers of adaptation/selection or acclimatization, providing insights into coral stress resilience.
iwn5 | · Investigate the health status of corals by measuring growth parameters of the recent coral skeleton and stress biomarkers (antioxidant capacity, apoptosis, stress response pathways, transcriptomic signatures) as well as by determining the telomere status of each sample (telo- meric DNA length and damage as potential proxies for stress). These data will be studied in relation to holobiont biodiversity, transcriptomic and metabolomics data, modern and/or historical environmental parameters, and stresses determined from a geochemical analysis of the coral skeleton.
uooz | · Generate a holistic coral metabolome for coral species as a foundation to the identification of the links between holobiont metabolism and prevailing environmental conditions.
pxbq | · Identify how the environment (physical, chemical, biogeochemical, and biological) is influ- encing coral holobiont diversity, physiology, and evolution using an extensive compilation of environmental conditions.
jfsr | A unique, pan-ecosystemic sampling strategy
u15r | The Pacific Ocean covers approximately one-third of the earth's surface, with nearly 25,000 islands, most of which harbor coral reefs. Tara Pacific equipped the schooner Tara to explore 32 islands across the entire Pacific over a period of 2.5 years (Fig 1). The route of the Tara schooner was chosen to maximize the number of visited remote islands and atolls and to per- form the widest possible comparative survey, from the equator to the temperate and more acidic regions, encompassing most of the environmental range where scleractinian coral spe- cies can live. It also covers a biodiversity gradient, from the low diversity present in the eastern Pacific reefs to the highly diverse western Pacific "warm pool" [14]. This sampling strategy also encompasses a wide variety of environments, from high temperature/low seasonality to low temperature/high seasonality, and also a full range of trophic status and physicochemical envi- ronmental parameters that affect coral reef ecosystems (sea surface temperature [SST], pH, nutrients, lights, pollutants, etc.).
lq35 | Across its entire route, the Tara Pacific expedition targeted two species of scleractinian cor- als (Cnidaria, Anthozoa: Pocillopora meandrina and Porites lobata), one species of hydrocoral
