You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

pbea | Repeated measures ANOVAs confirmed significant group-by-time interactions for three of the five mindfulness subscales (acting with awareness: <LATEX>F \left( 1 , 2 6 \right) = 1 6 . 8 7 ,</LATEX> <LATEX>P < 0 . 0 0 1 ;</LATEX> observing: <LATEX>F \left( 1 , 2 6 \right) = 7 . 0 9 ,</LATEX> <LATEX>P = 0 . 0 1 3 ;</LATEX> non-judging: <LATEX>F \left( 1 , 2 6 \right) = 4 . 6 1 ,</LATEX> <LATEX>P = 0 . 0 4 1 ;</LATEX> describing: <LATEX>F</LATEX> <LATEX>\left( 1 , 2 6 \right) = 1 . 9 5 ,</LATEX> <LATEX>P = 0 . 1 7 5 ;</LATEX> non-reactivity: <LATEX>F \left( 1 , 2 6 \right) = 2 . 7 9 ,</LATEX> <LATEX>\left. P = 0 . 1 0 7 \right) .</LATEX> Paired t-tests confirmed significant increases in the MBSR group (acting with awareness: <LATEX>t \left( 1 3 \right) = 3 . 6 6 5 ,</LATEX> <LATEX>P = 0 . 0 0 3 ;</LATEX> observing: <LATEX>t \left( 1 3 \right) = 4 . 2 1 8 ,</LATEX> <LATEX>P = 0 . 0 0 1 ;</LATEX> non-judging: t <LATEX>\left( 1 3 \right) = 3 . 5 8 0 ,</LATEX> <LATEX>\left. P = 0 . 0 0 3 \right) ,</LATEX> but not the control group (observing: <LATEX>t \left( 1 3 \right) = - \quad 0 . 6 9 8 ,</LATEX> <LATEX>P = 0 . 4 9 8 ;</LATEX> acting with awareness: <LATEX>t</LATEX> <LATEX>\left( 1 3 \right) = -</LATEX> <LATEX>1 . 9 9 1 , P = 0 . 0 6 8 ;</LATEX> non-judging: <LATEX>t \left( 1 3 \right) = 0 . 6 5 7 ,</LATEX> <LATEX>P = 0 . 5 2 3 ;</LATEX> two- tailed). That is, MBSR participants significantly increased their mindfulness scores on these three scales.
ccpt | 3.3. Gray matter changes in a priori regions of interest
0fpw | The paired t-test within the MBSR group identified a small cluster in the left hippocampus with (peak voxel MNI coordinates <LATEX>x , y , z : - \quad 3 6 , - 3 4 , - 8 ; t \left( 1 5 \right) = 6 . 8 9 ;</LATEX> voxel level <LATEX>P = 0 . 0 1 4 ,</LATEX> corrected for multiple comparisons with FWE correction; cluster size <LATEX>k = 3 0 ;</LATEX> Fig. 1). The averaged gray matter concentration within this cluster was then extracted for each individual at each time-point using the Marsbar toolbox and further analyses were performed in SPSS. A repeated measures ANOVA (two groups <LATEX>5 \times</LATEX> two time-points; age and gender as nuisance variables) showed a significant groupxtime interaction (F (1,29) =4.92; <LATEX>\left. P = 0 . 0 3 5 \right) .</LATEX> There was no difference in gray matter concentration within this cluster between the two groups at the Pre time-point (2-

P = 0 . 9 5 6 \right)</LATEX> and the control group did not show a change in gray matter concentration from the Pre to Post time-point (paired <LATEX>t</LATEX> t-test; t (16) =0.343; <LATEX>\left. P = 0 . 7 3 6 \right) .</LATEX> Pre to Post changes in the other regions of interest were not significant, and changes in the a priori regions were also not correlated with the amount of mindfulness homework practice or with changes in the FFMQ. Furthermore, we performed a paired t-test within the control group in SPM5 and applied the same thresholds. No significant voxels were associated with increase or decrease in gray matter concentration from Pre to Post in the control group. To summarize, analyses of gray matter concentration changes in the ROI analysis supported significant increases in the left hippocampus in the MBSR group, confirming that structural changes in this region are detectable within 8 weeks following the participation in this mind- fulness training program.
cop0 | 3.4. Whole brain analysis
lhkq | Exploratory analysis of the entire brain (paired <LATEX>t</LATEX> t-test in SPM5) revealed four clusters with significantly greater gray matter concentration at the Post compared with the Pre time-point in the MBSR group (Table 2). One cluster was located in the posterior
