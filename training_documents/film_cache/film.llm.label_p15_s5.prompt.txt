You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

ti7f | He begins by noting that the social presence of a woman is different in kind from that of a man. A man's presence depends upon the 'promise of power' which he embodies. This power may be:
oksu | · Moral.
wtow | · Physical.
o22k | · Temperamental.
nwfz | · Economic.
nvfy | · Social.
mror | · Sexual.
zlxc | The object of man's power is external to himself - a power which he exerts on others. A woman's presence expresses her own attitude to herself and defines what can and cannot be done to her. Presence to a woman is so intrinsic to her person (as an object of men's actions) that men tend to equate it with her body. To be born a woman is to be born into the keeping of men. We can still see vestiges of this in the traditional Christian wedding ceremony, in which the father, having been asked by the groom for permission to marry his daughter, officially 'gives her away' to the keeping of her husband.
k0bw | A woman must continually watch herself. She is almost continually accompanied by her own image of herself. From earliest childhood, she has been taught and persuaded to survey herself continually. The surveyor and the surveyed within her are the two constituent elements of her identity as a woman. Her own sense of being in herself is supplanted by a sense of being appreciated as herself by another. Men survey women before treating them. This determines not only most relations between men and women, but also the relation of women to themselves. To recap:
aq5a | · Men act and women appear.
sc5y | . Men look at women.
0yab | · Women watch themselves being looked at.

p6pq | The surveyor of women in herself is male - thus she turns herself into an object - and most particularly an object of vision, a sight. The mirror was often used in Renaissance paintings as a symbol of the vanity of woman. You painted a naked woman because you enjoyed looking at her. You put a mirror in her hand and you called the painting 'vanity', thus morally condemning the woman for your own pleasure.
zse6 | The real function of the painting was otherwise. It was to make the woman connive in treating herself as, first and foremost, a sight.
p2n3 | Berger draws a distinction between nakedness and nudity in the European tradition. The nude, he says, is always conventionalised. These conventions derive from a particular tradition of art. What do these conventions mean? What does a nude signify?
ohh7 | To be naked is to be oneself. To be nude is to be seen naked by others and yet not recognised for oneself. A naked body has to be seen as an object in order to become a nude. Nakedness reveals itself. Nudity is placed on display. To be naked is to be without disguise. To be nude is to have the surface of one's own skin turned into a disguise. Nudity is a form of dress.
vbni | In the average European oil painting of the nude the principal protagonist is never painted. He is the spectator in front of the picture and he is presumed to be a man. Everything is addressed to him. It is for him that the figures have assumed their nudity. Consider the Allegory of Time and Love by Bronzino (Fig. 1.1).

877u | Venus is depicted kissing cupid. But the way their bodies are arranged has nothing to do with their kissing. Her body is arranged in this way to display it to the man looking at the picture. The picture is made to appeal to his sexuality. It has nothing to do with her sexuality.
rzhj | Sometimes a painting includes a male lover. How then, can we accept Berger's claim that the protagonist is not depicted? Berger argues that almost all post- Renaissance European sexual imagery is frontal - either literally or metaphorically -because the protagonist is the spectator-owner looking at it. Quite often the female is depicted so as to be surveyed by both the man depicted in the painting and by the spectator/owner. The absurdity of this male flattery reached its height in the public art of the nineteenth century.
bfax | Berger does, however, acknowledge that there are a few exceptions to the conventions of the European tradition of oil painting. As an example, Berger suggests we examine Rembrandt's painting of Danäe (Fig. 1.2).
f2y8 | Fig. 1.2
o7qm | The way the painter has painted her includes her will and her intentions in the very structure of the image, in the very expression of her body and face. The image includes her agency, a promise of power that is usually relegated to the domain of the 'masculine'. Because of this, says Berger, the spectator cannot deceive himself into believing that she is naked for him. He cannot turn her into a nude.

bgre | Laura Mulvey
57lp | Laura Mulvey's 'Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema' (first published in 1975) appropriated psychoanalytic theory, particularly that of Freud and Lacan, to demonstrate the ways in which unconscious forces in patriarchal society have structured film form. Drawing on Freud's descriptions of scopophilia, Mulvey argued that this impulse could explain one of the central pleasures of the cinema. Scopophilia had been isolated by Freud as one of the component instincts of sexuality. He associated scopophilia with taking other people as objects, subjecting them to a controlling and curious gaze. Fetishistic scopophilia, says Mulvey, provides an avenue of escape for the male unconscious, which is threatened by the female figure insofar as it represents castration (the absence of a penis). By turning the female figure itself into a fetish, either through over-valuation or possessing her as an object of sight', her appearance becomes reassuring rather than dangerous. The other avenue of escape for the male unconscious, says Mulvey, is voyeurism - investigating the woman, penetrating her privacy, uncovering and demystifying her mystery. This investigation of the woman is counterbalanced by the devaluation, punishment or saving of the guilty object. This voyeuristic impulse has associations with sadism: pleasure lies in ascertaining guilt (immediately associated with castration), asserting control, and subjugating the guilty person to the controlling power of punishing or redeeming authorities.
ukth | Cinematic spectatorship, by its very nature, plays on voyeuristic fantasies. The audience are ensconced in darkness, enhancing their sense of separation from the magic world that unfolds in front of them, indifferent to their presence. The darkness also isolates the spectators from one another. The whole experience creates the illusion of a privileged perspective, from which the spectator can safely look in on a private world, while no one looks back at him.
kpvt | Mulvey identifies three voyeuristic/scopophilic kinds of look associated with the cinema:

4exe | . The look of the camera and crew as they record the action.
0myz | . The look between the characters on screen. (Let's call this a diegetic look.]
xh3i | . The look of the audience watching the film. (Let's call this the extra-diegetic look.]
syiw | All three kinds of look are predominantly masculine or associated with the male. Females are objectified by cinema as the object of desire. The audience identify with the male hero/protagonist's desire for the female (voyeuristically). In a world ordered by sexual imbalance, says Mulvey, pleasure in looking has been ordered along an active/male and passive/female divide. Women are simultaneously looked at and displayed. In an echo of Berger, Mulvey says that woman displayed as sexual object is the leitmotif of erotic spectacle, such that her very appearance is code for 'to-be-looked-at-ness'. The female as spectacle both plays to and constitutes male desire. Traditionally, the woman displayed has functioned as both erotic object for the characters within the film and as an erotic object for the spectator in the cinema.
kg3t | But voyeurism is not the only pleasure that cinema offers. Cinematic stimulation also produces narcissistic pleasures - the spectator identifies with the object seen. The term 'narcissism' comes from Greek mythology. Narcissus was a beautiful youth who fell in love with his own image reflected in a pool. He pined away, rooting himself to the spot, becoming the flower that bears his name. The film spectator can likewise become enthralled by a fantasy of his own omnipotence, attractiveness and/or prowess. Much of the pleasure of cinema revolves around the vicarious pleasure of living 'through' our heroes, whilst remaining oblivious to the realities of our real lives. Both voyeurism and narcissism pursue indifference to perceptual reality, creating the fantasised, eroticised concept of the world that assuages the neurotic needs of the male ego while rejecting empirical objectivity.
lvae | Females function within the classic film narrative as passive objects of the action. Just as pleasure in looking has been ordered along an active/male and passive/ female divide, so too has the narrative structure been divided into active/male and passive/female roles. The man's role is the active one of forwarding the story, making things happen. The man emerges in cinematic narrative as the representative of power. The story is typically structured around a main controlling figure with whom the spectator can identify.
o9sc | 'What counts is what the heroine provokes, or rather what she represents. She is the one, or rather the love or fear she inspires in the hero, or else the concern he feels for her, who makes him act the way he does. In herself the woman has not the slightest importance.' (Budd Boetticher in Mulvey 1975: 3)

6d4s | The spectator identifies with the main male protagonist, his screen surrogate, giving him a satisfying sense of omnipotence.
mqah | Viewers identify with the male's active resolution of the narrative (narcissistically). Women are seldom essential to the plot or represented as capable of resolving the narrative conflicts unaided. Traditionally there are few instances of female characters actively driving the narrative and thus competing for the audience's narcissistic identification. The result is that the male view is the only perspective from which the narcissistic pleasure of narrative can be derived. Female audiences experience phallocentric pleasure. Women have to psychologically 'cross dress' when they go to the cinema.
xxr8 | Linda Williams (in Turner 1988: 118) has argued that many films do represent females as powerful, only to then punish them for making use of their power. Her examples are Psycho (1960) and Dressed to Kill (1980), but Thelma & Louise (1991) also conforms to this rule. Kill Bill: Vol. 1 (2003) and Vol. 2 (2004) exhibit extreme sadism towards the powerful female protagonist (as well as other powerful female characters), despite the fact that the female protagonist does eventually triumph over her male lover/rival. What is interesting here is the excessively high price she must pay in suffering to accomplish her victory. At one point she literally has to dig herself out of a grave, having been buried alive. But this is only one of the many unspeakable horrors inflicted on her body throughout the course of her ordeal. The message this sends to viewers, who narcissistically identify with the heroine, is that fighting against a man, if you are a woman, is a masochistic endeavour. In Thelma & Louise it is a fatal one.
rl4j | Mulvey herself has acknowledged that the representation of women is far more complex than she had recognised in her early theory. Melodrama is one genre in which she says women do have key roles as subjects rather than objects. Mulvey may be correct, but, as Warren Buckland writes, 'melodrama can be said to turn its female character into a victim' (1998: 81). One problem with Mulvey's theory is that it draws on Freudian psychoanalysis, which does seem to presuppose some sort of essentialist model of gender. This suggests that a male gaze is inherent in male nature, rather than in the institutional power that men exert in having dominated the representational media. If this were the case then women, even with institutional power, would probably not represent men in similar ways. But the case studies we will examine in this book suggest that it is possible for both male and female directors to 'reverse' the allegedly 'male' look. What this suggests, of course, is that the use of a particular form of power (via the 'look') has less to do with the sex of the director than with the power of the director to represent the world according to his or her fantasies and desires, and these are not necessarily intrinsic in nature. They are just as likely to be products of upbringing and culture.

xjyk | Conclusion
mt0f | Neither of the above theoretical approaches can function as a thoroughgoing explanation of gender representation in art or cinema. In today's global film industry, new theoretical models might emerge that are better suited to aid our understanding of how gender representations work within and upon social and economic power relations. From today's perspective, we could probably find a handful of exceptions to the patriarchal modes of representation described above. Berger and Mulvey may seem a bit dated, but many of their insights still resonate with readers, and can be found and studied in the products of past eras, if not in our own. These are, of course, only theories, and summarised ones at that. But we will look in the following chapters at some of the ways in which the male gaze/male look and the power of patriarchal narratives have influenced cinema then and now.
awab | Chapter Summary
ixcc | · This book does not assume that a decontextualised evaluation of cinema is an adequate one. Sex is here examined not just as biological fact, but as a public concept, or set of ideas, about men, women, biology, the 'natural', the 'normal', the 'perverse', etc.
8p6h | . Since films are human artifacts, film-makers cannot avoid relating their works to the social, political, historical and visual culture in which they are situated. Traditions, popular forms, trends and styles develop through the imitation and repetition of certain elements. These common modes of representation become conventional or generic.
