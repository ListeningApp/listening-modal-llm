You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

29a3 | In mammals and birds, prolonged fasting induces a mobilization of fat stores whilst minimizing protein loss (Cherel et al., 1992). Fish, such as the Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) respond to starvation by mobilizing hepatic lipids first, then muscle and hepatic glycogen and finally muscle protein (Guderley et al., 2003). Long-term flying insects utilize lipids as their main energy source (Van der Horst & Ryan, 2012) while other insect species can use carbohydrates or proline (Gäde & Auerswald, 2002). In crustaceans, it is thought that protein contributes significantly to energy reserves (New, 1976) a conclusion that is consistent with some reports showing a limited capacity of marine crustaceans to store lipids and carbohydrates (Dall & Smith, 1986; Rosas et al., 2001).
sb1e | The hepatopancreas is the main storage organ in crustaceans, mainly accumulating lipids (Adamczewska & Morris, 1994; Luvizotto-Santos et al., 2003; Yepiz-Plascencia et al., 2000) and to a lesser extent, glycogen (Verri et al., 2001). It has been proposed that in crustaceans, neutral lipids (mainly triglycerides) are preferentially catabolized during starvation, while polar lipids (phospholipids and cholesterol) are conserved due to their role as structural components of cell membranes (Bourdier & Amblard, 1989; Heath & Barnes, 1970; Stuck et al., 1996). A large reduction in total lipids in response to starvation has been reported in larvae, sub-adult and adult lobsters (Ritar et al., 2003; Stuck et al., 1996).
w2yn | Glycogen is the most widely distributed animal polysaccharide and can be readily converted to glucose which, being soluble, can then be transported via the blood (Awapara & Simpson, 1967). Crustaceans utilize glycogen as an energy store but the proportion of all energy reserves depends upon the nutritional history of the individual. For example, in the estuarine grapsid crab Chasmagnathus granulata, 21 days of starvation reduced glycogen reserves by 51% in animals previously fed a high protein diet and by 64% in animals fed a high carbohydrate diet (Oliveira et al., 2004). The difference between the utilization of reserves becomes more significant when one considers the initial glycogen concentrations in the hepatopancreas organs: 1.71% in high protein-fed individuals and 2.82% in high carbohydrate-fed individuals. In these experiments, haemolymph glucose was principally
ap6l | maintained by effective gluconeogenesis from protein reserves in animals previously fed a high protein diet and from glycogen reserves in animals previously fed a high carbohydrate diet.
iest | MOLLUSCS
cox8 | Most bivalve molluscs are microphagous (feed on small particles) and feed on particles that are deposited on the substrate (deposit feeders) or in suspension (suspension feeders). Most of the species that are commercially exploited belong to this latter category and use their gills to filter particulate organic matter, usually phytoplankton, from the water.
ppqi | Suspension feeding requires that organic, digestible, materials are trapped, sorted from indigestible mineral particles and passed to the mouth (LaBarbera, 1981). Bivalves achieve this by means of capture mechanisms of the gills and sorting mechanisms of the gills, labial palps and stomach. Intertidal animals possess a feeding rhythm linked to tides (Morton, 1977; 1983).
oxou | Dissolved organic substances (monosaccharides, amino acids) or lipid droplets may be absorbed directly by the epithelium of larvae or adults. Many studies (reviewed in Hily, 1991) have demonstrated the existence of active transfer in the mantle and the gills, while certain carbohydrates present in sea water stimulate the rate of pumping and particle retention. Péquignat (1973) found that Mytilus edulis removed dissolved amino acids and glucose, most of which were absorbed onto the gills before transfer to the mantle and digestive gland. Pasteels (1968; 1969) has suggested that the mucus secreted onto the gills of M. edulis has a digestive as well as a mechanical function. The absorptive mechanism is chemically selective, but small particles are removed non-selectively by pinocytosis.
495n | Dissolved organic matter plays an important role in nutrition, possibly as a growth factor, particularly in littoral or estuarine zones. Héral et al. (1983) have established a correlation between the production of flesh in cupped oysters in the Marennes Oléron basin and the concentrations of dissolved organic matter, expressed as carbon or nitrogen.
awri | 1. Feeding
bl28 | 1.1 The role of the gills in feeding
d5bz | The lateral cilia of the gills draw a water current into the mantle cavity (Fig. 10).
ap5o | A typical bivalve filters 30 to 60 times its own volume of water in an hour (Famme et al., 1986). Water must pass between the gill filaments in order to reach the exhalant chamber.
7zvf | 1.11 Food capture
mov9 | As the water passes between the filaments (propelled by lateral cilia), food particles are held back by straining cirri (fused large cilia) and are carried forward to the ventral particle groove of the gill towards the mouth by other cilia in mucous strings (Silverman et al., 1999) (Fig. 11).
ks7m | Suspension feeding bivalves are capable of capturing suspended particles over a wide range of sizes, typically between 10-1 and 102 um (Møhlenberg & Riisgård, 1978).
w1w1 | In lamellibranchs, the frontal surface with its cilia is important in the capture of food. For this reason, the frontal surface is large relative to that of other molluscs and, and the filaments are slender. The combined frontal surface of the filaments forms large sheets known as lamellae (this is why bivalves are also known as lamellibranchs). The gill filaments are attached to the central axis, which is itself attached to the mantle (Fig. 12).
h8gv | Each gill filament drops ventrally (the descending limb) from the central axis and then climbs dorsally (the ascending limb). The ascending lamellae attach either to the mantle skirt (lateral filaments) or the visceral mass (medial filaments).
kwkp | Water (blue arrows) is propelled between the filaments by the beating lateral cilia.
yj0m | Food particles are shifted to the frontal cilia (red arrows) which transport them to the labial palps. After Silvester & Sleigh (1984).
