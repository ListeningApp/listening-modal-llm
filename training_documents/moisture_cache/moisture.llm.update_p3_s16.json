A fifty millimeter wide ring is removed from the center of the length including layers external to the insulation screen or, alternatively, the conductor. A tube at least ten millimeters in diameter is placed vertically over the exposed ring and sealed to the surface of the oversheath. Normally tap water is used to fill the tube. A period of five minutes is allowed for filling. The height of the water in the tube is one thousand millimeters above the center of the cable. The water is allowed to stand for twenty-four hours. The sample is then subjected to ten heating cycles. The conductor is heated until it reaches a temperature not less than five degrees Celsius or more than fifteen degrees Celsius above the maximum rated temperature of the insulation in normal operation. The heating cycle is eight hours on and sixteen hours off.\ng9du | A working group of CIGRE Study Committee twenty-one is preparing recommendations on tests for\nf682 | high voltage cables with synthetic insulation and laminated protective coverings as moisture barriers. These tests will supplement those of IEC eight forty, First Edition, nineteen eighty-eight. The recommendations are to be published in the Electra journal in nineteen ninety-one after amendments are made.\nli1k | IEEE Insulated Conductors Committee Task Group six dash twenty-three Activities\npbea | of the Insulated Conductors Committee of the IEEE has undertaken, and is nearing completion, the preparation of an IEEE standard entitled \"Guide on the Design, Testing and Application of Moisture Impervious, Solid Dielectric, five to thirty-five kilovolt, Power Cable Using Metal and Plastic Laminates\". The IEEE Standards Board has established Project Number P-eleven forty-two as the official identification for this endeavor. The task group is composed of representatives from utilities, industries, cable manufacturers, distributors and material suppliers. This task group was originally established to develop a guide on the use of metal and plastic laminates as moisture barriers in all types of cable. The scope was subsequently narrowed to encompass only medium voltage power cables.\nccpt | Task Group six dash twenty-three\n0fpw | As presently constituted, the guide includes sections on moisture barrier cable designs, metal and plastic laminates used for moisture barriers, cable performance and testing criteria and installation guidelines. Also included is a complete bibliography of technical papers, patents and specifications applicable to cables designed to preclude the effects of moisture.\ndqn8 | Presently, the task group has under consideration such matters as testing for the effects of moisture on insulation materials both by direct and indirect means. Direct means involve techniques for measuring the moisture content of the insulation. Indirect means involve electrical tests, such as dielectric strength and impulse, in order to determine if there has been a deterioration in insulation performance. Likewise, further consideration is being given to means for measuring the integrity of the moisture barrier. Another task is to resolve differences between proposed test methods for determining the overall performance of the cable in blocking the longitudinal movement of moisture. Draft Number six of this guide will soon be balloted by the voting members of the Insulated Conductors Committee.\ncop0 | Insulated Cable Engineers Association Activities on Strand Filling\nlhkq | A more recent technological advance in the development of water impervious power cables has been the use of strand filling materials to block the longitudinal flow of moisture in the conductors. Working Group six ten of the Insulated Cable Engineers Association was established in June nineteen eighty-five with three priorities for developing tests for cable with filled conductors. The first was to prepare a guide on testing for resistance to water penetration. The second was to develop tests for compatibility of the filler compound with adjacent cable materials (conductor screen). The third was to consider requirements for connectability testing of sealed conductors.\n82ju | The \"Guide for Conducting a Longitudinal Water Penetration Resistance Test for Sealed\ny2qo | Conductors\" was published in September nineteen eighty-nine. The test procedure for qualification calls for two cable samples, two meters long. One is heated to ninety degrees Celsius for one hour and the other is cooled to zero degrees Celsius for an hour. After conditioning, the samples are bent around a mandrel for three reverse bends. A one meter sample is attached to a pressurized water system and subjected to thirty-five kilopascals for one hour. For a production test one sample is subjected to pressure for fifteen minutes without conditioning, but after being subjected to three reverse bends. Thus, the guide consists of both a qualification test and a production test.\n1piq | The second priority of the Insulated Cable Engineers Association working group was to develop a guide for establishing the compatibility of the filler compound used to seal the conductor. The criteria for compatibility is the effect the filler has on the volume resistivity stability of the semiconducting compound used as the conductor screen. The working group has reviewed six test procedures and two have been completely tested and evaluated. A third procedure is presently under test. Variation in testing methodologies are being defined.\n7fqw | The work on the third priority, connectability, has been discontinued. The Insulated Cable Engineers Association charter does not permit it to deal with accessories. However, extensive work by several organizations has indicated that connectability of strand filled conductors will not be changed versus unsealed conductors. Connectability is considered feasible with standard commercial connectors.\nrhaz | De-Facto Standards - French Specifications\nwak1 | Watertight, medium voltage, synthetic insulated cable has been in use by Electricité de France since nineteen seventy-eight. Longitudinal water tightness is provided by a hygroscopic powder laid inside longitudinal grooves of the semiconducting insulation screen. Radial water tightness is obtained via an aluminum screen which is adhesively bonded to a polyvinyl chloride oversheath. The\nwtfz | A cable meets Electricité de France Standard HN thirty-three S twenty-three. A complete body of standards has been developed to cover accessories (HN thirty-three M zero three), twenty-four kilovolt plug-in terminations (HN fifty-two S sixty-one), single core terminations (HN sixty-eight S zero six), joints (HN sixty-eight S zero seven and HN sixty-eight S zero eight), and connectors (HN sixty-eight S zero four). The connectors developed for the aluminum screen do not require stripping of the sheath. Thus, a complete technology package has been developed for the watertight cable design.\nqy1i | Specific tests for water tightness are included in the HN thirty-three S twenty-three specification. The longitudinal water tightness test is carried out after three bending cycles. A ten millimeter wide ring is cut out of the oversheath in the middle of a three meter long sample. The area around the ring is enclosed in a small tank that is sealed to the oversheath. The tank is filled with water and a water head of eight hundred millimeters is maintained over the sealed area. The sample is subjected to a twenty-four hour period at ambient temperature without current. Then ten thermal cycles are applied bringing the conductor to one hundred degrees Celsius for four hours, followed by a four hour cooling period. No water leakage is permitted from the sample ends.\n1k9e | For radial water tightness an immersion withstand test is used. A sample at least ten meters long is immersed in water with the ends exposed. A voltage at twice the operating voltage of the cable is applied. A current is applied to bring the temperature of the conductor to one hundred degrees Celsius in parts of the cable not immersed in water. Thermal cycling of eight hours on and sixteen hours off for two hundred thermal cycles or five thousand hours is required without electrical breakdown of the insulation.\n5bjs | The cable standard also contains tests for checking the compatibility of the cable components and a metallic shield corrosion test is under consideration.\nuodj | APPLICATIONS OF MOISTURE IMPERVIOUS CABLE",
