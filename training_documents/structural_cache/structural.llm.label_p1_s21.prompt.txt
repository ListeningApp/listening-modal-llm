Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,

82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

v6sk | Structural and Mechanistic Insights into Methane Oxidation by Particulate Methane Monooxygenase
1wj6 | Received January 3, 2007
936l | ABSTRACT
06yq | Particulate methane monooxygense (pMMO) is an integral mem- brane copper-containing enzyme that converts methane to metha- nol. Knowledge of how pMMO selectively oxidizes methane under ambient conditions could impact the development of new catalysts. The crystal structure of Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath) pMMO reveals the composition and location of three metal centers. Spectroscopic data provide insight into the coordination environ- ments and oxidation states of these metal centers. These results, combined with computational studies and comparisons to relevant systems, are discussed in the context of identifying the most likely site for O2 activation.
dpv6 | Introduction
8r5j | The oxidation of methane to methanol is a challenging reaction because methane is the most inert hydrocarbon (104 kcal mol-1 C-H bond) and because methanol reacts further at high temperatures.1 In nature, methanotrophic bacteria oxidize methane to methanol in the first step of their metabolic pathway. Methane hydroxylation is carried out at ambient temperature by methane monooxygenase enzymes (MMOs).2,3 There are two forms of MMOs. All methanotrophs except members of the Methylocella genus produce an integral membrane MMO called particulate methane monooxygenase (pMMO). Several strains also express a cytoplasmic form called soluble methane mo- nooxygenase (sMMO).2-4 In organisms that possess both forms, including Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath) and Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b, differential expression is regulated by the bioavailable copper concentration.5-7 Both MMOs are metalloenzymes, but that is the extent of their similarity. The two systems differ in molecular structure, metal ion composition, and substrate specificity.8-11

o3ya | Whereas pMMO is more selective toward alkanes and alkenes that are five carbons or less, substrates for sMMO include alkanes, alkenes, aromatics, and halogenated hydrocarbons.12,13
r5il | Activation of O2 by sMMO and related enzymes has been investigated extensively (see the Account by Murray and Lippard in this issue). In contrast, the metal content, organization, and location of the active site in pMMO have been and continue to be controversial. It is only recently that enough information on pMMO has been obtained to begin thinking about O2 activation chemistry. In the past 5 years, there have been significant advances in the biochemical, spectroscopic, structural, and mechanistic characterization of pMMO. In this Account, we highlight recent discoveries, with an emphasis on their relevance to O2 activation chemistry.
5gui | Overall Architecture of pMMO
82qc | The 2.8 Å resolution crystal structure of M. capsulatus (Bath) pMMO revealed its overall architecture for the first time.14,15 pMMO consists of three subunits, pmoA (B), pmoB (x), and pmoC (y), with molecular masses ~24, ~47, and ~22 kDa, respectively. The three subunits assemble into a cylindrical 038373 trimeric structure that is ~105 Å in height and ~90 Å in diameter (Figure 1A). The pmoA and pmoC subunits comprise the bulk of the membrane-spanning regions and are composed of seven and five transmembrane helices, respectively. In contrast, pmoB includes two distinct cupredoxin-like ß barrels linked by two transmembrane helices and a long loop region. The ß barrels from pmoB form a soluble domain that houses two of the three metal centers identified in each protomer in the crystal structure (Figure 1B).
ls7d | In addition to the crystal structure, Dalton and co- workers determined the structure of M. capsulatus (Bath) pMMO by electron microscopy (EM).16 Although the 23 Å resolution cryo-EM structure limits detailed compari- sons with the crystallographic data, two observations are particularly significant. First, the EM structure represents an active complex and agrees well with the overall oligomeric state and architecture of the subunits in the crystal structure. Thus, the crystal structure of pMMO is physiologically relevant. Second, the identification of side "holes" in the soluble regions near the membrane inter- face are hypothesized to serve as entry points for hydro- phobic substrates (Figure 1A). A central cavity, present in both X-ray and EM structures, may function in product egress.16 Recent cryo-EM studies suggest that the pMMO trimer forms a larger assembly with methanol dehydro- genase (MDH), the subsequent enzyme in the methan- otroph metabolic pathway. In the complex, MDH is proposed to interact with the soluble ß-barrel regions of pmoB.17

kggw | pMMO Metal Centers
xrd1 | Metal Ion Composition. Early analyses of the pMMO metal content suggested that copper is the primary metal involved in methane oxidation.9 Different groups have reported copper stoichiometries for purified M. capsulatus (Bath) pMMO of 2 (Dalton laboratory),18 2-3 (our labora- tory),19 8-10 (DiSpirito laboratory),20 and 15-20 (Chan laboratory)21,22 copper ions/100 kDa aßy protomer. Puri- fied pMMO from M. trichosporium OB3b contains 2 copper ions/100 kDa.23 Iron is generally also present with reported stoichiometries of 0.75-2.5 ions/100 kDa. 18-20,24 The varying metal ion content highlights the difficulty in

7toz | the isolation and purification of pMMO. The discovery of methanobactin, a siderophore-like, copper-binding mol- ecule associated with some preparations, 25-28 resolves some of the discrepancies, however. The DiSpirito prepa- ration containing 8-10 copper ions actually includes 6-8 molecules of methanobactin and 2 copper ions20 and is thus consistent with values obtained by us19 and the Dalton group.18 Most but not all20 iron-containing pMMO preparations exhibit spectroscopic features characteristic of heme, suggesting that the iron derives from contami- nants in the membrane fractions.19,29
j346 | Crystal Structure. Three metal centers were identified in the crystal structure.14 A mononuclear copper center is located in the soluble domain of pmoB, ~25 Å from the surface of the membrane. The & nitrogen atoms of His 48 and His 72 coordinate this copper ion. Residue Gln 404, located ~3 Å from this site, might hydrogen bond to coordinated solvent ligands that are not observed at 2.8 Å resolution (Figure 2A). Sequence alignments of pmoB with homologues from other methanotrophs and am- monia-oxidizing bacteria reveal that neither His 48 nor Gln 404 is conserved and that only His 72 is present in most methanotroph pmoB sequences.8 A dinuclear copper center in pmoB is located ~21 Å from the mononuclear copper site. Residues His 33, His 137, and His 139 together with the amino-terminal nitrogen of His 33 were modeled as ligands to the two copper ions, which are separated by 2.6 Å (Figure 2B). It is likely that yet-to-be-identified exogenous ligands are also present at this site. The ligands to the dinuclear copper site are all strictly conserved.8 Finally, the crystal structure reveals a zinc ion within the membrane, ~19 Å from the dicopper center and ~32 Å from the mononuclear copper site. This zinc ion is coordinated by His 160, His 173, and Asp 156 from pmoC and Glu 195 from pmoA (Figure 2C). Zinc was used for crystallization but is not associated with purified pMMO14 and not detected in X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) samples.29 Thus, this site probably houses a different metal ion in vivo, perhaps a copper ion. A total number of 3-4 copper ions/protomer in the crystal structure is consistent with most earlier metal analyses.9
v8uq | Spectroscopic Data. Both membrane-bound and puri- fied pMMO have been studied extensively by spectro- scopic techniques. Prior to the crystal structure, these data were used to suggest models for the metal centers.9,15,30 At this point, we are trying to reconcile these data with the crystal structure to assess the physiological relevance of the structure and to glean more detailed information on the metal coordination environments and oxidation states. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectros- copy has been widely used to investigate pMMO. Chan and co-workers report a broad isotropic signal at g ~ 2.1, which was proposed to derive from a ferromagnetically coupled trinuclear Cu" cluster.31 Because no trinuclear copper center is present in the structure, alternative interpretations for this signal, such as methanobactin,24 superposition of a radical signal with a type 2 Cu" signal, 32 Cu[Fe(CN)6]2-,33 or adventitiously bound copper ions,18 might be more reasonable. All researchers observe a type

dfzb | The X-ray absorption near edge spectra (XANES) of purified pMMO samples exhibit a feature at 8984 eV, attributable to a Cul 1s -> 4p transition.19 This peak increases in intensity upon chemical reduction with dithionite, indicating that some of the copper ions are present as Cu" in purified pMMO. Treatment with H2O2 diminishes this peak, suggesting that some oxidation can occur.29 Complete oxidation might require turnover in the presence of a substrate.34 Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) data for purified pMMO are best fit with two Cu-O/N ligand environments, with Cu-O/N distances ranging from 1.93 to 2.22 Å. A second scattering interac- tion is best fit with a Cu-Cu interaction at 2.51 Å for as- isolated pMMO and 2.65 Å for pMMO reduced with dithionite.29 This Cu-Cu interaction was critical to our
u6ty | crystallographic model of the dicopper center because 2.8 Å resolution data cannot necessarily resolve two copper ions at such a close distance. The EXAFS data also support the presence of exogenous ligands because the coordina- tion number of 2-4 for the O/N ligands exceeds the two nitrogen ligands coordinated to each copper ion in the crystal structure. Furthermore, the pMMO EXAFS re- sembles that of dicopper model compounds, in which the copper ions are four- and five-coordinate.29
awvu | Possible Oxidation States. When the spectroscopic data are taken together with the structure, they suggest several possible schemes for the oxidation states of the pMMO metal centers (Figure 3).29 We consider these scenarios in the context of three findings: all pMMO samples, including those from M. trichosporium OB3b23 and M. capsulatus (strain M),35 exhibit a type 2 Cu" signal that disappears upon reduction, EXAFS data indicate an increase in the Cu-Cu distance upon reduction, and as- isolated pMMO contains a mixture of CuI and CuII. An additional consideration, on the basis of the sequence
