        "content": "7um8 | Particulate MMO. The first crystal structure of pM M O was that of the M. capsulatus (Bath) enzyme, determined in two thousand five to two point eight angstrom resolution. Structures of pM M Os from Methylosinus trichosporium OB three B, Methylocystis species strain M, and Methylocystis species strain Rockwell have also been reported. The pmoB, pmoA, and pmoC subunits are arranged as a three hundred kDa trimer, which is consistent with electron microscopic data. The pmoB subunit, forty-two kDa, consists of two cupredoxin-like domains linked by two transmembrane helices. The pmoA, twenty-four kDa, and pmoC, twenty-two kDa, subunits are composed primarily of transmembrane helices. In three of the four pM M O crystal structures, an additional helix not connected to any of the pM M O subunits is observed and appears to interact closely with the pmoC. In the Methylocystis species strain Rockwell pM M O structure, this interaction is mediated by a lipid molecule. Since pM M O is crystallized from the native organism, this yet to be identified helix is likely physiologically relevant.\nuow2 | METAL CENTERS AND ACTIVE SITE STRUCTURE\niat7 | Soluble MMO. M M O H contains only one type of metal center, the diiron active site located in each a subunit in the a28212 dimer. This diiron center is housed within a four-helix bundle of which surface-exposed helices E and F play key roles in modulating structural changes throughout the catalytic cycle. Fe one is coordinated by His147, Glu114, and a water molecule, and Fe two is coordinated by His246, Glu243, and Glu209. The two iron ions are bridged by residue Glu144 and two hydroxides. Upon reduction, the Fe-Fe\nywwr | Current Topic\n0i6j | distance increases from approximately three point one angstroms to approximately three point three angstroms, and Glu243 undergoes a carboxylate shift, replacing the bridging hydroxide ion as a ligand to the diiron center. This shift opens a site for reaction with dioxygen. It is well established that the two iron ions are present as an antiferromagnetically coupled diiron three site in oxidized M M O H and a weakly ferromagnetically coupled diiron two center in reduced M M O H. A mixed valence form can also be generated, but does not play a role in the catalytic cycle.\n87cq | Particulate MMO. In contrast to M M O H, several metal centers are observed in the structures of pM M O. All structures contain a copper binding site at the N-terminus of the pmoB subunit with ligands His33, which is the amino terminal residue of pmoB, His137, and His139, M. capsulatus, Bath numbering. Guided by extended X-ray absorption fine structure data, this site was modeled as two copper ions with a Cu-Cu distance of approximately two point five angstroms in the structures of M. capsulatus Bath and M. trichosporium OB three B pM M O, and in one protomer of Methylocystis species strain M pM M O. However, the moderate crystallographic resolution, two point six to three point nine angstroms, precludes definitive assignment of the nuclearity. This site was modeled as monocopper in Methylocystis species strain Rockwell pM M O and in two protomers of Methylocystis species strain M pM M O. Both of these pM M Os exhibit low copper binding stoichiometries once the enzyme is purified and concentrated. In the Methylocystis species strain Rockwell pM M O structure, a solvent molecule is modeled coordinated to the single copper ion and is within hydrogen bonding distance of Glu31, Glu35 using M. capsulatus Bath numbering. A monocopper site is also present at the equivalent location in the one point eight angstrom resolution structure of the soluble domain of the amoB",
