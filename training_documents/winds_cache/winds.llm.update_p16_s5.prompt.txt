You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).

Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021.

mror | C. mastigophora is an edible jellyfish species, and a fishery has been established in Indonesia (Java south coast) based on export to Japan (Omori & Nakano, 2001; Kitamura & Omori, 2010). To avoid confusion, it is worth noting here, that Rumpet (1991) provides an excellent description of another sea-east Asian fishery for "red" jellyfish, but it is unlikely that this is <LATEX>C .</LATEX> mastigophora. Rumpet's (1991) report from the South China Sea (Sarawak, Malaysia) almost certainly refers to Rhopilema esculentum Kishinouye 1891 based on the description of fisheries for this species and Rhopilema hispidum (Vanhöffen 1888) (white) else- where in the South China Sea (Vietnam) by Nishikawa
zlxc | et al. (2008). The economic feasibility of a fishery for <LATEX>C .</LATEX> mastigophora has not been evaluated in Australia and maybe worthy of examination especially if swarms continue to have detrimental economic impacts.
k0bw | Bivalve larvae, pteropods and invertebrate eggs dominated the prey items we found on <LATEX>C .</LATEX> mastigo- phora arms and 26% of all observed prey items were bivalve larvae. Nothing is known of the feeding rates of <LATEX>C .</LATEX> mastigophora; however, at the population sizes we recorded the potential for them to deplete plankton from the water column must be considered. Some jellyfish species feed predominantly and selectively on bivalve mollusc larvae including other rhizostome jellyfish. For example, Larson (1991) found very high feeding rates by Stomolophus meleagris Agassiz 1862 on oyster larvae which made up 56% of prey items and Ballard & Myers (1997) found bivalve larvae made up more than 80% of the diet of Proboscidactyla stellata (Forbes 1846). In the southern Kimberley region where we observed significant swarms in 2006, 2010, 2011, and 2012, the silver lipped pearl oyster Pinctada maxima (Jameson 1901) forms the basis of Australia's pearl industry valued at A$120 million per year (Hart & Joll, 2006). P. maxima spawn in the spring beginning in September when the peak spawning occurs although the spawning season can extend through to April (Rose et al., 1990). The peak spawning period coincides with the same period that C. mastigophora swarms have occurred near Broome and Eighty Mile Beach which is the most important area for pearl oyster broodstock in north-western Australia (Condie et al., 2006), meaning that when they are dense, <LATEX>C .</LATEX> mastigophora might be a significant predator of pearl oyster larvae. Condie et al. (2006) showed how tidal currents dominate pearl oyster larval transport in the Eighty Mile Beach region meaning larvae are retained in the area. This would make them vulnerable to large swarms of <LATEX>C .</LATEX> mastigophora which would be subject to the same transport patterns. Larson (1991) measured the feeding rate of the closely related <LATEX>S .</LATEX> meleagris and found a 325 g jellyfish would consume 6,000 prey items per day over half of which were oyster larvae. Based on these feeding rates, the population numbers of <LATEX>C .</LATEX> mastigophora estimated in this study <LATEX>\left( > 5 0 \times 1 0 ^ { 6 } \right.</LATEX> million, <LATEX>1 . 4 \times 1 0 ^ { 4 }</LATEX> tonnes) could consume upwards of <LATEX>3 \times 1 0 ^ { 1 1 }</LATEX> oyster larvae per day. It is important that a more in-depth study of the diet and feeding rate of <LATEX>C .</LATEX> mastigophora be
aq5a | undertaken to determine its significance as a predator of <LATEX>P .</LATEX> maxima and other bivalve larvae as our data on diet represent just a snapshot in time.
sc5y | Studies on the planktonic system are also required to determine the relative abundance of oyster larvae and other plankton in the water column as well as in the diet of <LATEX>C .</LATEX> mastigophora. The low C:N ratio (3.9:1) and <LATEX>8 C ^ { 1 3 } \left( - 2 0 . 8 \right)</LATEX> of <LATEX>C .</LATEX> mastigophora tissue indicate a dependence on marine derived sources of carbon in its diet (Meyers, 1997). The <LATEX>\mathrm { C } : \mathrm { N }</LATEX> ratio is similar to that found in other jellyfish: 4.0:1 (Faganeli et al., 1988) and 3.1:1 to 4:2:1 (Cui et al., 2012). The <LATEX>8 C ^ { 1 3 } \left( - 2 0 . 8 \right)</LATEX> and <LATEX>8 \mathrm { N } ^ { 1 5 }</LATEX> (8.1) isotopic signatures of <LATEX>C .</LATEX> mastigophora are similar to that recorded for another catostylid jellyfish (Catostylus mosaicus (Quoy and Gaimard 1824), <LATEX>\left. 8 C ^ { 1 3 } = - 2 0 . 9 \text { to } - 2 2 . 2 \right)</LATEX> (Pitt et al., 2008) and a rhizostome jellyfish (8 <LATEX>C ^ { 1 3 } = - 2 2 . 0</LATEX> to -17.4, 8 <LATEX>N ^ { 1 5 } = 4 . 8</LATEX> to 10.6 by Cui et al. (2012) but lower than in Pelagia noctiluca <LATEX>\left( 8 C ^ { 1 3 } = - 1 8 . 8 \right)</LATEX> (Faganeli et al., 1988; Malej et al., 1993). Pitt et al. (2008) found that copepods and mysids were the most important com- ponents of the diet of <LATEX>C .</LATEX> mosaicus based on compar- ative analysis of jellyfish and prey item stable isotope values. The use of stable isotopes can be used to infer the importance of particular food sources integrated over time as opposed to a snapshot in time in the case of prey items sampled from jellyfish arms (Pitt et al., 2009a). However, we can conclude little about the importance of different components of the diet of <LATEX>C .</LATEX> mastigophora over the longer term given we lack stable isotope data for the prey items we found and the difficulties interpreting diet from jellyfish tissue isotopic signatures without adequate temporal, spatial, ontogenetic and between organ sampling (Pitt et al., 2009a).
