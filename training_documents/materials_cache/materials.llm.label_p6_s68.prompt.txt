You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

sk5m | The cubic coordination can also be realized by the cation Eo. Eo6O12 has the optimal solution correspond- ing to the zirconia structure shown in Fig. 5(e). The cation Eo can also make the coordination polyhedra of

877u | square antiprism as shown in Fig. 5(f).
rzhj | Op4Ht4O12 has the optimal solution corresponding to the crystal structure of YFeO3 which is composed of coordination polyhedra of capped trigonal prisms as shown in Fig. 6(a). YFeO3 and the optimal solution shown in Fig. 6(b) have the same symmetry, but the latter structure is composed of 5 LGCs, and capped trigonal prisms in the structure share the faces. The manner of atomic distribution in YFeO3 is the same as LaMg_ Ta1-201+3x N2-3x which can be employed for overall water splitting at wavelengths of up to 600 nm [40]. The correspondence implies the applicability of our method to mixed anion compounds. On the other hand, we could not find the optimal solution correspond- ing to the crystal structure of Sr2PdO4 in the optimal solutions of Op4HdO16. However, the optimal solution, which has 4 LGCs and the Pbam symmetry shown in Fig. 6(c), is similar to the crystal structure of Sr2PdO4; they have the same symmetry, and the difference only comes from the kind of linking between octahedra and capped trigonal prisms. In the optimal solution, octahe- dra and capped trigonal prisms share the faces, while in the crystal structure of Sr2PdO4, they share edges. In general, our algorithm tends to generate polyhedra shar- ing as many common bridging atoms as possible.
bfax | Finally, Pe2Sh1O4 has the optimal solution corre- sponding to the crystal structure of InGaZnO4. However, it may be difficult to form trigonal bipyramidal coordi- nation polyhedra using the cation Pe, which possesses a hard cationic radius of C5. Note that in the hexago- nal closest packing of oxygen ions, the center of trigonal bipyramid is identical with the interstice between three atoms in the hexagonal layer, and accordingly, the axial atoms of the bipyramid are 41% more distant than the equatorial atoms from the central atoms. Also, note that C5 is same as C6.
f2y8 | In summary, we propose a novel method to enumer- ate crystal structure prototypes using the paired math-

The method consists of two optimization problems. The first is the minimization problem of the volume of the unit cell under the geometrical constraints that are the minimum and maximum distances between every pair of atoms, while the second is the maximization problem of the number of chemical bonds. The constraints of the two problems make every optimal solution satisfy a series of empirical rules systematized in inorganic structural chemistry [24, 25]. The two optimization problems are solved alternately to find a proper structure where every cation satisfies its bonding needs by transpositions of ge- ometrical constraints as sillium approach for amorphous silicons [28-31]. We find that the linear relaxations of inequality constraints are effective, and accordingly, the small computational cost enables the exhaustive search for the optimal solutions of large-scale systems. We apply the mathematical programming to cases with 18 compo- sitions, find the optimal solutions for each case success- fully, and identify the corresponding real crystal struc- tures. Our result strongly implies that the number of op- timal solutions in the mathematical programming seems to be much smaller than the number of local minima in the total energy by ab-initio simulations. A small number of optimal solutions, identified through the mathemati- cal programming, can be easily validated using ab-initio simulations to assess their stability. We anticipate that these optimal solutions may lead to the discovery of novel materials. The successful reproduction of a broad range of oxide crystal structures may suggest the emergence of a universal rule, potentially resulting from the precise refinement of the Pauling rules as demonstrated in this study. Given the proven success with oxide cases, it is anticipated that this method could be extended to other cases such as chalcogenides, mixed anionic compounds, intermetallic compounds, and borides, provided that ef- fective principles are established.

cp13 | A. Geometrical constraints
bgre | Figure S1(a) shows the optimal solution of Hd4Og cor- reponding to the rutile structure. Every oxygen makes three chemical bonds with Hd, while every Hd makes six chemical bonds with oxygens. Parallel linear strands of edge-sharing octahedra are joined by common octa- hedron vertices. Oxygen ions constitute the hexagonal closest-packings, and the structure is reproduced by the anionic constraints between every pair of oxygen ions. Figure S1(b) shows the optimal solution of Hd4Og cor- reponding to the a-PbO2 structure. The zigzag chains of edge-sharing octahedra are also joined by common vertices. If a pair of oxygen and Hd is not connected by a chemical bond, a non-bonding constraint connects them. Every Hd makes ten polyhedral constraints, and two of them correspond to edge-sharing. These two op- timal solutions, which correspond to the rutile structure and the a-PbO2 structure, respectively, have the same structural fingerprint, because the two structures have the same number of LGCs of the same type, where a fingerprint of a LGC enumerates the element symbols of the adjacent atoms linked by chemical bonds, polyhedral constraints, and anionic constraints in dictionary order, respectively. Figures S1(c) shows the optimal solution Ht4O6 correponding to the corundum structure. There are pairs of face-sharing octahedra, and every octahe- dron shares three edges within a layer and three vertices with octahedra from the adjacent layer to which it has no face-sharing connection.

Second, the lattice is expanded until the sum of the volume of the atomic spheres becomes 70% of the volume of the unit cell, where the anionic and cationic radii are set to be 0.6 and 1.4, respectively.
