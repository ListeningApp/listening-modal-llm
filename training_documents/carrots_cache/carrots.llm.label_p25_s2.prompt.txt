You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

06yq | Microdosing with psychedelics to self-medicate for ADHD symptoms in adults: A naturalistic study

8r5j | ABSTRACT
2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

7911 | 3. Founders' Position in the Firm
sn4j | The entrepreneurial team is likely to have a greater incentive to block a trade sale if the founder is still the CEO. First, a founder-CEO is likely to own more common stock than a replacement CEO; everything else equal, he or she will thus face a greater loss of option value if the firm is sold. Second, a founder-CEO may derive greater nonfinancial benefits from the business and thus may have additional incentive to keep the firm independent.
e927 | The entrepreneurial team may also have greater ability to impede a sale if the founder is still the CEO. A founder-CEO is likely to have substantially more common stock than a hired CEO, giving him more shareholder-blocking power. Compared to a hired CEO, the founder-CEO is also likely to have longer and deeper relationships with other directors and common shareholders. As a result, the founder-CEO is likely to have influence over directors and other common shareholders, increasing the likelihood that directors will resist the trade sale and further increasing the likelihood that common shareholders will vote against the transaction.
iyt5 | To reduce resistance to a trade sale, a firm's VC investors may use their control over the board of directors to replace the CEO before the planned exit. In our 50-firm sample, 29 of the founders (58%) were replaced as CEOs before the firm was sold. However, as we will discuss shortly, none of these replacements appeared to be made to overcome resistance to a trade sale.
f5f4 | ACTUAL CARROTS AND STICKS IN THE SALE OF VC-BACKED STARTUPS
3vbf | Part III described the potential carrots and sticks that VCs could deploy to induce entrepreneurial teams to sell the firm. Here, we describe the actual carrots (subpart A) and sticks (subpart B) used in our sample. We also describe the total out-of-pocket cost to the VCs in our sample of using carrots in connection with trade sales.
mkkr | A. Carrots
opg2 | 1. Common Carve-Outs
upma | In our sample, 11 sales (22% of 50 sales) feature carve-outs to common shareholders-extra value above the amount to which they were contractually entitled. To measure these carve-outs, we compare the actual payout received by VCs to the VCs' contractual entitlement. When VCs convert their preferred shares to common shares, their contractual entitlement equals their pro rata share of the sale price. When VCs exit as preferred shareholders,
z6xx | Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2221033
jwc7 | CARROTS AND STICKS
k3tc | their contractual entitlement is the lesser of their liquidation preferences and the sale price.89 Any excess payment received by the original common shareholders is treated as a carve-out to common.
xu7w | Table 3 describes the carve-outs to common shareholders in our sample. Limited to the 11 sales in which a carve-out occurs, the average carve-out to common shareholders is $3.7 million, or approximately 10% of the total sale price. Though most firms do not provide a carve-out, carve-outs can be substantial when they occur. In our sample, one sale provided a $10 million carve-out to common shareholders, and in two deals, the carve-out was at least 25% of the total sale price.
tnpl | Carve-outs to common shareholders occur only in the 42 firms where the VCs exit holding preferred stock. Limited to the subsample of 42 firms where VC investors did not convert their preferred shares to common shares, we find that common shareholders receive, on average, $969,000 more than their contractual entitlement, or approximately 2.5% of the total sale price. Among all 50 companies, common shareholders receive, on average, $810,000 more than their contractual entitlement, or approximately 2.2% of the total sale price.
a23k | Carve-outs to common shareholders are illustrated in Figure 1. Each bar represents a firm's total sale price (in millions of dollars). The sale price is divided into four components: (1) the amount actually paid to VCs (in black); (2) the contractual entitlement of the original common shareholders at the given sale price (in white); (3) the carve-out given to the original common shareholders (in dark grey); and (4) nonretention bonuses paid to senior management in connection with the sale (in light grey).
jslm | INSERT FIGURE 1 AND TABLE 3 HERE
zpfa | In our sample, common carve-outs are used, at least in part, to overcome common shareholders' opposition to trade sales. Elsewhere, we showed econometrically that these carve-outs are more likely to occur when: (1) VCs lack de facto board control and thus need to convince other directors-such as independent directors and common-appointed directors-to support the sale; (2) the firm is domiciled in California rather than Delaware, and therefore common shareholders' rights are likely to be slightly stronger; or (3) common shareholders would otherwise be wiped out and receive none of the sale proceeds.90
s2z2 | Qualitative interview data confirm that carve-outs to common shareholders are designed to induce common shareholders and their allies on the board to support the sale. In one California-domiciled firm, for example, the VCs carving out a portion of their liquidation preferences for common

uig1 | shareholders required each common shareholder to sign a liability waiver before receiving a portion of the carve-out. According to the entrepreneur, the carve-out was offered only because the VCs were concerned about a possible common-shareholder suit challenging the terms of the sale. In another case, where the VCs lacked board control, the entrepreneur told us that the VCs were forced to give a carve-out payment to common shareholders to obtain the support of other directors.
puiz | Of course, some of the carve-outs to common might have had other motives. VCs might have wanted to be "fair" to common shareholders or to build or maintain a reputation as "friendly" VCs. However, the fact that these carve-outs are more likely to occur when common shareholders have more power, or more incentive to block a sale, suggests that they are being used at least in part to induce common shareholders' cooperation with sales.
563d | 2. (Nonretention) Management Bonuses
gpcp | Bonuses that do not require management to stay with the acquirer might be used as carrots to induce executives to support a sale.91 Of the 50 firms in our sample, sixteen offered various nonretention management bonuses in connection with the acquisition, with an average bonus in these 16 firms of $1.63 million (or 6.6% of the sale price). Bonuses are sometimes given to a broad class of employees (five firms), but in most cases they are limited to key executives (11 firms).
ojp1 | Among all 50 companies, senior executives receive an average nonretention bonus of approximately $520,000. Across all companies, these payments represent approximately 2.1% of the total purchase price (or 0.95% on a dollar-weighted basis).92 Compared to bonuses awarded in connection with the sale of publicly held firms, the payments we document are modest in dollar terms, but large as a fraction of deal size.93 Nonretention management bonuses are depicted in Figure 1.
mllr | Of course, VCs might have other reasons to give executives a management bonus besides inducing them to sell the company. They may want to reward the executives for a job well done or to curry favor with
1hop | Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2221033
wyz3 | CARROTS AND STICKS
umuu | executives whom they hope to hire in the future. Thus, we cannot be certain that all of the nonretention bonuses observed were sale-related carrots.
k3o7 | 3. Cost of Carrots
ec5m | In our sample, 23 of the 50 firms offer a management bonus or common carve-out. Limited to the group of 23 firms offering a carrot, Figure 2 illustrates the value of these benefits relative to the sale price. In most cases, total carrots represent between 5% and 12% of the sale price, with a mean amount of approximately $2.9 million (or 9.4% of deal value) (Table 3). In two firms, however, total carrots exceed 20% of deal value.
czyq | Across all 50 firms, the total cost of carrots (those given to executives plus those given to common shareholders) is about $1.33 million for the average sample firm (Table 3). Across all companies, the average carrot is approximately 4.3% of the purchase price (or 2.4% on a dollar-weighted basis).94
l48a | INSERT FIGURE 2 HERE
oe9w | The use of carrots is greater in the 42 firms in our sample where the VC investors did not convert to common stock, and thus where the conflict between the entrepreneurial team and VCs was likely to be the greatest. In this subsample of forty-two firms we find that the total cost of carrots is about $1.51 million for the average firm and that approximately 5.0% of deal value (3.1% on a dollar-weighted basis) was used to fund carrots.
off5 | B. Sticks
sf66 | As explained earlier, the two potential sticks available to VCs in dealing with recalcitrant executives are firing them and threatening to blacklist them, and the two sticks that can be used against common shareholders are cross-voting and vote buying. This section describes the use of such sticks in our sample.
zz00 | 1. Termination of CEO
s3yz | Recall that 29 of the 50 founders of our firms had been replaced before the sale. But these replacements typically occurred well before the sale, usually in connection with a later round of financing.95 After three years of operating, approximately 30% of the firms in our sample had replaced the founder-CEO. Of those firms still in operation after six years, approximately 63% of the firms had replaced the founder-CEO.96 Data on the timing of

q61q | 2013]
fwgs | CEO replacement in our sample are summarized in Table 4.
6l8g | INSERT TABLE 4 HERE
2v3s | In fact, none of the entrepreneurs providing us with data indicated that any founder (or other executive) was fired or threatened with being fired immediately in connection with a contemplated sale. Moreover, while the impetus for replacing the founder-CEO typically came from the VCs, there was little conflict over the replacement of the founder-CEO.97 None of the terminated founder-CEOs reported that the VCs had caused the firm to repurchase vested options or had fired the founder-CEO to strip him or her of unvested equity, a possibility raised by Michael Klausner and Kate Litvak.98
z6e1 | Indeed, most of the replaced founders reported significant involvement with the firm after the CEO change. The founder-CEO remained on the board following the CEO replacement in almost 60% (17 out of 29) of our sample firms. Even when the founder does not keep a board seat, he or she generally has some position with the firm after replacement (often serving as the Chief Technology Officer or in some other executive capacity).
ccsa | To be sure, even if we do not observe forcible termination, the possibility of such termination is always present. The possibility of termination limits the value of management bonuses that executives can extract from the VCs.
1dvu | 2. Blacklisting
mnn4 | In two firms (Firm 35 and Firm 50), VCs explicitly threatened to prevent a founder from ever raising money again in Silicon Valley if he or she did not vote for the sale as a director. In each of these firms, the founder's support was not necessary as a matter of corporate law to conduct the sale-the VCs had control of the board-but the VCs wanted a unanimous board vote to reduce liability risk. And they got it in both situations.
we7g | Again, the fact that blacklisting was explicitly threatened in only two firms does not mean that founders or executives in other firms were not affected by the possibility of blacklisting. We have been told by VCs and venture capital lawyers that entrepreneurs are keenly aware, even if they have not been explicitly told, that if they behave "unreasonably" toward the VCs backing their firm, it will be very difficult for them to raise funds from other VCs in the future. Our results thus understate the importance of blacklisting

wjl4 | 3. Cross-Voting
qgqj | In one firm (Firm 29), VC investors engaged in cross-voting, the scheme used in Orban v. Fields. Firm 29, which was California-domiciled, received $50 million over three rounds of VC financing and was sold in 2004 for $20 million. At the time of sale, the VCs already controlled the board of directors, the founder had already been replaced as CEO, and the VCs collectively had liquidation preferences exceeding $100 million (the third-round financing included a 3x preference). The founder refused to vote his common stock in favor of the sale.99 Because the firm was incorporated in California, approval by a majority of the common shareholders was necessary to sell the firm, giving the founder some degree of blocking power. To eliminate this holdup, the VCs converted a fraction of their preferred stock into common shares. This maneuver did not cost the VCs anything because, as in Orban, the VCs were left postconversion with liquidation preferences far greater than the $20 million sale price.100
8cda | Firm 29 was the only company in our sample where this form of cross- voting was actually used. However, other founders, especially those of firms whose common stock was far underwater, reported that they were aware that VCs could engage in this tactic. Thus, demands for carve-outs to common shareholders are made in the shadow of possible cross-voting.101
aoy6 | 4. Vote Buying
l20z | Vote buying reportedly occurred in one firm (Firm 49) in our sample. The firm was California-domiciled, and there were no drag-along rights. The founder reported that the VC-controlled board paid the CEO and other employees to exercise underwater options to acquire and vote common stock in favor of a trade sale for about $80 million. In addition to this stick, the VCs used a carrot: they provided a $4 million carve-out to common shareholders. The founder sued the VCs, alleging vote buying and improprieties associated with a presale financing round. The case was settled for an undisclosed amount.
r4to | Of course, implicit and essentially undetectable vote buying might be occurring through management bonuses because of the considerable overlap between shareholders and executives. Thus, we cannot rule out the possibility that vote buying was occurring in other firms in our sample.

zf2f | CONCLUSION
y77l | Trade sales by VCs are actually much more common than IPOs and, in the aggregate, are likely to be just as financially important to VCs. However, unlike IPOs, trade sales do not trigger the intense public-disclosure requirements of the securities laws. As a result, we know relatively little about them.
a8wo | In this Article, we seek to shed light on how VCs arrange to sell startups in trade sales. In particular, we investigate how VCs induce the founder, other executives, and common shareholders to go along with a trade sale that they might otherwise have an incentive to resist.
