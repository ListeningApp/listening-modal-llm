In this section it is assumed that the standard deviation is the same for each treatment group although alternative formulae are available when this is clearly not the case. The standard deviation can be estimated from previous observational studies or in some cases a pilot study will be required. However, as when considering two percentages, it is advisable to calculate the required sample size for a number of different scenarios.\nn1wo | To distinguish between means and percentages ut one and ut two will be used to refer to the anticipated means in the two treatment groups.\n5bq3 | As for the comparison of percentages, there are certain assumptions and decisions that need to be made. These are as follows:\nezla | I one equals anticipated mean response on the standard treatment\nrsbu | Mu two equals anticipated mean response on the alternative treatment\nmagd | Sigma equals standard deviation of response (assumed the same on both treatments)\ntb74 | Alpha equals risk of a type one error (significance level)\n8l69 | Beta equals risk of a type two error. Once these values have been decided upon, the required number per group can be calculated as follows:\n1jyv | N equals function of alpha, beta times two sigma squared divided by mu one minus mu two squared in each group. Note that the actual values of mu one and mu two are less important than the treatment difference to be detected. Suppose delta is the anticipated treatment difference then the above formula can be written as:\nolce | N equals function of alpha, beta times two sigma squared divided by delta squared in each group. Seven point two Example in kidney transplantation\nerx1 | The REPAIR trial was designed to assess the impact of remote ischaemic preconditioning using repeated inflations of a blood pressure cuff on kidney function in patients undergoing kidney transplantation. The outcome of interest is a glomerular filtration rate at one year.\nb3bt | The assumptions are as follows:\n0w8m | Delta equals four point seven three milliliters per minute per one point seventy-three square meters superiority with RIPC equals mu one minus mu two equivalent to a one thousand ninety-six improvement. Sigma equals thirteen point nine milliliters per minute per one point seventy-three square meters from a previous study\nvcu3 | Alpha equals zero point zero five. Beta equals zero point two, i.e. power equals zero point eight or eighty percent. The number required in each group is two hundred twenty-two seven point eighty-five times two times thirteen point nine squared divided by four point seven three squared equals one hundred thirty-six, two hundred seventy-two in total.\nhjzj | To allow for losses to follow-up the trial requires approximately three hundred twenty patients.\nj79f | It has been seen already when estimating the sample size for comparing percentages that as the absolute difference to detect decreases then the number required increases. In addition, as the significance level decreases or as the power increases this also leads to an increase in the numbers required. The same principles apply when comparing means as can be seen from the sample size formula.\n6tbv | The impact of the standard deviation (sigma) also needs to be considered when comparing means. As the standard deviation increases so the number required in each group also increases. For example, suppose that the standard deviation was estimated to be fourteen point nine instead of thirteen point nine in the example given previously.\nxb13 | The number required in each group becomes two hundred twenty-two seven point eighty-five times two times fourteen point nine squared divided by four point seven three squared equals one hundred fifty-six. Three hundred twelve in total.\ncxqi | Conversely, as the estimated standard deviation decreases so does the number of patients required. For example, suppose that the standard deviation was estimated to be twelve point nine percent.\nqfmx | The number required in each group would be two hundred twenty-two seven point eighty-five times two times twelve point nine squared divided by four point seven three squared equals one hundred seventeen, i.e. two hundred thirty-four in total.\nrut3 | Seven point three Potential of adjustment in the analysis on the sample size for comparing two means\nm3cp | It has already been stated that sample sizes are often disappointingly large even before making any adjustments. However, there is one scenario where it may be possible to reduce the required size if the primary outcome is a continuous measure which is also measured at baseline.\nmq4s | A detailed discussion is beyond the scope of this session and requires an understanding of an analysis technique call 'analysis of covariance' (ANCOVA). Basically this method takes advantage of the fact that the outcome measure for individual patients is likely to be strongly correlated to the baseline value. For example, in the REPAIR trial an estimate of the glomerular filtration rate of the transplanted kidney from the living donor is available and is expected to be correlated to the kidney function at one year following transplantation. This information was used in the analysis of the data.\n95el | Eight Adjustments to sample size calculations\na0a5 | In the calculations so far it has been assumed that full information is available on everyone (i.e. no losses to follow-up) and also that every patient receives the treatment they are allocated. In reality this is rarely achieved and some adjustments to the sample size needs to be made to account for this.\ngocl | In this section the implications of these two scenarios will briefly be considered including what adjustments can be made. Note that these adjustments make certain assumptions but provide useful guidance to the number required. In addition, the situation where more patients will be randomized to one group than the other will also be discussed.\nob1z | Eight point one Losses to follow-up\nm4cb | If patients are lost to follow-up for some endpoint then this reduces the effective sample size. For example, if two percent of patients in the UK PACE trial were expected to be lost to follow-up for mortality then the effective sample size of one thousand nine hundred twenty-six would be reduced by two percent (although in the UK, the Office of National Statistics can notify the trial when a patient dies).\nm61y | Suppose the proportion expected to be lost to follow-up is 'Q' then, in order to adjust for this, the total sample size needs to be multiplied by\n```",
