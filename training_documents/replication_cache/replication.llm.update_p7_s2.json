Crowns frequently are the origins of filaments that likely represent nascent progeny positive RNAs being exported into the cytosol. Below we outline recent findings that similar crown-like complexes of RNA replication factors are formed by alphaviruses and coronaviruses, suggesting that such features are widely conserved in positive RNA viruses.\n121u | Mapping a genetically engineered hexahistidine (His six) tag showed that the FHV crown apical lobe corresponds to the protein A RdRp domain. This accessible position appears consistent with the RdRp domain's roles in RNA template recruitment and potentially in negative-strand RNA synthesis, but less compatible with positive RNA synthesis due to its distance from the vesicle-bound dsRNA template. Thus, positive RNA synthesis might depend on an alternate protein A state with its RdRp domain deeper in the crown, either by bending of one or more crown apical lobes toward the vesicle or through an alternate form of protein A, as suggested by asymmetric electron-dense bodies often seen inside the crown turret. Further mapping of protein A's RNA capping and other domains within the crown should provide more powerful foundations for understanding and testing crown function and RC assembly and maturation.\nzh03 | Given these new revelations on FHV RC and crown structure, the tight linkage of FHV spherule formation to viral RNA synthesis suggests that the spherule RC may be formed during negative RNA synthesis by inflating the vesicle with the dsRNA product, like blowing up a balloon. A similar model was proposed among other alternatives for Semliki Forest alphavirus.\n1mvw | Two point two. Alphavirus-Like Superfamily\n6d4s | The alphavirus-like superfamily of positive RNA viruses includes members that infect animals, insects, fungi, and plants, united by four conserved domains in their RNA replication proteins: an RNA MTase/capping domain, membrane-interactive Iceberg region, superfamily one NTPase/helicase, and RdRp. Through multiple phylogenetic interconnections, this alphavirus-like superfamily, the nodavirus-tombusvirus clade discussed above, and the flavivirus superfamily discussed below are now grouped together in phylum Kitrinoviricota, which represents approximately fifty percent of positive RNA viruses. This broad linkage underscores structural and functional parallels discussed here within and beyond this phylum.\nmqah | Alphavirus RNA replication has best been studied for Semliki Forest virus and Sindbis virus, and increasingly for some more clinically important pathogens such as Chikungunya virus, also known as C H I K V. Alphaviruses encode a nonstructural polyprotein that is processed by a viral protease into nonstructural proteins (nsPs) one through four. nsP one contains the RNA MTase/capping domain, the Iceberg region, and a second membrane-associating region. nsP two has the NTPase/helicase, the protease, and a potential two-prime-O-MTase. nsP three has a macrodomain, zinc-binding domain, and hypervariable region. nsP four contains the RdRp domain. Alphavirus RNA replication occurs in characteristic sixty- to seventy-nanometer spherule vesicles that are induced on the plasma membrane and then, to degrees varying among different alphaviruses, are endocytosed into endosomal and lysosomal compartments.\nxxr8 | Equivalent spherule RCs are induced by numerous plant-infecting alphavirus-like viruses. EM studies confirmed the same spherule architecture as for alphaviruses and provided particularly detailed views of spherule necks through freeze-fracture studies with turnip yellow mosaic virus. Evidence for spherules as the sites of viral RNA synthesis progressively accumulated from multiple viruses. For example, autoradiography mapped incorporated uridine three H to cytopathic vesicles bearing spherules, electron-dense fibrils inside spherules were identified as dsRNA, i.e., potential replication intermediates, by RNase sensitivity in low salt and dsRNA-specific antibodies, and bromine rUTP incorporation was mapped directly to spherules by EM immunogold labeling. Further details of spherule formation and function were revealed\nrl4j | by brome mosaic virus, or B M V, studies showing that nsP one/nsP two-like B M V one a protein induces spherule formation, recruits genomic positive RNA through specific cis-signals to the spherule interior, and recruits nsP four-like B M V two a pol to synthesize first one negative RNA retained in the spherule and then many positive RNAs released to the cytosol.\nvz32 | Additional connections between alphavirus and nodavirus RCs emerged when cryo-EM single-particle analysis of C H I K V nsP one revealed an nsP one dodecamer ring. This nsP one dodecamer has been visualized to date from exogenously expressed, detergent-solubilized nsP one, and not in an alphavirus RC. Nevertheless, the parallel twelve-fold symmetry of crowns in active nodavirus RCs and conservation of the capping domain, Iceberg region, and polymerase domain between alphaviruses and nodaviruses suggests that the nsP one dodecamer likely forms the membrane-bound base of a larger crown also incorporating nsP two, nsP three, and the nsP four RdRp, and serves as a cytosolic export channel for progeny\nncb0 | positive RNAs. One nsP one-nsP one dodecamer interface includes amphipathic detergent-binding projections, suggesting that oligomerization and membrane binding may be coupled. As in nodavirus crowns, nsP one's ordered contacts with lipids likely generate and stabilize the curvature of the membrane neck. Additionally, the nsP one MTase domain structure shares features with eukaryotic mRNA cap (guanine-N seven) MTase Ecm one, suggesting structural and mechanistic interpretations of alphavirus five prime RNA capping reactions involving m seven G T P methylation, m seven G M P - nsP one complex formation, and m seven GpppRNA formation.\n8mp0 | Two point three. Flaviviruses\nxjyk | A third class of positive RNA viruses forming spherule RCs are the Flaviviridae, which include major pathogens such as Zika, yellow fever, and dengue viruses. Flaviviruses encode a single polyprotein that is cleaved into three structural proteins and seven nonstructural N S RNA replication proteins. NS five contains the RdRp and RNA capping enzyme. NS three contains an RNA helicase/NTPase and the polyprotein processing protease. NS two A, NS two B, NS four A, and NS four B are membrane-spanning proteins that induce a continuous membrane network comprising vesicle packets, convoluted membranes, and virion assembly/budding sites.",
