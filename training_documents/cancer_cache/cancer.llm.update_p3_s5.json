Overall, the three-D models may be divided into several major categories: spheroid-based, microengineering-based, and scaffold-based categories, and organoids and tumoroids. A graphical summary of each three-D model can be found in Figure one, while Table one presents the main advantages, disadvantages, and complexity (evaluated from low to high) of each cancer three-D model. Besides these types of cellular three-D models, explant-based three-D models have also been applied to cancer research. Precision-cut tissue slices are a type of three-D tissue explant derived from human or animal organs. Notwithstanding their ability to closely mimic in vivo conditions, explant-based models such as precision-cut tissue slices still present ethical questions regarding the use of animal models. Thus, we will not explore the details of this type of cell model more deeply in the present review.\nerx1 | Three point one. Spheroid-Based Models\nb3bt | Multicellular tumor spheroids are three-D models that resemble micrometastases or microregions of a tumor, comprising peripheral proliferating cells, deep non-proliferating cells, and, in some cases, a necrotic core, obtained through the self-assembly of tumoral cells. Additionally, the geometry of spheroids allows for studying different sub-populations of cancer cells in relation to their microenvironment. In comparison with two-D monolayer models, spheroids are able to better recapitulate in vivo aspects, such as microenvironment interactions, tissue architecture, gene expression, hypoxic regions, and metabolism. As a result of their similarities with in vivo tumors, multicellular tumor spheroids have been extensively used in research, in particular for the evaluation of different therapeutic strategies.\n0w8m | Despite their several advantages, spheroids also present some limitations, such as imaging difficulties using fluorescence microscopy due to the spheroid thickness and light-scattering phenomenon. This makes high-resolution images of intact spheroids, particularly from their interior, difficult to obtain. This could be addressed by cutting the spheroids into thin slices; however, it may damage the spheroid structure and result in the introduction of artifacts during computational analysis. Alternatively, optical sectioning microscopes, such as confocal laser scanning microscopy, multiphoton microscopy, and light-sheet fluorescence microscopy, can be used to image the deeper regions of intact spheroids.\nvcu3 | Several methods for the efficient growth and manipulation of spheroids derived from rodent and human cancers have been established. The four principal approaches for spheroid production are suspension cultures, hanging drop plates, liquid overlay technique, and low adhesion plates.\nhjzj | Three point one point one. Suspension Cultures\nj79f | In suspension-based or agitation-based approaches, a cell suspension is maintained in motion through stirring or rotation. As the suspended cells are constantly moving, they do not attach to the container walls, but instead develop cell-cell interactions, forming spheroids. This type of culture can be performed in spinner flask bioreactors or rotational culture systems.\n6tbv | Spinner flasks are a simple way of producing spheroids in higher quantities, depending on the size of the bioreactor. Moreover, spinner flasks allow for the control of culture properties, such as culture duration, while constant agitation promotes the transport of nutrients and waste products. However, using spinner flasks involves a constant cell motion, resulting in a shear force that may have a negative impact on cellular physiology, as well as a larger volume of culture medium, making this technique more expensive than other methods. Rotational systems present several similarities with spinner flasks, both in terms of their advantages and disadvantages. However, contrary to the spinner flask, rotational systems present the advantage of having low shear forces, as in this method, both the container and its content are rotating. These two techniques have advantages such as easy maneuvering, affordability, and the ability to scale-up production. However, heterogeneous spheroids regarding size and morphology are limitations that need to be considered, as the manual selection of spheroids may be necessary for drug screening.\nxb13 | Three point one point two. Hanging Drop\ncxqi | Hanging drop plates benefit from the fact that when no surface is available for cell adhesion, cells self-aggregate into spheroids. This is possible using a traditional tissue culture petri dish, where the lid is used to place small droplets, in which the spheroids form. Alternatively, specialized plates with bottomless, open wells that allow for the formation of a small media droplet, can also be used. Kelm et al. described a protocol using hanging drop plates that allows multicellular tumor spheroids growth from a variety of cell lines, including some that are not frequently obtained with other methods. The spheroids produced present\nqfmx | reproducibility, rapid generation, and homogenous size distribution, qualities that are essential for drug screening assays. This last feature in particular is crucial, ensuring that the spheroids can be used immediately without the need to select the appropriate spheroids. Furthermore, with these types of plates, it is possible to use the spheroids in an automated drug-screening platform, which may be relevant to the pharmaceutical industry. However, due to plate incompatibility with microscopes and uncentered spheroids in the well plates, hanging drop plates can be difficult to image. Moreover, media exchange is a difficult process in traditional plates, whereas specialized open-top plates are costly and difficult to adapt to the experimental requirements.\nrut3 | Three point one point three. Liquid Overlay Technique and Low Adhesion Plates\nm3cp | In the liquid overlay technique, cells are cultured on a nonadherent surface and centrifuged to induce spheroid formation. Nevertheless, it is necessary to take\n```",
