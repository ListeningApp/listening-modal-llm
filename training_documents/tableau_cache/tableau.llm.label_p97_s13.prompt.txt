You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

i22c | In the following example, we added the group to the Color shelf on the Marks card of the map. Countries are colored by their membership in the group. Either they are in, or they are out, as shown in the following screenshot:
ofle | Similarly, we can create a set that groups members of a dimension by their adherence to the criteria that you establish.
ezbr | We can create a set that identifies the top 25 countries by life expectancy, which will be used again to modify the map, from the World Bank indicators data source by performing the following steps:
tpiw | 1. Right-click on the Country field in the Dimensions pane.
dgkq | 2. Click on Create and then select Set.
hxjr | 3. Rename the Set to Country Set.
2yv3 | 4. Click on the Condition tab rather than manually selecting the members of the Set so that it will be updated if and when we get new data.

cxyx | Summary
w0aw | In this chapter, we discussed the processes that are the best if you want to design charts, from understanding the requirements, to data discovery, through to an iterative discovery cycle. We discussed the best practices in chart design and data visualization, reviewed the chart types that best answer which types of questions, and explored data dimensions and measures. We also discussed the different impacts that discrete and continuous data elements have on visualizations. Lastly, we talked about the use of reference and trend lines in views.
w41b | In the next chapter, we will talk about how to create calculated fields and table calculations.

7qi5 | The data sources that you query to tell stories do not always have all the data points that you need. If they did, someone else would have told the story already. Tableau Public's data engine allows you to create new mathematical calculations of varying complexity, from basic multiplication functions to sophisticated aggregations with specific levels of detail that add color, context, and key insights to your data stories.
9f5r | In this chapter, we will discuss how to develop new insights for users by understanding and implementing different types of calculated fields. We will use several data sources that we have connected to previously, in order to help you understand the following functions:
j3tt | · Creating and editing calculated fields
zoz0 | · Types of calculations
3blu | · Number functions
xv2l | · String functions
xt4k | · Date functions
ti78 | · Type conversions
k5pk | · Aggregate functions
n093 | · Logic functions
4khi | · Blending data sources
7fh2 | Throughout this chapter, we will present and discuss error messages that you are likely to encounter. We cannot emphasize enough that, especially when presenting information to others using a tool that might be new to them, substance is more important than style. Also, it's very difficult to rebuild credibility once it's been compromised.
5isn | The next chapter focuses on Level of Detail calculations and table calculations. They both are big topics that build on the capabilities that you will learn in this chapter.

johv | In this chapter, we will use a data set of major global floods since 1985, which was found on Tableau Public's resources page. The original source is at http://floodobservatory.colorado.edu/Archives/index.html.
2olp | Creating calculated fields
zb7x | A calculated field that you create exists only in your data source in Tableau Public; it does not exist in the file that you originally queried, which is the reason behind why you are creating it in the first place. In the following examples, we will be creating calculated fields in a data set of floods. The fields that we create will show up in the Dimensions or Measures pane in the Data window in Tableau Public depending on their type of field, with the equals sign (=) next to them.
uadf | In Tableau Public, there are several ways to create a calculated field. The following steps will guide you:
wuf4 | 1. From the Analysis menu, select Create Calculated Field.
lfk1 | 2. Click on the Context menu of the data source and then select Create Calculated Field.
rwjw | 3. Right-click on a field in the Dimensions or Measure pane of a data source. Select Create and then choose Calculated Field.
iazp | Tableau Public has a new calculated field dialog box in version 9.x, which is a significant improvement over the previous versions. When it's open, you can perform functions on your visualization, and if you want to add fields to a calculation, you can drag them into the dialog box from the Data window.
ksn3 | You also can resize the dialog box and show or hide the list of functions.
8xbx | The following screenshot shows the dialog box along with descriptions of each fields:

r4w4 | The following are the descriptions of all the functions shown in the preceding screenshot:
sswz | · Calculated field name (1): This is where you give the field a good, descriptive name so that others understand what it is.
0uoj | . Data source (2): The data source name in which you created the calculated field.
0c89 | . Click on the close icon (3) to close the dialog box.
658v | · The list of functions (4) includes the following function types and elements:
4gqa | ° List of function types, which can be used to filter the list of functions. The options, which will be explored in detail later in this chapter, are as follows:
mpgz | · String
gf06 | · Date
75hv | . Type Conversion
tbiu | · Logical
413q | · Aggregate
8wkl | · User
next | · Table calculation
3dfm | . Filter box (here, you can type in the name of the function type that you would like to see)
hjmm | . Information box (5): Here, you can see the name of the function, what it does, and an example.
s0s6 | . Button (6): This can be used to hide the function list.
cxx7 | . The Apply and OK buttons (7): These buttons apply changes that you have made to the visualization and then close the window respectively.
uzqc | · Messages (8): This tells you when your calculation is valid, when there are errors, and what the error is.
dqwn | . The calculation itself (9): Tableau Public 9.x is intelligent. When you start typing in a field name, it will suggest all the fields that include the string that you are typing. You can hit the Tab key or click on its suggestion to populate the field. Alternatively, you can drag fields from the Dimensions and Measures pane, of both your current data source and others data sources that you have loaded into your workbook, to create new fields.

tl2g | The parts of the formula include fields, mathematical operators, functions, and often parameters as shown in the following screenshot:
xy74 | Editing calculated fields
q0se | Once you have created a calculated field that is valid, you can edit it by right-clicking on it in the window in which it appears and then selecting Edit. You can also rename calculated fields (as well as fields native to your data source) by right-clicking on them and selecting Rename.
tz7u | Types of calculations
jszk | There are several types of calculations that you can create, as listed previously. Some of them are common to other data management tools, but some, such as user calculations, are unique to Tableau Public.
egkh | When creating calculated fields, the functions that you can apply on a field depends on the type of that field. For instance, you can't perform multiplication functions on a string field (even if it contains only numbers) without first converting it to a numeric field. Similarly, you can't concatenate numeric values without first converting them to strings.
kbpy | Basic mathematical functions, such as addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and exponents (^), are created by typing the standard operators into the dialog box.
afdp | You can add functions by typing their names or filtering the list of functions to the appropriate group, or name, and then double-clicking on the best choice. The different types of functions that you can perform in Tableau Public are as follows:
5jom | · Number: This includes geometric, trigonometric, and rounding functions, among others
fdhb | · Strings: This includes options to find characters, measure string length, split and parse fields, and match character strings

22hf | Chapter 5
gici | . Date: This includes functions for duration, the addition and subtraction of dates, the truncation of dates, and the identification of date parts
owaw | . Type conversion: This allows you to convert fields into different types without modifying the metadata of the source field
z6xu | . Logical: This includes the powerful IF, CASE, and ISNULL and allows you to tell Tableau Public how to group fields or relate them to parameters
knw2 | . Aggregate calculations: These are the most commonly used functions; they include sum, count, avg, min, max, and median
mxnw | . User functions: These are more commonly used for Tableau Server rather than Tableau Public; they allow you to create calculated fields that operate on usernames or groups
bdx4 | . Table calculation: This will be detailed in the next chapter; it allows you to compute aggregations based on data points that are visible in the current window
l01c | The number functions
yphh | Number functions include several functions that you may be familiar with owing to working with applications such as ROUND and ABS. Many of us may not have used several of these functions, such as the trigonometric and exponential functions, since our high school math class. There are some number functions that we will use extensively, such as MIN and MAX, while there are others that have limited uses, such as the geometric and trigonometric functions.
3yor | Number functions include the following, in order of decreasing precedence:
f9sc | . ABS: This takes the absolute value of a number. It is commonly found in the denominator of table calculations.
o5l0 | . CEILING: This rounds up a decimal to its nearest integer and is the opposite of INT.
c1wq | · FLOOR: This rounds a decimal down to its nearest integer.
gr2b | . MAX and MIN: These take the maximum and minimum values in a sequence respectively. They are also considered to be string functions.
jkky | . ROUND: This allows you to specify how many decimals to round up a float number to.
7vxr | · ZN: This is predominantly found in table calculations. It tells Tableau Public that if a numeric field has a NULL value, you want to replace it with zero.
qzyn | . DIV: This produces the whole number product of a division statement.
rcl1 | . PI: This produces the numeric value of pi.
9qpf | [87 ]
y5cx | www.it-ebooks.info
hexk | . SIGN: This produces a numeric value (1, 0, or 01) based on the input, which may be positive, zero, or negative respectively.
c05v | . Trigonometric and geometric functions: These are largely beyond the scope of this book. These functions include ACOS, ASIN, ATAN, ATAN2, COS, COT, DEGREES, RADIANS, SIN, and TAN as well as HEXBINX and HEXBINY.
1ytq | . Exponential and logarithmic functions: These functions include EXP, LN, LOG, POWER, SQRT, and SQUARE.
tkax | The date functions
6mpz | The date functions are useful for a variety of tasks, such as identifying the elapsed time between two events or a part of a date.
bi1x | Many date functions in Tableau Public operate on dateparts. Dateparts are the small units of measurement of dates, such as a year, quarter, month, week, day, and the units of time, such as an hour, a minute, and a second. Writing date functions in Tableau Public is similar to writing date functions in ANSI SQL or Microsoft Excel with a big difference- dateparts need to be spelled out and enclosed in single quotation marks, which is a relatively simple design and use of punctuation for a programming language.
bnve | The most commonly performed analysis is the measurement of change over time, and the prevalence of date functions is high. Therefore, it is worth the time and effort to master them early on in your work with Tableau Public.
7gvc | The date functions include the following functions:
jf19 | . DATEADD: This adds numeric values, which can be hard-coded or variable, in a specific number of dateparts to a date.
6hx6 | . DATEDIFF: This calculates the elapsed number of specified dateparts between two dates.
xcql | . DATENAME: This produces the name of the specified datepart of a date. An example that demonstrates the implementation of this function is, DATENAME ( 'month', #7/21/2015#) = "July".
xcxb | . DATEPARSE: This turns a string into a date in the format that you specify.
ci51 | [88 ]
jaj7 | www.it-ebooks.info
uc0w | Chapter 5
494y | . DATEPART: This is similar to DATENAME. It returns the datepart of a specified date but returns a numeric value. An example that demonstrates the implementation of this function is, DATEPART ( 'month', #7/21/2015#) = 7.
5whs | . DATETRUNC: This rounds up a date to the first date of the datepart that you specify. An example that demonstrates how to implement this function is, DATETRUNC ('month, #7/21/2015#) = '7/1/2015'.
kigc | . DAY: This returns the day of the month of a given date. An example that demonstrates how to implement this function is, DAY (#7/21/2015#) = 21.
k5st | . ISDATE: This tests whether a string that you enter is actually a date and produces a Boolean value (true or false).
d8e8 | . MONTH: This produces the numerical month of a date.
gb7b | . TODAY and NOW: These produce the date and datetime of the current moment by using the time settings on your computer.
jxu0 | . YEAR: This produces the year of the current date.
l1bb | In the following example, we will use the floods data to determine the number of years that have elapsed since the last major flood. Most of the countries have had many floods and not just one. Therefore, we used the maximum value of Date Began, which is the most recent date in the data set, and compared it with today's date.
i3e0 | We could have omitted the max from the Date Began, but for each country, Tableau Public would have then aggregated the elapsed time per country, and we really wanted to know how long it has been since the most recent flood, as shown in the following screenshot:
78dj | [89 ]
c1pj | www.it-ebooks.info
6v9y | Type conversions
deen | We will begin with type conversions because you cannot create properly functioning calculated fields without having the fields in the right format. For instance, aggregations work on numeric fields, string functions work on strings, and date functions work on dates. Tableau Public automatically identifies the type of field based on its contents, but this may not meet your needs to aggregate or create calculations. Publicly available data sources, such as the ones available at http://public.tableau.com/s/resources, often have issues with either the format or the quality of the data. This will make it necessary for you to convert fields into different types, and it is quite likely that you will need to strip bad data and identify replacement values as well.
27bo | If you are familiar with relational database management, you are probably aware that there are many different field types, some of which are used to govern the field length within a database. Tableau Public focuses on the three primary field types, namely; string, which can be anything; numeric fields, which include integers and float fields; and datetime fields; which include the DATETIME, DATE, and TIME field formats.
72k6 | You can convert a field to another type by creating a calculated field and wrapping it in the appropriate function. In case fields are of the same parent form or are interchangeable, you can right-click on the field name, select Change Data Type, and then choose the appropriate type. If you do need to change the format manually, you can use the following functions:
