Connections\nwkbn | In EBF systems, brace-to-beam and link-to-column connections attracted particular research attention due to the high level of demands on these joints. Gusset plate buckling at the brace-to-beam connection was observed in the full-scale tests of Roeder et al. and Foutch. Engelhardt and Popov proposed and tested modified gusseted and directly welded brace-to-beam connections. Satisfactory results were reported for all of the proposed connection details; however, the directly welded connections were found to be more advantageous in controlling LTB of the beam segment outside the link. Considering that the braces are expected to remain essentially elastic during severe loadings, most of the ductility requirements which are required for braces of special CBFs are not mandatory for EBF braces and their connections, based on the AISC Seismic Provisions.\nftfg | Tests by Hjelmstad and Popov, and Malley and Popov in the nineteen eighties suggested that fully welded link-to-column connections can exhibit satisfactory behavior during severe loading scenarios. In these tests short links with different combinations of complete joint penetration groove welds and fillet welds for the flanges and the web were considered. In contrast, details with welded flanges and bolted web connections tested by Malley and Popov showed significant bolt slippage which led to premature flange fractures.\n7xi5 | Engelhardt and Popov investigated the behavior of link-to-column connections for the case of long links. Details employing CJP groove welds at the flanges and either a fully welded shear tab or a CJP groove weld at the link web were considered owing to their acceptable performances in previous tests on short links. Premature link flange fracture was observed for these specimens at early stages of loading, and thus, modified details were proposed and tested by these researchers. Furthermore, a link-to-column connection with all-around fillet welds was also studied. Although some of the modified details sustained high rotations prior to failure (especially the cover plate and the all-around fillet weld details) due to the doubtful performance of the tested specimens as well as the observed brittle failure modes, it was concluded that the use of long links attached to a column should be avoided. Engelhardt and Popov also tested two short links which were connected to the web of an I-shaped column through continuity plates. A similar detail was previously studied by\nw8r5 | Malley and Popov and acceptable results were reported with minor flaws compared to the link- to-column-flange connections. However, the tests of Engelhardt and Popov revealed that the link-to-column-web connection is prone to premature link flange fracture and should be avoided. Based on these studies, the nineteen ninety-two AISC Seismic Provisions limited the use of link-to-column connections to short links, recommending details such as Figure seven a and b.\nybik | In the experiments of Tsai et al. CJP groove welds at the flanges and fillet weld at the web were used to connect short links to box columns. Premature fractures at very low link rotations (sometimes less than zero point zero zero five radians) were observed in the link flange welds. Although a number of modified details performed remarkably better, the observed fractures gave cause for concern.\ngii5 | Ghobarah and Ramadan proposed an extended end-plate link-to-column connection in nineteen ninety-four. In this approach the link is shop-welded to the end-plate using all-around fillet welds and the end-plate is then field-bolted to the column flange. Although some of the specimens exhibited bolt or flange weld fractures, it was concluded that properly designed extended end-plate link-to-column connections would remain elastic during severe loadings and demonstrate a similar performance to that of a fully welded connection. In a recent study by Dusicka and Lewis on end- plate link-to-column connections, different stiffening details were investigated to reduce the demand on link flanges in the vicinity of the link-to-end-plate welds, which was found to be a potential region for brittle failure. These details included using an additional pair of stiffeners in the first web panel which were either parallel to the web and connected to the web or within a small distance from it, or angled from the link end towards the web, or curved stiffeners made from round HSS. Promising results were reported based on FE analyses for the first detail with stiffeners parallel to the web which shifted the failure mode from the link flange fracture to fracturing of the web. The results were further confirmed through a number of experiments on long links. In twenty sixteen, Pirmoz et al. numerically studied the behavior of extended end-plate link-to-column connections, with rib stiffeners, in contrast to the suggestion of Ghobarah and Ramadan. Although the study did not address issues such as low-cycle fatigue or material fracture, the promising performance of this link- to-column connection was demonstrated.\nq5eu | An experimental study was undertaken by Tsai et al. on the behavior of link-to-box column connections in two thousand. In these tests, short links were connected to box columns using CJP groove welds at the flanges and either a fully welded shear tab or a CJP groove weld at the link web. Although some of the specimens used the improved weld access hole detail suggested by Mao et al., premature fracture was observed in all connections at the link flange in the vicinity of the groove weld. The urgent need for research on this issue was emphasized. Consequently, an extensive study was initiated at the University of Texas at Austin in the early two thousands. These tests along with those performed previously at the National Taiwan University by Tsai et al. were the first experiments on large-scale link-to-column connections with realistic details. Okazaki et al. tested twelve welded link- to-column specimens considering short, intermediate, and long links with four different connection details using the old loading protocol of AISC three forty-one zero-two. Pre-Northridge as well as other moment connections which adhered to the recommendations of FEMA three fifty were considered. Recently developed welded moment connections with free flange and no access hole details were also tested. Except one specimen, all of the tested connections failed due to abrupt fracture of the flange near the groove weld prior to developing the required level of plastic rotation. The performance was inferior for the pre-Northridge and FEMA three fifty details which only developed about half of the required Y P. Results proved that the connections which are suitable for MRFs may not necessarily perform well as link-to-column connections. It was concluded that link-to- column connections are prone to brittle failure regardless of the link length ratio and should therefore be avoided until a satisfactory detail is developed.",
