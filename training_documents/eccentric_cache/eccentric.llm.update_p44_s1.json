Use of E B F's or links in Reinforced Concrete Structures\n8sye | Providing a thorough review of this topic is out of the scope of this study; however, the main applications of E B F configurations in reinforced concrete structures are mentioned here for the sake of completeness. Steel eccentric braces with or without vertical links can be connected to existing R C frames for seismic rehabilitation. This concept was numerically and experimentally studied by Bouadi and Engelhardt, Ghobarah and Abou Elfath, Bouwkamp et al., Perera et al., D'Aniello, Mazzolani et al., Pina et al., Durucan and Dicleli, Özel and Güneyisi, Varum et al., and Wang and Yu in the past few decades. Steel links are also utilized as energy dissipating coupling beams between adjacent R C wall piers in hybrid coupled wall systems. A comprehensive review of the research on the behavior, analysis, and design of these systems as well as particular topics such as link-to-wall connections can be found in El-Tawil et al.\nr04h | Six point five. Progressive Collapse of E B F's\norpr | In two thousand nine, the gravity-induced progressive collapse of E B F's was studied by Khandelwal et al. utilizing validated numerical analyses. To this end, the alternate path method was used, that is critical columns and adjacent braces were instantaneously removed from a ten-story E B F, properly designed based on the U.S. specifications for high seismic risk. The limited numerical results demonstrated that E B F's are less vulnerable to progressive collapse compared to special C B F's, mainly because of their improved system layout. The beneficial effect of locating E B F's at the perimeter of the structure was also noted.\nk36m | Six point six. Fragility Functions for Links\nwnuz | The damage states and fragility functions for E B F links were developed recently by Gulec et al. Based on a precise evaluation of the test data of eighty-two links, a\nsy14 | total of nine damage states, such as web yielding, flange local buckling, flange fracture, damage to concrete slab, etc., were indicated. Furthermore, the methods of repair were categorized into four groups, that is cosmetic repair, concrete replacement, heat straightening, and link replacement, and each damage state was related to a certain method of repair. Fragility functions were also developed for short and long links based on statistical analyses to specify the probability that a specific method of repair will be required as a function of Y P.\nghss | Six point seven. Other Applications\n3s61 | In a number of studies by Bruneau and his colleagues, the concept of E B F's with horizontal or vertical links has been used in steel bridge superstructures in order to introduce energy dissipation in end-diaphragms instead of the common approach which relies on the energy dissipation of the substructure. This can be fruitful for instance in cases where stable and ductile behavior of the substructure is doubtful. Results of the extensive numerical and experimental studies as well as design procedures are presented by these researchers.\ns3rm | The applicability of stainless steel in E B F's was studied by DiSarno et al. in two thousand eight. The results of nonlinear pushover and time-history analyses of a sample structure revealed that using members made from stainless steel can enhance the energy dissipation and structural overstrength of the system compared to regular E B F's while reducing the roof drift and the probability of local buckling in members.\npqxb | In addition to E B F's, hybrid coupled walls, and bridges, the concept of dissipative link segments has also been utilized in other structural systems. For instance, Moghaddasi B. and Zhang studied the seismic behavior of diagrid structural frames with replaceable shear links, in two thousand thirteen. In another recent study, the concept of linked column frames was proposed and numerically studied by Malakoutian et al. The use of buckling-restrained braces in eccentric configuration was studied by Prinz and Richards. The energy dissipation mechanism in this system is however substantially different from that of E B F's since yielding is concentrated in the braces rather than in the links.\n08qc | Seven. Summary and Future Research Needs\nhdj2 | A comprehensive review of the research conducted on the behavior and design of eccentrically braced frames has been presented in this study which has covered both component level and system level responses. Experimental and numerical studies that address the main characteristics of links as well as link detailing have been presented. Different numerical techniques for link modeling have also been discussed. Furthermore, studies which focused on the seismic behavior and design of E B F systems have been summarized with an emphasis on the capacity design approach. Finally, the special applications of E B F systems or link segments have been discussed. For the improvement of E B F design and applications, the following items have been identified in the course of this review study as important research needs:\na57g | · Further research on the behavior of very short links (P is less than one) is required in order to take advantage of their excessive inelastic rotation capacity in E B F systems. In contrast, considering the doubtful performance of very long links (P is greater than three to three point five) reported in some numerical studies, additional research for identifying their deficiencies and limitations would appear to be beneficial.\ng8m3 | · The use of a single link overstrength factor for all link length ratios in the E B F design process can lead to significant underestimations of internal forces developed in other members due to the yielded and strain hardened links, especially when very short links are utilized. Thus, further research is needed to develop simple methods for estimating the actual link overstrength factor for different link length ratios considering the effects of moment-shear interaction, link flange shear resistance, axial restraint provided by the adjacent members, and excessive cyclic hardening. A similar concern is also valid for the case of built-up tubular links. Furthermore, the unusually high overstrengths, of the order of five point zero, which have been reported recently for some unstiffened very short links also need further attention.\na9av | There is a substantial research need for investigating the effect of high axial load on the behavior of intermediate and long links. In addition, the effect of tensile axial force on increasing the link overstrength requires further attention, as mentioned in a number of recent studies.\n73l3 | · The increase in the link overstrength due to the presence of a concrete slab has not been adequately investigated. This effect can be hazardous particularly from the capacity design point of view. Methods for estimating this increase are required which can be conveniently applied in practice.\nornm | · Additional investigation is required to validate whether the recent relaxation in the flange slenderness requirements of shear links by the American Institute of Steel Construction Seismic Provisions can also be considered for shear links subject to high axial loads.\nu2z1 | · Several issues have recently been reported for the spacing requirements of links per American Institute of Steel Construction three hundred forty-one dash ten which need further consideration. Research is required to investigate the possibility of any relaxation in the stiffener spacing requirements of I-shaped shear links. On the contrary, the observed poor performance of some intermediate links, which is attributed mostly to their stiffener spacing requirements, should be studied carefully to come up with appropriate solutions.\natmh | · Many novel web stiffening details for reducing the probability of premature fracture and improving the link rotation capacity including, but not restricted to, the sandwich, horizontal stiffener, and diagonal stiffeners details have been proposed which require further research. In addition, the feasibility of other approaches, such as links without intermediate stiffeners, should be studied. Furthermore, if approved, the development of design guidelines for employing these details is essential.",
