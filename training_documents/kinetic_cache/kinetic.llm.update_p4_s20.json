The BV model assumes a linear free energy relationship, where the ET free energy barrier is proportional to the ET driving force, and can be generalized to concerted PCET reactions by replacing the redox potential with the proton-coupled redox potential in the expressions. Moreover, we have shown that the MG theory can be extended to describe concerted PCET reactions within the framework of our vibronically nonadiabatic PCET theory by including the transitions between all reactant and product vibronic states. Figure two b shows the potential-dependent kad and kopp as functions of pH at a given electrode potential. The oxidation apparent rate constant has a slope of ninety percent equals one, whereas the reduction apparent rate constant has a slope of zero point six three, which is less than unity, indicating that the reduction reaction has a weaker pH dependence. In general, both reduction and oxidation reactions can exhibit weak pH dependence in this model. A detailed analysis of this figure is provided in the supporting information.\nl2v9 | There are also multiple ways to define a potential-independent rate constant. The standard rate constant ks is defined as the rate constant when E equals E naught. At this potential, the reaction free energy AG equals F times the quantity of E minus E naught equals zero so kRed equals kox equals ks. Alternatively, if the reaction rate constant saturates at very negative or positive potentials, maximum rate constants k max for reduction and oxidation can be defined at E approaches positive or negative infinity. Similarly, we can define the potential-independent apparent standard rate constant and apparent maximum rate constants as\nafbe | Ks,app equals kapp parentheses Eapp parentheses equals k times Ox Px parentheses Eapp parentheses\n78r8 | equals k Red parentheses Kapp parentheses E approaches negative infinity parentheses\n320g | \ntp8g | Here, Eapp is the apparent standard potential defined in equation four. In practice, kmax,app can also be defined at the experimental potential limits. The apparent standard or maximum rate constants can then be obtained by substituting the expressions for kRed parentheses E parentheses and ko parentheses E parentheses into equations nine a and nine b and setting E equals Eapp or positive or negative infinity. The general expressions for ks,app and Kmax,app provided in the supporting information. For the BV and MG kinetic models, the results are presented in Table one. Representative illustrations of these cases are shown in Figure two c,d, and detailed analyses are provided in the supporting information.\ngxfd | To conclude this section, we summarize the expressions for the apparent rate constants for both homogeneous and electrochemical PCET reactions in Table one. Note that these equations are not limited to the four-channel case shown in Figure one. Certain channels can be shut down by excluding the corresponding form of Ox and Red or setting certain k equals zero. For example, if we exclude all concerted pathways in Figure one and apply the equation for BV kinetics ksapp and s,app, this model is reduced to Laviron's model, and we obtain the same expression for the apparent standard rate constant. More generally, other channels could be added, such as concerted pathways with buffer as the proton donor or acceptor, and the assumption of equilibrium for PT and complex formation could be removed, leading to more complex kinetic equations.\ns2v1 | P subscript max, app superscript MG, Ox equals the sum over i of P subscript max, i X subscript Red raised to the power of a alpha subscript i and P subscript s, i are the cathodic transfer coefficient and the standard rate constant for the ith channel, respectively. P subscript k subscript max i is the maximum rate constant for the ith channel.\njkp9 | RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nz8tt | We applied our model to an electrochemical PCET reaction, namely, PCET to a Ruthenium-based water oxidation catalyst attached to an indium tin oxide surface. As discussed above, the apparent rate constant of an electrochemical PCET reaction is not only pH-dependent but also potential-dependent. Kessinger et al. studied the interfacial ET and PCET reactions in a Ruthenium-based water oxidation catalyst, Ruthenium two complexed to two tpy and bpy groups, attached to indium tin oxide. Photoexcitation of Ruthenium two complexed to OH two results in rapid electron transfer to the indium tin oxide electrode, producing Ruthenium three complexed to OH two or OH with a protonation state that is dependent on the solution pH. The resulting back electron transfer reaction from indium tin oxide to Ruthenium three complexed to OH two or deprotonated OH that regenerates Ruthenium two complexed to OH two therefore occurs via an ET and or a PCET pathway. This reduction reaction was monitored using transient absorption spectroscopy by measuring the recovery of the metal-to-ligand charge-transfer absorption peak of",
