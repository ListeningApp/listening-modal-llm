You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

06yq | Microdosing with psychedelics to self-medicate for ADHD symptoms in adults: A naturalistic study

2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

82qc | Introduction
ls7d | Building on what we learned in Chapter 1, therapeutic use of self calls for a dynamic (i.e., ever-changing), personal, and subjective investment in the client during which the therapist makes moment-to-moment decisions about how to initiate and respond to the client's interpersonal char- acteristics and reactions to the inevitable events of therapy using six distinct communication approaches. This process of using one's therapeutic self is best summarized as in- terpersonal reasoning; it is a highly personal, individual- ized, subjective decision-making process that is grounded in the disciplined application of a set of concepts aimed
tzt3 | The Intentional Relationship Model (IRM) guides occu- pational therapy practice by defining therapeutic use of self and thereby outlining an interpersonal reasoning pro- cess that therapists may apply when interacting with their clients. Each component of this model describes practical skills that may be applied during actual practice situations. The concepts and skills that comprise the IRM have been empirically validated and tested and are explained in greater detail in subsequent chapters.

xrd1 | at meeting the client's interpersonal needs. Some may believe that the process is driven by one's emotional reac- tions to clients and an innate or nurtured intuitive capacity (i.e., reliance on one's "heart"). A smaller set of others per- ceive the process as largely rational and grounded in the disciplined application of a set of interpersonal guidelines.
5746 | Irrespective of such viewpoints, the IRM argues that therapeutic use of self is, in large part, a product of the extent to which one approaches practice intentionally, being ever-vigilant toward keeping one's personal reac- tions to a client in perspective and, instead, focusing one's attention on the client's reactions to us and to the therapy process. Therapeutic use of self involves prioritizing one's attempts to cultivate an empathic understanding of one's client and applying a knowledge base and interpersonal skill set thoughtfully to common interpersonal events,
7toz | CASE EXAMPLE 3.1 Rigel Returns to Meet Mr. Johnson
j346 | As we learned in Chapter 1, Mr. Johnson became depressed and withdrawn following a stroke. One of Mr. Johnson's most prominent interpersonal charac- teristics is his communication style, which tends to be guarded and reluctant. His first interaction with Rigel resulted in an interpersonal event cascade (i.e., more than one inevitable interpersonal event occur- ring in succession during a single session). This was because of a series of missed opportunities in not responding to Mr. Johnson's interpersonal charac- teristics and to the interpersonal events using the ap- propriate modes. As you may recall, Rigel decides to end the therapy session early and return another day.
v8uq | After a long evening of contemplation, Rigel returns to work with Mr. Johnson the following morning. This time, he applies interpersonal reason- ing by reflecting upon Mr. Johnson's most striking interpersonal characteristic, his communication style. Knowing that Mr. Johnson uses few words and largely communicates nonverbally, Rigel decides he will not engage with him in a way that would require him to speak a great deal. Also knowing that the interpersonal event of resistance had happened the day before, Rigel decided that he would need to be exceptionally careful about always communicating
x972 | such as when a client is not engaging in therapy appro- priately. Accordingly, therapeutic use of self is an occupa- tional therapy skill that must be developed, reinforced, monitored, and refined. One's personal and emotional re- actions to clients must be overseen by and balanced with a rational and self-disciplined application of almost selfless empathy toward the client.
cwrw | This chapter presents the IRM, a conceptual practice model that operationalizes the processes involved in ther- apeutic use of self. The rationale, conceptual background, and underlying principles of this model are presented. The model explains how components of the client-therapist relationship interact and are enacted in the face of every- day challenges to that relationship. Finally, this chapter presents a set of core principles that guide the implemen- tation of this model.
4i0e | beginning the session with small talk, he decided to begin the session by using the empathizing mode.
h2l3 | Instead of asserting any type of agenda for therapy that day, Rigel enters the room and simply greets Mr. Johnson by saying:
dfzb | Rigel: "Remember me?"
u6ty | Mr. Johnson simply looks up to acknowledge Rigel. Rigel sits down at a bit of a distance, not facing Mr. Johnson. Rigel draws upon the empathizing mode by orienting his body at an angle toward Mr. Johnson in a nonthreatening way that would not imply any expectations or demands. After a few moments pass, Rigel uses the empathizing mode by making the fol- lowing summary statement, which opened a door for continued communication with Mr. Johnson.
awvu | Rigel (using the empathizing mode): "I was really fumbling around trying to offer something thera- peutic for you yesterday. I knew that I was heading in the wrong direction, so I thought I would come back again, today, just to acknowledge this."
on9b | Mr. Johnson makes an intimate self-disclosure: "It was not your fault."

h27a | ways I might be able to serve you. Today, we can begin wherever we want."
pdjh | Mr. Johnson says nothing and gives Rigel a curious glance.
xmgs | Rigel then enacts the collaborating mode: "If you don't mind, I'd like to just spend our time together observing you as you go about your day. You can do or not do anything you want."
bd9h | Mr. Johnson responds: "Nothing we do will make a difference."
m047 | Rigel then shifts to the empathizing mode: "I want to understand why you believe this."
gy8c | (Silence and a nonverbal cue from Mr. Johnson, who looks down and away from Rigel.)
y4mj | Rigel continues in the empathizing mode: "I just want to get to know you and learn about anything that you might be thinking or anything that is im- portant to you."
vpgq | The session continues as Rigel observes Mr. Johnson pull out his smartphone and thumb through what appear to be photos of family and friends. After several moments pass, Rigel continues with the empathizing mode and observes:
ousl | "I see that you are looking at photos."
m4ju | Mr. Johnson makes a second intimate self-disclosure:
a0mb | "I will be useless to these people now."
ki8m | Rigel responds by asking a deepening question in a spirit of gentle inquiry (consistent with the empathizing mode): "How were you of use to them before the stroke?"
km8w | Mr. Johnson: "I was kind of a handyman. A jack of all trades. People relied on me a lot on the reser- vation, and I did things even when I wasn't paid."
wzno | Rigel (empathizing mode): "Thank you for shar- ing that with me. It sounds like you are concerned that you may not be able to do the handyman jobs that you used to do, and, therefore, that you will not be useful to those that you care about."
xagm | Mr. Johnson: "That's pretty much it. No amount of therapy can give that back to me."
iwn5 | Rigel (empathizing mode): "Having lost so much of your ability to control your muscles and your bal- ance, it makes sense that you would think that your abilities will never improve." (shifting to the advocat- ing mode) "I have worked with a lot of people, and
uooz | Chapter 3 A Model of the Intentional Relationship 53
pxbq | Mr. Johnson remains silent but gazes at Rigel.
jfsr | Rigel (shifting to instructing mode): "Mr. Johnson, I cannot tell you how much body function you are going to recover. That is a highly individual outcome that varies from person to person. What I can tell you is that working with me toward some concrete goals, beginning now, during these early days after your stroke, will allow you to gain more function than if you do not participate in therapy."
u15r | Mr. Johnson nods affirmatively and responds with an invitation: "You can call me Bart."
lq35 | Rigel (continuing with the instructing mode): "Now that I know a little bit about what you were doing before your stroke, I would recommend that we work on activities and exercises that will serve as the building blocks toward eventually being able to en- gage in some handyman work again in the future. The future may seem like a long way away, but we need to get started soon in order to maximize the effects of our work. When we work together, I will be sure to explain how each thing that we are doing would build toward being able to complete handyman work one day."
3g9w | Mr. Johnson continues to listen but does not respond. His face reveals a blunted affect (an inter- personal characteristic). Therefore, Rigel has diffi- culty reading his expression.
d09o | Rigel: "Are you willing to try with me?"
ylhz | Mr. Johnson: "The doctor told me that recovery is mainly a function of time . . . that it is a waiting game."
a3td | Rigel (asks a rhetorical question consistent with the instructing mode): "Did the doctor not explain how therapy can speed the process of recovery?"
ex5k | Mr. Johnson: "No."
9d4o | Rigel (instructing mode): "The healing process of the human brain occurs both inside and out- side of the body. The brain is not a static organ. It changes and can heal itself, to some degree, depending on whether and how much we exercise it. What a person does while he is healing and how he interacts with the people and objects within his environment can make a big difference-not only in the speed with which he recovers function but also in the extent to which he recovers function."
cjq2 | Mr. Johnson: "OK. I'm tired now."
5esx | Rigel (instructing mode): "Yes, and we are out of time. I look forward to continuing our work tomorrow."

76b0 | Explaining the Therapeutic Relationship: Need for a Conceptual Practice Model
zxz6 | As noted in Chapter 1, there has been discussion of the therapeutic use of self throughout occupational therapy's history. Although numerous recommendations have been made regarding the requisite training, characteristics, feelings, and behaviors necessary for effective interper- sonal practice in occupational therapy, until the IRM, these recommendations had not been integrated into a coherent explanation. Moreover, there are few details about how the therapeutic relationship should be ap- proached and managed in light of the field's central focus on the client's engagement in occupation. Educators, su- pervisors, students, and staff may benefit from a vocabu- lary with which to discuss and describe the interpersonal phenomena that have an ongoing impact on everyday practice.
xnth | The central question that a conceptualization of the therapeutic relationship in occupational therapy must an- swer is: How can one's therapeutic use of self be utilized specifically to promote occupational engagement and promote positive therapy outcomes?
vafm | The IRM is intended as a conceptual practice model (Kielhofner, 2008). It was developed to explain the ther- apeutic use of self in occupational therapy and how that relationship can facilitate or hinder a client's occupational engagement. The model is designed to guide interper- sonal reasoning for addressing dilemmas and challenges to the therapeutic relationship that arise in everyday prac- tice. Finally, the model illustrates how best to develop

d6r4 | Conceptual Background for the Model: How Therapeutic Use of Self in Occupational Therapy Differs From Psychotherapy
9mrz | Many of the concepts for the IRM have their origins in theory underlying psychotherapy. However, as introduced in Chapter 1, the IRM recognizes a fundamental differ- ence between occupational therapy and psychotherapy. Figure 3.1 portrays the traditional psychotherapy pro- cess. As it shows, interpersonal relating between client and therapist is the central focus. Moreover, interpersonal communication is typically the only activity that occurs during psychotherapy.
pk06 | In occupational therapy, particularly when conducted outside of mental health settings, the client-therapist relationship should not pretend to emulate the intensity, duration, and complexity of a psychotherapy relationship. The central focus of psychotherapy is symptom reduction and psychological change. The central focus of occupa- tional therapy is occupational engagement. The unique role that the therapeutic relationship plays in occupa- tional therapy is diagrammed in Figure 3.2.

caos | As shown, the occupational therapist employs several therapeutic strategies, usually rooted in existing models of practice, to facilitate the client's engagement in occupation. Depending on the occupational needs, capacities, and di- agnosis of the client, any number of occupational therapy practice models might be employed alone or in combina- tion to promote occupational engagement. However, this main task of promoting occupational engagement through employing the specific methods and strategies of occupa- tional therapy does not exist in isolation of a larger process of relating that occurs between client and therapist.
qrvy | The IRM explains the relationship between client and therapist that is part of the overall process of occu- pational therapy. Accordingly, the model is intended to complement existing occupational therapy conceptual practice models rather than to replace any single model. It explains the detailed and overarching aspects of the client-therapist relationship, an aspect of occupational therapy not addressed by other practice models in as much detail or as the sole focus. Figure 3.3 shows how the intentional relationship is designed to supplement the use of other occupational therapy conceptual practice models. As shown, the IRM should complement the usual concepts and strategies of occupational therapy that are directly aimed at facilitating occupational engagement.
pn9j | The model's utility for occupational therapy lies in addressing the otherwise unarticulated aspects of the
