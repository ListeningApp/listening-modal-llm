You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

hx9e | Aaron Lazare (1979, 1989), an early colleague at Massachusetts General Hospital, talked about two kinds of loss that are directly related to this concept of disenfranchised grief. Socially negated losses are those losses that society treats as nonlosses. An example of this would be pregnancy loss, either spontaneous or induced. The second kind of loss related to disenfranchised grief would be socially unspeakable losses. These are specific losses about which the mourner has a difficult time talking. Common examples would be death by suicide and death by AIDS. Both of these losses carry some stigma in the broader society. One intervention that can be helpful to those experiencing these types of losses is assisting them in talking about them and exploring their thoughts and feelings about the death. Re-enfranchising suggestions for these types of losses can be found in Chapter 7 of this volume.

a63r | CONTINUING BONDS
dqvj | Attachments to the deceased that are maintained rather than relin- quished have been called continuing bonds. This is not an entirely new concept. Shuchter and Zisook (1988) noted that widows in their sem- inal conjugal bereavement studies in San Diego maintained a sense of their loved ones' presence for several years after the death. In the Harvard Child Bereavement Study, Silverman, Nickman, and Worden (1992) observed ongoing connections with the deceased parent among a large number of these bereaved school-age children. For most it was a positive experience; for some it was not. The book by Klass, Silverman, and Nickman titled Continuing Bonds: New Understandings of Grief (1996) pulled together information from our study and several others to pro- mote the notion that some people stay connected with the deceased rather than emotionally withdrawing, as was the notion previously pro- moted by Freud (1917/1957).
r17u | This new concept was not embraced by all and questions soon arose as to whether continuing bonds can be adaptive for some and maladaptive for others. Are continuing bonds actually associated with a healthy ongoing life? A lot of this controversy is based on the lack of good research evidence for the efficacy of continuing bonds. As more research is done, some of these questions will be resolved. Essentially, the questions center around four main issues: (a) What types of bonds are the most helpful in the adaptation to loss? These would include objects from the deceased (linking and transitional objects, keepsakes), a sense of the deceased's presence, talking to the deceased, introjecting the deceased's beliefs and values, taking on characteristics of the deceased, and the like (Field & Filanosky, 2010). (b) For whom are continuing bonds helpful, and for whom are they not? This necessitates the identification of subgroups of mourners; the concept should not be applied to everyone. One promising approach to this is to look at the mourner's attachment style in relationship to the deceased (Field, Gao, & Paderna, 2005). In the case of anxious attachments that can lead to chronic grief, holding onto the deceased may not be adaptive. Some mourners need to relinquish and move on (Stroebe & Schut, 2005). (c) In what time frame are continuing bonds the most adaptive and when are they less adaptive-closer to the loss, farther from the loss? (Field, Gao, & Paderna, 2005). (d) What is the impact of religious and cultural differences on maintaining healthy bonds? This would include beliefs and rituals that promote a connection and memorialization of the deceased cross-culturally in various societies (Suhail, Jamil, Ovebode, & Ajmal, 2011; Yu et al., 2016). More on bonds can be found in Chapter 2.

g345 | MEANING MAKING
svhz | Meaning reconstruction and meaning making, concepts introduced and promoted by psychologist Robert Neimeyer, have been an important emphasis in the field over the past 20 years. He sees meaning reconstruc- tion as the central process faced by bereaved individuals. This reconstruc- tion is primarily accomplished through the use of narratives or life stories. When unanticipated or incongruous events such as the death of a loved one occur, a person needs to redefine the self and relearn ways to engage with the world without the deceased. The person cannot return to a pre- loss level of functioning but learns how to develop a meaningful life with- out the deceased loved one (Neimeyer, 2001). This is central to my third task of mourning, in which the mourner must learn to adjust to a world without the deceased. Death can challenge one's assumptions about the world (spiritual adjustments) and one's personal identity (internal adjust- ments). Bereaved individuals have serious questions such as: "What will my life look like now?" "What did the deceased's life mean?" "How can I feel safe in a world such as this?" and "Who am I now that this death has occurred?" (Neimeyer, Prigerson, & Davies, 2002).
oaen | I think it is important to note, however, that some deaths do not challenge personal meaning making in any fundamental way. Davis, Wortman, Lehman, and Silver (2000) conducted research on two differ- ent bereaved populations and found that 20% to 30% of the bereaved individuals appeared to function well without engaging in the process of meaning making. Of those who searched for meaning, fewer than half of the individuals found it even over a year after the death. Those who did find meaning, however, were better adjusted than those who searched and didn't find it. But, interestingly, for some, the quest to understand continued even after meaning was found.
5u67 | Neimeyer (2000), commenting on the Davis research, makes note that the majority in the studies were struggling with meaning making and these should be helped with this process. But, he cautions the coun- selor about initiating this process if it does not occur spontaneously. He concludes his comments with an important distinction: meaning mak- ing is a process, not an outcome or achievement. The meanings associ- ated with death loss are constantly revised. We see this clearly in our work with bereaved children, who, as they age and pass through new developmental stages, ask: "What would my parent be like now?" and "What would our relationship be like now that I am graduating college, getting married, etc .? " (Worden, 1996a). More on meaning making as a task of mourning can be found in Chapter 2.

qrd3 | RESILIENCE
rxrg | When Phyllis Silverman and I studied 125 parentally bereaved chil- dren over a 2-year period after the death, we noted that children fell into one of three groups. The first was the group of children (approx- imately 20%) who were not doing well during the 2 years after the death. Since our research grant came from the National Institute of Mental Health for a study intended to identify bereaved children at-risk and prevent problem outcomes, this group became a major focus of our study. Could we identify at-risk children early after the loss so that early intervention might be offered to prevent later neg- ative sequelae from the death? However, we also noticed a second smaller group of children who seemed to be doing very well, and we identified them as resilient children. Their academic performance, social life, communication about the deceased, self-worth, sense of control, and healthy identification with the deceased parent were all on the high side. The third and largest group was the group making do during the first 2 years of bereavement (Silverman, 2000; Worden, 1996a).
