Multiple RNA Replication Complex Outputs: Genomic RNAs, Subgenomic Messenger RNAs, and Recombination\nj79f | The R C s of most positive RNA viruses host multiple processes such as replicating different RNAs of multicomponent genomes, genomic and subgenomic RNA synthesis, and RNA recombination. Growing understanding of R C structure and compartmentalization enables more effective consideration of how these processes are regulated and whether individual R C s might be specialized for particular pathways or RNA templates.\n6tbv | To express additional proteins from internal open reading frames, many positive RNA viruses produce subgenomic mRNAs corresponding to five prime truncated fragments of viral genomic positive RNA. For B M V (Figure two), and by inference other alphavirus-like viruses, in vitro and in vivo results show that subgenomic mRNAs are synthesized by positive RNA initiation at alternate internal promoters on a full-length genomic negative RNA template. While many regulatory questions remain, mutual interference between B M V genomic and subgenomic RNA synthesis suggests that both pathways may proceed on a common genomic negative RNA template in a single spherule R C.\nxb13 | For nodaviruses and coronaviruses (Figure two), subgenomic RNAs are generated by terminating negative RNA synthesis at interior sites on genomic positive RNA templates, yielding truncated or internally deleted negative RNAs that become independent replicons. For both viruses, subgenomic negative RNA production depends on defined RNA sequences, structures, and long-range RNA interactions. However, the precise conditions triggering premature termination of negative RNA synthesis and regulating relative levels of full-length genomic and partial-length subgenomic negative RNAs remain poorly understood.\ncxqi | It is also unknown whether individual coronavirus or nodavirus R C s contain only one or more types of genomic or subgenomic RNA templates. For coronavirus D M Vs, the presence\nqfmx | of multiple crowns per D M V and the apparently lower density of double-stranded RNA intermediates relative to spherules (Figure three c) suggest that individual D M Vs might host multiple genomic and/or subgenomic RNA templates, with either transient or more durable associations with specific crowns. For spherule R C s, volume measurements and the presence of a single crown suggest that most spherules contain a single double-stranded RNA replication intermediate. However, nodavirus genomic RNA2 replication both requires and subsequently suppresses synthesis of subgenomic R N A three from genomic RNA1. Thus, either some of these three replicatively interdependent RNAs are produced in a single spherule or the templates and products of their replication must interact between R C s.\nrut3 | Positive RNA virus RNA recombination, which is crucial for short-term adaptation and long-term evolution, appears to occur primarily by template switching during RNA replication and thus within R C s. Accordingly, B M V recombination requires both parental RNAs to possess signals for recruitment into R C s, and recruiting two templates into a single R C may be the limiting factor for recombination.\nm3cp | Four point four. Connection of Virion Assembly to RNA Replication\nmq4s | For many positive RNA viruses, genome RNA synthesis shows close physical and functional links to virion assembly. For coronaviruses, for example, virion assembly and budding sites are usually closely juxtaposed with D M V R C s producing new viral genomic RNAs (Figure three c). Coronavirus R C s and encapsidation are further linked by interaction of the cytosolic domains of R C crowns with clustered densities similar to virion ribonucleoproteins and by crown protein n s p three binding of viral nucleocapsid N, implying that n s p three-N interaction might initiate encapsidation of progeny RNAs as they are released from crowns.\n95el | Flavivirus virions also assemble and bud near their genome replication sites (Figure three b). For both flaviviruses and hepaciviruses, multiple R C-associated nonstructural proteins are linked to virion assembly. In particular, flavivirus N S two A and hepacivirus N S two are key organizers of virion assembly, promoting recruitment, localization, and function of multiple viral factors at virion assembly sites jointly associated with lipid droplets and E R. In addition to N S two A, flavivirus nonstructural proteins implicated in virion assembly include at least N S two B and N S three, while implicated H C V proteins include N S two plus N S one/P seven, N S three, N S four A, and N S five A, establishing multiple potentially guiding connections between the machineries of progeny RNA and virion production.\na0a5 | In nodavirus infection, large arrays of unenveloped virions accumulate directly adjacent to infection-modified mitochondria bearing R C s, and several results illustrate functional coupling between these processes. First, nodavirus genomic RNA1 and RNA2 are only efficiently encapsidated by capsid protein translated from RNA2 synthesized by nodaviral RNA-dependent RNA replication in mitochondrial R C s, but not by capsid protein supplied in trans from non-replicating mRNA transcribed from baculovirus DNA. Moreover, an arginine-rich motif near the capsid protein N terminus is selectively required to encapsidate genomic RNA1 but not RNA2, largely because this domain localizes capsid protein to the mitochondrial sites of RNA replication. Thus, for all of these viruses, virion assembly and RNA replication are linked by multiple pathways whose mechanistic principles are still incompletely understood but promise to be quite enlightening.\ngocl | Four point five. Opportunities for Improved Virus Control\nob1z | With genome replication at the heart of positive RNA virus life cycles, R C assembly, maturation, and function are prime targets for antiviral strategies. Because natural positive RNA virus infections\nm4cb | typically start at low multiplicity, the incoming single-stranded RNA genome (Figure P left l a right) is highly vulnerable to normal cellular RNA turnover prior to RNA replication. Thus, merely slowing R C assembly can have dramatic antiviral effects. In addition to attractive potentials for targeting viral replication factor synthesis, stability, trafficking, and assembly, R C assembly might be inhibited by targeting relevant host factors. While space does not allow general review here of the myriad host factor requirements for positive R N A virus replication, some examples are instructive. Host pathways involved in lipid synthesis, modification, and trafficking are prominent illustrations of potential targets because most or all positive R N A viruses depend on and recruit such functions to R C assembly sites. Similarly, R C generation by many positive R N A viruses requires host membrane remodeling factors such as E S C R T proteins, reticulons, and others. Because these and many other host pathways are used by numerous positive R N A viruses, targeting well-selected factors could provide valuable broad-spectrum antiviral effects.",
