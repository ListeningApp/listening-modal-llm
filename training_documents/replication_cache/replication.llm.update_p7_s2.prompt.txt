You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

o9sc | spherule structure against the high membrane curvature of the neck and electrostatic repulsion of the closely packed dsRNA. Crowns frequently are the origins of filaments that likely represent nascent progeny (+)RNAs being exported into the cytosol (26). Below we outline recent find- ings that similar crown-like complexes of RNA replication factors are formed by alphaviruses and coronaviruses, suggesting that such features are widely conserved in (+)RNA viruses.
121u | Mapping a genetically engineered hexahistidine (His6) tag showed that the FHV crown apical lobe corresponds to the protein A RdRp domain (21) (Figure 4a). This accessible position appears consistent with the RdRp domain's roles in RNA template recruitment (22) and potentially in negative-strand RNA [(-)RNA] synthesis, but less compatible with (+)RNA synthesis due to its distance from the vesicle-bound dsRNA template (21). Thus, (+)RNA synthesis might depend on an alternate protein A state with its RdRp domain deeper in the crown, either by bending of one or more crown apical lobes toward the vesicle or through an alternate form of protein A, as suggested by asymmetric electron-dense bodies often seen inside the crown turret (21). Further mapping of protein A's RNA capping and other domains within the crown should provide more powerful foundations for understanding and testing crown function and RC assembly and maturation.
zh03 | Given these new revelations on FHV RC and crown structure, the tight linkage of FHV spherule formation to viral RNA synthesis (24) suggests that the spherule RC may be formed dur- ing (-)RNA synthesis by inflating the vesicle with the dsRNA product, like blowing up a balloon (12). A similar model was proposed among other alternatives for Semliki Forest alphavirus (27).
1mvw | 2.2. Alphavirus-Like Superfamily
6d4s | The alphavirus-like superfamily of (+)RNA viruses includes members that infect animals, insects, fungi, and plants, united by four conserved domains in their RNA replication proteins: an RNA MTase/capping domain, membrane-interactive Iceberg region (11), superfamily 1 NTPase/helicase, and RdRp (Figure 2). Through multiple phylogenetic interconnections, this alphavirus-like superfamily, the nodavirus-tombusvirus clade discussed above, and the flavivirus superfamily discussed below are now grouped together in phylum Kitrinoviricota, which represents ~50% of (+)RNA viruses (1). This broad linkage underscores structural and functional parallels discussed here within and beyond this phylum.
mqah | Alphavirus RNA replication has best been studied for Semliki Forest virus and Sindbis virus, and increasingly for some more clinically important pathogens such as Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) (28-30). Alphaviruses encode a nonstructural polyprotein that is processed by a viral protease into nonstructural proteins (nsPs) 1-4 (Figure 2). nsP1 contains the RNA MTase/capping domain, the Iceberg region, and a second membrane-associating region. nsP2 has the NTPase/helicase, the protease, and a potential 2'-O-MTase. nsP3 has a macrodomain, zinc- binding domain, and hypervariable region. nsP4 contains the RdRp domain. Alphavirus RNA replication occurs in characteristic ~60- to 70-nm spherule vesicles (31, 32) that are induced on the plasma membrane and then, to degrees varying among different alphaviruses, are endocytosed into endosomal and lysosomal compartments (33, 34).
xxr8 | Equivalent spherule RCs are induced by numerous plant-infecting alphavirus-like viruses (35, 36). EM studies confirmed the same spherule architecture as for alphaviruses and provided particularly detailed views of spherule necks through freeze-fracture studies with turnip yellow mosaic virus (37). Evidence for spherules as the sites of viral RNA synthesis progressively accumu- lated from multiple viruses. For example, autoradiography mapped incorporated 3H-uridine to cytopathic vesicles bearing spherules (32), electron-dense fibrils inside spherules were identified as dsRNA-i.e., potential replication intermediates-by RNase sensitivity in low salt (38) and dsRNA-specific antibodies (39), and Br-rUTP incorporation was mapped directly to spherules by EM immunogold labeling (40). Further details of spherule formation and function were revealed
rl4j | by brome mosaic virus (BMV) studies showing that nsP1/nsP2-like BMV 1a protein (Figure 2) induces spherule formation, recruits genomic (+)RNA through specific cis-signals to the spherule interior, and recruits nsP4-like BMV 2apol to synthesize first one (-)RNA retained in the spherule and then many (+)RNAs released to the cytosol (40).
vz32 | Additional connections between alphavirus and nodavirus RCs emerged when cryo-EM single- particle analysis of CHIKV nsP1 revealed an nsP1 dodecamer ring (41, 42) (Figure 4b). This nsP1 dodecamer has been visualized to date from exogenously expressed, detergent-solubilized nsP1, and not in an alphavirus RC. Nevertheless, the parallel 12-fold symmetry of crowns in active no- davirus RCs (Figure <LATEX>\left. 4 a \right)</LATEX> and conservation of the capping domain, Iceberg region, and polymerase domain between alphaviruses and nodaviruses (Figure 2) suggests that the nsP1 dodecamer likely forms the membrane-bound base of a larger crown also incorporating nsP2, nsP3, and the nsP4 RdRp, and serves as a cytosolic export channel for progeny
ncb0 | <LATEX>\left( + \right) \mathrm { R N A s } .</LATEX> One nsP1-nsP1 dodecamer interface includes amphipathic detergent-binding projections, sug- gesting that oligomerization and membrane binding may be coupled. As in nodavirus crowns (21), nsP1's ordered contacts with lipids (43, 44) likely generate and stabilize the curvature of the membrane neck. Additionally, the nsP1 MTase domain structure shares features with eukaryotic mRNA cap (guanine-N7) MTase Ecm1, suggesting structural and mechanistic interpretations of alphavirus 5' RNA capping reactions involving <LATEX>\mathrm { m } ^ { 7 } \mathrm { G T P }</LATEX> methylation, <LATEX>\mathrm { m } ^ { 7 } \mathrm { G M P - n s P 1 }</LATEX> complex for- mation, and m7GpppRNA formation.
8mp0 | 2.3. Flaviviruses
xjyk | A third class of (+)RNA viruses forming spherule RCs are the Flaviviridae, which include major pathogens such as Zika, yellow fever, and dengue viruses. Flaviviruses encode a single polypro- tein that is cleaved into three structural proteins and seven nonstructural (NS) RNA replication proteins (45) (Figure 2). NS5 contains the RdRp and RNA capping enzyme. NS3 contains an RNA helicase/NTPase and the polyprotein processing protease. NS2A, NS2B, NS4A, and NS4B are membrane-spanning proteins that induce a continuous membrane network comprising vesicle packets, convoluted membranes, and virion assembly/budding sites (46, 47).
