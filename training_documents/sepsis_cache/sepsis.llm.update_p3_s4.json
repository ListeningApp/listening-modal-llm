        "content": "wak1 | Participants were randomized to usual care or to the study intervention in a one-to-one ratio by computer-generated, block randomization with variable block size (using random blocks of two, four, and six) to ensure allocation concealment. An allocation table based on this randomization scheme was uploaded to Research Electronic Data Capture, a secure, web-based application for research data management, by a statistician. A study coordinator obtained the randomization code for each patient from the Research Electronic Data Capture database after informed consent had been obtained. Block randomization was used to ensure similar numbers of participants in each study group given the overall small sample size, which was calculated a priori.\nwtfz | Study Treatments\nqy1i | The study intervention consisted of forty-eight hours of external warming with a forced-air warming system to a goal core temperature one point five degrees Celsius greater than the lowest recorded temperature in the twenty-four hours prior to enrollment or to at least thirty-seven point five degrees Celsius (whichever was higher). This goal temperature was chosen based on evidence from preliminary studies in our laboratory showing improved monocyte HLA-DR expression in patients with a one point five degrees Celsius increase in minimum body temperature during the first forty-eight hours after sepsis diagnosis. All participants enrolled in the study had temperature monitoring using a core temperature monitor (esophageal, bladder, or rectal). Immediately following randomization to the intervention group, a forced-air warming blanket on the highest setting (forty-three degrees Celsius) was applied to participant with the aim of attaining the target temperature within six hours of warming onset. After six hours, if the goal temperature was not achieved, warm blankets were added on top of the forced-air blanket and the room temperature was increased. Once the goal temperature was achieved, the forced-air blanket was used to maintain the temperature above the goal for the remainder of the intervention period.\n1k9e | The warming intervention was terminated early if any of the following criteria were met: vasopressor increase greater than fifty percent for six hours and greater than zero point one micrograms per kilogram per minute norepinephrine-equivalent dose, heart rate increase by greater than twenty-five beats per minute and heart rate greater than ninety, evidence of thermal skin injury, or\n5bjs | extubation. These termination criteria were chosen to avoid negative adverse effects of hyperthermia and to ensure participant comfort.\nuodj | Participants randomized to the control group received usual care temperature management in accordance with our current Intensive Care Unit protocols during the forty-eight-hour intervention period, at the discretion of the clinical team.\nk16v | Data Collection\nb2lm | Demographics, comorbidities, microbiological culture results, and sources of sepsis were extracted from the electronic medical record. Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation Two scores were calculated based on data from the first twenty-four hours in the Intensive Care Unit. Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores (excluding the Glasgow Coma Score component) were calculated prior to and following the intervention period. Throughout the forty-eight-hour intervention period, core body temperatures were recorded hourly. Mean arterial blood pressure, vasopressor dose (in norepinephrine-equivalents), and heart rate were documented every six hours. If warming was terminated early in the participants randomized to the study intervention, the reason for termination was noted. Blood samples were collected at randomization (days one to two after sepsis diagnosis) and following the forty-eight-hour intervention period (days three to four after sepsis diagnosis) to evaluate markers of immune function. Absolute lymphocyte counts from complete blood cell counts ordered by the treating clinical team were recorded from the electronic health record for the first seven days following sepsis diagnosis.\nti7f | Outcomes\noksu | The primary outcome was monocyte HLA-DR expression following the forty-eight-hour intervention period. This outcome was chosen because one, HLA-DR expression is one of the most widely accepted measures of sepsis-induced immunosuppression; two, low levels are associated with mortality and acquisition of nosocomial infection in septic patients; and three, our preliminary data suggested HLA-DR expression is higher in patients who experience fever during the first forty-eight hours of sepsis. Secondary immune outcomes included CD3/CD28-induced Interferon Gamma production following the intervention period and prevalence of persistent lymphopenia (defined as an absolute\nwtow | lymphocyte count less than one point two cells per microliter times ten to the power of three, which is the lower limit of normal at our institution, persisting beyond seventy-two hours after sepsis diagnosis). Clinical outcomes included the delta Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score (change in Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score based on laboratory studies and vital signs from the twenty-four-hour period prior to the start of the intervention compared to score based on data from the twenty-four-hour period after completion of the intervention), twenty-eight-day hospital-free days, twenty-eight-day ventilator-free days, acquisition of secondary infections, and twenty-eight-day mortality. Secondary infections were defined as new positive cultures or new antibiotics started after forty-eight hours and documentation of a new confirmed infection by the treating clinical team.\no22k | The safety outcomes of interest were vasopressor dose (expressed as norepinephrine-equivalent dose), heart rate, and respiratory rate.\nnwfz | Immunological Testing",
