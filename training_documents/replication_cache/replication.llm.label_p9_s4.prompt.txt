Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

pn9j | A long-elusive path for the potential release of viral RNA products from DMV interiors was provided when cryo-EM tomography revealed a sixfold symmetrical pore that spans both DMV membranes and contains nsp3, the largest <LATEX>\left( > 1 , 9 0 0 \right.</LATEX> aa) coronavirus RNA replication factor (65) (Figure 4c). This coronavirus channel or crown parallels the crowns previously recognized on spherule RCs (Figure <LATEX>\left. 4 a , b \right)</LATEX> in being a ringed complex of viral RNA replication factors that gates cytosolic release of viral RNA products and may assist in guiding their synthesis. Both the cytosolic and luminal portions of this coronavirus crown appear to interact with other viral and cellular factors (65). Potential luminal interactions with other viral RNA synthesis factors could help to coordinate synthesis and release of RNA replication and transcription products. On the crown's cytosolic side, nsp3's ubiquitin-like N terminus interacts with viral RNA and nucleocapsid protein (66-69), greatly enhancing RNA replication, likely by facilitating RNA delivery to the RC (66, 67, 70). As addressed below, in later infection these same nsp3/nucleocapsid interactions may guide encapsidation of progeny genomic RNA.
1pmc | 3.2. Picornaviruses, Hepaciviruses, and Noroviruses
5z6q | Picornaviruses are a large family of human and animal viruses that include poliovirus; rhinoviruses A, B, and <LATEX>\mathrm { C }</LATEX> hepatitis A virus; and many others (71). Like flaviviruses, picornaviruses express a single polyprotein processed by virus-encoded proteases into structural and nonstructural proteins (Figure <LATEX>\left. 2 a \right) .</LATEX> The nonstructural RNA replication proteins include the <LATEX>2 A ^ { P r o }</LATEX> and <LATEX>3 C ^ { \mathrm { P r o } }</LATEX> proteases, 2C NTPase, RNA synthesis primer <LATEX>3 \mathrm { B } \mathrm { V } \mathrm { P } \mathrm { g } ,</LATEX> and <LATEX>3 D ^ { \text { Pol } } R d R p .</LATEX> Domains conserved with 2C NTPase, 3B/VPg primer, <LATEX>3 \mathrm { C } ^ { \mathrm { P r o } } ,</LATEX> and <LATEX>3 \mathrm { D } ^ { \mathrm { P o l } }</LATEX> are shared by a superfamily of picornavirus-like viruses spanning vertebrate, invertebrate, and plant hosts (2). Within this superfamily, the

99fo | functions of these conserved domains and RNA replication generally have been studied best in poliovirus (72).
y5r7 | Membrane association of picornavirus RNA replication proteins is mediated through 2B, 2C, and 3A, which are sufficient to induce DMVs (55). Picornavirus-infected cells undergo extensive reorganization of ER, Golgi, and lysosomal membranes to initially produce single-membrane- bounded tubules that are progressively converted into double-membrane or multi-lamellar structures by flattening, curving, and fusing single-membrane tubules (73). Viral RNA replication proteins, dsRNA, and, most importantly, Br-rUTP labeling of newly synthesized RNA were all associated with both single- and double-membrane structures, suggesting that the nature of active picornavirus RCs may be dynamic (73). A possible picornavirus connection to coronavirus crowns is suggested by features of viral protein 2C (Figure 2): Like coronavirus crown constituent nsp3, picornavirus 2C is a crucial, conserved RNA replication factor that binds membranes, helps to induce DMV formation, and forms hexamers (74-76).
lrry | As noted above, HCV differs from most spherule RC-forming Flaviviridae in generating some closed single-membrane vesicles, particularly early in infection, and larger numbers of ~150- to 300-nm DMVs later in infection. As with coronaviruses and picornaviruses, HCV DMVs appear linked with RNA replication because their emergence matches RNA replication kinetics, they label with antibodies to dsRNA, and they are induced by and contain HCV RNA replication factor NS5A (53, 54, 77). As considered further below, the ability of similar Flaviviridae genomes to give rise to either spherule RCs (dengue virus and other flaviviruses) or DMV RCs (HCV) (78) has potential implications for the structural, functional, and potentially evolutionary relation of spherules and DMVs.
hvhm | Finally, similar to picornaviruses and hepaciviruses, noroviruses induce a progression from ER-linked single-membrane to double-membrane and even multi-lamellar vesicles (79). Similar structures were induced by norovirus nonstructural protein NS4 and modulated by NS1-2 and NS3. Further work is needed to define the functions of these varied compartments in norovirus replication.
863b | 4. FURTHER MECHANISTIC IMPLICATIONS
fj24 | 4.1. Functional Parallels and Potential Evolutionary Links Across Viruses
uz3c | The RC findings summarized here reveal parallels among and beyond (+)RNA viruses, sug- gesting or in some cases enriching potential underlying evolutionary connections. Spherule and DMV RCs were previously viewed as disparate structures, but the presence of crown-like rings of viral RNA replication proteins serving as product RNA release channels provides unifying links between them (12, 80). As shown in Figure 4, the topological similarity or difference between these structures ultimately reduces to the detailed contacts of each crown with two membrane sheets: for spherules, the outer organellar membrane and inner vesicle membrane (Figure 4d); for DMVs, the outer and inner vesicle membranes (Figure 4f). While interpretive schematics such as Figure 4 tend to emphasize continuity of the membranes interacting with nodaviral crowns on spherule RCs and separation of membranes interacting with coronavirus crowns on DMVs, these membranes may not be purely continuous or discontinuous in either structure. In particular, the spherule membranes interacting with nodavirus crowns are heavily disrupted by insertion of the crown's hydrophobic anchors (21), such that many lipids interact with crown proteins rather than other lipids. Similarly, for coronavirus crowns, as imaging resolution advances it will be of great interest to determine if interactions with crown proteins lead to any approach or contact between lipids in the inner and outer membranes.

ffx8 | Crown structures embodying such mixed lipid-lipid and lipid-protein interactions at crown- membrane interfaces might represent evolutionary intermediates linking (+)RNA viruses employ- ing spherule and DMV RCs. As noted earlier, one such evolutionary connection appears implicit within the Flaviviridae because flaviviruses and hepaciviruses use highly similar suites of RNA replication genes to generate spherules and DMVs, respectively (78). Further similar connections seem likely to emerge as phylogenetic gaps are filled by accelerating virus discovery.
s6su | At a higher level, similarities have been noted between intracellular (+)RNA virus RCs and certain types of virions. Most notably, (+)RNA virus RCs parallel the cores of dsRNA virus and retrovirus virions: Through these structures, each virus replicates its genome through an mRNA intermediate that is sequestered with its polymerase in a virus-induced membrane or protein com- partment for negative-strand synthesis (81).
y219 | Particularly extensive parallels exist between genome replication in (+)RNA virus RCs and dsRNA viruses. The pathways and (+)RNA/dsRNA replication intermediates (Figure 1a) appear identical. Indeed, (+)RNA and dsRNA virus life cycles are differentiated primarily by which repli- cation intermediate is packaged in virions: (+)RNA/mRNA for (+)RNA viruses, and the entire dsRNA-containing RNA replication compartment or core for dsRNA viruses (81). (+)RNA virus RC crowns also show intriguing parallels with ringed viral protein channels at the fivefold vertices of dsRNA virus cores. Cystoviruses such as dsRNA bacteriophage @6 assemble procapsids whose fivefold axes each bear an exterior hexamer of viral NTPase P4 (82). Similar to emerging models of nodavirus RC assembly (12, 26), these P4 hexamers serve as portals for active import of (+)RNA genome templates and passive release of progeny (+)RNA transcripts (83). Coronavirus DMVs also parallel these @6 capsids in bearing multiple hexameric crowns that are thought to serve as progeny RNA release channels and might serve as RNA template import channels (65).
06ht | Reoviruses, another family of dsRNA viruses, have cores whose fivefold axes bear pentameric turrets that serve as release channels and 5' capping complexes for viral mRNAs (84). The viral protein A that forms nodavirus crowns also contains the viral RNA capping functions (Figure 2) and may also 5' cap emerging nodavirus RNAs. Finally, paralleling the 12-fold symme- try of nodavirus crowns, herpesviruses and many DNA bacteriophage use 12-mer ringed portal protein complexes as import motors and release channels for their genomic DNA (85). Thus, (+)RNA virus crowns share features with proteins from a wide range of viruses, which might represent links with common ancestors contributing to the evolution of crowns.
v3r2 | 4.2. Dynamic Maturational Transitions of RNA Replication Complexes
nv42 | Results from many (+)RNA viruses indicate that RCs are dynamic complexes that undergo se- quential maturational changes and interact with a progression of viral and host interaction partners (see also below). Alphaviruses, for example, transition their RCs from (-)RNA to (+)RNA synthe- sis by viral nsP2 protease processing of their nsP1234 polyprotein (28, 30) (Figure 2). In an early step required for RNA synthesis, nsP2 releases nsP4pol from nsP1234 during or immediately after polyprotein translation. The resulting nsP123 and nsP4pol complex is specialized for (-)RNA syn- thesis, which as with nodaviruses is linked to spherule formation (33, 86). Subsequently, (-)RNA synthesis is inhibited and (+)RNA synthesis promoted by cleavages that separate first nsP1 from nsP23, and then nsP2 from nsP3 (87). The timing of nsP1/2 cleavage appears optimized to al- low conformational adjustments of nsP-nsP interactions required for subsequent steps, including nsP2/3 cleavage (88-90).
xags | This alphavirus polyprotein processing takes on new meaning with the finding that nsP1 assembles a 12-mer ring (41, 42) (Figure 4) that likely serves as a base for at least early nsP123 and nsP1234 complexes. Such high copy nsP1234 multimers would have similarities to the 12-fold symmetric, multi-domain nodavirus crowns (21, 26) and intriguing implications for functional

5zyf | issues such as intra- and intermolecular cleavages by nsP2 and the need to proteolytically release nsP4pol for RNA synthesis.
9own | Further indication of RC maturational changes emerged from recognition that alphavirus-like viruses, flaviviruses, and other Kitrinoviricota exploit cellular oxidizing functions to enable later aspects of (+)RNA synthesis including RNA 5' capping (91). Antioxidant treatment or knock- down of specific oxidases inhibits genome replication by BMV, red clover necrotic mosaic virus, alphaviruses, and flaviviruses (92-94). Conversely, oxidant treatment in vitro or overexpression of specific oxidases in vivo enhances 5' RNA capping by the relevant viral capping enzymes. Disulfide-linked viral RNA capping protein multimers are formed in flavi- and alpha-like virus infections, and their abundance correlates with such oxidant-dependent capping activation (92, 94, 95).
bqfb | How viral RNA capping enzymes could access cellular oxidants was initially unclear be- cause these oxidants are compartmentalized within organellar lumens, while the relevant RCs (Figures 3 and 4) are spherules that connect via their membrane necks and crowns to the highly reduced cytosol (96). Recent studies showed that BMV RNA replication protein 1a, whose mul- tiple functions include RNA capping, permeabilizes the ER membranes on which BMV spherule RCs form, locally oxidizing the adjacent cytosol (94). The effects of 1a mutations and other re- sults suggest that this oxidation induces a 1a-1a disulfide-linked complex whose conformational changes activate la's RNA capping functions (94). These studies also mapped la's membrane- permeabilizing or viroporin functions to an amphipathic alpha-helix conserved among alpha-like viruses (11). Because flavivirus NS2 and picornavirus 2B (Figure 2) also permeabilize intracel- lular membranes (97), members of all three (+)RNA virus superfamilies have RNA replication factors with viroporin activity, whose release of oxidizing potential or other small molecules from secretory or organellar lumens may regulate later steps in RNA replication (91).
wwdt | 4.3. Multiple RNA Replication Complex Outputs: Genomic RNAs, Subgenomic Messenger RNAs, and Recombination
mn1r | The RCs of most (+)RNA viruses host multiple processes such as replicating different RNAs of multicomponent genomes, genomic and subgenomic RNA synthesis, and RNA recombination. Growing understanding of RC structure and compartmentalization enables more effective con- sideration of how these processes are regulated and whether individual RCs might be specialized for particular pathways or RNA templates.
5vqw | To express additional proteins from internal open reading frames, many (+)RNA viruses pro- duce subgenomic mRNAs corresponding to 5' truncated fragments of viral genomic (+)RNA. For BMV (Figure 2), and by inference other alphavirus-like viruses, in vitro and in vivo results show that subgenomic mRNAs are synthesized by (+)RNA initiation at alternate internal promoters on a full-length genomic (-)RNA template (98). While many regulatory questions remain, mutual interference between BMV genomic and subgenomic RNA synthesis suggests that both pathways may proceed on a common genomic (-)RNA template in a single spherule RC (99).
