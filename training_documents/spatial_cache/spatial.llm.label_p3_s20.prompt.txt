You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

It is important to note that the conditions must be satisfied separately for each point if its <LATEX>G _ { i }</LATEX> is to be assessed via the normal approximation.

This implies that any concentration of the <LATEX>x</LATEX> values includes the <LATEX>x</LATEX> at <LATEX>i .</LATEX> Note that the distribution of <LATEX>G _ { t } ^ { * } \left( d \right)</LATEX> is evaluated under the null hypothesis that all n! random permutations are equally likely.
m047 | ATTRIBUTES OF <LATEX>G _ { i }</LATEX> STATISTICS
gy8c | It is important to note that <LATEX>G _ { i }</LATEX> is scale-invariant <LATEX>\left( Y _ { i } = b X _ { i } \right. ,</LATEX> yields the same scores as <LATEX>X _ { t }</LATEX> but not location-invariant <LATEX>\left( Y _ { i } = a + X _ { i } \right.</LATEX> gives different results than <LATEX>X _ { i } .</LATEX> The statistic is intended for use only for those variables that possess a natural origin. Like all other such statistics, transformations like <LATEX>Y _ { i } = \log X _ { i }</LATEX> will change the results.
y4mj | <LATEX>G _ { i } \left( d \right)</LATEX> measures the concentration or lack of concentration of the sum of values associated with variable <LATEX>X</LATEX> in the region under study. <LATEX>G _ { i } \left( d \right)</LATEX> is a proportion of the sum of all <LATEX>x _ { j }</LATEX> values that are within <LATEX>d</LATEX> of <LATEX>i .</LATEX> If, for example, high-value <LATEX>x _ { j } s</LATEX> are within <LATEX>d</LATEX> of point <LATEX>i ,</LATEX> then <LATEX>G _ { i } \left( d \right)</LATEX> is high. Whether the <LATEX>G _ { i } \left( d \right)</LATEX> value is statistically significant depends on the statistic's distribution.
vpgq | Earlier work on a form of the <LATEX>G _ { i } \left( d \right)</LATEX> statistic is in Getis (1984), Getis and Franklin (1987), and Getis (1991). Their work is based on the second-order approach to map pattern analysis developed by Ripley

The estimated <LATEX>G _ { i } \left( d \right)</LATEX> is computed from equation (1) using the observed <LATEX>x _ { j }</LATEX> values. Assuming that <LATEX>G _ { i } \left( d \right)</LATEX> is approximately normally distributed, when

a0mb | is positively or negatively greater than some specified level of significance, then we say that positive or negative spatial association obtains. A large positive <LATEX>Z _ { i }</LATEX> implies that large values of <LATEX>x _ { j }</LATEX> (values above the mean <LATEX>\left. x ; \right)</LATEX> are within <LATEX>d</LATEX> of point <LATEX>i .</LATEX> A large negative <LATEX>Z _ { i } ,</LATEX> means that small values of <LATEX>x _ { j }</LATEX> are within <LATEX>d</LATEX> of point <LATEX>i</LATEX> i.

wzno | A special feature of this statistic is that the pattern of data points is neutralized when the expectation is that all <LATEX>x</LATEX> values are the same. This is illustrated for the case when data point densities are high in the vicinity of point <LATEX>i</LATEX> i, and <LATEX>d</LATEX> is just large enough to contain the area of the clustered points. Theoretical <LATEX>G _ { i } \left( d \right)</LATEX> values are high because <LATEX>W _ { i } ,</LATEX> is high. However, only if the observed <LATEX>x _ { j }</LATEX> values in the vicinity of point <LATEX>i</LATEX> differ systematically from the mean is there the opportunity to identify significant spatial concentration of the sum of <LATEX>x _ { j } s .</LATEX> That is, as data points become more clustered in the vicinity of point <LATEX>i</LATEX> i, the expectation of <LATEX>G _ { i } \left( d \right)</LATEX> rises, neutralizing the effect of the dense cluster of <LATEX>: _ { j }</LATEX> values.
xagm | In addition to its above meaning, the value of <LATEX>d</LATEX> can be interpreted as a distance that incorporates specified cells in a lattice. It is to be expected that neighboring <LATEX>G _ { i }</LATEX> will be correlated if <LATEX>d</LATEX> includes neighbors. To examine this issue, consider a regular lattice. When <LATEX>n</LATEX> is large, the denominator of each <LATEX>G _ { i }</LATEX> is almost constant so it follows that corr <LATEX>\left( G _ { i } , G _ { j } \right) =</LATEX> proportion of neighbors that <LATEX>i</LATEX> and <LATEX>j</LATEX> have in common.
iwn5 | EXAMPLE 1
uooz | Consider the rook's case. Cell <LATEX>i</LATEX> has no common neighbors with its four imme- diate neighbors, but two with its immediate diagonal neighbors. The numbers of common neighbors are as illustrated below:
pxbq | All the other cells have no common neighbors with <LATEX>i</LATEX> i. Thus, the G-indices for the four diagonal neighbors have correlations of about 0.5 with <LATEX>G _ { i } ,</LATEX> four others have correlations of about 0.25 and the rest are virtually uncorrelated.
jfsr | For more highly connected lattices (such as the queen's case) the array of nonzero correlations stretches further, but the maximum correlation between any pair of G-indices remains about 0.5.
