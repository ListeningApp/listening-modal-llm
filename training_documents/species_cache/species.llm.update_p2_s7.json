        "content": "d52l | Indirect human agency has been a driver of species range expansion since the Neolithic Age, in which substantial human modifications of natural environments, through deforestation, onset of agriculture, and anthropogenic changes of the fire cycle are first recorded. Indeed, humans already affected the environment earlier-that is, when hunter-gatherers through their use of fire for hunting stimulated the growth of certain fire-adapted plants that profoundly changed ecosystems or because of the extinction of the megafauna. With the onset of agriculture, anthropogenic landscape modifications became a more widespread phenomenon. Around one thousand five hundred C E, however, agriculture was still largely confined to a few parts of the world. From the late eighteenth century onward, the beginning of the industrial revolution led to an exponential increase of human population size, agricultural industrial activities and the release of pollutants and fertilizers into the environment, a trend that became particularly pronounced after World War Two-the Great Acceleration.\nqlbb | Together, the intensifying anthropogenic changes of the environment since the mid-twentieth century have resulted in the current human domination of most Earth's system processes and in widespread substantial modifications of ecosystem properties, such as nutrient and energy stocks and flows, habitat destruction, and in the accumulation of pollutants, man-made substances (e.g., plastic) and structures (e.g., buildings). Concomitantly, humans have become the prime force for redistributing species across the globe, either by direct (transport of propagules) or strong indirect agency (human-made corridors connecting previously separated regions) that have resulted in biological invasions, or by causing environmental change that has resulted in species latitudinal and altitudinal range reductions as well as expansion.\nnhsg | Do we need a distinct classification for species expanding their ranges as a consequence of environmental change?\nhy0l | Range expansion in response to human-induced environmental changes have become a frequent phenomenon and are likely to continue becoming even more prominent in the future. Because of the profound implications this phenomenon has for biogeography, ecology, policy and management, range expansion involving species that track the changing environmental conditions according to their niche, without specific human assistance, require further elucidation.\n4jmz | Forum\nb7cq | Regional species pools\n0b39 | First, the processes involved in the range expansion of such species differ considerably from those underlying biological invasions because of the absence of human agency (other than human-induced environmental change), the lack of anthropogenic propagule pressure, and the typically intracontinental pattern of relatively short- to medium-distance spread adjacent to the historical native range, but see, for intercontinental seed dispersal with migrating birds.\nqecd | Second, range-expanding species responding to human-induced environmental changes are becoming an increasingly important challenge for conservation and\n1o7p | environmental management in many parts of the world. For instance, should such range expansion be facilitated by increasing permeability or connectivity of landscapes (e.g., green infrastructure) to allow the spread of species to new regions that are presumed to have become climatically suitable? What are the likely impacts of range expansion on resident biota, how can these be anticipated, and do the range expanders need to be managed, and if so, how? Which properties of species and the environment, and which types of environmental change affect the likelihood that a particular species will track the changing environmental conditions? In some cases, facilitating range expansion\ncp13 | (by creating dispersal corridors) may be crucial for ensuring species survival under rapid environmental change.\nbgre | Characteristic features of range-expanding taxa responding to human-induced environmental change\n57lp | For a taxon to qualify as range expanding due to human-induced environmental change, we suggest that it has to fulfill the following criteria: Its range has expanded beyond the historic native range, the range expansion has been facilitated by human-induced environmental change, the range expansion is not due to direct human agency (e.g., introduction of propagules), the population status of recent occurrences (i.e., being permanent or ephemeral) outside the historic native reference range, and-optionally-the range expansion has occurred within a timeframe that points to anthropogenic environmental change. We will discuss each of these features in detail and we propose a term for such species (neonative) below.\nukth | Applying the above-mentioned criteria in practice will often be difficult because of a lack of data (e.g., when did a species expand its range; what are the causal factors underlying the expansion?). Therefore, using expert knowledge and developing practical guidelines and thresholds will be essential for ensuring the usefulness and robustness of assessments of range-expanding taxa. We provide some recommendations on thresholds as a basis for future discussions to reach a widely accepted consensus.",
