And just as a way of waking up in the morning, I would ask people to unpack objects, to take a chocolate croissant and lead me through flour and chocolate and butter and sugar and coffee and connect us to world histories that way. I would ask people to pick an object, the T-shirt that the person sitting next to them was wearing, what was printed on it, the label, the very fact of labeling, the fibre composition. If it's got polyester, then take me through the history of Purity Hall and research labs at Du Pont; you know, back me up into nitrogen chemistry. If it's cotton, then back me into pesticides and the California water projects and where cotton is grown and the length of the fibre and what about what you are wearing on your chest? I would ask people, as a way of talking about science and politics, to take a pencil, a piece of paper, the architecture of the lecture hall that you walked past; pick something and get the class started by giving me an account of it.\nixcc | WAKING UP TO CONNECTIONS\n8p6h | Coffee is not enough, alas. Necessary for some of us, but not enough to properly wake up to the connectedness of the world, to our connectedness to world histories. But why not? How do T-shirts, croissants, and pencils contain their histories without our being aware of them? Why does even Donna Haraway, a historian of these particular connections, need to wake up each day to them again?\npmgl | The everyday, it seems, conspires against us, or with that part of us that wants to live in an everyday in which objects are mere parts of the world and it all makes a certain kind of sleepy sense. The connections Haraway instigates in the coffee shop may strike one as outrageous, certainly so early in the morning. They require promiscuous knowledge; they seem to accuse one of not having done enough homework. Anxieties arise, some look for an exit. Even worse, the connections may threaten the well-made world one lives in. One senses a potentially dangerous demand in them. The dormant activist stirs, \"If I find out that T-shirts contribute to environmental degradation or coffee to poverty, how am I going to get out of bed at all?\" How to live, how to know, how to be comfortable. How did comfort get wired in anyway?\n90no | Published in the same year as Haraway's \"Manifesto for Cyborgs,\" Gilles Deleuze's Cinema Two considered post-World War Two cinema and described a similar opposition between films that use the everyday to \"make us grasp something intolerable and unbearable\" and those that \"no matter how violent, are directed to a pragmatic visual function which 'tolerates' or 'puts up with' practically anything.\" The words intolerable and unbearable may seem overblown for T-shirts and coffee, but I ask your indulgence with this matter to understand how Deleuze wants to use these terms to signal an embodied form of politics aspiring to something different, opposed to a commonsense body and business as usual, a politics that indicates a (perhaps grudging) acceptance of the order of things and people. I want to put Deleuze's Cinema Two in dialogue with Haraway's work on connections, because working through the former helps me unpack the process of Haraway's inquisitive implosion method and some of its aims better. Following this exegesis, I offer a homework project for putting this method into practice.\njt0y | Haraway wakes up to connections precisely to rewire her common sense that every day conspires against this new physiology. For both Haraway and Deleuze, it is in our bodies that we are most vulnerable to comfort.\nqb7o | Neither everyday nor limit-situations are marked by anything rare or extraordinary. It is just a factory, a school. We mix with all that, even death, even accidents, in our normal life or on holidays. We see, and we more or less experience, a powerful organization of poverty and oppression. And we are precisely not without sensory-motor schemata for recognizing such things, for putting up with and approving them. We have schemata for turning away when it is too unpleasant, for prompting resignation when it is terrible and for assimilating when it is too beautiful. It should be pointed out here that even metaphors are sensory-motor evasions, and furnish us with something to say when we no longer know what to do.\noae5 | Hovering about, haunting all sides of our everyday worlds are other stories, other accounts, other connections that we may suspect, yet that paralyze us sometimes due to their enormity. Writing about cutting-edge films for their formation of new concepts, Deleuze does not analyze the processes of sensory-motor enculturation produced by more popular media. Haraway's Primate Visions takes on this challenge, examining the excruciating ways in which \"nature stories\" about primates, primitives, women, and civilization are produced in post-World War Two films and scientific articles. She explains how the processes of iconically and categorically dividing nature from history both give us our common sense about the neat world and therapeutically inoculate us against worrying about the loose ends.\ns0fl | In summary, in all of these stories humans from scientific cultures are placed in \"nature\" in gestures that absolve the reader and viewer of unspoken transgressions, that relieve the anxieties of separation and solitary isolation on a threatened planet and for a culture threatened by the consequences of its own history. But the films and articles rigorously exclude the contextualizing politics of decolonization and exploitation of the emergent Third World. Instead the dramas of communication, origin, extinction and reproduction are played out in a nature that seems innocent of history. It is precisely to renaturalize \"man\" after the calamities of advanced industrialism, and especially after the bomb, that apes and white people are placed together in both the \"natural\" world of the forest and the \"cultural\" world of language-users and pet-keepers.\n43ia | WRITING THE IMPLOSION\n3g2y | Key to war movies featuring bands of brothers and heroism are bits of complex threads about even horrific events, used in ways that isolate them into nice nuggets. The universal myth here is that most comfortable of epistemic objects, a cliché, a story that should be redundant yet whose enjoyment and function is to be repeated: the comfort of a McDonald's in times of peace and war. And weaving though our lives from start to finish, clichés are part of us.\ngc7v | The image constantly sinks to the state of the cliché: because it is introduced into sensory-motor linkages, because it itself organizes or induces these linkages, because we never perceive everything that is in the image, because it is made for that purpose. Civilization of the image? In fact, it is a civilization of the cliché where all the powers have an interest in hiding images from us, not necessarily hiding the same thing from us, but in hiding something in the image.\n```",
