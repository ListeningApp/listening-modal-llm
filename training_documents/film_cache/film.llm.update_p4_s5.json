Discontent with the simplicity of the 'hypodermic' model of media effects, a cluster of academics in the mid-'90s ditched media effects altogether and instead of pointing out particular flaws in the theory, opted for a wholesale rejection of the model. This effectively put an end to theoretical analysis of how media representations (e.g. of human sexuality, masculinity, femininity, race or age) work within a global economic system that often serves to define the nature of the content produced. Consequently, media studies academics now start from the premise that media texts are 'polysemic' (open to multiple meanings). As such, there is literally no 'thing' to study. But as professor Gail Dines has pointed out, this is like saying there is no such thing as a\noaen | car industry because there are lots of different types of cars on the road.\n5u67 | Media scholars seem to have substituted biological determinism in place of cultural determinism, thus conceptually transforming cultural products into 'unmediated' reflections of 'intrinsic' human nature. This has fed into the common belief that the film industry is totally democratic and therefore its products are an objective reflection of what human beings are like.\ndvms | But if you feed kids on a steady diet of sugar, advertise sweets all over the place to encourage them to buy more, distribute free samples, open candy stores on every corner, and then claim that kids 'naturally' prefer sweets to healthy nutritious food, you're insulting my intelligence. And just as the huge variety of sweets all contain very generous helpings of sugar and artificial ingredients and very little nutritional value, likewise the many varieties of films in the world (particularly those produced by Hollywood) seem to stick faithfully to remarkably common leitmotifs and conventions.\nqrd3 | American graphic novelist Alison Bechdel's famous test (unsurprisingly known as 'The Bechdel Test' or the 'Mo Movie Test') first appeared in her nineteen eighty-five comic 'Dykes to Watch Out For' under the title 'The Rule'. This test provides a very simple means of measuring whether females are meaningfully represented in a film. It sets a very low bar, because to 'pass' the test, a film needs only to meet three very minimal criteria:\nrxrg | One. It must have at least two (named) female characters\ntf43 | Two. Who talk to one another\nfcco | Three. About something other than a man.\n8uji | The test does not even require that the women in the film are non-stereotypical characters. They could talk about doing laundry or recipes. The test only measures whether women are meaningfully present in a film at all; it does not require that the film is feminist or that it in any way presents women positively. The only requirement is that there are women in the film who have some kind of an interior life independent of men. It is astonishing how many major Hollywood films do not pass the test, including many Oscar-nominated films.\ndf3e | But things are almost as bad when females are represented in films, since the ways in which they are depicted do not go very far towards suggesting that they have interior lives or minds. Almost a quarter of all female characters in family films are undressed or partially nude, compared to four percent of male characters.\n53eu | In their analysis of two hundred top grossing films of twenty fourteen and twenty fifteen, The Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media found that in twenty fourteen only eleven percent of them featured a female lead and in twenty fifteen only seventeen percent of the top grossing films had a female lead. Male characters were twice as likely to speak as female characters in the top grossing\na5u1 | films. Overall, male characters spoke thirty-one point eight percent of the time in films compared to fourteen point five percent of the time for female characters. On average, the top one hundred grossing non-animated films of twenty fifteen earned ninety million six hundred and sixty thousand dollars each. Films with female leads made considerably more on average than films with male leads: eighty-nine million nine hundred and forty-one thousand one hundred and seventy-six dollars for female leads compared to seventy-five million seven hundred and thirty-eight thousand ninety-five dollars for male leads. Films led by women grossed fifteen point eight percent more on average than films led by men. Even though women played leading roles in action blockbusters such as Star Wars: The Force Awakens (Daisy Ridley), The Hunger Games Series: Mockingjay Part two (Jennifer Lawrence), and The Divergent Series: Insurgent (Shailene Woodley), overall, male characters appeared and spoke on screen three times more often than female characters in action films.\nry7u | The sheer scale of the film industry has important cultural implications. The entertainment industries constitute our hegemonic culture and our norms of acceptable behaviour. The hegemonic Marxist approach to cinema suggests that media industries operate within a structure that reinforces the dominant ideology. Cinema has grown into a major industry with sophisticated marketing, technologies and global distribution networks, as well as cross-media promotion and production available to conglomerates such as Disney. Like other major industries that generate potentially harmful social impacts, the film industry creates a discourse that nurtures public confidence in its products and practices. The role of the media scholar is to interrogate the presuppositions latent in this discourse, and to unpack the relationships of power implicit in it.\n5mda | Most film studies and media studies students are familiar with the formal codes of film language - editing, framing, camera movement, lighting, sound, etc. These formal aspects of cinema work together to make meaning in ways that are familiar, or conventional, to media consumers. Consequently, it makes sense to speak of the cinema as having its own 'language'. Paradoxically, media and film studies courses involve a process of helping students to recognise (and talk about) the codes and conventions that they already know. Most students know how to 'read' the conventional codes from which a cinematic text is constructed, which is why they can enjoy these texts prior to studying them. In similar fashion, most English- speaking children can understand and tell stories in English long before they have ever heard of a preposition, a pronoun, an epithet or a metaphor. To study film form without engaging in critical analysis of its messages and values is analogous to studying English grammar without ever studying English literature. The former is about understanding the structure of the language, the latter is about the various uses to which this language is deployed within social or political contexts.\ni4li | No dichotomy between form and content need be presupposed. It is common to conceive of form as a container and content as something more substantial contained within it. This distinction is questionable, however, when we consider how the formal components work together as a 'meaning system' to create the whole pattern that is perceived. Subject matter and abstract ideas are an integral part\n```",
