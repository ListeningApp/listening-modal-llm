        "content": "ybik | The initial goal of therapy in patients with CS and associated hypotension should be focused on the restoration of perfusion to vital organs, achieved through augmenting MAP and cardiac output. End-organ blood flow is a direct correlate of MAP, and reduced systolic blood pressure in CS, in particular in the setting of AMI-CS, is independently associated with an increased risk of mortality.\ngii5 | The safety and efficacy of dopamine in CS has been called into question by the SOAP-Two trial. This study compared dopamine and norepinephrine as first-line therapies through a multicenter, ICU-based randomized controlled trial of one thousand six hundred seventy-nine patients with shock of all causes. Although there was no difference in the primary outcome of all-cause twenty-eight-day mortality in this cohort, dopamine was associated with increased arrhythmic events (n equals two hundred seven [twenty-four point one percent] versus n equals one hundred two [twelve point four percent], P is less than zero point zero zero one) and in a prespecified subgroup of two hundred eighty patients with CS there\nq5eu | Vasoactive Medications in Cardiogenic Shock\na7ao | was an increased risk of twenty-eight-day mortality (P equals zero point zero three). Although these findings are hypothesis generating, in the absence of alternate data supporting the use of dopamine, we advocate that noradrenaline should be used in preference to dopamine in the hemodynamic support in patients with CS and hypotension.\n29a3 | There is an emerging body of evidence to support the use of norepinephrine as the initial vasoactive agent for the management of CS with hypotension. OPTIMA double C (Epinephrine Versus Norepinephrine for Cardiogenic Shock After Acute Myocardial Infarction), a small prospective, double-blinded, randomized controlled study, sought to compare the hemodynamic effects and tolerability of epinephrine with norepinephrine in AMI-CS. Despite recruiting a total of only fifty-seven patients, there were several valuable insights gained from these data; (one) there were no differences observed in MAP, cardiac index, or stroke volume in patients treated with either epinephrine or norepinephrine; (two) comparable doses of both study drugs were required to achieve a target MAP of seventy millimeters of mercury; (three) epinephrine treatment was associated\nsb1e | Vasoactive Medications in Cardiogenic Shock\nw2yn | AMI-CS indicates acute myocardial infarction cardiogenic shock; ICU, intensive care unit; and PCI, percutaneous coronary intervention.
