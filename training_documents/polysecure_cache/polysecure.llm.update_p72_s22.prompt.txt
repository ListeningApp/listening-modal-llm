You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

70t5 | . The inability to find housing with your partners because of laws that allow only a certain amount of unrelated people to cohabitate.
kwz0 | . Having to navigate and inhabit homes that are built for the married nuclear family.
vool | . Dealing with child custody battles where your children are at risk of being taken out of the home because you are nonmonogamous. Elisabeth Sheff's research has found that most of the child custody court cases that non- monogamous parents face are not initiated by the state or Child Protective Services, but from ex-spouses or the child's grandparents who disapprove of the parent being nonmonogamous.
jwym | Culture and Communities Level
umh8 | At the culture and communities level, trauma, discrimination and attachment rup- tures can arise from:
1zay | · Being rejected by social groups or communities that you were regularly in- volved with and previously accepted by.
ns7i | . Being ostracized from a church that you belong to.
fztd | . Being subjected to "interventions" from teachers or community or religious
o5o5 | leaders who are unaccepting of nonmonogamy.
r5z1 | · Being unable to bring more than one partner to events, holidays, work func- tions, graduations or weddings, either because of the potential negative consequences or because of the standard plus-one policy of many formal occasions.
j696 | . Already being a part of a minority group that does not fully fit into more mainstream communities and now having to experience even further community discrimination or isolation.
34d0 | . Being blocked from online groups or being unfriended or unfollowed on so- cial media because of being nonmonogamous.
9ugn | . Being an outcast at school because of being nonmonogamous.
zvft | . Losing your job because you are nonmonogamous.
c1b3 | . Losing your polycule or nonmonogamous community because of drama or a breakup.
k969 | . Being unable to be out about being nonmonogamous at work because it could put your job, respect, ranking, promotions, bonuses, clients or social status at risk.
vt1d | · Being a man (usually white and cisgender) who is facing not having certain privileges for the first time. When nonmonogamous, the loss of monog- amous privilege shows up in several of the different levels for everyone, but for men it is usually first noticed in regards to dating, where men practicing CNM no longer have the same ease, accessibility and favor when it comes to dating now that they are nonmonogamous. The transition to CNM can be- come a significant eye-opener to privilege. While it is extremely important for men (especially white and/or cisgender men) to face the power dynamics that they have participated in and benefited from, the experience of going through a privilege flip can be disorienting, painful and even traumatic. Men can also experience further ostracization when they are met with contention from nonmonogamous communities because they still hold other forms of privilege, and when they experience a lack of support and guidance in how to
24sn | make sense of the privileges they've lost and those they still hold.
o0sh | . Being judged or scolded at the doctor's office for being nonmonogamous.
3max | . Being denied certain STI testing because the doctors or nurses are not aware or accepting of nonmonogamy.
sysw | . Being given misinformation about sexual health and STIs from health-care practitioners who have been trained from a mononormative perspective.
nbik | . Being denied access to partners who are in the hospital because you are not married.
sqoe | . No longer seeing yourself in popular culture via songs, commercials, movies, television, news, etc.
ok42 | . Not being able to find a local nonmonogamous community to participate in.
a22o | Societal Level
txc2 | At the societal level, trauma, discrimination and attachment ruptures can arise from:
65aq | . People practicing CNM being a legally unprotected class in the US and most other countries.
i3ag | . Being unable to legally marry more than one partner.
t1vi | . Being unable to religiously marry more than one person (this is not true of all religions).
hkxq | . Nonmonogamy being considered adultery, which is illegal in certain states.
9gst | . In the military, nonmonogamy can also be considered adultery, which can put someone's job, ranking and veteran's benefits at risk or even lead to incarceration or being dishonorably discharged from the military.
094q | Discrimination or the loss of privileges based on the many ways that monogamy and marriage have been institutionalized through tax benefits, health insurance benefits, child rights, estate rights, social security benefits, immigration and citizenship rights and veterans' benefits.
nlyd | Global Level
k5jo | At the global level, trauma and attachment ruptures can arise from:
r3vp | . The collective traumas, deaths and enslavement that the patriarchal, het- eronormative and mononormative monogamous paradigms have produced.
nuc1 | . The specific hardships that nonmonogamous people face during a global emergency such as a pandemic. As I write this during the 2020 coronavirus pandemic, all of my clients, regardless of their relationship structure, are ex- periencing a maelstrom of fear, overwhelm, anxiety and significant loss. This includes the loss of loved ones, work, home, community, touch, meaning and purpose. However, my nonmonogamous clients are facing additional challenges. Having multiple partners while being asked to practice social dis- tancing and isolation means being separated from important intimate part- nerships for an extended period of time. Uncertainty around how long this will go on and concern about the levels of risk that may come with reuniting are also exacerbating their sense of loss, anxiety and overwhelm.
2vej | When someone is no longer a part of a dominant paradigm, trauma can arise from the experience of being separated from the group and the feeling that they are alone with no one to turn to.65 Additionally, some experiences specific to being nonmonogamous can create additional and recurring threats that compromise our ability to attach, connect or even function. However, there is much growth that can come from this hardship. Just as scar tissue is stronger than regular skin tissue, traumas can lead to what researchers and mental health professionals refer to as post-traumatic growth, where 30 to 70 percent of individuals who experienced trau- ma report positive changes arising out of the traumatic experience they went through.66 Psychologists Richard Tedeschi and Lawrence Calhoun define post- traumatic growth as occurring when "someone's development has surpassed what was present before the struggle with crises occurred. The individual has not only survived, but has experienced changes that are viewed as important, and that go beyond the status quo."67 Such people have described profound changes in how they view their relationships, as well as how they conceive of themselves and their philosophy of life.
zj7x | Nonmonogamy can be a pressure cooker for growth. It is commonly and play- fully known in the nonmonogamous world that you shouldn't enter CNM unless you are ready to process, communicate, grow and then process, communicate and grow some more. This is because having multiple partners will expose all of your relationship baggage, your blind spots, shadows and shortcomings, and all the potential ways you've been asleep to social issues. Because of this, I've seen how nonmonogamy can actually become an accelerated path to growth, specifically when it comes to attachment, where it offers a path to healing that many people would not experience otherwise. When people are able to heal their previous at- tachment wounds, address any attachment changes that have occurred since open- ing up and create relationships that are founded on relational security instead of structural security, what previously felt impossible about CNM becomes possible, even celebratory.
