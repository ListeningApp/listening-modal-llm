        "content": "q5eu | Since D A ramping in the NAc is independent of V T A D A cell spiking, the magnitude and duration of D A signaling not only depends on the somatic firing of D A V T A neurons but also on the regulation of D A release from nerve terminals within the NAc. D A release in the NAc is regulated by cholinergic interneurons within the NAc, which are tonically active and release acetylcholine. Acetylcholine binds to nicotinic and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors on D A nerve terminals to directly depolarize D A terminals increasing striatal D A release independently of somatic firing, which provides a distinct modulatory mechanism. Moreover, terminal D A signaling depends on D A\na7ao | receptor availability and the efficiency of D A clearance, which is determined by the D A transporter, the level of enzymatic degradation of D A, and its diffusion from the synapse. The inhibitory D A auto-receptor D two modulates several of these regulatory steps: Upon binding of D A to axonal D two receptors in the NAc, it reduces the\n29a3 | exocytotic release of D A from axon terminals, increases the activity of the D A T and consequently D A clearance from the synaptic cleft, \nsb1e | Two thousand two. It also inhibits tyrosine hydroxylase activity and therefore D A synthesis. Somatodendritic D two receptors in the V T A also regulate D A signalling. Upon D A release from the soma and dendrites, D A binds to somatodendritic D two receptors, which activates hyperpolarizing G protein-gated inwardly rectifying potassium channel currents resulting in reduced firing rate and excitability of V T A D A neurons. While both axonal and somatodendritic D two receptors reduce D A signalling onto medium spiny neuron in the NAc, it is unclear how regulation of D A signalling via axonal and somatodendritic D two receptors is intertwined and whether treatments, that change efferent axonal D A release, also cause similar changes in local somatodendritic D A release. Additionally, neuronal D A signalling is modulated by surrounding astrocytes, along with microglia and oligodendrocytes, which are important for the homeostasis of the brain microenvironment.\nw2yn | One point three.
