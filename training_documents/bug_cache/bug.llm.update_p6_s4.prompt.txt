You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

slz6 | Self-Esteem and Behavior Plasticity
90k5 | Research on self-esteem as a main effect has yielded weak and inconsistent results. To address this issue, Brockner (1988) developed behavior plasticity theory. This theory proposes that self-esteem moderates the rela- tionship between situational factors and individual behav- ior such that those with low self-esteem are more respon- sive to external cues (situational factors) than those with high self-esteem. Brockner gave three reasons for this relationship. First, low self-esteem individuals are less certain of their own beliefs and behaviors and are more influenced by their environments. Second, because low self-esteem individuals are dependent on others for posi- tive feedback, they respond to others by conforming in an attempt to gain approval. Finally, low self-esteem indi- viduals are especially sensitive to negative feedback. They tend to overgeneralize, apply the feedback broadly, and change their behavior in a variety of situations. In con- trast, those with high self-esteem are less influenced by situational factors and are more likely to exhibit behav- ioral autonomy.
9m8s | Many studies have demonstrated that self-esteem mod- erates the relationship between events and circumstances in the workplace. (e.g., Brockner, Derr, & Laing, 1987; Greenhaus & Badin, 1974; Korman, 1966, 1970; Pierce, Gardner, Dunham, & Cummings, 1993; Tharenou & Harker, 1984; Weiss & Knight, 1980). Mossholder, Be- deian, and Armenakis (1981, 1982), for instance, demon- strated that self-esteem moderated the relationship be- tween peer-group interaction and performance/tenure/ stress such that those with low self-esteem were more responsive to the elements in their work environment.
893y | Overall, the literature on self-esteem suggests that low self-esteem individuals tend to be more responsive to a
favz | variety of organizational stimuli including peer-group in- teraction, evaluative feedback, socialization, leadership influence, role strain, and work layoff. In contrast, those with high self-esteem are less responsive to external cues and influence. Applying this logic to our study, we hypoth- esized that self-esteem would moderate the link between situational factors and voice behavior. Individuals with low self-esteem should be more responsive to the contex- tual influence of group size and style of management ( self- vs. traditional management). More specifically, those with low self-esteem would be more sensitive to the diffusion of responsibility that typically occurs in large groups. They would feel less involved, less influential, and would be less willing to engage in challenging behavior such as voice. Thus, low self-esteem would enhance the negative relationship between group size and voice.
7szx | Likewise, we hypothesized that the predicted relation- ship between style of management and voice will be stronger for those with low self-esteem. That is, those with low self-esteem will be more responsive to the personal responsibility, job complexity, and accountability of self- managed work teams and this will enhance their willing- ness to be proactive and exhibit voice. On the basis of the above we hypothesized the following:
hx9e | Hypothesis Sa. Voice will be an interactive function of self- esteem and group size such that the negative relationship between group size and voice will be stronger ( more nega- tive ) for individuals with low self-esteem relative to those with high self-esteem.
ywn2 | Hypothesis 5b. Voice will be an interactive function of self- esteem and self- versus traditional management such that the relationship between self-management and voice will be stronger (more positive) for individuals with low self- esteem relative to those with high self-esteem.
a63r | Satisfaction With the Group and Behavior Plasticity
dqvj | Although behavior plasticity theory was developed by Brockner (1988) specifically to explain self-esteem by situational factor interactions, it also seems reasonable to propose that satisfaction may have plasticity characteris- tics. That is, just like for self-esteem, we suggest that satisfaction with the group will moderate the relationship between situational factors and individual behavior.
r17u | Satisfaction is based on individuals' assessment that they are fulfilling important values (Locke, 1976). Satis- faction with the group implies that individuals believe they are fulfilling their values, in part, through the group. They are attached to the group, the group is important to them, and they are willing to reciprocate by taking the time to develop and express ideas for change. Their behav- ior, therefore, is a function of their own values and their preference for fulfilling these values through their group.

svhz | VOICE IN WORK GROUPS
oaen | As such, they should be less sensitive to contextual factors and should not increase or decrease their voice in response to those factors. That is, highly satisfied group members will engage in voice regardless of the situation.
5u67 | In contrast, those who are less satisfied are also less attached and less dependent on the group. Their behavior in the group is not based on fulfilling their values through group involvement. Instead it is more a function of the characteristics of the situation. That is, situational factors are more salient to individuals who are less satisfied with their group and their behavior is more "plastic." There- fore, we expected individuals with low satisfaction to be more responsive to the conformity pressure, feelings of anonymity, and diffusion of responsibility that are charac- teristic of large groups. Similarly, we expected individuals with low satisfaction to be more responsive to feelings of accountability and personal responsibility that are charac- teristic of self-managed groups. In essence, we propose that low satisfaction magnifies the relationship between situational factors and voice. That is, low satisfaction strengthens the negative relationship between group size and voice and the positive relationship between style of management and voice. Accordingly, we hypothesized the following:
dvms | Hypothesis 6a. Voice will be an interactive function of satisfaction with the group and group size such that the negative relationship between group size and voice will be stronger (more negative) for individuals who are less satisfied with their group relative to those who are more satisfied with their group.
qrd3 | Hypothesis 6b. Voice will be an interactive function of satisfaction with the group and self- versus traditional man- agement such that the positive benefit of self-management on voice will be stronger (more positive ) for individuals who are less satisfied with their group relative to those who are more satisfied with their group.
rxrg | Summary
tf43 | Consistent with the notion that voice in work groups is a function of more than just satisfaction, we have used theory and related empirical findings to hypothesize rela- tionships for two person-centered constructs ( satisfaction with the group and global self-esteem), two situational constructs (group size and style of management), and their interaction in expanding our understanding of the antecedents of voice. In the next section, we report a study that assessed these hypotheses using a construct valid measure of voice behavior.
