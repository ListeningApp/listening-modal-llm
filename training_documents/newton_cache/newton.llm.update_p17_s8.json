Lemma A point three D type equals NPC. Suppose that the MINRES algorithm returns D type equals NPC so that our step is r raised to the t minus one. Then,\ncchx | inner product of r raised to the t minus one and g equals negative norm of r raised to the t minus one squared.\n2vma | Additionally, the residual norm is upper bounded by the gradient.\nz4aw | norm of r raised to the t minus one is less than or equal to norm of g.\nmo0p | Proof. The relation twenty-one follows from the MINRES properties directly. We get twenty-two by noting that\ntyxr | norm of H s raised to the t minus one squared equals norm of r raised to the t minus one plus g squared equals norm of r raised to the t minus one squared plus two inner product of r raised to the t minus one and g plus norm of g squared equals norm of r raised to the t minus one squared minus two norm of r raised to the t minus one squared plus norm of g squared equals norm of g squared minus norm of r raised to the t minus one squared. For the third line, we applied twenty-one. The final equality and the nonnegativity of the norm implies the result.\ntxaa | B. Global Convergence - Minimal Assumptions\nqz8s | In this section, we detail the proof of the global convergence of Algorithm one, that is, Theorem three point three. We first demonstrate that the uniform positive curvature certification of the residuals, r raised to the i, provides a bound on the curvature of the Hessian over the corresponding Krylov subspace.\ny7de | Lemma B point one Strong Positive Curvature Certification. By verifying\nrukn | inner product of r raised to the t minus one and H r raised to the i is greater than varrho norm of r raised to the i squared, for i equals zero to t minus one, we obtain\n5tu7 | inner product of v and H v is greater than or equal to varrho over t plus one norm of v squared,\nvqgg | for any\nsbs5 | v in K sub t left parenthesis H comma g right parenthesis.
