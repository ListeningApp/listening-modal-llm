You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

cop0 | Stability and Change of Psychopathology Symptoms Throughout Childhood and Adolescence
lhkq | Abstract
82ju | Assessing stability and change of children's psychopathology symptoms can help elucidate whether specific behaviors are transient developmental variations or indicate persistent psychopathology. This study included 6930 children across early childhood (T1), late childhood (T2) and early adolescence (T3), from the general population. Latent profile analysis identi- fied psychopathology subgroups and latent transition analysis quantified the probability that children remained within, or transitioned across psychopathology subgroups. We identified four psychopathology subgroups; no problems (T1: 85.9%, T2: 79.0%, T3: 78.0%), internalizing (T1: 5.1%, T2: 9.2%, T3: 9.0%), externalizing (T1: 7.3%, T2: 8.3%, T3: 10.2%) and the dysregulation profile (DP) (T1: 1.7%, T2: 3.5%, T3: 2.8%). From T1 to T2, 44.7% of the children remained in the DP. Between T2 and T3, 33.6% remained in the DP; however, 91.4% were classified in one of the psychopathology subgroups. Our findings suggest that for many children, internalizing or externalizing symptoms encompass a transient phase within development. Contrary, the DP resembles a severe at-risk state in which the predictive value for being in one of the psycho- pathology subgroups increases over time.
y2qo | Introduction
1piq | It is widely known that children with symptoms of psycho- pathology in childhood and adolescence are at higher risk of psychopathology in adulthood [1-5]. Studying the stability and change of child behavior over time can elucidate those characteristics of psychopathology that are transient phases of development versus those that signal persistent psycho- pathology. Symptoms of psychopathology in children can be divided broadly into two domains; namely internalizing (e.g. anxiety) and externalizing problems (e.g. aggressive behav- ior). Additionally, there is a group of children with comorbid internalizing and externalizing problems. In the literature these children have been labelled as either a comorbid group or a group with the dysregulation profile (DP) [5-8].
7fqw | Many studies have assessed the prevalence of psycho- pathology and the continuity of individual domains of psy- chopathology separately (e.g. depressive symptoms, aggres- sive behavior) [1, 9-11]. These studies provide evidence that overall stability decreases when the time interval between the first measurement and follow-up waves increases [9-11], and that externalizing behavior tends to be more stable than
rhaz | internalizing behavior [9]. Additionally, stability in symp- toms of psychopathology has been shown to be higher in children who were older at initial assessment, suggesting that symptoms of psychopathology become more predic- tive of persistent psychopathology with age [1]. However, studying persistence and change of individual domains of psychopathology has two limitations. First, as internalizing and externalizing symptoms are highly comorbid [10], the continuity and change of the correlated domains will likely, to some extent, reflect the same underlying process. Second, when there is a reduction of symptoms in one domain, we do not know whether this reflects a decrease in overall symp- toms, or alternatively, a change only in those specific symp- toms (e.g. decrease in aggression coupled with an increase in attention problems).
wak1 | An increasingly adopted method that identifies subgroups of children based on their continuous symptoms across domains of psychopathology is latent profile analysis (LPA). This data-driven approach minimizes the heterogeneity of comorbid symptoms and allows for a more integrated analy- sis of child behavior compared to assessing specific domains (e.g. depressive symptoms) separately. In a recent review, 23 studies that used LPA to study symptoms of psychopathol- ogy in 4-11 year-old children were compared [12]. Three of these studies analyzed symptoms across internalizing and externalizing domains in a population-based setting, of which two were performed at younger ages in the current sample [6, 13]. All studies identified four psychopathology subgroups; (i.) no problems, (ii.) internalizing, (iii.) exter- nalizing and (iv.) a comorbid or DP group [6, 7, 13]. Across all ages, approximately 2% of the population was classified in the DP with comorbid internalizing and externalizing problems. The percentage of children included in either the internalizing or externalizing subgroup differed substantially between the two studies, with prior work in early childhood showing higher rates of externalizing, but lower rates of internalizing symptoms compared to studies in later child- hood and adolescence [6, 7]. An internalizing subgroup was present in toddlers aged 3 to 4.5 years and children between 5 and 9 years of age, with 4.8% and 5.3% being included in the internalizing subgroup in these age ranges, respec- tively. An externalizing subgroup was present as early as 1.5 to 2.5 years of age, with 11.1% of the children exhibit- ing this profile. Further, between 3 and 4.5 years of age, 6.5% was included in the externalizing profile and between 5 and 9 years of age, the proportion of children included was 7.3% [6]. Within another sample, assessing children in late childhood (mean age 7.5 years) and early adolescence (mean age 14 years), respectively 16.1% and 13.9% of the children were included in the internalizing and 2.5% and 4.4% in the externalizing subgroup [7].
wtfz | To answer questions on individual developmental trajec- tories within or across psychopathology subgroups, latent
qy1i | transition analysis (LTA) can be applied. During develop- ment, children can either remain in the same subgroup over time, or transition between psychopathology subgroups. The former is typically referred to as homotypic continu- ity, which elucidates the predictive validity of children remaining in the same subgroup at each subsequent time point. Transitioning between psychopathology subgroups is referred to as heterotypic continuity, in which an earlier psy- chopathology subgroup can be an underlying risk factor for a child to transition to a different subgroup. Earlier work on the stability of symptoms of psychopathology in children has shown that stability increases with age [6] and that between mid-childhood and early adolescence, homotypic continuity is higher for the internalizing and externalizing subgroups than for the DP [7]. More specifically, from those children included in the internalizing subgroup in late toddlerhood, only 23% remained in this subgroup in early childhood [6] and from those identified with internalizing symptoms in late childhood, 61% exhibited internalizing symptoms in early adolescence [7]. Likewise for the externalizing sub- group, homotypic continuity was present for 31% between early and late toddlerhood, 39% between late toddlerhood and early childhood [6] and 62% between late childhood and early adolescence [7]. Regarding the DP, homotypic continu- ity did not consistently increase across age. Between early and late toddlerhood, late toddlerhood and early childhood, and finally between late childhood and early adolescence, homotypic continuity of the DP was present for 37%, 18% and 44% [6, 7].
