You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

2zpk | 1. Obtaining the facts. You will likely obtain the most infor- mation by reviewing the history with the person who spends the most time with the patient. Their familiarity with the animal may provide valuable insights. It is the care-giver who has had the best opportunity to have made key observations regarding a concern or illness, i.e., the "chief concern." Sometimes the individual who has brought the pet to the facility is not able to convey the necessary information because of language, handicap, or another issue. This will direct you to attempt identifica- tion of the next most knowledgeable source of informa- tion. Always verify the patient's signalment as an easy means of beginning a conversation while avoiding mis- placed diagnostic and therapeutic pursuits. There are many examples of diagnoses being made after a mistake in the record is identified. It is "best not to assume anything."
epu7 | 2. Diet and appetite. Animals with normal appetites are rarely critically ill. Changes in appetite, up or down, are easily and often observed. This reality is the reason that appetite is frequently a cause for concern and may be one of the first observed signs of illness. It may be important to know how much of an increase or decrease in appetite has taken place and over what period of time. Has the change progressively worsened or has it reached some plateau? Changes in appetite often parallel duration of illness. Dietary information is especially important in patients who are cachectic, obese, or who have chronic digestive system complaints. When possible, determine

f682 | the current diet, duration of providing that food, and all other sources of oral intake. It may be critically important to know if a diet is homemade or a commercially available food. Supplements and "chew toys" may be important.
li1k | 3. Drinking, urination, and defecation patterns. These are 3 daily activities typically observed by owners. As such, they are common areas of concern and frequently represent an "owner chief complaint." Even if an owner's chief concern appears unrelated to water intake, urine output, stool quality, or defecation frequency, having an understanding of the current status of these physical traits will be of general value and may help explain a primary concern. Answers to questions about these matters may provide the clinician with insight regarding the care-giver's obser- vational skills.
pbea | As examples, polydipsia can be associated with numer- ous syndromes while adipsia will sometimes be a reason for an animal becoming severely hypernatremic. Polyuria can accompany the same syndromes associated with poly- dipsia while stranguria and dysuria will usually be associ- ated with lower urinary outflow concerns. Stool quality and frequency of production could provide important information about the pancreas and intestines. High volume, greasy stools in a polyphagic pet who has expe- rienced weight loss or difficulty gaining weight are typical of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. Frequent watery stools are associated with small bowel dysfunction. Colonic disease is often characterized by a pet with stable body weight but who has straining (tenesmus), frequency, and the stool may be small in volume while containing blood and/or mucus.
ccpt | 4. Geographic history. Knowing the geographic background can provide important information because certain dis- eases are endemic to specific geographic areas. Clinical diagnosis can escape the clinician who fails to understand the importance of where the pet has traveled or lived.
0fpw | 5. Describe home environment. Knowing the conditions of the animal's home is essential. A dog or cat that is allowed to be unattended outdoors might be subjected to various forms of trauma or be exposed to one of several of nature's maladies such as venomous snake encounters, toxic plant ingestion, etc. Behavioral problems can sometimes be traced to changes in the home environment. The addition or loss of a person or another animal from the home may be significant. Remember that pets may be exposed to or consume medications prescribed for people in the home.
dqn8 | 6. The chronology of the sequence of events. Knowing when the animal was last normal and then being able to trace sub- sequent events in chronological order may help in under- standing a concern. In some cases, this may help categorize the disorder as being either acute (occurring over the past hours or days) or chronic (occurring over a period of two weeks or more). The duration of subacute illnesses lies somewhere in-between.
cop0 | 7. The initial abnormal signs and their progression. This infor- mation provides the opportunity for the clinician to per- ceive not only how the illness began, but it furthers the understanding of the disorder by providing important information for how the illness progressed and its effects on the animal. As mentioned, it may allow the clinician to actually get a "feel" for the disease. This can be illus- trated in a dog that is examined for initially vomiting a clear watery fluid. If the vomitus then progressed to being bile-colored and if the patient then begins to produce profuse watery brown diarrhea with or without hemato- chezia, it may be interpreted as gastritis that has pro- gressed to involve the proximal and distal small intestine. The presence of bile provides evidence that the pylorus is probably patent.
lhkq | 8. Changes in body weight. Acute disease rarely causes signifi- cant weight loss. When weight loss is present in the acute setting, it is usually reflected in dehydration caused by water loss through vomiting and/or diarrhea. Polyuria, if present, will cause dehydration to develop quickly if the animal is not drinking. It is possible for an animal to lose as much as 12 percent of its body weight via water lost through vomiting and diarrhea while retaining muscle mass.
82ju | The chronically ill pet may be brought to the veteri- nary facility with a "chief concern" of weight gain or weight loss. The hydrated pet with weight loss will have often lost both fat and muscle mass. These more chronic concerns have usually developed over a period of at least 1-2 weeks. Changes in body weight should trigger a number of questions directed at determining duration, changes in environment, diet, appetite, presence of intesti- nal signs, travel history, water intake and urine output, etc.
y2qo | 9. Vaccinations and medications. The owner of every pet should be asked about current, recent and previous medi- cations given. Knowing what vaccinations have been given, when, and where may become valuable. Responses by the pet, positive or negative, to any medications should be noted. This information is not only important to help diagnose the disease, but might also help with its subse- quent treatment management. A young dog may have been successfully treated at another hospital with gluco- corticoids and parenteral fluids. Later, the dog relapses with the same symptoms after the effects of the treatment dissipated. This treatment history would be classic for adrenocortical insufficiency.
