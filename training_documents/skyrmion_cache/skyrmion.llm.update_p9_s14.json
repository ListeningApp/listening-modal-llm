        "content": "u8nw | We typically start with random MPS initial states of bond dimensions up to M is less than or equal to one thousand twenty-four, followed by sequential variational optimizations (\"sweeping\") of two adjacent tensors (two-site DMRG). The two-site DMRG allows us to estimate the truncation error Delta rho equals the sum from i equals M plus one to infinity of s subscript i squared, which we use in Fig. ten to extrapolate toward results without numerical errors. To ensure that we display converged results only, we carefully monitor local spin expectation values and stop the simulation if changes in the observables become smaller than delta equals ten to the negative ten. Since we use DMRG in two spatial dimensions, convergence to a spin spiral state may require many sweeps, on the order of one hundred to one thousand. The quality of the approximate ground state with energy E of M equals the inner product of psi of M with operator H with psi of tilde M can be estimated by the energy variance\nl2v9 | epsilon of M equals the inner product of psi of M with operator H minus E of M squared with psi of M. \nafbe | By construction, epsilon equals zero for exact eigenstates of the Hamiltonian. Since MPS approximates the wave function with a finite bond dimension M, we have epsilon of M greater than zero and the limit as M approaches infinity epsilon of M equals zero in general. Similarly, the limit as M approaches infinity E of M equals E subscript zero converges to the true eigenstate energy. To estimate the numerical error of our approximate wave functions, we perform linear extrapolations of the energy scaled against the truncation error and the energy variance. The outcomes of this extrapolation are presented in Fig. ten and Table two. We want to stress that the MPS approximations corresponding to skyrmion and\n78r8 | field-polarized states easily reach convergence within a few dozen sweeps and follow the expected linear trend in the approximation errors Delta rho and ampersand.\n320g | Changes in the local spin expectation values beyond M equals one hundred twenty-eight are invisible to the naked eye when displayed on the scales used in the main text such that a detailed error extrapolation is not needed. A word of caution is due in the case of helical spin spiral states: as we already explained in the main text, these states are difficult to simulate using MPS due to the large degeneracy of the ground-state manifold. This leads to some issues in reaching convergence (up to one thousand sweeps are needed) which for too small bond dimensions may even cause DMRG to get stuck in local energy minima corresponding to excited eigenstates. In the helical phase and for large lattices, MPS is thus not always reliably converging to approximations of the global ground state but converges under some circumstances to low-lying excited states with less entanglement.\ntp8g | Before we can apply DMRG to the system at hand, the two-dimensional lattice must be mapped to a one-dimensional chain. The map from a two-dimensional lattice to a one-dimensional chain can be performed by a sequential numbering of the lattice nodes with major ordering along an arbitrary axis (zigzag order). We choose the major axis to be a subscript two. This can be achieved by f of r of n subscript one, n subscript two equals n subscript two plus the sum n less than n subscript one of l of n where one of n is an auxiliary function that encodes the lattice open boundary conditions and\ngxfd | r of n subscript one, n subscript two equals the sum of i n subscript i a subscript i. As a result, the lattice Hamiltonian H hat equals the sum of the inner product of H hat subscript r, r prime plus the sum of r H subscript r a chain Hamiltonian H hat equals the sum of r H subscript r mapped Io the sum of the inner product of H hat subscript f of r, f of r prime plus the sum of r H hat subscript f of r. To simplify the remaining discussion, we now assume square or rhomboid boundary conditions (see Fig. twelve), and one less than n subscript i less than L subscript i, such that l of n equals L subscript two. On-site contributions remain local, nearest-neighbor interactions along the major axis remain short ranged, but the interactions along the a subscript one axis now have an extended range absolute value of f of r minus f of r plus or minus a subscript one equals L subscript two. This results in a growth of the dimension of the Hamiltonian matrix product operator M subscript H proportional to L subscript two. To obtain reasonable computation times for large\ns2v1 | skyrmion lattice systems, one must therefore restrict the bond dimension M to significantly smaller values. For the largest quantum skyrmion lattice system we present in Fig. eight, we plot the converged results of M equals one hundred twenty-eight. Note that the choice of our mapping preserves the locality of the interaction in one direction. In an attempt to remove this bias, we checked the resulting MPS quality for a different mapping, starting at the central spin-one half site and ordered radially outward (spiral ordering). Using the spiral ordering, we can confirm using the von Neumann entropy that the outer rim of the skyrmion is strongly entangled with its environment, a conclusion we had also reached based on the concurrence.",
