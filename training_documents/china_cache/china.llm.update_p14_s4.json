It appears that invitations have been very widely distributed to non-communist groups, including associations known to have right-wing connections or sympathies. Many more 'neutral' people have accepted the invitations. They feel much less inhibited about attending such parties. Some of them even regard it as an honour to have been invited.\n57lp | Different views were shared by former migrants from China and the locally born young generation. A large proportion of middle-aged and elderly groups still viewed commu- nism with scepticism. The young generation took a relatively 'relaxed attitude' about 'the likelihood of Hong Kong returning to China'. Most post-war baby boomers however 'still preferred the status quo' and did not 'cherish returning to live in China under a com- munist regime'. The general optimism towards China stretched into the late nineteen seventies: 'a general feeling of relief and confidence currently prevails'. While it was convention- ally believed that 'older Chinese had often kept their negative views of the PRC', MOOD shows that attitudes of the middle-aged and elderly towards China had improved signifi- cantly in nineteen seventy-eight. Many were 'now more relaxed about China and welcome the improve- ment of Hong Kong and Beijing relations'. For the young generation, the Return Home Movement lost momentum and MOOD detected 'no significant trend' of students wanting to return to China.\nukth | The mass media in Hong Kong played an important role in shaping views towards China. By the mid-nineteen seventies, most Hong Kong Chinese had greater access to the mass media. The literacy rate in Hong Kong was high: eighty-three per cent in nineteen seventy-one with an anticipated increase of eight per cent over the next ten years. Most households owned radios. Television sets were becoming prevalent. Before the nineteen seventies, the liberal mass media had avoided reporting on Chinese news, except atrocities and chaos during political upheavals. In the early nineteen seventies, the press and media in Hong Kong 'began to change perceptibly'. Right- wing newspapers stopped focusing on the shortfalls of the communist regime and started providing less biased accounts. The communist press ceased to attack misdeeds of the colonial state to 'make their papers more credible, acceptable or attractive to Hong Kong'. For instance, to increase the readership in Hong Kong, Wen Wei Po no longer used simplified characters in their papers. Cheng Ming, a new magazine sponsored by the communists, featured debates and philosophical dissertations on com- munist policies and doctrines to appeal for the support of Hong Kong's young and intel- lectual audience.\nkpvt | Chinese policies after nineteen seventy-six also convinced people that China would 'gradually shift from communism to socialism'. Many believed that the use of Western technologies and modernization in China would 'inevitably have an impact on the political and ideo- logical stand of China's leadership'. The emergence of an intelligentsia who were partial\njie2 | to Western philosophies was a sign that the state would soon 'evolve into a new type of regime'. After the fall of the Gang of Four in nineteen seventy-six, it was crucial for Beijing to main- tain the stability of Hong Kong. Increased optimism could be observed with many start- ing to refer to the Chinese Communist Party as 'the Chinese government' and the mainland as 'China'. Taiwan was now labelled 'a territory'. Economic modernization and increased visits to the mainland led many to believe that the living standard there had risen 'very considerably'. The 'dull and colourless' life and 'apparent backwardness', however, prevented many from considering a return to and settlement in the mainland permanently.\nd0ik | Conclusion\n0x0s | The Home Affairs Department monitored popular political attitudes and social aspira- tions on important topics and sensitive issues. Such constructed public opinion influ- enced policymaking, and bureaucrats created a structurally invisible concept of public opinion. Thus, by implication, the state did not rule indirectly and did not view the Chinese communities as self-regulating. These MOOD reports were circulated restric- tively among senior officials. Ordinary people were unaware that they were exercising political influence: this was covert colonialism. They believed that the undemocratic administrative system only gave certain social elites access to policy formulation processes.\n4exe | Throughout the period from nineteen seventy-five to nineteen eighty, MOOD's techniques improved. The Home Affairs Department and the City District Office broadened their contact lists, expanded the samples, and increased incidental contacts. They then adopted a per district quota sampling method and incorporated the New Territories. To maintain and improve the qualitative aspect of MOOD, informal and unstructured techniques were adopted in interviews. MOOD became increasingly scientific.\n0myz | The MOOD materials provided Hong Kong bureaucrats with intelligence on shift- ing popular sentiments on the reformed colonial state, the British government, and China. Findings in MOOD were largely reassuring. In general, there was improved communication between the state and society. Political culture was changing, espe- cially among those of the young generation and at the grass-roots level, although polit- ical conservatism was still deeply rooted in the middle-aged and elderly groups, particularly among entrepreneurs and professionals within the upper and middle classes. Neither group advocated major constitutional reforms. They did not pose a major threat to the colonial rule as they were not cohesive. Even the post-war baby boomers were divided. On the whole, the public at large supported colonialism; a desire to maintain the status quo, an open economy, low tax rates, and social stability; and a lifestyle which blended Chinese culture with cosmopolitanism - although the public was indifferent to the British government and political allegiance to the monar- chy was non-existent. By contrast, the public adopted a more positive attitude towards the PRC, a shift that affected even the middle-aged and elderly, who formerly viewed the communist regime with fear, hostility, and contempt. Nonetheless, patriotic student movements waned in the mid-nineteen seventies.\nxh3i | Notes\nsyiw |\nkg3t |\n```",
