You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

pk06 | We note that <LATEX>G _ { i } ,</LATEX> and <LATEX>G _ { i } ^ { * }</LATEX> are similar in this case; if the central <LATEX>A</LATEX> was replaced by a <LATEX>B ,</LATEX> <LATEX>Z \left( G _ { i } \right)</LATEX> would be unchanged, whereas <LATEX>\mathrm { Z } \left( G _ { i } ^ { * } \right)</LATEX> drops to 4.25. Thus, <LATEX>G _ { i }</LATEX> and <LATEX>G _ { i } ^ { * }</LATEX> typically convey much the same information.
7wn9 | EXAMPLE 3
wcd0 | Consider a large regular lattice for which we seek the distribution under <LATEX>H _ { 0 }</LATEX> for <LATEX>G _ { i } ^ { * }</LATEX> with <LATEX>W _ { i }</LATEX> neighbors. Let p = proportion of As = proportion of <LATEX>B s</LATEX> and <LATEX>1 \quad - \quad 2 p</LATEX> = proportion of
caos | <LATEX>m s .</LATEX> Let <LATEX>\langle k _ { 1 } ,</LATEX> <LATEX>k _ { 2 } ,</LATEX> <LATEX>k _ { 3 }</LATEX> denote the number of As, <LATEX>B s ,</LATEX> and <LATEX>m s ,</LATEX> respectively so that <LATEX>k _ { 1 } + k _ { 2 } + k _ { 3 } = n .</LATEX> For large lattices, in this case, the joint distribution is approximately tri(multi-)nomial with index <LATEX>W</LATEX> and parameters
qrvy | <LATEX>\left( p , p , 1 \quad - \quad 2 p \right) .</LATEX> Since
pn9j | <LATEX>G _ { i } ^ { * } = \frac { W _ { i } + \left( k _ { 1 } - k _ { 2 } \right) c } { n }</LATEX> clearly <LATEX>E \left( G _ { i } ^ { * } \right) = W _ { i } / n</LATEX> as expected
1pmc | and <LATEX>V \left( G _ { i } ^ { * } \right) = 2 p W _ { i } / n ,</LATEX> ,
5z6q | reflecting the large sample approximation. The distribution is symmetric and the standardized fourth moment is
yeoh | <LATEX>3 + \frac { \left( 1 - 6 p \right) } { 2 p W _ { i } }</LATEX> This is close to 3 provided <LATEX>p W _ { i }</LATEX> is not too small.
b8hf | Since we are using <LATEX>G _ { i }</LATEX> and <LATEX>G _ { i } ^ { * }</LATEX> primarily in a diagnostic mode, we suggest that <LATEX>W _ { i } \geq 8</LATEX> at least (that is, the queen's case), although further work is clearly neces- sary to establish cut-off values for the statistics.
hntf | A GENERAL G STATISTIC
99fo | Following from these arguments, a general statistic, <LATEX>G \left( d \right) ,</LATEX> can be developed. The statistic is general in the sense that it is based on all pairs of values <LATEX>\left( x _ { i } , x _ { j } \right)</LATEX> such that <LATEX>i</LATEX> and <LATEX>j</LATEX> are within distance <LATEX>d</LATEX> of each other. No particular location <LATEX>i</LATEX> is fixed in this case. The statistic is
y5r7 | <LATEX>G \left( d \right) = \frac { \sum _ { i = 1 } \sum _ { j = 1 } ^ { N } w _ { i j } \left( d \right) x _ { i } x _ { j } } { \sum _ { i = 1 } ^ { n } \sum _ { j = 1 } ^ { n } x _ { i } x _ { j } } , \quad j \text { not equal to } i .</LATEX> n (5)

863b | The G-statistic is a member of the class of linear permutation statistics, first introduced by Pitman (1937). Such statistics were first considered in a spatial context by Mantel (1967) and Cliff and Ord (1973), and developed as a general cross-product statistic by Hubert (1977 and 1979), and Hubert, Golledge, and Costanzo (1981).
fj24 | For equation (5),
uz3c | <LATEX>W = \sum _ { i = 1 } \sum _ { j = 1 } w _ { i j } \left( d \right) , j \text { not equal to } i</LATEX> so that
d5bi | <LATEX>E \left[ \mathrm { G } \left( d \right) \right] = \mathrm { W } / \left[ n \left( n - 1 \right) \right] .</LATEX> (6)
ba4l | The variance of <LATEX>G</LATEX> follows from Cliff and Ord (1973, pp. 70-71):
ffx8 | <LATEX>E \left( G ^ { 2 } \right) = \frac { 1 } { \left( m _ { 1 } ^ { 2 } - m _ { 2 } \right) ^ { 2 } n ^ { \left( 4 \right) } } \left[ B _ { 0 } m _ { 2 } ^ { 2 } + B _ { 1 } m _ { 4 } + B _ { 2 } m _ { 1 } ^ { 2 } m _ { 2 } + B _ { 3 } m _ { 1 } m _ { 3 } + B _ { 4 } m _ { 1 } ^ { 4 } \right.</LATEX> where <LATEX>m _ { j } = \sum _ { i = 1 } x _ { i } ^ { j } ,</LATEX> <LATEX>j = 1 , 2 , 3 , 4</LATEX> ,
s6su | and
y219 | <LATEX>n ^ { \left( r \right) } = n \left( n - 1 \right) \left( n - 2 \right) \ldots \left( n - r + 1 \right) .</LATEX> The coefficients, <LATEX>B ,</LATEX> are
06ht | <LATEX>B _ { 0 } = \left( n ^ { 2 } - 3 n + 3 \right) S _ { 1 } - n S _ { 2 } + 3 W ^ { 2 }</LATEX> <LATEX>B _ { 1 } = - \left[ \left( n ^ { 2 } - n \right) S _ { 1 } - 2 n S _ { 2 } + 3 W ^ { 2 } \right]</LATEX> <LATEX>B _ { 2 } = - \left[ 2 n S _ { 1 } - \left( n + 3 \right) S _ { 2 } + 6 W ^ { 2 } \right]</LATEX> <LATEX>B _ { 3 } = 4 \left( n - 1 \right) S _ { 1 } - 2 \left( n + 1 \right) S _ { 2 } + 8 W ^ { 2 }</LATEX> ;
v3r2 | <LATEX>B _ { 4 } = S _ { 1 } - S _ { 2 } + W ^ { 2 }</LATEX> and
nv42 | where <LATEX>S _ { 1 } = 1 / 2 \sum \sum \left( w _ { i j } + w _ { j i } \right) ^ { 2 } ,</LATEX> <LATEX>j</LATEX> not equal to <LATEX>i</LATEX> , i j
xags | <LATEX>S _ { 2 } = \Sigma _ { i } \left( w _ { i . } + w _ { . i } \right) ^ { 2 } ; \quad w _ { i . } = \Sigma _ { j } w _ { i j } ,</LATEX> and <LATEX>j</LATEX> not equal to <LATEX>i</LATEX> ;
jc47 | thus
ko3c | <LATEX>\mathrm { V a r } \left( G \right) = E \left( G ^ { 2 } \right) - \left\{ W / \left[ n \left( n - 1 \right) \right] \right\} ^ { 2 } .</LATEX> (7)
xek3 | THE <LATEX>G \left( d \right)</LATEX> STATISTIC AND MORAN'S I COMPARED
bbpr | The <LATEX>G \left( d \right)</LATEX> statistic measures overall concentration or lack of concentration of all pairs of <LATEX>\left( x _ { i } , x _ { i } \right)</LATEX> such that <LATEX>i</LATEX> and <LATEX>j</LATEX> are within <LATEX>d</LATEX> of each other. Following equation (5), one finds <LATEX>G \left( d \right)</LATEX> by taking the sum of the multiples of each <LATEX>x _ { i }</LATEX> with all <LATEX>x _ { j } s</LATEX> within <LATEX>d</LATEX> of all <LATEX>i</LATEX> as a proportion of the sum of all <LATEX>x _ { i } x _ { j } .</LATEX> Moran's <LATEX>I ,</LATEX> on the other hand, is often used to measure the correlation of each <LATEX>x _ { i }</LATEX> with all <LATEX>x _ { j } s</LATEX> within <LATEX>d</LATEX> of <LATEX>i</LATEX> and, therefore,
