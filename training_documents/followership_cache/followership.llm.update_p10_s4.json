        "content": "s2g2 | Language is important not only in terms of the words we use but also in terms of the script that they suggest. The words \"leader\" and \"follower\" bring to mind a common script in which the leader is in charge, saying, \"You do this, and you do that.\" Meanwhile, followers are imagined as inferior beings in need of the leader's direction, motivation, and protection. We need to rethink this outdated script. What societal purpose does it serve? Is it still functional in today's world? What personal purpose does it serve for the people who promulgate it or for the people who actually follow it? We need to ask ourselves whether we need a new script. Can we start to reframe the entire conversation in a new way? If so, what does the new script sound like? What words and imagery do we use to suggest either a more accurate or a more desirable relationship between followers and leaders?\nq1q2 | Courageous Conscience\ncb7r | Related to the issue of peer pressure discussed earlier is the responsibility that followers have to keep leaders and peers ethically and legally in check. Instead of viewing followers as the \"good soldiers\" who carry out commands dutifully, we need to view followers as the primary defenders against toxic leaders or dysfunctional organizations. The buck stops more with followers than leaders. In fact, they are often in a better position to see the day-to-day events or leader decisions that lead to disastrous consequences. However, our current script of followership does not include this responsibility in the role description. For the most part, society\n68xu | neither prepares nor expects followers to exercise what I label as the \"courageous conscience.\"\nhd35 | The ability to make ethical and legal judgments, to take proactive steps to promote ethical and legal activities, and then to stand up against unethical and illegal decisions and actions, is a crucial aspect of followership. Followers cannot abdicate their courageous conscience by outsourcing it to the leader. Rather, followers need to learn how to blow the whistle effectively, how to combat groupthink, how to avoid the dispersion of responsibility so often found in groups, and how to advance institutional integrity.\n2zpk | How do we make this happen? How do we help people be successful when they have to stand up? The answer has at least three parts: one, teaching people that the followership role includes the courageous conscience, thus not only legitimating this responsibility but also mandating it; two, helping followers find the personal courage to stand up, and providing the societal supports that encourage people to exercise their courageous conscience; and three, preparing followers so that when they do stand up, they are successful.\nepu7 | If all followers actively used their courageous conscience, we would likely have fewer toxic leaders who steer the organization down the path of organizational corruption or societal damage. This could go a long way in limiting the fallout of the world events I discussed earlier. To this end, I would like someone to develop an entire curriculum that brings the ethical, legal, and social science tools together to equip every person with a strong, active courageous conscience.\n7od1 | CONCLUSION\n0bqy | The field of followership is still in its infancy. It is rare that people get a chance to build and shape a new area of inquiry. This twenty-five-year journey has been a wonderful experience for me: when I started, I only wanted to put my stake in the ground, and now many people have joined the journey, taking it in new directions. I am confident that fellow travelers will generate their own ways to rethink the followership field and create novel research agendas. Collectively, we can grow the followership field so that it makes powerful contributions to society and to the individuals who make up society.\nb780 | Rethinking Followership",
