You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

51g2 | S = k(ln T + C) Writing C = - In(To) for some constant To, this gives S = k ln(T /T0) Dimensional analysis implies T0 must have units of temperature!
ekj5 | But what is this temperature T0? For that we must think harder.
0heu | The formula S = k(ln T + C) is a bit scary from the viewpoint of dimensional analysis. We usually avoid working with the logarithm of a dimensionful quantity, like ln T, because it transforms in a funny way when we change our units. But if we write C = - In To then we get S = kln(T/To), and we see the solution to our problem! If To has units of temperature, then T/To is dimensionless, so In(T/To) doesn't change at all when we change our units. In other words: now ln(T/T0) is dimensionless, so S = k ln(T/T0) has units of entropy as it should.
yh7j | So, the constant C must equal - In To for some temperature To that we can compute for any harmonic oscillator. What is it? We could just compute it. But it's more fun to use dimensonal analysis.
3ql4 | What could it depend on? Obviously the mass m, the spring constant k and Boltz- mann's constant k. But there's no way to form a quantity with units of temperature from just m, k and k. So we need an extra ingredient.
9rtl | And we've seen this already: to define the entropy of a probability distribution on the q, p plane and get something with the right units, we need a quantity with units of action! The obvious candidate is Planck's constant h, and this is actually right. The entropy we're after is given by an integral with respect to dp dq/h where h = h/2T. So the temperature To can depend on h as well as m, k and k.
wjx6 | We can compute a quantity with units of temperature from m, k, k and h. The frequency of our oscillator is w = k/m, and it's a famous fact that he has units of energy. k has units of energy/temperature ... so hw/k has units of temperature!
t62c | Thus, our temperature To must be hw/k times some dimensionless purely mathe- matical constant, which I'll call 1/a. a must be something like 7 or 2, or if we're really unlucky, e666 - though in practice we usually get numbers fairly close to 1, not huge or tiny numbers.
50qr | So, the entropy of a classical harmonic oscillator must be
2mku | S = kln(T/To) =kln(akT/hw).
apbe | This is far as I can get without breaking down and doing some real work. Later we will compute Q.
2wh5 | ENTROPY OF THE HARMONIC OSCILLATOR: 3
tjrm | We've seen a classical harmonic oscillator with frequency w has entropy
w9xo | S = kln(akT/hw) when it's in thermal equilibrium at temperature T.
utyz | Here k is Boltzmann's constant, h is Planck's constant,
tquj | and o is some dimensionless mathematical constant. We'll figure it out later.
oepx | Even though we don't know o, this formula is already very interesting! kT is known to be the typical energy scale of thermal fluctuations at temperature T. hw is the spacing between energy levels of a quantum harmonic oscillator with frequency w. The ratio kT/hw is therefore roughly the number of energy eigenstates in which we may find a quantum harmonic oscillator with high probability when it's at temperature T.
qt5u | Thus, S is roughly k times the logarithm of the number of states that we're likely to find a quantum harmonic oscillator in, when it's at temperature T. This may seem mysterious. After all, we weren't trying to do quantum mechanics, much less count quantum states. But there are other examples of this pattern, where the entropy of a classical system in thermal equilibrium at temperature T is roughly k times the logarithm of the number of quantum states that are accessible at temperature T.
a2kn | We'll learn a bit more about this later, when we relate entropy to something called the 'partition function', which can be understood as the 'number of acccessible states'. This viewpoint will also explain the constant Q. But now let's calculate this constant.

oh1c | A classical harmonic oscillator has energy
apax | p, q) = 2 + Kg2 2m
zc7j | where p is its momentum, q its position, m its mass and « its spring constant.
96pn | At temperature T, the probability density of its momentum and position is the Boltzmann distribution:
txea | e-BE(p,q) p(p,q) =
8oh3 | .00 e-BE(p,q) dp dq h
m27u | where ( = 1/kT, k is Boltzmann's constant, and h = 2Th is the original 'unreduced' Planck's constant.
s0b6 | The oscillator's entropy at temperature T is thus
ihlu | 00 p(p, q) In p(p, q) dp dq h
r3zr | S =- k -00/- 100
j6ku | Last time we found a formula for the entropy of a classical harmonic oscillator ... which includes a mysterious purely mathematical dimensionless constant Q. Now let's figure out a.
zt0d | We'll grit our teeth and actually do the integral needed to calculate the entropy-but only in one easy case! Combining this with our formula, we'll get a.
ej0q | First, recall the basics. The energy E(p, q) of our harmonic oscillator at momentum p and position q determines its Boltzmann distribution at temperature T, which I'll call p(p, q) now since the letter p is already being used. Integrating -pln p using the measure dp dq/h we get the Shannon entropy. In physics we multiply this by Boltzmann's constant k to get the Gibbs entropy.
dg44 | ENTROPY OF THE HARMONIC OSCILLATOR: 5
lhtj | We can choose units of length, time, mass and temperature to make a classical harmonic oscillator's mass m, its spring constant K, Boltzmann's constant k and Planck's constant h all equal 1.
ns07 | Then at T = 1 the Boltzmann distribution of the oscillator is
q8bx | e-(p2+q2)/2
lftq | p(p, q) = .00 ∞ e-(p2+q2)/2 dpdq = e-(p2+q2)/2
hyaf | so its entropy is S = - | | e- (p2 +2)/2 In (e- (p2+2) /2) dpdq -001-00
9etn | Let's do this integral!
2bic | Let's compute the Boltzmann distribution p(p, q) and the entropy S. To keep the formulas clean, we'll work in units where m = K = k = h =1, and compute everything at one special temperature: T = 1.
jras | In this setup h = 27, and
dwvf | e-BE(p,q) =e-(p2+q2)/2
ic87 | is a beautiful Gaussian with integral
bxpw | 00 e-(p2+q2)/2 = 27T.
4g09 | These two factors of 27 cancel when we compute the denominator of the probability distribution p(p, q):
txr8 | dpdq 2TT 2TT .= 1. =
rsup | Thus, we get simply
hk1c | p(p,q) =e-(p2+q2)/2
