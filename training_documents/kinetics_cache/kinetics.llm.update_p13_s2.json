Second, promoter architecture can be described by a multi-state model since a transcription process would involve many molecular steps. It is unclear whether the multi-state architecture is more descriptive than the two-state model. Determining the number of gene states and studying the effect on burst kinetics is a long-term effort. Third, our hierarchical model only considered self-regulatory feedback, the simplest feedback form. More complex regulatory forms may exist in gene-expression systems. However, since they reflect high-level structure regulation, more complex yet reasonable mathematical models and more powerful inference methods need to be developed for better studying transcriptional burst kinetics. Fourth, most of the traditional models of gene expression were based on the Markov hypothesis. In organisms, however, the processes of molecular synthesis may be non-Markovian, and increasing time-resolved data have verified the extensive existence of molecular memory. Therefore, it is necessary to extend Markov models to non-Markov ones. But this is a great challenge to numerical solutions and statistical inferences. Finally, we point out that choosing a suitable model involves trade-off problems since more complex models would bring less consensus on general principles of transcriptional bursting.\nhis3 | Finally, studying transcriptional burst kinetics may start with a data-driven approach as done in our statistical inference framework. Our predictions of burst kinetics using scRNA-seq data were based on the assumption that the abundances of mRNA and protein were highly dependent. Recently, more and more studies of sequencing methods have paid attention to measuring the profiles of multi-type molecules in single-cell levels, such as simultaneous quantification of intracellular mRNA and protein, which can better describe cell states. For feedback loop types our method predicted, we found that many genes have been confirmed by biological experiments. Moreover, the identification of feedback loops can be more convincing by using multimodal data combined with scRNA-seq such as ENCODE and some automated packages. In addition, time-resolved data can provide more information compared to static data. We believe that with the continuous progress in measurement technologies, time-resolved single-cell data will be primary means to study the transcription burst kinetics in the future. Meanwhile, spatial transcriptome multimodal data and chromatin structural data provided good opportunities for in-depth studies of burst kinetics. Analysis of those multimodal single-cell data or integrated data can help us discover more credible biological knowledge but would also bring challenges for developing statistical methods to infer dynamic molecular mechanisms masked in static single-cell data.\nm50z | DATA AVAILABILITY\nme84 | All the analysis results and inference code that support the findings of this study are provided through github dot com slash cellfate slash BurstFeedback or zenodo dot org slash record slash seven three seven one three one eight.\no56m | SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nslz6 | Supplementary Data are available at NAR Online.\n90k5 | Author contributions: J.
