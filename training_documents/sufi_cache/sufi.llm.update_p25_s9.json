No sooner had he pulled up one bucketful than he found himself compelled to draw another, and another, and this went on for an entire week.\n3txt | The water flooded his house, then that of the neighbours, and finally the whole town, almost causing it to collapse ...\nqe3d | Attaining Knowledge\nod26 | Q: How can I attain knowledge of myself? I look at organisations and institutions, such as schools or universities, or business enterprises or professions, and I can see that they have established reputations. They also have enrolment and recruitment, and they have objectives. For instance, if I become a politician I am aiming for cabinet rank; if I want to study medicine it is in order to become a practising doctor or a research worker or a teacher. When I approach Sufi ideas, whether through books or individuals, I find that a similar kind of coherence is not there: or if it is, I cannot find it. I often become confused, and I have met many other people who are also confused, who are trying the same thing. Because of this I also feel that an answer to this question would be of great value to many other people who believe that there must be truth and value in Sufi thought and activity, because it has continually produced great people, but that the 'way in' and the curricula are baffling.\nl4k6 | A: It is interesting, not as a lesson in what Sufis are like, or what the Sufi enterprise is about, to look at these words, for they display, very clearly, what people are like, and we will see in a moment, how easily one can answer them by using materials, analogies and ways of thought which they would have been able to use for themselves if they had really been as analytical and coherent as they imagine they are.\ny4a0 | First it must be said that it is precisely because someone thinks like this that he is baffled. He has arbitrarily selected parallels and assumptions, and seeks to apply them to us. Interestingly, he had misapplied them, with the result that he arrives at what he could even have subconsciously sought, confusion.\nbnif | One traditional way of answering this question would be to quote the proverb: However fast you run, or however skilfully, you can't run away from your own feet.\nq018 | We will go through the analogies, and show how they apply to\njbak | us just as much as to anyone or anything else cited.\ne9cp | First of all, it is not for us to satisfy each and every would-be student about Sufi applicability to himself and Sufic probity or otherwise. It is for him to satisfy himself; and he will probably use the same methods he uses when he applies to learn anything else. But he should remember that if he goes, for instance, to a school of medicine and asks: \"How do I know that you can teach me?' he will be shown the door. He is not eligible. Such an approach is neither correct behaviour nor indicative of a stage of intelligence in which one can be taught. There are plenty of people who do not adopt the attitude of an idiot, and it is the duty of the medical school to give its limited time to such people. It is someone else's task to do the more preliminary work with you. One function of the books already published is to provide this briefing.\n94lh | Secondly, the reputation of the Sufis is already well enough established, and continues in that role from a base of repute which they established even long before numerous contemporary institutions existed. Sufic continued flexibility, viability and effectiveness (if you must measure in this way) are themselves evidences of their value in terms of the levels on which such things are assessed in the familiar world.\njxk1 | The coexistence of genuine Sufic enterprises and imitation ones only parallels similar imitations of almost every other kind of institution in the world. It is no new thing, and it has virtually the same characteristics and origins.\nwgvf | Thirdly, the idea of 'enrolment and recruitment' naturally varies with the kind of institution. The enrolment and recruitment of, say, bank clerks differs from that of, say, soldiers. People may become bank clerks and find that they are not suited for banking life. They may become politicians and discover that they are suited to this life. They may enrol as deep-sea divers and discover that deep-sea diving is not what they thought it was, in spite of plenty of divers around, sufficient schools, and an abundance of literature on the subject. What are you seeking from Sufi studies or activity which differs from these things?\n3jlo | Fourthly, of course, there is the question which comes under the heading of objectives. Suppose you want to be a politician: no-\nldqe | body would say that you could become a Cabinet Minister before you were perhaps a leg-man for a minor parliamentary candidate, or an envelope-licker in Party HQ, or even a canvasser for an obscure Rural District Council Member. The objective, again, may be to be a Cabinet Minister or a Prime Minister. How many people who at the beginning of their political careers: (a) know what it is like to be a Prime Minister, even if they are aiming for it; (b) really will become a Prime Minister? In any case, the people who do attain such rank are the ones who obey the Chinese proverb 'The journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step'.\nqt5x | Fifthly, as to confusion: people frequently become confused either because they cannot understand the elementary steps they have to take, or because they invariably enjoy confusion, or for some other reason which they do not know. The origins of a state of confusion can often be discovered merely by transposing the problem into terms whose structure is more familiar, as I have just done.\ncc6l | Among the Sufis, as among those of other paths, it has always been required that the intending participant practise certain requirements to fit him or her for higher learning. In modern societies, equivalent and often exactly similar prerequisites are found. Because so many familiar institutions with clearly laid out requirements already exist in contemporary cultures, it should be easier, not more difficult, for people to understand, given real desire, the requirements. These include: humility, dedication, abstinence, restraint, obedience. Unless you exercise these 'virtues', you will get nowhere in banking, the Army, medicine, politics, human service or anywhere else in many forms of mundane endeavour. If, on the other hand, you want to escape these tiresome preliminaries and flee into Sufism, then we know what you are like, and we cannot talk to you at all. 'To say \"yes\" to the Sufi way is to say \"no\" to imagined escapes.'\nw8g7 | It is no accident that Sufis find that they can connect most constructively with people who are well integrated into the world, as well as having higher aims, and that those who adopt a sensible attitude towards society and life as generally known can usually absorb Sufi teachings very well indeed.\n0lyq | You started your question with the matter of the visibility of study institutions. But the world itself, as well as special attitudes, properly understood, constitute the Sufi school. Remember the words of Maghribi, who said to a monkish individual: 'What you are seeking in your retreat/I see clearly in every road and alley-way'.\nmk88 | It is no use adding external things, say observances - to the life of someone who is carrying on too many unproductive observances. It is hopeless to add ideas to minds already too full of ideas. Study institutions may become visible when the head is more emptied of imaginings.\nkft0 | SAADI AND THE MAN WITH A FULL HEAD",
