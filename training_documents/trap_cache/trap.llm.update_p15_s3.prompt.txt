You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

rut3 | because elites enjoy greater power and nonelites have less recourse for checking that power.40 In economic versions of such models, elites cre- ate extractive institutions to ensure their rents, even if these institutions slow growth for the economy as a whole.41 Although oversimplified, these models are useful in highlighting the pivotal role of domestic elite participation in potential upgrading coalitions and the ways in which elite privileges can discourage such engagement.
m3cp | One obstacle to such participation involves a form of entrenchment in which longer periods in MI status allow large firms and elite social groups to consolidate their positions in the economy and the polity.42 The domestic firms-mostly huge, conglomerated, family-owned busi- ness groups-that grew large in the late twentieth century were con- centrated in commodities (natural resources, basic metals, and other semiprocessed goods), regulated sectors (especially banking and utili- ties), natural oligopolies (such as cement and beer), and occasionally, low-tech manufacturing (having been boxed out of high-tech manufac- turing by MNCs). They were already very large and powerful coming into the twenty-first century.43 In contrast to business groups in countries that escaped the MI trap, these concentrated business groups have had little to gain from pushing for policies that would help their economies break out of the trap.44 They are entrenched in their own traditional business strategies and in politics and wield power to maintain institu- tions favorable to their existing businesses. 45
mq4s | Inequality also impedes upgrading policies and institutions through the more explicitly political mechanisms of clientelism and populism. Clientelism-exchanges of particularistic goods (patronage) between wealthy and poor or powerful and powerless-thrives under conditions of poverty and inequality.46 To the extent patronage runs through the public administration, it undermines bureaucratic capacity, encourages particularistic ties between state officials and private sector groups, and

a0a5 | diverts resources to unproductive spending. The overall result is that clientelism undercuts programmatic politics and thereby displaces up- grading goals from partisan and electoral politics.47 The phenomenon does, of course, also exist in LI countries, but the political effects in MI countries are more debilitating, as they fragment politics and reduce the possibility that upgrading coalitions will emerge.
gocl | Inequality also makes politics more prone to populism, understood here in economic terms as some form of personalistic leadership that addresses broad but unorganized discontent by undertaking unsustain- able redistribution through mechanisms like price controls, consump- tion subsidies, inflation, and exchange rate overvaluation.48 Among large MI countries, such distortions have recently been especially marked in Argentina, Thailand, and Venezuela. Recent cases vary, but economic populism encourages short-term, ad hoc policy-making, antagonizes significant portions of business, and weakens rather than builds insti- tutions. Moreover, at some point economic populism ends badly-in recession and crisis, which siphon off resources from policy priorities that could have been used to escape the MI trap. Populism, although not inevitable in MI countries, is more likely to occur there because it draws crucial support from the urban informal sector that grew large in the transition to MI status.
ob1z | INFORMALITY
m4cb | Following what is known as the "Lewis turning point," earlier devel- opers usually transited out of informality with the shift out of agri- culture; urban workers quickly became formal workers, whose rising wages stimulated investments in skills as the supply of surplus labor was exhausted.49 Historical estimates are hard to come by, but scattered evidence suggests informality was much less of a factor for earlier in- dustrializers as they transitioned to high income, in part because manu- facturing accounted for a larger share of the economy than it does in today's MI countries that are suffering premature deindustrialization.50 For European countries, the shadow economy was about 8 to 12 per-
m61y | cent in Germany in the late 1970s, 8 percent in Denmark in 1980, 3 to 6 percent in France in the late 1970s, 13 to 14 percent in Sweden in 1978, 10 to 27 percent in Spain in 1979-80, and 20 to 35 percent in Italy in 1979.51 The informal workforce in Korea was 7 percent in 1993.52
u2ob | Most MI countries have been waiting a long time for Lewis's turning point and are instead characterized by a massive and relatively stable shift out of rural informality into urban informality, sometimes abetted by inflows of migrant labor (see Table 4).53 The shadow economies of large MI countries are nearly double those of high-income countries. For a different measure, informal employment is even higher-44 per- cent-for our large MI countries.54 Informal workers are a heteroge- neous lot, but the vast majority of them labor in precarious low-skill, low-wage, low-productivity employment.55
2gnm | These high levels of informality are especially striking for having persisted despite growth and rising wages. In all nine large MI countries, the shadow economy actually increased from 1999 to 2007.56 Indeed, many of the sources economists identify as contributing to informal- ity-excessive labor-market regulation, outsourcing and contract work, weak enforcement capacity, and premature deindustrialization-are not moving in directions that would reduce informality in MI countries.57 Further, high levels of informality are correlated empirically with high levels of inequality,58 which as noted remain stubbornly high in large MI countries.
emgw | The informal-formal distinction constitutes a crucial cleavage within

5rcb | the labor force that involves, among other things, divergent policy in- terests.59 Because, for example, formal sector workers have longer job tenure and benefit from on-the-job training for specific skills, they have an interest in greater subsidies for in-firm training. By contrast, infor- mal workers, who shift jobs every few years, would prefer investment in vocational schools offering general training (Section IV examines interests in education). Frank-Borge Wietzke also emphasizes differing interests in labor-market policy.60 Outsiders with insecure work con- tracts prefer employment generating "active" labor-market policies, for example, public employment centers, labor-market training, and sub- sidized employment. Insiders focus on the security of their contracts, worker protection, and lower public spending on employment policies. Although the interest cleavages between formal and informal are often attenuated by movements of workers between sectors over time, it is nonetheless rare to see organized coalitions that incorporate both insid- ers and outsiders.61
524j | The electoral strategies of parties and politicians can deepen these labor- market cleavages and reinforce the divergence in preferences be- tween workers in the informal sector and workers in the formal sector. Some parties, for example, use segmented strategies by appealing to poor voters with clientelist, individual benefits, on the one hand, and to richer groups with programmatic appeals, on the other hand.62 In essence, this segmentation allows parties to ignore the programmatic interests of the poor. At a minimum, the strategy further fragments
