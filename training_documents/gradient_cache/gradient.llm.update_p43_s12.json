        "content": "sptg | Twenty-four\n2k40 | Those local second derivatives with respect to connection weights can be computed from local second derivatives with respect to the total input of the downstream unit\nkrk7 | Twenty-five\n4tyc | where x j is the state of unit j and the second derivative of the instantaneous loss function with respect to the total input to unit i (denoted a i). Interestingly, there is an efficient algorithm to compute those second derivatives which is very similar to the back-propagation procedure used to compute the first derivatives.\n2mjl | k second derivative plus f of i on. aEP\n6d9q | da squared equals f prime of a squared Z u k second derivative\nwsc1 | Twenty-six\nor3l | Unfortunately, using those derivatives leads to well-known problems associated with every Newton-like algorithm: these terms can be negative and can cause the gradient algorithm to move uphill instead of downhill. Therefore, our second approximation is a well-known trick called the Gauss-Newton approximation, which guarantees that the second derivative estimates are nonnegative. The Gauss-Newton approximation essentially ignores the nonlinearity of the estimated function (the N N, in our case), but not that of the loss function. The back propagation equation for Gauss-Newton approximations of the second derivatives is\nfbyc | second derivative equals f prime of a i. Uni k second derivative\nvceo | Twenty-seven\nkd78 | This is very similar to the formula for back propagating the first derivatives, except that the sigmoid's derivative and the weight values are squared. The right-hand side is a sum of products of nonnegative terms, therefore the left-hand side term is nonnegative.\n896u | The third approximation we make is that we do not run the average in twenty-four over the entire training set, but run it on a small subset of the training set instead. In addition the re-estimation does not need to be done often since the second-order properties of the error surface change rather slowly. In the experiments described in this paper, we re-estimate the h k k on five hundred patterns before each training pass through the training set. Since the size of the training set is sixty thousand, the additional cost of re-estimating the h k k is negligible. The estimates are not particularly sensitive to the particular subset of the training set used in the averaging. This seems to suggest that the second-order properties of the error surface are mainly determined by the structure of the network, rather than by the detailed statistics of the samples. This algorithm is particularly useful for shared-weight networks because the weight sharing creates ill conditioning of the error surface. Because of the sharing, one single parameter in the first few layers can have an enormous influence on the output. Consequently, the second derivative of the error with respect to this parameter may be very large, while it can be quite small for other parameters elsewhere in the network. The above algorithm compensates for that phenomenon.\no0si | Unlike most other second-order acceleration methods for back-propagation, the above method works in stochastic mode. It uses a diagonal approximation of the Hessian. Like the classical Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, it uses a \"safety\" factor u to prevent the step sizes from getting too large if the second derivative estimates are small. Hence the method is called the stochastic diagonal Levenberg-Marquardt method.\n1fx8 | ACKNOWLEDGMENT\ntfms | During his time at the Universit√© Pierre et Marie Curie, he proposed an early version of the back-propagation learning algorithm for neural networks. He joined the Department of Computer Science at the University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada, as a Research Associate in nineteen eighty-seven. In nineteen eighty-eight, he joined the Adaptive Systems Research Department at AT&T Bell Laboratories, Holmdel, New Jersey, where he worked on neural networks, machine learning, and handwriting recognition. In nineteen ninety-six he became Head of the Image Processing Services Research Department at AT&T Labs-Research, Red Bank, New Jersey. He has published over seventy technical papers and book chapters on neural networks, machine learning, pattern recognition, handwriting recognition, document understanding, image processing, very large scale integration design, and information theory. In addition to the above topics, his current interests include video-based user interfaces, image compression, and content-based indexing of multimedia material.\npfv5 | Yoshua Bengio received the B.Eng. degree in electrical engineering and the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in computer science from McGill University, Montreal, Canada, in nineteen eighty-six, nineteen eighty-eight, and nineteen ninety-one, respectively.",
