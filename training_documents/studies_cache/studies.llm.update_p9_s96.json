Although a number of reviews exploring\n877u | similar issues have recently been published, our analysis takes a particularly broad view, and specifically focuses on the methods used in SES field through a list of method \"categories\" or typologies, also assessing the extent to which they account for the underlying organizing principles of CAS. Here we discuss five broad conclusions from these results, and their implications for advancing SES research.\nrzhj | SES research is growing rapidly, but is still unevenly distributed Similar to other reviews on SES and related fields, we note significant increases in SES research over the last three decades, relative to the growth of scientific publications overall. SES research is clearly spanning the social and natural sciences in terms of the subject fields of the main journals in which this research is being published. The interdisciplinary journal Ecology and Society has become a dominant outlet, especially in recent years. Its dominance may be partly attributed to being one of the earliest open access, online-only journals in the SES field. More recently (and not reflected in our results because of the time span analyzed), a number of new journals have been established in the SES field, including People and Nature, Ecosystems and People, and One Earth. These provide further evidence of the maturing of the SES field, and potentially broadening the core set of journals publishing SES research. This maturation is perhaps also evident from the analysis of key SES research terms, which reveals a variety of common terms used to describe the interactive relationship between human societies and the natural environment, and appears to currently be consolidating around the terms \"nature society relations,\" \"social-ecological,\" and \"socio-ecological.\" Consolidation around key terms and concepts is central to the development of new research fields.\nbfax | SES research is dominated by a few institutions, notably Stockholm University in Sweden, Arizona State University\nf2y8 | United States of America, Wageningen University Netherlands and James Cook University Australia. The top twenty research institutions conducting SES are all based in the Global North, but SES being studied are more globally distributed. Nevertheless, there are still large parts of the Earth where relatively little SES is being undertaken. These include island regions such as the Caribbean, Indian Ocean Islands, Oceania, and inaccessible regions such as Antarctica. However, several populous regions are also little studied, including Central Africa, East Africa, West Africa, Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa. Several of these regions are undergoing rapid population growth and environmental change, experiencing pressing sustainability issues, and increasingly influencing regional and global changes in nature society relations. Better understanding context-specific SES dynamics in these regions to inform local and regional sustainability-related policies and actions is therefore a priority. Encouragingly, however, some of the places with the most SES research include Southern Africa and Asia, regions that are often not that well represented in environmental and social research more generally.\no7qm | SES research is dominated by place-based research at local to regional scales\nd52l | Our results point to the frequent use and development of new frameworks in SES research. Of all five thousand ninety-eight published papers assessed, fifteen point one eight percent were framework papers, and only one point three nine percent were purely theoretical. The bulk thirteen point seven nine percent proposed frameworks that\nqlbb | were applied to place-based systems, which may also suggest that the popularization of the term \"social-ecological\" systems was probably influenced by explicitly place-based frameworks. Although the high number of framework studies might be an indication that SES research is still in a developmental phase (counter to our earlier point), the strong place-based focus in the development of these frameworks suggests that customizing frameworks for new social-ecological contexts may be a characterizing feature of SES research. Many frameworks used in SES research are adaptations of three core frameworks; that of Ostrom twenty zero seven, twenty zero nine, Folke and Berkes nineteen ninety-eight and Berkes et al. twenty zero three, and the robustness framework Anderies twenty zero four, twenty zero seven. All three of these have an explicit CAS-based underpinning.\nnhsg | Although a CAS lens is by no means the only way to conceptualize SES, it has become the most popular. Our timeline analysis shows the most significant inflection point in the rise of SES research to lie between nineteen ninety-nine and two thousand, which coincides with the establishment of the Resilience Alliance in nineteen ninety-nine, and the initial publication of their affiliate journal Ecology and Society, which has published more SES research than any other journal. The Resilience Alliance in particular, and Ecology and Society by association, relies heavily on CAS and resilience as key guiding frameworks. Our results thus align with other studies that have highlighted the dominance of a CAS framing in influencing SES research. Given the theoretical maturity of CAS, we argue that a definition of SES as CAS, as attempted by Preiser et al., offers a pragmatic step toward a more universal definition of SES, often lamented as missing in the field. This is not to say, however, that CAS thinking is sufficient to support SES research, or that it excludes the use and integration of other frameworks.\nhy0l | SES research is centered on pressing sustainability issues\n4jmz | Key words identified in our study, similar to those found in related reviews, emphasize a focus of SES research on pressing sustainability issues such as climate change, biodiversity loss, livelihoods, poverty, policy, land use change, water, and social and environmental justice. Our change point analysis shows notable inflection points around nineteen ninety and two thousand, years that follow calls to address global Earth system changes and move toward \"sustainable development of the Biosphere.\" The smaller upsurge post-two thousand ten can likely be attributed to the integration of SES with broader sustainability initiatives, such as the Sustainable Development Goals (S D Gs), the Future Earth initiative and its core research programs such as the Program on Ecosystem Change and Society (P E C S), and the Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (I P B E S).\n```",
