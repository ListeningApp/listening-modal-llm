        "content": "1mvw | Unfortunately, the details of this reaction are not described. Really, two-body collisions in the conditions of high pressure inside the bubble, when SL originates, have much lower probability than three-body collisions like seven. The formation of triplet-excited water molecule is doubtful. In addition, the excitation energy of the H two O star molecule is seven point one electron volts; consequently, the emission at the transition nine has to be at one greater than one hundred seventy-five nanometers seven point one electron volts, and the shift of the maximum to two hundred eighty nanometers is difficult to explain. Thus, the position of the emission maxima at one less than three hundred nanometers in SL spectra cannot be explained by reactions nine and ten.\n6d4s | The transition from the excited B o r C states of water molecule to the quiescent state has to be accompanied by the vacuum-ultraviolet emission as the excitation energy of these states is approximately eight point three and ten electron volts, respectively. Really, the maximum in the SL spectra of noble gas-saturated water is situated at two hundred sixty-two, two hundred sixty-eight, two hundred fifty, and two hundred forty-two nanometers for He, Ar, Kr, and Xe, respectively, and the intensity of those bands increases in the same order. One could assume that SL is blackbody radiation; then both these experimental observations can easily be explained by the increase of temperatures inside the cavitation bubble in the order from He to Xe followed by the decrease of thermal conductivity in the same order. However, SL is not\nmqah | a blackbody radiation, the band at one less than three hundred nanometers is not formed by the noble gas emission, and a water molecule dissociates at high temperature, giving the excited OH two-two plus radical which emits at three hundred ten nanometers.\nxxr8 | Thus, it is impossible to explain the results obtained in this paper with the help of known data on the emission of excited water molecules or excited atoms of the inert gases. We propose that the bonds at less than three hundred nanometers in the spectra of water SL are due to the emission of excimer molecules like H two O star dot M.\nrl4j | It is well-known that noble gases can form complexes with water molecules and their stability increases in the order from argon to xenon. The pressures of dissociation of Ar, Kr, and Xe hydrates at zero degrees Celsius are one hundred five, fourteen point five, and one point four-five atmospheres, respectively. The increase of static pressure promotes the growth of clusters concentration. Thus, one can say that the clusters like m H two O r n M, where m, n equals one, two, three, etc., and M is the atom of a gas, can be formed after bubble collapse and cooling. On the other hand, at the process of bubble collapse, when temperature inside it is increasing, the formation of big clusters seems less probable. So we can only propose that the excimers and clusters like H two O star star Xe and H two O dot Xe can be formed at the conditions of a bubble collapse.\nvz32 | The dissociation energy D e of such van der Waals complexes is not high. For example, D c of Ar H two O molecule is around zero point zero two electron volts. Similar weak bounded complexes exist, and they are described in the literature.\nncb0 | The excimers are formed by three-body collisions:\n8mp0 | H two O star plus two M goes to H two O star dot M plus M \nxjyk | This process takes place at short distances between H two O star and M, where the collisional potential is higher or around thermal energy, because only in this case a third particle can remove the excess kinetic energy of H two O and M. The quiescent state for these excimers can be bounded\nmt0f | H two O star star M goes to H two O M plus h v\nawab | or unbounded\nixcc | H two O star M goes to H two O plus M plus h v\n8p6h | The distance between H two O star and M will increase in the order of Ar-, Kr-, and Xe-containing excimers following the increase in atomic shell size. Thus, the energy difference between excited and quiescent states will increase, but the wavelength of emission will decrease in the same order, which was detected in the experiments. A similar relationship was revealed in the order of weakly bounded excimers KrXeF star, KrXeCl star, KrXeBr star, and KrXeI star.\npmgl | Note that the formation of excimers like H two O star dot N two and H two O star dot O two inside the cavitation bubble is also possible as the corresponding clusters exist. Probably, the band discovered around two hundred thirty nanometers originates from these species.\n90no | Formed as a result of reaction one, the excited water molecule can react by processes three, four, and eleven or with the unexcited water molecules, the concentration of which inside the cavitation bubble is high enough. In the last case the energy can transform very effectively (\"resonant quenching\"). In addition, water molecules quench the excited states of hydroxyl radical.\njt0y | OH star goes to OH plus H two O plus q \nqb7o | Thus, the total scheme simplified of course of chemical reactions inside the cavitation bubble, which lead to SL, in the presence of noble gas can be presented as follows:\noae5 | Spectra of Water Sonoluminescence",
