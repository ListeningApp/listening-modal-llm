You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

9own | Several interesting and important findings emerge from Figures 4 and 5. First, the his- tograms show quite clearly that lots sold by Blas Chapa were much cheaper than those sold by Elías López; indeed, they were under

meyw | all means). Quite how Elías López managed to sell lots at much higher prices is hard to
2e62 | 2638
75y3 | explain, but the fact that he did offer formal Contracts for Deed (unlike Blas' preference for more informal receipts) and the fact that he had overall control of the development process in two distant settlements quite re- mote from Las Lomas where Blas Chapa had his base, may have been two key factors. Overall, it looks as though Elías López was the more business-oriented and profit-seek- ing of the two developers and this concurs with the fact that, unlike for Blas Chapa, the residents never held him in much affection. His recent death-if not celebrated-went relatively unmourned by most, as the focus group discussions revealed.
s2g2 | Another feature suggesting that it is the development process more than location that shapes colonia prices is the fact that the trimmed mean purchase price of lots varies significantly by period (Table 4, col. 2). Lots sold during the early 1990s were consider- ably more expensive than those sold during the 1980s and were even higher than those that have come on line since 1995. This also suggests some differential price setting by certain actors-the developers, in this case. While both men were actively selling lots throughout the two decades, the bulk of Elias Lopez' developments were in the late 1980s to mid 1990s, so to the extent that he
q1q2 | and others were charging higher rates at this time, so the overall curve of land price changes could also be expected to rise in those years. As Figure 5 shows, Blas Chapa regularly 'undersold' lots during that period (his price curve actually declines), appar- ently only catching on to the opportunity of charging higher and more competitive prices in 1994. Interestingly, Blas must have known that he could have charged more for lots in the developments that he controlled, since the joint sales that he and Elías under- took together were usually at the higher rate (with some notable peaks and troughs, see Figure 5). Thus, to the extent that different developers are engaging in differential price- setting procedures at different periods, the overall price curve will also reflect their operations. In part, therefore, the upward price trends that we have observed, es- pecially in the 1990-95 period, at least in part reflects the impact that Elías López and others had in driving-up prices, rather than signifying an overall market change. Had it not been for Blas Chapa's continued activity of selling lots at lower prices, the increase would probably have been even more significant.

b780 | come (irregular) settlements that land prices are often 'socially determined', rather than being shaped primarily by more orthodox and conventional factors such as location, scarcity, amenity, etc. Future studies of land price changes in Texas colonias should ana- lyse carefully the role that developers play in setting prices and, in those cities where there are several different developers, it will be important to disaggregate the extent to which they work individually or in concert with one another. In Rio Grande City, Blas Chapa's somewhat aberrant (non-market) behaviour had a significant impact in offering lots at sharply different (lower) prices from those of his competitor developers. However, now that the developers' influence has been re- moved, we may expect other land market factors such as location, level of services, and physical characteristics to come more to the foreground and the pricing of lots in colonias will more closely reflect orthodox market factors, displacing the 'aberrations' borne of personal relations between devel- oper and clients that we have described here.
ccmb | Colonia Property: a Good Investment?
ma93 | As well as asking people how much they paid for their lots, we also asked them to estimate the value of their lots-either their own, or those derived from recent sales that they knew about. Table 3 shows the resi- dents' estimated lot values in 2002. Looking over the data in Table 3 (col. 2, row 7), we see that a median lot cost was $4070 or 0.78¢ per square foot of land in 2002 prices. Inflating the 1983 values and trimmed mean of 0.50¢ (Table 4, col. 3) to 2003 values gives us a lot cost today of around $4250 which is the figure we use as our comparator to estimated current values in Table 3. Inter- estingly, however, estimates made locally by the residents themselves are considerably higher-a median of $6000 as estimated by 51 (valid case) respondents. While this varies somewhat between settlements (Table 3), the $6000 lot sale value is not unreasonable or inflated.13
c6hh | Adopting a $6000 estimated lot value as
y7ea | the comparator, then the total gain in 2002 values would come out at between $1500 and $2000 per lot, although this return on the investment will depend heavily the period in which the householder bought the lot. Taking the data in Table 4 above, an individual buying a regular-sized lot at 36¢ per square foot would, in real terms, have made around $1350 on the investment assuming that upon resale the vendor was able to get the average increased value recorded across the settle- ments-$4250 (Table 3) in 2002. That same householder would earn a considerably higher gain of $2850 if, as respondents sug- gested, lots were selling for $6000. Calculat- ing these capital gains in terms of percentage annual yield of these two estimates over a 17-year period (for someone buying in 1985) comes out at 2.1 per cent and 5.3 per cent respectively. If we extrapolate the average purchase price of the next cohort of buyers (1990-94) at 54¢ per square foot (Table 4 above) and similarly compare the net return in real terms, then someone buying in 1993 would have experienced an overall loss of 1 per cent (on a $4250 valuation) and a gain of 2.7 per cent per annum on a contemporary $6000 resale.
nav4 | What this tells us is that, unless lots are selling today for $6000 or more, people would not be making any significant gains on their investment and some would even be losing value in real-price terms. However, if a $6000 resale price was realised in the market in 2002, then those lot vendors would have made a profit of something in the order of $1250-2000-a sizeable equity gain for most people. But whether they can actually get that amount in the market-place is an- other matter. Assuming that they can, and depending upon when they bought, the gains range from 25-100 per cent in equity value.
gem8 | We also asked respondents to estimate the value of their properties (i.e. the lot and dwelling combined). Measured against what people now self-assess their property's worth, we see a substantial development of equity in Rio Grande City colonias. Some 82 respondents were able to estimate their own property's worth, with a median value of
e8nr | $30 000 (varying between $40 000 for B & E and $20 000 in for Mike's; see Table 3). Not surprisingly, these higher values are gener- ated among those who bought their lots a longer time ago: those buying their lots be- fore 1989 valued their property at $35 000, whilst those purchasing since 1995 valued at less than half that amount-at $14 500.13 Al- though these data are hypothetical self-as- sessments and are, perhaps, somewhat inflated coming out as they do at an overall average of $30 000, we believe that they are probably quite close to reflecting the cumu- lative costs of land purchase and housing improvements that many people have made, in particular those related to building or plac- ing a dwelling on the lot.14
k78w | However, as we have underscored, esti- mating the current value or worth of one's property and actually getting that on the open market are very different matters. In Starr County colonias today, it is even more difficult to sell a lot with a dwelling on it than it is to traspasar a vacant lot. The reasons for this are actually quite obvious: there are very few potential buyers who would be willing or able to pay such a (rela- tively) high price on the open market. Thus, there is no effective demand, but assuming that such a sale could be realised-either now or in the future-then colonia popula- tions would be moving from being equity- poor, to a position of being able to make a relatively sizeable net gain. Currently, how- ever, given the real difficulty in realising those gains, and as long as the land market is 'stunted' with little or no effective demand for purchase at the $30 000-40 000 level, we are obliged to conclude that for colonia resi- dents today it is the use value rather than exchange value that remains paramount. For many colonia residents this is not a problem, unless they are motivated or obliged to sell. But theoretically it is important insofar as low-income minority populations (in this case Hispanics) are less likely to be success- ful in building real wealth than better-off Whites, accentuating social stratification and segmentation akin to the arguments of William Julius Wilson (1999). Investing in
g9du | 2641
f682 | low-income real estate is not a particularly good investment deal for the very low-in- come segment of the market-a point that confirms the finding of a broader colonias study in Texas (Ward et al., 2000, p. 112). Nevertheless, one must also recognise that it is probably the only arena in which low-in- come people in Starr County can invest and hope to gain from their 'sweat' equity.
li1k | Conclusions: Comparing Informal Hous- ing Market Operations in the US and Else- where
pbea | This paper has argued that, for Texas colo- nias and low-income sub-divisions, the rate at which land is valorised is relatively mod- est and that the provision of formal property titles as part of a policy to 'regularise' clouded land titles appears to have little or no direct influence upon market performance or upon land prices. Instead, it is sweat equity by the people themselves, along with housing improvement, that raises the property value and which gives rise to some equity creation and to (rather modest) potential wealth cre- ation. But in Texas and elsewhere in the US, an overarching problem remains: namely, the low viability of the property (sales) market, such that unless the market is 'primed' to allow for greater mobility and sales, then there is little prospect that low-income (colo- nia) residents will be able to benefit financially from home-ownership, and cer- tainly not to anything like the same extent experienced by middle- and upper-income groups. Despite these modest gains and eq- uity growth through land acquisition and par- ticipation in colonia housing markets, the higher gains accruing to the formal middle and higher ends of the property market are leading to greater, not lesser, social segmen- tation between those income-groups and the poor. We recognise that the 'bootstraps' ap- proach and the self-managed opportunities for home-ownership in colonias and similar sub-divisions in the US do offer important positive outcomes as place of residence as well as providing a mechanism for saving and for creating equity. This is particularly
ccpt | 2642
0fpw | true if one compares peri-urban colonia own- ers with their equity-poor renter and inner- city peers. But there also seems little doubt that the formal land and property markets are much more favourable to middle-income America, for whom homesteading generates better medium- and long-term growth in eq- uity.
dqn8 | In this article, we have observed that infor- mal colonia land markets function poorly and that there is evidence for only very mod- est increases in real land values from one decade to the next. In essence, real land values appear to be 'flat' over time. Nor does intervention to provide clear title to lot own- ers appear to make much difference, al- though it is arguably still too soon to use the data to hand to gauge accurately the impact of CRG's intervention in the colonias outside Rio Grande City. When it comes to informal colonia property markets, the level of servic- ing provision and relative location are not good explanatory variables of land price dif- ferentials either. Instead, our data suggest that it is the price-setting behaviour by land developers and supply-side variables that best explain land prices and land price changes over time. This is an important finding and suggests that more orthodox ex- planations and theory about land pricing do not work well at the lower and informal end of the market, raising caveats about the ver- acity of de Soto-type arguments of land mar- ket behaviour and regularisation. 'Social' explanations of price setting such as those outlined here corroborate findings elsewhere (Jones et al., 1993; Varley, 2002) and further emphasise the functionality of informality in providing access to land for low-income self- build or self-managed housing. In addition to these 'social' variables, lot affordability to the very poor is achieved through the nature of supply by three principal mechanisms: first, by offering poor-quality land without services; secondly, by lowering front-end transaction costs through informal vendor financing and through informal contractual arrangements; and, thirdly, by reducing the size of lots to a bare minimum such that the overall lot price is just within the reach of
cop0 | very low-income buyers. Average colonia lot prices in Rio Grande City and Starr County are generally lower than in many other bor- der counties, but the unit price per square foot is about the same, the lower prices in Rio Grande City coming through smaller lot size.
