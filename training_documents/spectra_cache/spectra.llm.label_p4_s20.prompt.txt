You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

pk06 | Sonoluminescence occurs at the final stage of a cavitation bubble compression, with the high pressure inside it. Thus, one can suppose the formation of excimer molecules like (M-OH)*, <LATEX>\mathrm { M } _ { 2 } ^ { * } ,</LATEX> and (M.H2O) *.

caos | Thus, these particles can contribute to the light emission of the spectra of water sonoluminescence.

5z6q | Consider the possible addition to the SL spectra of the excited atoms and molecules of noble gases. The M2* excimers radiate in broad-band emission with the maximum in the ultraviolet field. This maximum shifts to a short-wave region with the decrease in atomic weight of a gas. For example, the maximum is situated at 170 nm for xenon and at 126 nm for argon.35 The bands at 195 nm (Ar), 220 nm (Kr), and 300 nm (Xe) originate from the reaction of ion-electron recombination like

This supports, in our mind, the opinion that electrical phenomena are not major in the mechanism of a cavitation light emission.
hntf | The continuum in the near-ultraviolet field with the maximum at 210 nm (Ar) or 270 nm <LATEX>\left( K r \right)</LATEX> is formed by the transitions36
99fo | <LATEX>X _ { 2 } * * = X _ { 2 } * + h v</LATEX> (8)
y5r7 | Note that the maximum of the emission shifts to a longer wave region with the increase in atomic weight of noble gas. Thus, it is impossible to explain the results of Figure 1 by reaction 8 as we observed an opposite dependence: the maxima in the spectra are shifted to the short-wave field with the increase in atomic weight of noble gas (Figure 1).
lrry | The lines of noble gas in the spectra of SL were not also discovered before.13,15,16 This can be a consequence of two causes. First, the excitation energy of noble gases is higher than that one of water; thus, the temperature inside the cavitation bubble is not high enough for the formation of excited molecules or atoms of noble gases. Second, water molecules quench effectively the excited states of noble gas atoms.37
hvhm | Thus, the continuum in the spectra is formed by fast transition <LATEX>\left( \approx 1 0 ^ { - 1 2 } s ^ { 3 2 } \right)</LATEX> <LATEX>\widetilde { \mathrm { C } } ^ { 1 } \mathrm { B } _ { 1 } \twoheadrightarrow \widetilde { \mathrm { A } } ^ { 1 } \mathrm { B } _ { 1 }</LATEX> (reaction 4b) and by the recom- <LATEX>b i n a t i o n \left( 7 \right) .</LATEX> Note that the vibrational excited water molecules can also be formed by reaction 1.
863b | It is still not clear what kind of species emits the light at wavelengths below 310 nm. Sehgal et al.15 believe that this emission occurs by the transition
fj24 | <LATEX>H _ { 2 } O ^ { * } \left( { } ^ { 3 } B _ { 1 } \right) \rightarrow H _ { 2 } O \left( { } ^ { 1 } A _ { 1 } \right)</LATEX> (9)
uz3c | In addition, they write that " ... The short wavelength cutoff at <LATEX>2 3 5 - 2 4 5</LATEX> nm or 113-117 kkal/mole gives the heat of reaction <LATEX>H _ { 2 } O \rightarrow H + O H</LATEX> (all in the ground state) at 0 K in good agreement with the thermal value of 119 kkal/mole".15 Prob- ably, authors of that paper assumed that the emission originates by two-body collision with the radiative stabilization of the product:
d5bi | <LATEX>H + O H \rightarrow H _ { 2 } O ^ { * } \rightarrow H _ { 2 } O + h v</LATEX> (10)
ba4l | Unfortunately, the details of this reaction are not described. Really, two-body collisions in the conditions of high pressure inside the bubble, when SL originates, have much lower probability than three-body collisions like (7). The formation of triplet-excited water molecule is doubtful (see above). In addition, the excitation energy of the <LATEX>H _ { 2 } O ^ { * } \left( { } ^ { 3 } B _ { L } \right)</LATEX> molecule is 7.1 eV;38 consequently, the emission at the transition (9) has to be at <LATEX>1 > 1 7 5 \quad n m</LATEX> (7.1 eV), and the shift of the maximum to 280 <LATEX>n m ^ { 1 5 }</LATEX> is difficult to explain. Thus, the position of the emission maxima at <LATEX>1 < 3 0 0 \quad n m</LATEX> in SL spectra (Figure 1) cannot be explained by reactions 9 and 10.
ffx8 | The transition from the excited <LATEX>\widetilde { \mathrm { B } } \mathrm { o r } \widetilde { \mathrm { C } }</LATEX> states of water molecule to the quiescent state has to be accompanied by the vacuum-ultraviolet emission as the excitation energy of these states is ~8.3 and 10 eV, respectively.32 Really, the maximum in the SL spectra of noble gas-saturated water is situated at 262, 268, 250, and 242 nm for <LATEX>\mathrm { H e } _ { * } \mathrm { A r } ,</LATEX> Kr, and Xe, respectively, and the intensity of those bands increases in the same order (Figure 1). One could assume that SL is blackbody radiation; then both these experimental observations can easily be explained by the increase of temperatures inside the cavitation bubble in the order from He to Xe followed by the decrease of thermal conductivity in the same order.39 However, SL is not
s6su | Didenko and Pugach
y219 | a blackbody radiation, the band at <LATEX>1 < 3 0 0 \quad n m</LATEX> is not formed by the noble gas emission (see above), and a water molecule dissociates at high temperature, giving the excited OH*(22+) radical which emits at 310 nm.
06ht | Thus, it is impossible to explain the results obtained in this paper with the help of known data on the emission of excited water molecules or excited atoms of the inert gases. We propose that the bonds at <LATEX>< 3 0 0</LATEX> nm in the spectra of water SL are due to the emission of excimer molecules like H2O *. M.
v3r2 | It is well-known that noble gases can form complexes with water molecules and their stability increases in the order from argon to xenon.40 The pressures of dissociation of Ar, Kr, and Xe hydrates at 0 ℃ are 105, 14.5, and 1.45 atm, respectively. The increase of static pressure promotes the growth of clusters concentration.41 Thus, one can say that the clusters like <LATEX>m H _ { 2 } O r n M ,</LATEX> where <LATEX>m ,</LATEX> <LATEX>n = 1 , 2 , 3 ,</LATEX> etc., and <LATEX>M</LATEX> is the atom of a gas, can be formed after bubble collapse and cooling. On the other hand, at the process of bubble collapse, when temperature inside it is increasing, the formation of big clusters seems less probable. So we can only propose that the excimers and clusters like <LATEX>H _ { 2 } O ^ { * * } X e</LATEX> and H2O.Xe can be formed at the conditions of a bubble collapse.
nv42 | The dissociation energy <LATEX>D _ { e }</LATEX> of such van der Waals complexes is not high. For example, <LATEX>D _ { c }</LATEX> of <LATEX>A r H _ { 2 } O</LATEX> molecule is around 0.02 eV.42 Similar weak bounded complexes exist, and they are described in the literature (see review in ref 43).
xags | The excimers are formed by three-body collisions:
jc47 | <LATEX>H _ { 2 } O ^ { * } + 2 M \rightarrow H _ { 2 } O ^ { * } \cdot M + M</LATEX> (11)
ko3c | This process takes place at short distances between <LATEX>H _ { 2 } O ^ { * }</LATEX> and <LATEX>\mathrm { M } ,</LATEX> where the collisional potential is higher or around thermal energy, because only in this case a third particle can remove the excess kinetic energy of <LATEX>H _ { 2 } O</LATEX> and <LATEX>M . 4 3</LATEX> The quiescent state for for these excimers can be bounded
xek3 | <LATEX>H _ { 2 } O ^ { * * } M \rightarrow H _ { 2 } O M + h v</LATEX> (12)
bbpr | or unbounded
5zyf | <LATEX>H _ { 2 } O ^ { * } M \rightarrow H _ { 2 } O + M + h v</LATEX> (13)
9own | The distance between H2O* and <LATEX>M</LATEX> will increase in the order of Ar-, Kr-, and Xe-containing excimers following the increase in atomic shell size. Thus, the energy difference between excited and quiescent states will increase, but the wavelength of emission will decrease in the same order, which was detected in the experiments (Figure 1). A similar relationship was revealed in the order of weakly bounded excimers KrXeF*, KrXeCI*, KrXeBr*, and KrXeI* 43
bqfb | Note that the formation of excimers like H2O *. N2 and <LATEX>H _ { 2 } O ^ { * } \cdot O _ { 2 }</LATEX> inside the cavitation bubble is also possible as the corresponding clusters exist.40,41 Probably, the band discovered in refs 6 and 7 around 230 nm originates from these species.
wwdt | Formed as a result of reaction 1, the excited water molecule can react by processes 3, 4, and 11 or with the unexcited water molecules, the concentration of which inside the cavitation bubble is high enough (see above). In the last case the energy can transform very effectively ("resonant quenching"). In addition, water molecules quench the excited states of hydroxyl radical37
mn1r | <LATEX>O H ^ { * } \left( ^ { 2 } \Sigma ^ { + } \right) + H _ { 2 } O \rightarrow O H \left( ^ { 2 } T I \right) + H _ { 2 } O + q</LATEX> (14)
5vqw | Thus, the total scheme (simplified of course) of chemical reactions inside the cavitation bubble, which lead to SL, in the presence of noble gas can be presented as follows:
meyw | Spectra of Water Sonoluminescence
2e62 | It is necessary to include also in this scheme reactions 5-8 and 14. It is seen from scheme 15 that the rate of luminescence quenching of H2O* and OH* species increases with the increase of water molecules concentration. This diminishes the total SL light emission and changes the spectra: the intensity of a short- wave part of the spectrum decreases more significantly as the "resonant quenching" is usually more effective. The difference in the spectra of water SL at high and low frequency is explained by SL quenching.16
