You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).

Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

cw76 | A therapeutic mode is a specific way of relating to a client. Six therapeutic modes have been identified in pre- vious work as occurring with a high level of frequency in occupational therapy practice relationships (Taylor, 2008). In this chapter, each of these six modes is described, and examples are provided to illustrate the multiple ways in which the primary modes can be combined and utilized during therapeutic interactions with clients. Practical applications of each mode for specific client character- istics and interpersonal events are discussed. Moreover, the chapter provides a rationale for the importance of the modes to the interpersonal reasoning process within the Intentional Relationship Model (IRM).

zh6q | adaptive individuals utilize a wide range of natural inter- personal strategies to adapt to the social demands of liv- ing (Beck, Freeman, & Davis, 2004). Examples of these strategies are empathy, compassion, hopefulness, altru- ism, kindness, assertiveness, competitiveness, deference, dominance, passivity, resistance, avoidance, emotionality, restraint, power, aggression, suspiciousness, emotional disengagement, and isolative behavior.
kp04 | Highly adaptive individuals are able to draw upon these and other strategies in an ever-changing and flex- ible manner in an attempt to adapt to the social demands of life (Beck et al, 2004). For example, a woman who is otherwise outgoing and gregarious at parties may signifi- cantly limit the extent to which she talks and socializes at a funeral if the social atmosphere is such that it requires silence and solemnity.
3e8r | By contrast, individuals who are not as interper- sonally adaptive tend to overutilize a small set of interpersonal strategies in inflexible, maladaptive, or com- pulsive ways (Beck et al, 2004). For example, an individ- ual whose primary objectives in relating to others involve self-preservation, resource acquisition, and a desire for power concerning others may consistently come across as confident, charming, competitive, and, at times, dominant, even when the situation requires humility and deference.
8g7g | mutually supportive behaviors. If the previously described individual is unable to demonstrate other characteristics necessary for collaborative activities, such as deference, thoughtfulness, kindness, and empathy, negative conse- quences are likely to result when these characteristics are needed. For example, an individual with a more fixed style may become emotionally fatigued, may struggle to move into alternative roles within the group, or may even act to interfere with someone else's attempt to move into a position of power. Others in the group may grow fearful or resentful if they are not able to witness this person's humil- ity, vulnerability, or attempts to share and be supportive.
5j4f | An individual with a greater capacity to draw on a wider range of characteristics is better able to establish appropriate relationships in both social situations. Thus, although our interpersonal behavior is relatively stable, we function best when we utilize interpersonal strategies in a flexible way and adapt to a wide range of individuals in a variety of social situations.
4xe7 | Interpersonal Behavior and Therapeutic Modes
pg4b | Therapists' interpersonal behaviors are reflected in:
b0d0 | Their fundamental motivation to serve others
d7eu | Their preferred approach to serving
xndr | The values they hold while serving
m6hi | The way in which therapists interact in their personal lives (outside of therapy) may also be reflected in the specific ways in which they behave and interact with their clients during therapy (i.e., therapeutic modes). Chapter 3 noted that therapeutic communication is optimal when therapists draw on a variety of modes consciously and flexibly. This has several implications. First, therapists should develop an awareness of their natural modes (i.e., the ones that flow from their interpersonal behavior in their daily personal lives). Second, they should develop the self-discipline to use these modes in response to client needs rather than in response to their own internal comfort levels. Third, ther- apists should be aware of the limits of the modes they use and, in some instances, develop the capacity to use modes beyond those that come naturally (Fig. 4.2).

1ocm | The idea that a therapist merely needs to select the correct mode to produce a desirable outcome carries an
527v | the same mode applied to similar situations may produce two opposing reactions in two different clients. A client's reactions are less a function of the mode choice and more a function of the interpersonal characteristics and imme- diate needs of the client. The case example at the begin- ning of this chapter illustrates this point with respect to the instructing mode. When Kamisha explained why she was asking Margarita questions about her daily occupa- tions and roles, Margarita's daughter reacted negatively, whereas Margarita appeared to accept the explanation as being valid. It is important to keep in mind that modes are perceived, relativistic, and subjective. As such, they are best interpreted through the mind's eye of the client. Rather than the mode itself, the client's interpretation and experi- ence of the mode is what determines which mode is most desirable at any given time.
lrri | Carrying this point a step further, it is even possible that the same mode applied to similar situations may produce vastly different reactions in the same client. For example, when Rigel used the instructing mode to ed- ucate Mr. Johnson about the assessment he was using, Mr. Johnson's nonverbal cues revealed that he was not interested (refer to the case example in Chapter 1). How- ever, when Rigel used the same mode to explain the con- cept of brain plasticity as justification for why his early engagement in therapy is likely to facilitate functional improvement, Mr. Johnson's body language became more positive. Ultimately, he invites Rigel to return to work with him on the following day.
