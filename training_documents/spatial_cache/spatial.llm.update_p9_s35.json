Neither statistic can differentiate between a random pattern and one with little spatial variation. Contributions to G of d are large only when the product x sub I x sub I is large, whereas contributions to I of d are large when x sub I minus M x sub J minus M is large. It should be noted that the distribution is nowhere near normal in this case. A\n5bq3 | EXAMPLE SIX\nezla | One equals negative zero point seven eight four three, V a r of I equals zero point zero one zero eight nine seven, Z of I equals negative seven point three one seven seven. When A equals two M and B equals zero,\nrsbu | The juxtaposition of high values next to lows provides the high negative covariance needed for the strong negative spatial autocorrelation Z of I, but it is the multiplicative effect of high values near lows that has the negative effect on\nmagd | Z of G. Table two gives some idea of the values of Z of G and Z of I under various circumstances. The differences result from each statistic's structure. As shown in the examples above, if high values within d of other high values dominate the pattern, then the summation of the products of neighboring values is high, with resulting high positive Z of G values. If low values within d of low values dominate, then the sum of the product of the xs is low resulting in strong negative Z of G values. In the Moran's case, both when high values are within d of other high values and low values are within d of other low values, positive covariance is high, with resulting high Z of I values.\ntb74 | Any test for spatial association should use both types of statistics. Sums of products and covariances are two different aspects of pattern. Both reflect the dependence structure in spatial patterns. The I bar of d statistic has its peculiar weakness in not being able to discriminate between patterns that have high values dominant within d or low values dominant. Both statistics have difficulty discerning a random pattern from one in which there is little deviation from the mean.\n8l69 | If a study requires that I of d or G of d values be traced over time, there are advantages to using both statistics to explore the processes thought to be responsible for changes in association among regions. If data values increase or decrease at the same rate, that is, if they increase or decrease in proportion to their already existing size, Moran's I changes while G of d remains the same. On the other hand, if all x values increase or decrease by the same amount, G of d changes but I of d remains the same.\n1jyv | It must be remembered that G of d is based on a variable that is positive and has a natural origin. Thus, for example, it is inappropriate to use G of d to study residuals from regression. Also, for both I of d and G of d one must recognize that transformations of the variable X result in different values for the test statistic. As has\nolce | been mentioned above, conditions may arise when d is so small or large that tests based on the normal approximation are inappropriate.\nerx1 | EMPIRICAL EXAMPLES",
