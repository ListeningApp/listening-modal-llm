You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

8r5j | ABSTRACT
2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

1wj6 | Street-level Bureaucrats as Policymakers in the Implementation of New Technologies
936l | Introduction
06yq | New technologies provide an important answer to the challenges, such as limiting resources, inherited old service models, and personalization coupled to equity issues unmet in one-size-fits-all service models, public sector organizations are facing (Haug, Dan & Mergel, 2023; Kinder & Stenvall, 2022). Technologies might, for instance, shape public services making them more sustainable and inclusive (see, Eriksson, 2022; Perikangas & Tuurnas, 2023). Overall, technological transformation is 'concerned with the changes digital technologies can, for instance, bring about in organizations' model, products or organizational structures' (Nadkarni & Prugl 2021; Hess et al. 2016). In particular, the challenge is how to integrate technology with the work and actions of frontline professionals, here, street level bureaucrats, in a meaningful and effective way (Buffat, 2015; Busch & Henriksen, 2018; Høybye-Mortensen 2019; Kuoppakangas et all. 2023).
dpv6 | The study field of street-level bureaucracy, e-government, ICT and new technologies has also focused on the consequences of technological developments for discretion, legitimacy and the ethics of street-level bureaucrats (later, SLBs) (Bovens & Zouridis, 2002). Buffat, 2015; Busch & Henrikssen, 2018; For instance, Buffat (2015) offers an extensive summary of e-government and SLB as curtailment and enablement theses. Her study shows that e-government (and overall, ICT) does not have negative or positive consequences for SLB per se, but the outcomes depend on context and implementation. This study contributes to the street-level bureaucracy literature specifically from the viewpoint of the implementation of technology within the public service ecosystems. In our paper we focus on social care services, where direct contact with service users and frontline discretion plays a key role (Evans & Harris 2004). Implementation of (social) policies in social work entails negotiations and creation of meanings on the frontline with clients and colleagues, as well as with managers (see,
8r5j | Carson et al. 2015). Thus, Nothdurfter and Hermans (2018, 8) underline the political role of social workers: "Social policies do not work automatically; their internal ambiguities permit and require considerable discretion for their implementation and street-level delivery".
2taz | Against this backdrop we ask, how do street-level bureaucrats implement a new technology in social services? For analytical purposes we utilize a framework of public service ecosystems. Empirically, we focus on the implementation process of a client and patient information system (later, IS), called 'Apotti', which is a large-scale, technology- driven development initiative in Finland. The data consists of ten in-depth, narrative interviews with professionals working at social care services in a mid-sized city in Helsinki-Uusimaa region. In the analysis, the professionals' experiences about how they implemented the new IS in the practices of their everyday work are foregrounded through an interpretive, phenomenon-driven analysis method. We argue that technology implementation, in practice, is done by the public service professionals who in their everyday work constantly make decisions of which available institutional arrangements (aims, values, beliefs, assumptions and practices) they are to follow (see, Lipsky, 1980; Rossi & Tuurnas, 2021).
o3ya | Implementation of New Technologies through the Framework of Public Service Ecosystems
r5il | In this article we focus on implementation of new technology from the perspective of street-level bureaucrats. We utilize an analytical framework of public service ecosystems (PSEs). The approach of PSE recognizes that multiple actors and components are interrelated in multi-level, dynamic and overlapping PSE, where institutional arrangements both enable and constrain the processes taking place in that particular context (Rossi & Tuurnas, 2021; Vargo & Lusch, 2016; Vargo et al., 2015). Following Cabrera et al. (2001), technology should therefore be considered as only one, although an inter-related component affecting the processes, decision-making and behaviours of actors undergoing technology-driven change.
5gui | Foregrounding the interdependencies between the different components, such as technology, of a PSE, is a 'both-and' situation - the technology could be designed to fit the organization's current structures and ways of working or the structures and practices need to be reformulated to meet the operational logic of the new technology (Cabrera et al., 2001). Accordingly, new technologies can, for instance, foster changes in
82qc | organizations' structures, processes, products or services (Nadkarni & Prugl 2021; Hess et al. 2016; Kuoppakangas et all 2023). In turn, new technologies may cause disruptions in practices, which means changes that make previous products, services and/or processes ineffective (Millar et al. 2018). There even might be an inherent expectation about the problems (for example, fragmented social and healthcare service sector) and solutions (for example information systems fostering the integration of social and healthcare services), to which the new technology is considered as an answer.
ls7d | To better understand the nuanced and multilayered functions of digital technologies within public services, there is a growing body of public service literature utilizing public service ecosystem (PSE) as an analytical framework (see, e.g., Leite & Hodgkinson, 2023; Petrescu, 2019; Rösler et al., 2021). Petrescu (2019) describes PSE as a unifying framework to understand and analyse the complexities of public service delivery and value creation at the societal, service, and individual levels. According to Strokosch and Osborne (2020, 436), PSEs "move us beyond the transactional and linear approach associated with NPM, towards a relational model where value is shaped by the interplay between all of these dimensions and not least by the wider societal context and the values that underpin it.". Thus, the PSE literature better recognizes the policy-making role and interconnectedness of street-level workers who implement new technologies by shifting the focus from the intra-organizational aspects and structures of organizations to the multi-actor, multi-logic, and multi-level PSE' (Rossi, 2021; Rösler et al., 2021).
tzt3 | Public service ecosystem, a dynamic, interactive and tension-filled entity comprising of constellations of living and non-living, co-existing, co-evolving and co- dependent components, provides a more holistic understanding of the complex contexts and interlinked processes of these components (Osborne et al., 2023; Petrescu, 2019; Trischler & Charles, 2019). As Vargo et al. (2017) foreground, ecosystems are holistic entities, turning one's attention to the dynamics and interconnectedness of the ecosystems' components. For analytical purposes, scholars often divide PSEs to micro, meso and macro levels to better understand the individual (micro), organizational (meso), and institutional (macro) aspects and their interrelations within the context of public service ecosystems.
t8vv | Understanding technologies as non-living components of PSE, we turn our attention to the street-level bureaucrats and their experiences about the implementation of new technologies and ask, what happens when street-level workers are required to cope with new technologies in the processes of implementation (Isett et al., 2006; Jansson &
qvnu | Erlingsson 2014; Selten et al., 2023). That is, how street-level workers and new technology are interlinked; how the street-level workers are able to implement a new technology; and ultimately, what limiting and enabling elements within the particular context of social services does the focus on street-level workers' experiences reveal.
kggw | Street-level bureaucrats as policymakers and as sources of reform
xrd1 | Michael Lipsky's classic study of 'street-level bureaucracy' (1980) focused on frontline work public organizations and was pioneering in this respect. Lipsky drew the attention to the policy-making power of frontline workers, as he pictured street-level bureaucrats 'the people who make decisions about other people' (Lipsky, 1980, 161). Street-level workers can be seen as active actors in policy implementation and a reform resource (May & Winter, 2007; Meyers & Vorsanger, 2003). While street-level bureaucrats, such as social workers, teachers, or nurses, are hierarchically on the "lowest" organisational level they still have the possibility to create their own ethical codes and apply rules based on their own understanding (to certain extent) due to discretion that they use in their everyday work practices (Evans & Harris, 2004; Evans & Hupe, 2020; Lipsky, 1980). This gives, for instance, an explanation for the results of policy implementation in which street level bureaucrats may have a strong effect on the content of changes in the organisational context, but also beyond that.
5746 | As Carson et al. (2015) note, frontline discretion is a complex phenomenon entailing also interorganisational rules and policies and governance frameworks. Rice (2013) offers a valuable illustration of the systemic nature of SLBs work, as she combines a street-level perspective with micro-institutionalism. Her comparative research contribution identifies different layers that influence the implementation process of activation policies: the professional identity of the caseworker; caseworker's ideas of the worthiness of clients; organisational characteristics; and wider political, economic, cultural and social developments and institutions that frame and/or restrict the actions that are relevant, appropriate or permitted in certain types of situations. Moreover, Isett et al. (2006) underline the importance of frontline acceptance to systemic changes: SLBs perceptions of system changes affect attitudes towards the work environment, even if the new system is more effective and efficient. This, according to the authors, may lead event to systems failure if not handled well.
7toz | Whereas many SLBs can be seen also as professionals, the theoretical and analytical angles differ in following way: Evans (2015) notes that SLBs are seen to
j346 | implement policy goals whereas professionals formulate their own goals. According to previous research, social workers can be categorised as both (see, e.g. Ellis, 2007), but as Trappenburg et al. (2020) suggest, social workers are more SLBs than professionals, as they implement policies to meet the needs of their clients, bending the rules and applying policies to fit their street-level practices, albeit the notion that professional codes and rules are the basis of their discretion (Carson et al., 2015).
v8uq | New technologies are seen in this study as an instrumental context for examining SLBs policy implementation. Therefore, we do not focus on the question, what kinds of negative or positive consequences new technologies have for STBs work. In short, there are conflicting views on such consequences: some researchers assume that technology has an especially negative effect on street-level bureaucrats and often the negative consequences are connected with the decreasing level of discretion. For instance, Ellis (2011) notes that new technologies help managers monitor SLBs more easily and make it more difficult to bend rules in frontline implementation. Then again, there are also views according to which SLBs can use ICT as action resources (Buffat, 2015). Overall, new technologies are a broad umbrella term, and it is the context and special conditions in the usage of the technology that define the impacts for SLB's work (see, Buffat, 2015, 158). In this study we focus on the process of implementation by asking, how do street- level bureaucrats implement a new technology in social services?
x972 | Context and methods
cwrw | Our study focuses on the implementation of a social and health care client and patient information system commissioned by the Hospital District of Helsinki (HUS) and the municipalities of the Helsinki Metropolitan Area, Finland (Helsinki-Uusimaa region) in 2016. The implementation of the new information system took place during the years 2018-2022. This client and patient information system is software developed by the Epic Systems Corporation. One crucial promise of the new IS was to enhance the integration of social and healthcare services by creating, first in the world, an electronic client and patient record and system combining social care and healthcare data into "a single, unified record" (Apotti Oy, 2023).
4i0e | Other Nordic countries Denmark and Norway have also commissioned Epic Systems Corporation's healthcare software and thus have their own Epic implementations. The Danish implementation was contracted late 2013 and the implementation took place in hospitals of two regions between years 2016-2017 (see,
h2l3 | e.g., Hertzum et al., 2022). Norway's Epic implementation, Hellseplatformen, first took place 2022 in the city of Trondheim in Central Norway. However, a strong resistance towards the information system has sparked among the Norwegian healthcare actors (see, e.g., Ellingsen et al., 2022). Unlike in Denmark and Norway, the Finnish implementation of Epic was not restricted to hospitals, rather, both the primary healthcare and, importantly, social care were included. As part of the Helsinki-Uusimaa region, the city of Vantaa was the first organization world-wide to implement Apotti to social services in 2019.
dfzb | The data was collected through narrative interviews, and these interviews with the professionals working at the city of Vantaa's social services were conducted in November and December 2021, approximately 1,5 years after the implementation of the new IS. We utilized a purposive sampling to select informants who had experienced the implementation of the client information system (Charmaz, 2006; Jupp, 2006). The informants were all professionals working at the City of Vantaa's social services, and they were thus expected to be able to hold sufficient knowledge about the phenomena under study. The data was collected through narrative interviews, and altogether ten informants were interviewed. One interview lasted approximately 60 minutes. All the interviews were fully transcribed afterwards, and the transcribed data consists of 94 pages of text.
u6ty | Narrative interviews, in which the informants make sense of their experiences about the implementation of the client information system, are particularly useful as they allow the researchers the opportunity to explore beyond the implementation process as such. In addition, the hidden aspects, emotions and thoughts underlying the felt meanings and lived experiences that ordinary discourse sometimes fails to engage with can be addressed (Allen, 2017; Charmaz, 2006). The aim of the narrative interviews is to give voice, time and possibilities for the informants to express and reflect on their experiences about the studied phenomenon, connecting the past, present and future at the point of telling (Hyvärinen, 2016; Rossi, 2021). In practice, researcher asked open-ended questions so that the informants could reflect on and make sense of the experiences they have had and the expectations they hold to provide examples of situations where experiences took place and how they acted, felt and thought about what has happened (Charmaz, 2006; Hyvärinen, 2016).
awvu | The phenomenon-driven, interpretive analysis was aimed at gaining understanding about how the professionals justified their actions, decisions and choices
on9b | in their everyday work about the usage and implementation of the new information system. Therefore, a five-step coding scheme was utilized to systematically describe the meaning of the qualitative data (Gläser & Laudel, 2013; Rossi, 2021):
