You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

qb7o | More moderate linguists such as John Witherspoon, the teacher of James Madison, deplored the lack of federal English. He encouraged the incorporation of "Americanisms," advising his students to compile new dictionaries. The most prominent compiler and reformer of the English language was Noah Webster, who initially began his reform efforts by concentrating on the received standards of English pronunciation. Using the linguistic theory that written words follow the ear, he demanded that common schools adopt a new orthography in which alphabetic letters functioned like modern phonetic signs. To illustrate his argument, for example, he wrote, "There iz no alternativ."7
oae5 | In Webster's 1783 primer, A Grammatical Institute of the English Lan- guage, his first successful publication in a series of spelling books, the alphabet lesson combined the pedagogic elements of reading and elocu- tion manuals. Its directions maintained that "a child be taught, first the Roman letters, both small and great-then the Italics-then the sounds of the vowels." The various spelling exercises depended on a pronouncing- form method, which meant that students learned to cipher and spell the written word through the imitation of the stresses, breaks, and pauses that marked the word's spoken performance. Moreover, because these lessons in pronunciation required students to stand up as a group, the early national spelling exercises resembled a choral performance. Each of Webster's spelling lessons entailed a graduated theatrical element: stu- dents recited numerous tables that progressed from syllabic fragments
s0fl | (table 1: "ba, be, bi, bo . . . "), to monosyllabic words, to the polysyllabic (table 2: "bag, big, bog . . . "; table 6: "ab so lute, ab sti nence . . . "), until they finally rehearsed short didactic narratives (table 42: "The Story of Tommy and Harry").8
43ia | In order to give the American language its own "sound" (and make it at the same time the basis of a new language), Webster focused on the oral component of the elementary spelling lessons and marshaled most of his pedagogic efforts toward introducing a national "standard of pronuncia- tion." "Such a standard," Webster claimed, "universally used in schools, would in time, demolish those odious distinctions of provincial dialects, which are the objects of reciprocal ridicule in the United States." Webster, a staunch Federalist and ardent proponent of the union, hoped to miti- gate political tensions by erasing local linguistic differences. Indeed, the expressed hope of the Grammatical Institute was that standardized pro- nunciation, not so much alphabetic orthography, would mediate among a regionally and socially differentiated people. If Americans would only adopt his reformed speller, Webster believed, "all persons, of every rank, would speak with some degree of precision and uniformity. Such a unifor- mity in these states is very desirable; it would remove prejudice, and con- ciliate mutual affection and respect."9
3g2y | By concentrating on pronunciation rather than orthography, Webster sidestepped the fact that he was still using the English language to cre- ate the proposed American variant. He acknowledged that English was a fickle instrument for creating a national community. He predicted that, even if there were an American English language, the new citizen "will claim a right to pronounce most agreably to his own fancy, and the lan- guage will be exposed to perpetual fluctuation." Webster's reform plan seemed already defeated, for he must negotiate the inherent flexibility underlying all languages, the fact that linguistic forms do not always fol- low rules but evolve constantly and are shaped by individual oral applica- tions, local habits, and social settings.10
gc7v | Webster resolved this dilemma by turning to the discourse of geogra- phy, in particular the spelling of place-names. He assured his readers that a geographical lexicon could overcome local differences. Commenting in the Grammatical Institute, Webster writes that "the advantage of pub- lishing, in a work of this kind, the names of the United States, the coun- ties in each, etc. will not be disputed by any American." Thus, while the opacity surrounding the English language was fueling the regionally moti- vated debates over the proper wording of the Republic's basic document, Webster imagined that the "undisputed" pronunciation of geographical words could provide a sense of clarity and a practical code when imagin- ing a unified community.11
wqfv | The assertion that the consensual pronunciation of geographic place- names was the nation's neutral linguistic ground provided Webster with a formula through which he simultaneously decolonized and nationalized his speller. Webster's self-assigned challenge was to displace the British schoolbook A New Guide to the English Language, by Thomas Dilworth, a speller that had dominated the classrooms and homes of British Ameri-
