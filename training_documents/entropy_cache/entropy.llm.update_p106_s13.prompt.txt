You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

8oh3 | <LATEX>F _ { i } = - k \ln Z _ { i } = - k \ln \left( \frac { 1 } { N ! } \frac { V ^ { N } } { \Lambda ^ { 3 N } } \right) .</LATEX> Thus the entropy of the gas is
m27u | <LATEX>S _ { i } = \frac { \langle E _ { i } \rangle - F _ { i } } { T } = k N \left( \ln \frac { V } { \Lambda ^ { 3 } } + \frac { 3 } { 2 } \right) - k \ln N !</LATEX> In short, it is <LATEX>k \ln N</LATEX> less than for the gas of distinguishable particles. This makes beautiful intuitive sense: there are <LATEX>N !</LATEX> permutations of the particles that we no longer care about in the indistinguishable case.
s0b6 | STIRLING'S FORMULA
ihlu | Stirling's formula says
r3zr | <LATEX>\sim \sqrt { 2 \pi N } \left( \frac { N } { e } \right) ^ { N }</LATEX> e N N
j6ku | N!
zt0d | and it gives In <LATEX>N ! \approx \left( \ln N - 1 \right) N + \frac { 1 } { 2 } \ln 2 \pi N</LATEX> where the error goes to zero as
ej0q | <LATEX>N \rightarrow + \infty .</LATEX> Now we need a bit of math: Stirling's formula for the factorial function. In one form this says
dg44 | <LATEX>\lim _ { N \rightarrow + \infty } \frac { \sqrt { 2 \pi N } \left( \frac { N } { e } \right) ^ { N } } { N ! } = 1 .</LATEX> We abbreviate this fact, that the ratio of two quantities approaches 1 as <LATEX>N \rightarrow + \infty ,</LATEX> by saying <LATEX>N !</LATEX> is asymptotic to <LATEX>\sqrt { 2 \pi N } \left( \frac { N } { e } \right) ^ { N }</LATEX> . We also write
lhtj | <LATEX>N ! \sim \sqrt { 2 \pi N } \left( \frac { N } { e } \right) ^ { N } .</LATEX> where the <LATEX>\mathrm { s y m b o l } \sim \mathrm { m e a n s }</LATEX> 'asymptotic to'.
ns07 | If we take the logarithm of both sides we get
q8bx | <LATEX>\ln N ! \approx \left( \ln N - 1 \right) N + \frac { 1 } { 2 } \ln 2 \pi N .</LATEX> The symbol ~ has a vaguer meaning: 'approximately equal to'. But it turns out that in this instance the approximation is extremely good: the difference between the left and right sides goes to zero as <LATEX>N \rightarrow + \infty .</LATEX> In fact we will content ourselves with a cruder approximation:
lftq | <LATEX>\ln N ! \approx \left( \ln N - 1 \right) N</LATEX> because in the entropy entropy of an ideal gas <LATEX>N</LATEX> is typically huge, so the term we have discarded here is dwarfed by the others.
hyaf | Puzzle 47. Suppose <LATEX>N</LATEX> is Avogadro's number, close to the number of atoms in 4 grams of helium:
9etn | <LATEX>N \approx 6 \cdot 1 0 ^ { 2 3 } .</LATEX> What is the ratio of <LATEX>\frac { 1 } { 2 } \ln 2 \pi N</LATEX> to
2bic | <LATEX>N ?</LATEX> While deriving Stirling's formula is fascinating and not at all trivial, doing so would take us rather far afield. So I will resist, and refer you instead to this:
jras | THE SACKUR-TETRODE EQUATION
dwvf | In thermal equilibrium, an ideal gas of <LATEX>N</LATEX> indistinguishable classical particles in a 3-dimensional box of volume <LATEX>V</LATEX> has entropy
ic87 | <LATEX>S _ { i } = k N \left( \ln \frac { V } { \Lambda ^ { 3 } } + \frac { 3 } { 2 } \right) - k \ln N !</LATEX> where <LATEX>\Lambda = h / \sqrt { 2 \pi m k T }</LATEX> is the thermal wavelength.
bxpw | Using Stirling's formula
4g09 | <LATEX>\ln N ! \approx \left( \ln N - 1 \right) N</LATEX> we get the Sackur-Tetrode equation:
txr8 | <LATEX>S _ { i } \approx k N \left( \ln \frac { V } { N \Lambda ^ { 3 } } + \frac { 5 } { 2 } \right)</LATEX> Taking our formula
rsup | <LATEX>S _ { i } = k N \left( \ln \frac { V } { \Lambda ^ { 3 } } + \frac { 3 } { 2 } \right) - k \ln N !</LATEX> and using a simple version of Stirling's formula, <LATEX>\ln N ! \sim \left( \ln N - 1 \right) N ,</LATEX> we get the famous Sackur-Tetrode equation:
hk1c | <LATEX>S _ { i } \sim k N \left( \ln \frac { V } { \Lambda ^ { 3 } } + \frac { 3 } { 2 } \right) - k \left( \ln N - 1 \right) N</LATEX> <LATEX>\sim k N \left( \ln \frac { V } { N \Lambda ^ { 3 } } + \frac { 5 } { 2 } \right) .</LATEX> Note that with this formula, if we multiply both <LATEX>V</LATEX> and <LATEX>N</LATEX> by the same constant, the entropy also gets multiplied by that constant. In this situation we say the entropy is 'extensive'.
na8b | For a better approximation, we can use
a4wk | <LATEX>\ln N ! \approx \left( \ln N - 1 \right) N + \frac { 1 } { 2 } \ln 2 \pi N</LATEX> where the error goes to zero as <LATEX>N \rightarrow \infty .</LATEX> This gives a correction to the Sackur-Tetrode equation:
bi02 | <LATEX>S _ { i } \approx k N \left( \ln \frac { V } { N \Lambda ^ { 3 } } + \frac { 5 } { 2 } \right) - \frac { 1 } { 2 } \ln 2 \pi N .</LATEX> Here if we multiply both <LATEX>V</LATEX> and <LATEX>N</LATEX> by a constant c, we don't just multiply the entropy by c: we also have to subtract <LATEX>\frac { 1 } { 2 } \ln 2 \pi c .</LATEX> So the entropy is not quite extensive but this effect is tiny when you've got a mole of gas.
