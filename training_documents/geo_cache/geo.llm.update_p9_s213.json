        "content": "lvae | using theoretical and empirical relationships but have also been examined experimentally, showing that at storage conditions, the rate of hydrogen diffusion is approximately twice as high when compared to methane and three times as high when compared to carbon dioxide.\no9sc | Three point six. Thermophysical parameters of hydrogen at underground storage conditions\n121u | Comprehension of the thermophysical properties of hydrogen is essential for a detailed consideration of its storage potential in UHS systems. In particular, with regard to the storage of hydrogen in aquifers and depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs, a detailed consideration of its two\nzh03 | thermophysical properties, density and viscosity, is essential under pressure and temperature conditions prevailing in the storage system. For this application, it is also useful to compare these properties of hydrogen with those of methane and carbon dioxide. All thermophysical properties of hydrogen, methane, and carbon dioxide presented here were obtained from the NIST chemistry web book database and are intended to serve as a reference for upcoming UHS systems.\n1mvw | One of the most notable thermophysical characteristics of hydrogen is its low density, which dictates that it must be compressed or liquefied for any practical application. At standard temperature (zero degrees Celsius or two hundred seventy-three point one five Kelvin) and pressure (zero point one MPa or one bar), the density of hydrogen is zero point zero eight eight seven one kilograms per meter cubed according to the equation of state for normal hydrogen. Due to the low critical temperature (negative two hundred forty point zero zero five degrees Celsius or thirty-three point one four five Kelvin) and low critical pressure\n6d4s | (one point two nine six four MPa or twelve point nine six four bar) of hydrogen, it would be stored in the gaseous phase in porous storage systems. Hydrogen is a highly compressible gas, and its density increases significantly with increasing pressure and barely with increasing temperature. Consequently, hydrogen storage efficiency increases with increasing reservoir depth. But, because methane and carbon dioxide are much denser than hydrogen, storing hydrogen gas of the same mass requires higher pressure and less hydrogen can be stored in the same reservoir volume compared to methane and carbon dioxide. This underlines the importance of storage capacity in hydrogen storage. In this context, depleted hydrocarbon storage facilities represent a more interesting storage option compared to salt caverns and aquifers due to their large storage space and high availability. Moreover, the large density difference between hydrogen and dense formation water and cushion gas can cause a strong gravity segregation effect, resulting in the accumulation of a hydrogen cap beneath the cap rock, which could ensure that hydrogen will remain in the reservoir. Conversely, some researchers emphasized that a hydrogen plume is susceptible to formidable buoyancy forces, with the magnitude of said\nmqah | forces directly correlating to the potential for hydrogen leakage. Literature suggests that water may ascend towards the production well under these conditions, making seasonal storage of hydrogen in porous storage systems challenging.",
