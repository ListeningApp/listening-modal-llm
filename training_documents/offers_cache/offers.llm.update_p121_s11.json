        "content": "7ylr | This is especially powerful as you scale and become more edified as a business owner. Can you imagine one of my sales people saying, \"Alex will personally work with you until your offer converts\"? Right. It would work. It would also be a nightmare. So I would probably put contingencies like, \"Provided you've already spent ten thousand dollars on your existing offer using our structure, the offer you ran was for lead generation, and it was a free offer. These are things that would make it unlikely they would not succeed. If for some reason they hadn't with those stipulations in place, I could probably fix their problem in ten minutes just looking at it.\ns7xm | [Conditional] Hotel + Airfare Perks Guarantee\n5bgk | What the Client Gets: If you don't receive value, we will reimburse your product and your hotel + airfare.\n85iv | My Take: This is technically a \"refund of ancillary costs\" from our first example. I just love it a lot for workshops and in-person experiences. Normally the event would cost more than the hotel and airfare, so it's like adding an extra one thousand dollars to a guarantee but way more tangible. It's original enough that people like it.\nk7w0 | [Conditional] Wage-Payment Guarantee\n737f | What the Client Gets: You offer to pay their hourly rate, whatever that may be, if they don't find your call/session with them valuable.\nj541 | My Take: This is also an ancillary cost guarantee, just a very original one. If someone ever actually asks for the wage payment, just ask them for their tax return and divide it by one thousand nine hundred sixty (number of working hours at forty hours per week for a year). But no one asking for a refund will actually do that, so you will never actually have to give one of these out. Like ever.\nz4rd | [Conditional] Release of Service Guarantee\n0ivu | What the Client Gets: You let them out of their contract free of charge.\noxnd | My Take: This voids a commitment or cancellation fee. If you have a business that has enforceable commitments, contracts or clauses, this can be a powerful guarantee. Better yet, if you are in a business that does not enforce your contracts, then you have nothing to lose by adding the guarantee.\n44ku | [Conditional] Delayed Second Payment Guarantee\ne0qn | What the Client Gets: You won't bill them again until after they make or get their first outcome. Example: Lose your first five pounds . . . make your first sale . . . get your website live, etc.\n7343 | My Take: I like this a lot, especially if you have a very systematized process for getting the first result. It gets the prospect thinking in fast action terms and gets them moving. It will also focus your team on activating your client. This is a great one when you know what metric or action drives activation (predicting indicator of long-term retention) of a client.\n06l7 | I've successfully used this guarantee loads of times.\no1mq | [Conditional] First Outcome Guarantee\nielb | What the Client Gets: You continue to pay their ancillary costs (ad spend, hotel, etc) until they reach their first outcome. Example: If you don't make your first sale in fourteen days, we will pay for your ad spend until you do.\nllcu | My Take: Just like the delayed second payment, just centered around a different cost. I personally like this setup a lot. It keeps everyone focused on getting that first dollar over the bridge. Once that one comes across, the second comes soon after.\n4vdi | [Anti-Guarantee] All Sales Are Final\nkl0p | What the Client Gets: Access to super exclusive very valuable service/product. Likely, this is a very powerful thing that once seen cannot be unseen, or once used cannot be taken away. Example: a line of code to improve your checkout experience on a website. Once someone received this code, they could try and use it without paying you. Or a series of opening messages for picking up girls, or opening sentences for messaging cold prospects. Things that are very valuable but incredibly easy to steal after they've been seen/understood.\nczi9 | My Take: This can enhance the persuasiveness of the sale and the value of the product or service. It essentially implies that the client is going to use it and see an immense benefit thereby exposing the business to vulnerability. It acts as a damaging admission. We have an \"all sales are final\" policy, but that is because our product is so exclusive and so powerful that once used it cannot be unused.\" Since it is so standard to have some sort of guarantee, not having one is attention-worthy.\na3sj | So instead of being wishy-washy, lean into the fact this thing works so well, and is so easy to copy, you must make all sales final. They'll believe you even more if you take this position. \"We are going to show you our proprietary process that we are using right now to generate leads in our business. Our funnels, ads, and metrics. We're going to be exposing the inner workings of our business, as a result, all sales are final.\" Note: strong reason why is needed here. Just make one up that sounds compelling. The more you can show real exposure, the more effective this will be.\nfhkc | Anti-guarantees can also work very well with high ticket products and services that require a lot of work or customization. \"If you're the type of customer who needs a guarantee before taking a jump, then you are not the type of person we want to work with. We want motivated self-starters who can follow instructions and are not looking for a way out before they even begin. If you are not serious, don't buy it. But if you are, boy are you going to make a killing.\" From these examples, you should get the idea.\n5hcr | Implied Guarantees: Performance Models, Revshares, and Profit-Sharing\nem55 | Performance: A) ... Only pay me X dollars per sale/ X dollars per show B) X dollars per pound lost Revshare: A) ten percent of top line revenue B) twenty percent profit share C) twenty-five percent of revenue growth from baseline Profit-Share: A) X percent of profit B) X percent of Gross Profit\n8x5q | Ratchets: ten percent if over X, twenty percent if over Y, thirty percent if over Z\nwv87 | Bonuses/Triggers: I get X when Y occurs.\n97h8 | What The Client Gets: If you do not perform, they do not have to pay. If you perform, your compensation has been determined based on an agreement decided upon before you begin working.",
