You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

u3ij | f(x) =cx
x0aw | for any real constant c. But are there any other solutions?
rx1a | Yes, if you use the axiom of choice! Treat the reals as a vector space over the rationals. Using the axiom of choice, pick a basis. To get f : R -> R that's linear over the rational numbers, just let f send each basis element to whatever real number you want and extend it to a linear function defined on all of R. This gives a function f that obeys f(x+y) =f(x)+f(y).
agnr | However, no solutions of f (x +y) = f(x) + f(y) meet our other condition
t1o7 | x < y implies f (x) > f(y) for all x, y ≤ 0
2830 | except for the familiar ones f(x) = cx. For a proof see Wikipedia: they show all solutions except the familiar ones are so discontinuous their graphs are dense in the plane!
q9nf | So, our conditions imply f(x) = cx for some c, and since f is decreasing we need c < 0. So our formula I(p) = f(ln p) says
5q5q | I(p)=clnp
4cbq | but this equals - log, p if we take b = exp(-1/c). And this number b can be any number > 1. QED.
33ef | Thus, if we want a more general concept of the information associated to a proba- bility, we need to drop Condition 1 or 2. For example, we could replace additivity by some other rule. People have tried this! Indeed, there is a world of generalized entropy concepts including Tsallis entropies, Rényi entropies and others.
xfue | WHAT IS PROBABILITY?
pmnr | Since I've defined information in terms of probability, you may naturally wonder "what is probability?" I won't seriously try to answer this. This question has stirred up many debates over the centuries, and even today there's not a fully accepted answer. It deserves a whole book-and this is not that book. Luckily, we don't really need to know exactly what probability is to do calculations with it: we mainly need to set up some rules for working with it. This may seem like a cop-out. But it's a strange and wonderful feature of science that we can achieve great reliability in our results by sidestepping certain difficult questions, like someone who can make their way safely through a jungle by avoiding the quicksand and snakes.
7ce8 | One approach to probability goes like this. Suppose you repeat some experiment N times, doing your best to make the conditions the same each time. Suppose that M of these times some event E occurs. You may then say that the probability of event E happening under these conditions is M/N. This approach is called 'finite frequentism'. Unfortunately, this approach can lead you to say a coin has probability 1 of landing heads up if it does so the first time, or first 3 times, you flip it.
qrtv | Another approach goes like this. You may say that some event E has probability p under some conditions if when you set up these conditions N times, and the event E happens M times, the fraction M /N approaches p in the limit N > co. This approach is called 'hypothetical frequentism', because in real experiments you can't take the limit N - 00. But you can hope that when N becomes large enough, the fraction M/N usually becomes close to the limiting probability p-whatever that means.
a7z0 | Another approach, called 'Bayesianism', treats a probability of an event E under some specified conditions as a measure of your degree of belief that E will happen under these conditions. But what is 'degree of belief'? One answer involves bets. For example, perhaps to believe an event has probability 1/2 means you're willing to take a bet where you win more when the event happens than you lose if it does not.
7dsi | Bayesians tend to focus on the rules for updating your probabilities as you learn new things, the most famous being 'Bayes' rule'. Even if agents start by assigning different probabilities to an event, if they follow the same rules for changing these probabilities as they learn new things, under certain circumstances we can prove their probabilities will converge to the same value.
iax1 | For a passionate and intelligent discussion of these issues, I recommend E. T. Jaynes' book Probability Theory: the Logic of Science. Later we'll meet his 'principle of max- imum entropy', another important approach to working with probabilities.
61w7 | PROBABILITY MEASURES
nllv | A measure on a set X is a function that assigns to certain so-called measurable subsets S C X a number p(S) E [0, 0], obeying these rules:
bsru | . Ø, X C X are measurable and
7ylr | m(Ø) = 0
s7xm | . If S, T C X are measurable and S C T, then T - S is measurable and
5bgk | m(T) = m(S) + m(T- S)
85iv | . If a countable collection of disjoint subsets S; C X are measurable, then their union is measurable and
k7w0 | m (US;) = Em(Si) i=1 00
737f | We say m is a probability measure if m(X) = 1.
j541 | It is easier to do calculations with probabilities than say exactly what they mean! I will take a rough-and-ready approach to working with them, but first let's take a peek at how mathematicians do it. If you don't care, it's safe to move right on to the next tweet.
z4rd | We start with any set. We call elements of X 'outcomes' and subsets of X 'events'. We can sometimes get into trouble trying to assign a probability to every subset of X. So, we'll only try to assign probabilites to events in some collection M with these properties:
0ivu | · Ø EM and X € M.
oxnd | . If S, T E M and S CT then the set of elements of T that are not in S, called T - S, is in M.
44ku | . If Si E M for i = 1, 2, ... then the union UM1 Si is in M.
e0qn | We call elements of M measurable subsets of X. A measure is then a function m: M -> [0, 0] obeying these rules:
7343 | · m(Ø) = 0
06l7 | · If S, T & M and S C M then m(T) = m(S) + m(T - S).
o1mq | . If Si E M then m (Ui-1 Si) = Li-1 m(Si).
ielb | If <LATEX>m</LATEX> also obeys <LATEX>m \left( X \right) = 1</LATEX> then we say <LATEX>m</LATEX> is a probability measure, and for any <LATEX>S \in \mathcal{M}</LATEX> we say <LATEX>m \left( S \right)</LATEX> is the probability of the event <LATEX>S .</LATEX> But we will also be interested in other measures, like the measure on the real line called 'Lebesgue measure'. This is closely connected to the symbol <LATEX>d x</LATEX> that shows up in integrals, because for any measurable set <LATEX>S \subseteq \mathbb{R} ,</LATEX> its Lebesgue measure is
