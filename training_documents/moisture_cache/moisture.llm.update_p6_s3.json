        "content": "0bqy | testing water penetration for sealed conductors and is currently developing a guide for compatibility of the sealing compound with adjacent cable materials. A full complement of standards and tests have been developed by Electricite De France for use in their system. Those standardization activities are taking place during development of the technology for moisture impervious cable. The users are able to participate in the development of this technology and use the guides and standards to prepare their own specifications. The most widespread use of medium voltage watertight cable has been by Electricite De France with over thirty-one thousand kilometers (twenty-one thousand miles) of three phase network installed between nineteen seventy-six and nineteen eighty-six. Experience has been excellent. The mean national fault rate has steadily decreased as more and more watertight cable is placed in service.\nb780 | One) Lengths of cable installed annually (Kilometers of three phase network).\nccmb | Two) Failure rate per one hundred kilometers of circuit per year (all causes and cable types combined).\nma93 | global development of coated metal shielding and armoring tapes for applications in cables. Mr. Bow graduated with a B.S.E.E. degree from Michigan State University in nineteen sixty-two. He is a member of IEEE, the Wire Association International, the Society\nc6hh | of Plastics Engineers, the National Association of Corrosion Engineers, and ASM.\ny7ea | Joseph H. Snow was born in Angleton, Texas on September ten, nineteen twenty. He received a B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Texas A and M University in nineteen forty-two. During World War Two, he served in the U.S. Army Signal Corps involving early warning radar at various locations in the Central Pacific Area.\nnav4 | Mr. Snow was employed by The Dow Chemical Company from nineteen forty-six until his retirement in nineteen eighty-one in various engineering, commercial and managerial assignments. This has included\ngem8 | electrical engineering responsibility for Dow's petrochemical complex at Freeport, Texas. For a number of years, he was manager of Dow's products for the wire and cable industry and was located at their corporate headquarters in Midland, Michigan. Since nineteen eighty-two, Mr. Snow has been retained by Anixter Brothers, Inc. as a cable consultant and applications engineer to provide assistance in specifying and applying cable for various industrial and utility applications.\ne8nr | He is a Life Member of the IEEE including both the Power Engineering Society and the Industry Applications Society. He has authored or co-authored numerous technical papers for the IEEE and has served on various IEEE technical committees. He has been a member of the Insulated Conductors Committee of the IEEE since nineteen sixty-four and served for twelve years as Chairman of the ICC Sheaths and Coverings Subcommittee. Presently, Mr. Snow serves as chairman of ICC Task Group six dash twenty-three which has undertaken the preparation of an IEEE guide on use of metal and plastic laminates as moisture barriers on power cable.",
