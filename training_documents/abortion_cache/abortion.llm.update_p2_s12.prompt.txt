You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021.

cb7r | An important consideration for people who self-man- age is the safety and effectiveness of the method they are using. Since 2018, self-managed abortion using mifepris- tone and misoprostol has been available through online telemedicine in the U.S. via a non-profit service called Aid Access.7 The service received 57,506 requests from people in the U.S. in its first two years of operation.4 While clinic-based and physician-led telemedicine mod- els that provide medication abortion within the formal healthcare setting are also available in some U.S. states,8 -10 Aid Access is distinct from these service models because it offers self-managed abortion, operating out- side of the formal U.S. healthcare setting in all 50 states. Provision of self-managed medication abortion using similar services, such as Women on Web and Women Help Women, has been explored in other countries,11-13 but outcomes have not been studied in any U.S .- based population. Using data from Aid Access, the objective of this study is to examine the safety, effectiveness, and acceptability of self-managed medication abortion pro- vided via online telemedicine in the U.S.
68xu | Methods
hd35 | Data
2zpk | Aid Access currently provides medication abortion up to 10 weeks gestation at the time of request, which is made using an online consultation form. A doctor reviews the form to ensure no contraindications and provides a prescription of 200mg mifepristone to be taken orally and 800mcg misoprostol to be taken sub- lingually, along with an additional 800mcg of
epu7 | misoprostol for use if needed, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended dosage reg- imen for medication abortion.14 A partner organization then mails the medications along with usage instruc- tions. A donation of $110 to support the service is requested, but those who cannot afford it are asked to donate what they can. An online non-clinical helpdesk team is available to answer questions. Four weeks after receipt of the medications, users are invited to report their abortion outcomes using an online evaluation form or via an email to the helpdesk.
7od1 | Our dataset includes all U.S. residents to whom abortion medications were shipped between March 20th 2018 and March 20th 2019. Since Aid Access is the sole organization of its kind serving the U.S., our sample represents the universe of people in the U.S. self-managing a medication abortion using online tele- medicine outside the formal healthcare system. De- identified data from the online consultation form, fol- low-up form, and emails were provided by Aid Access. All individuals in the sample consented to the anony- mized use of their data at the aggregate level for research purposes.
0bqy | The online consultation form includes self-reported information about age, weeks' gestation, parity, feelings about the decision to have an abortion, any medical con- traindications, whether or not a person has had an ultra- sound scan for the current pregnancy, knows someone who can be with them during their abortion, and lives within 60 min of a hospital. We categorized age as "Under 20 years", "20-24 years" and into 5-year incre- ments thereafter, with a final group of "40 years and over". Gestation was reported as "< 7 weeks" or "7-10 weeks", which represents gestation at the time of the consultation. Those who did not have an ultrasound scan used a pregnancy calculator based on their last menstrual period. Number of children was reported numerically, and we constructed categories of "o" and "I or more". Feelings about the decision to have an abor- tion were reported as "I can cope with my feelings regarding my decision" and "I have some worries about my decision and would like further information". Those who expressed worries were directed to appropriate sources of information. Medical history questions included the presence of any contraindications (e.g. bleeding disorders, inherited porphyrias, allergies to mifepristone or misoprostol) or medical conditions that required additional medical screening (e.g. having an IUD in place or having a suspected STI).
b780 | The evaluation form is based on similar follow-up instruments used in the clinical setting and is sent to participants 4 weeks after receipt of the medication. Available information included the number who con- firmed delivery of the medications, the number who confirmed whether or not they used the medications, and the outcome of the pregnancy or abortion. Those who confirmed using the medications were asked about
ccmb | gestation at the time of use, whether or not they were still pregnant, whether or not they received any clinical intervention to help end the pregnancy (Dilation and Curettage (D&C) or vacuum aspiration), and any other treatment they received for a possible serious adverse event following their abortion. Those who confirmed not using the medications were asked about the out- come of their pregnancy.
ma93 | Analysis
c6hh | We compared available clinical and demographic char- acteristics among those who provided follow-up infor- mation and those who did not. We conducted chi- squared difference of proportions tests using an alpha level of 0.05 to indicate statistical significance to check for any systematic differences between the two groups that might affect the outcome of their abortions.
y7ea | Among those for whom self-reported information on outcomes was available, we examined these in the over- all sample as well as constructing two groups: those reported a gestation of 10 weeks or fewer at the time of using the pills, and those who reported a gestation of over 10 weeks. This threshold was chosen to allow com- parison with outcomes of medication abortion in the clinic setting, where the mifepristone-misoprostol com- bined regimen is approved by the FDA through 70 days gestation.15 While requestors must be 10 weeks preg- nant or less at the time of filling out the consultation form, the medications may take I-3 weeks to arrive and thus some individuals may be over 10 weeks at the time of use. We first examined the proportion who reported that they were no longer pregnant, and then the propor- tion for whom medication abortion was successful according to the standard definition of success in the Medical Abortion Reporting of Efficacy (MARE) Guide- lines, i.e. the proportion who were able to expel their pregnancy without the need for surgical intervention.16 Next, we examined the prevalence of reported serious adverse events, following to the extent possible the cate- gories defined by Cleland et al.17 Information was avail- able on receipt of IV antibiotics and blood transfusion and we also assessed whether any deaths were reported, recognizing that we are relying on reporting by friends, family members, the authorities, or the media. We cal- culated point-estimates and exact binomial 95% confi- dence intervals (CI) both for the overall population and for the binary gestation categories available in our data- set. To compare outcomes between the two gestation groups we used Fisher's exact test and considered find- ings statistically significant at an alpha level of 0.05.
nav4 | The follow-up form also included a series of "yes/no" questions asking about the abortion experience, includ- ing satisfaction with the service, and whether: using it had been the right choice; affording the full donation (which at the time of data collection was $90) had been difficult; enough information had been provided about
gem8 | the abortion process; and enough support was available from family and friends. We calculated the proportions of people answering "yes" and "no" to each question.
e8nr | Data analysis was conducted using Stata version 15.1.18 The Institutional Review Board of the University of Texas at Austin approved the study.
k78w | Role of the funding source
g9du | Neither funding source that supported the investigators during the study had any involvement in study design, data collection, analysis or interpretation, and had no role in the writing of this manuscript or the decision to submit for publication.
