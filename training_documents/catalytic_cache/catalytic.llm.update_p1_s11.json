        "content": "mror | Catalytic graphitization assisted synthesis of iron carbide, iron, graphitic carbon with advanced pseudocapacitance\nzlxc | We report an environmentally friendly strategy for the synthesis of iron carbide, iron, graphitic carbon based on hydrothermal carbonization and graphitization of carbon spheres with potassium ferrate at eight hundred degrees Celsius. The obtained sample consisting of iron carbide, iron nanoparticles and graphitic carbon delivered an enhanced pseudocapacitance of four hundred twenty-eight point zero farad per gram at a current density of one amp per gram. After removal of the iron carbide, iron electroactive materials, the graphitic carbon possessed a large specific surface area up to two thousand eight hundred thirteen point six meters squared per gram with a capacity of two hundred forty-three point three farad per gram at one amp per gram, far outweighing the other amorphous carbon electrodes of carbon spheres annealed at eight hundred degrees Celsius without the treatment of potassium ferrate. The graphitic material with a porous structure could offer more electroactive sites and improved conductivity of the sample. This method provided guidelines for the synthesis of superior performance supercapacitors with synchronous graphitic carbon and electroactive species.\nk0bw | One. Introduction\naq5a | The ever-increasing demand for energy all over the world has promoted intensive research in the field of energy storage materials. Among various types of emerging power devices, supercapacitors owing to their excellent output capability, quick charge-discharge rate and long cycle stability have attracted much attention of researchers.\nsc5y | Carbon-based materials, such as activated carbon and graphene, have been regarded as the most common electrode materials. The hydrothermal carbonization technique is a green and soft chemistry method to synthesize carbon-based materials under mild temperature and self-generated pressure. The whole process involved a series of reactions, such as hydrolysis, dehydration, polymerization and aromatization, leading to the formation of brown hydrochar and soluble chemicals. Biomass-derived carbon materials are low-cost and have been reported as good candidates for carbon-based electrodes.\n0yab | The properties of specific surface area, porosity and conductivity of these materials have a big influence on their performance of electrochemistry. As we all know, the larger specific surface area value is favorable to obtaining electrode material with excellent performance. Till now, various strategies have been proposed to develop porous structure, including carbonization under potassium hydroxide, zinc chloride and carbon dioxide. Despite the remarkable increase\nw95z | in the specific surface area value and pore size after activation, most materials display unsatisfied specific capacitance because of the low conductivity. Creating graphitic carbon leading to lower internal resistance is a possible method to solve the problem. Generally, the conventional graphitization transformation requires rigorous conditions, like high temperature greater than one thousand degrees Celsius or high vacuum degree, which does not only need a huge energy input but also leads to a decreased porosity of the host. However, using transition metal such as iron, cobalt or nickel functioned as a catalyst during the pyrolysis process could achieve graphitization transformation at low temperature. Metal organic frameworks, as a kind of porous coordination polymers, are promising materials in the field of supercapacitor and battery. Pang et al. studied a series of metal organic framework composite as excellent electrochemical energy storage material, such as nickel thiophene dash two comma five dash dicarboxylate bipyridine metal organic framework nanocrystals, cobalt oxide nanocube at cobalt metal organic framework. In some cases, the derived species could serve as electroactive species as well and can be used to prepare supercapacitors with high performance. For example, Li et al. fabricated carbon hybrids by graphitic carbon nitride and iron oxalate as electrode, which delivered an enhanced pseudocapacitance. In this process, iron oxalate was further reduced to metallic iron followed by carbide reaction. Iron based nanomaterials, such as encapsulated iron phosphide nanoparticles with graphene, nano iron dash carbon three with in situ grown carbon nanotube on nitrogen doped hollow carbon cube, nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes grafted onto metal organic framework derived carbon nanomaterials were proved to display efficient electrochemical performance. Beta iron oxyhydroxide at carbon derived multi-shelled ferric oxide microspheres by calcination in air could deliver a high capacity up to six hundred thirty farad per gram at one amp per gram.\n0i1k | Herein, we achieved a safe and environmentally friendly transformation from amorphous carbon spheres to graphitic\ndqlg | carbon layers with iron carbide, iron nanoparticles through potassium ferrate named as FC-One-Eight, which showed excellent pseudocapacitance as the electrode for supercapacitors. Potassium ferrate, in this article, is not only used as the activating agent but also functioned as the precursor of catalyst iron in the graphitic transformation process. The derived iron carbide, iron nanoparticles serve as electroactive species as well and compared with the other amorphous carbon electrodes of FC-Zero-Eight, the potassium ferrate-derived iron carbide, iron, graphitic carbon exhibited an outstanding pseudocapacitance of four hundred twenty-eight point zero farad per gram at one amp per gram working as an electrode material for supercapacitors. After removal of the iron carbide, iron electroactive materials, the graphitic carbon with a much high specific surface area up to two thousand eight hundred thirteen point six meters squared per gram displayed a capacity of two times higher than that of the other type of amorphous carbon electrode, FC-Zero-Eight. Iron carbide, iron, graphitic carbon exhibited synchronous performance of graphitic carbon and electroactive species, which was inspirational and provided a novel route to design electrode material.\np6pq | Two. Experimental\nzse6 | Two point one. Materials\np2n3 | Glucose, C six H twelve O six, AR was purchased from Aladdin Reagent Inc. Potassium ferrate greater than ninety-eight percent was obtained from Beijing Innochem Chemical Company, Limited. All the chemicals were used as received without further purification.\nohh7 | Two point two. Hydrothermal synthesis of carbon spheres\nvbni | The carbon spheres were synthesized using glucose as a precursor through hydrothermal carbonization. In a typical procedure, a certain concentration of glucose was transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave one hundred milliliters, followed by heating at one hundred forty to two hundred degrees Celsius for ten hours before being naturally cooled to room temperature. The precipitates were isolated by centrifugation and rinsed sequentially with deionized water and ethanol, and dried in an oven at sixty degrees Celsius overnight. Several kinds of parameters were investigated and the details were displayed in Table one. The samples were named as Gx dash T dash t, where X is the concentration of glucose, T is the hydrothermal temperature, t is the reaction time. For example, G one dash two hundred dash ten means one molar glucose was hydrothermally treated at two hundred degrees Celsius for ten hours.\ndgcw | Two point three.
