You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

90k5 | When we refer to "research," we intend a particular meaning: the use of systematic methods within an explicit theoretical framework to col- lect and analyze data. PHLR seeks methodological rigor in all phases of research, from the careful articulation and operationalization of theory through thoughtful and innovative study design to analysis, interpreta- tion, and dissemination.
9m8s | Making the Case for Laws That Improve Health
893y | PHLR includes both qualitative and quantitative studies using ex- perimental, quasi-experimental, observational, or participatory designs. It ranges from health impact assessments gathering limited data on le- gal effects in order to inform policymaking in real time, to complex experiments and quasi experiments studying the effects of law on health over extended periods of time. Formal decision analyses, simulations, econometric analyses, laboratory and social experiments, survey, inter- view, and focus-group studies, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses are included, as is legal research to systematically and reproducibly collect, classify, and quantify laws and judicial decisions for analytic purposes (Hall and Wright 2008; Tremper, Thomas, and Wagenaar 2010).
favz | Theory and methods may be drawn from a variety of disciplines in the social sciences, including epidemiology, biostatistics, law, sociology, his- tory, political science, economics, anthropology, and psychology. From the natural sciences, PHLR imports the scientific method, approaching research questions with a hypothesis to be tested rather than a position to be defended; gathering data for the purpose of proving or disproving the hypothesis (or disproving a null hypothesis); and reaching conclu- sions based on a careful and restrained analysis and interpretation of all relevant data.
7szx | As we define it, public health law research is thus distinguishable from public health law scholarship. "Scholarship" embraces a range of nonempirical but no less valid and useful work on public health law, ranging from work grounded in philosophy or ethics (Ruger 2006), to doctrinal exegesis (Lazzarini and Rosales 2002), to the crafting of model laws, and to legal analysis arguing how the law ought to be applied in various situations (Ruhl, Stephens, and Locke 2003). What we call PHLR does not exhaust all forms of knowledge gathering or analysis concerning public health law. Indeed, public health law scholarship includes many outstanding and influential works that have shaped the field of public health law but do not fall within our definition of PHLR.
hx9e | "Law" and "Public Health"
ywn2 | A key challenge in defining PHLR arises from the potential breadth of the definitions of "law" and "public health" (Magnusson 2007). In linking the two in PHLR, we take a broad sociological stance, encom- passing not simply written laws on one side and morbidity and mortality
a63r | on the other, but the whole range of institutions, practices, and beliefs through which laws influence health and the determinants of health. This is particularly important given that the timelines for law to in- fluence health may be long and data on key outcome variables scarce; it may be important to examine the effects of law on mediating factors such as health behaviors. From the perspective of whether it is properly classified as PHLR, the key aspect of such a study is that it examines the relationship between a law variable and a public health variable.
dqvj | Social epidemiology, the branch of epidemiology aimed at understand- ing social determinants of health (Berkman and Kawachi 2000), pro- vides a theoretical framework into which PHLR can readily fit (Burris, Kawachi, and Sarat 2002). Most things human beings do, and most characteristics of our environments, have some impact on the level and distribution of health in a population. Whether styled as health in- equities or health disparities, differences in health among identifiable subpopulations have become a major concern in health and policy (Com- mission on Social Determinants of Health 2008). Health law scholars, too, increasingly recognize the need to examine individual interests and choices through the lens of population health, recognizing that "the choices individuals exercise and the health risks they face are deter- mined, to a large degree, by the environments they experience and the populations they comprise" (Parmet 2009, 268; Sage 2008). PHLR, however, does not encompass the full scope of social epidemiology. That is, we confine our definition of PHLR to the study of law and regulatory practices and not the full spectrum of contributing factors.
r17u | Another distinctive aspect of PHLR's conception of "law" is that it is not confined to "law on the books": constitutions, statutes, judicial opin- ions, and so on. The mainstream of empirical legal research over the past thirty years has acknowledged the salience of law as it is implemented in practice and experienced by those it targets. Studies of legality or legal consciousness (Ewick and Silbey 1998), behavioral law and eco- nomics research (Jolls 2006), scholarship on compliance theory (Tyler 1990), scholarship on deterrence theory and tort law (Mello and Brennan 2002), and regulation and governance studies (Braithwaite, Coglianese, and Levi-Faur 2007) all explore this theme. PHLR is necessarily in- terested in the psychosocial mechanisms through which compliance is achieved (Tyler 1990), the range of regulatory techniques that may be deployed (Braithwaite, Coglianese, and Levi-Faur 2007), and how law "operates through social life as persons and groups deliberately interpret
3c47 | Making the Case for Laws That Improve Health
g345 | and invoke law's language, authority and procedures to organize their lives and manage their relationships" (Ewick and Silbey 1998, 20). Law is fundamentally a social practice embedded in institutions and imple- mented by agents. It is part of, not distinct from, the social environment whose influence on health is the focus of social epidemiology.
svhz | PHLR also properly encompasses both laws that were intended to affect population health and laws that have unintended health effects. What has been referred to as "interventional public health law" is law or legal practices that are intended to influence health outcomes or me- diators directly. Likewise, "infrastructural public health law" establishes the powers, duties, and institutions of public health (Moulton et al. 2009). But much of the law that influences population health was not adopted for that purpose and may on its face seem to have no connection to health at all. For example, criminal laws aimed at controlling illicit drug use may increase the risk of users acquiring HIV (Friedman et al. 2006). Research that investigates the relationship of law and legal prac- tices to population health falls within PHLR when it investigates health effects or otherwise deploys an explicit population health framework, whether or not the law on its face is oriented toward health. We label this important category of PHLR "incidental public health law."
oaen | Finally, PHLR is distinguishable from other kinds of public health research in that it evaluates not merely the effectiveness of a public health intervention but also the effectiveness of law as the tool used to implement or facilitate the intervention. For example, research on whether abstinence-only education reduces teenage pregnancy is not PHLR merely because abstinence-only education happens to be required by law. PHLR does, however, encompass research on how abstinence- only education rules are implemented (Sonfield and Gold 2001) and whether the existence of state-level, abstinence-only legal mandates is associated with differences in states' reproductive health outcomes.
