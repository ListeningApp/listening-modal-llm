Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

v6sk | Mineralization and Alteration of a Modern Seafloor Massive Sulfide Deposit Hosted in Mafic Volcaniclastic Rocks
1wj6 | Abstract
936l | Tinakula is the first seafloor massive sulfide deposit described in the Jean Charcot troughs and is the first such deposit described in the Solomon Islands-on land or the seabed. The deposit is hosted by mafic (basaltic- andesitic) volcaniclastic rocks within a series of cinder cones along a single eruptive fissure. Extensive mapping and sampling by remotely operated vehicle, together with shallow drilling, provide insights into deposit geology and especially hydrothermal processes operating in the shallow subsurface. On the seafloor, mostly inactive chim- neys and mounds cover an area of ~77,000 m2 and are partially buried by volcaniclastic sand. Mineralization is characterized by abundant barite- and sulfide-rich chimneys that formed by low-temperature (<250℃) venting over ~5,600 years. Barite-rich samples have high SiO2, Pb, and Hg contents; the sulfide chimneys are dominated by low-Fe sphalerite and are high in Cd, Ge, Sb, and Ag. Few high-temperature chimneys, including zoned chalcopyrite-sphalerite samples and rare massive chalcopyrite, are rich in As, Mo, In, and Au (up to 9.26 ppm), locally as visible gold. Below the seafloor, the mineralization includes buried intervals of sulfide-rich talus with disseminated sulfides in volcaniclastic rocks consisting mainly of lapillistone with minor tuffaceous beds and autobreccias. The volcaniclastic rocks are intensely altered and variably cemented by anhydrite with crosscutting sulfate (+ minor sulfide) veins. Fluid inclusions in anhydrite and sphalerite from the footwall (to 19.3 m below seafloor; m b.s.f.) have trapping temperatures of up to 298℃ with salinities close to, but slightly higher than, that of seawater (2.8-4.5 wt % NaCl equiv). These temperatures are 10° to 20℃ lower than the minimum tempera- ture of boiling at this depth (1,070-1,204 m below sea level; m b.s.l.), suggesting that the highest-temperature fluids boiled below the seafloor. The alteration is distributed in broadly conformable zones, expressed in order of increasing depth and temperature as (1) montmorillonite/nontronite, (2) nontronite + corrensite, (3) illite/ smectite + pyrite, (4) illite/smectite + chamosite, and (5) chamosite + corrensite. Zones of argillic alteration are distinguished from chloritic alteration by large positive mass changes in K2O (enriched in illite/smectite), MgO (enriched in chamosite and corrensite), and Fe2O3 (enriched in pyrite associated with illite/smectite alteration). The 8180 and OD values of clay minerals confirm increasing temperature with depth, from 124° to 256°C, and interaction with seawater-dominated hydrothermal fluids at high water/rock ratios. Leaching of the volcanic host rocks and thermochemical reduction of seawater sulfate are the primary sources of sulfur, with 834S values of sulfides, from -0.8 to 3.4%%, and those of sulfate minerals close to seawater sulfate, from 19.3 to 22.5%o.
06yq | The mineralization and alteration at Tinakula are typical of a class of ancient massive sulfide deposits hosted mainly by permeable volcaniclastic rocks with broad, semiconformable alteration zones. Processes by which these deposits form have never been documented in modern seafloor massive sulfide systems, because they mostly develop below the seafloor. Our study shows how hydrothermal fluids can become focused within permeable rocks by progressive, low-temperature fluid circulation, leading to a large area (>150,000 m2) of alteration with reduced permeability close to the seafloor. In our model, overpressuring and fracturing of the sulfate- and clay-cemented volcaniclastic rocks produced the pathways for higher-temperature fluids to reach the seafloor, present now as sulfate-sulfide veins within the footwall. In the geologic record, the sulfate (anhy- drite) is not preserved, leaving a broad zone of intense alteration with disseminated and stringer sulfides typical of this class of deposits.
dpv6 | et al., 2005). In extensional volcanic arc and back-arc envi- ronments, VMS deposits are typically hosted by volcanic suc- cessions including both clastic and coherent rock types (cf. Franklin et al., 2005; Hannington et al., 2005; Galley et al., 2007). Volcanic facies play a first-order control on the sizes and shapes of the deposits, the flow of hydrothermal fluids, and the nature of the footwall alteration zones. Coherent lavas that formed by effusive eruptions are relatively impermeable,

r5il | and hydrothermal fluids tend to be focused along faults with minimal influx of cold seawater and form discordant pipe-like alteration zones (e.g., Ansel and Amulet deposits, Noranda district, Québec: Kerr and Gibson, 1993; Gibson and Galley, 2007). In contrast, volcaniclastic-dominated strata have high permeability and porosity, promoting lateral fluid flow, wide- spread mixing with seawater, and broadly stratiform alteration zones. There are numerous examples of ancient volcanicla- stic-hosted VMS deposits, including the Mattabi deposit in the Sturgeon Lake Caldera Complex, Canada (cf. Franklin et al., 1975; Morton and Franklin, 1987; Holk et al., 2008), the Horne and Bouchard-Hebert deposits in the Noranda mining district, Canada (cf. Gibson et al., 1993; Galley et al., 1995), the Boundary deposit in the Newfoundland Appalachians, Canada (cf. Piercey et al., 2014), and the Rosebery deposit in the Mount Read Volcanics belt of western Tasmania (cf. Large et al., 2001). In these deposits, the massive sulfide ore- bodies occur as stratiform lenses that are interpreted to form in whole or in part below the seafloor. Underlying the massive sulfide lenses, stringer mineralization is vertically restricted, occurring as semiconformable zones of disseminated sulfide mineralization. In the immediate footwall of the VMS depos- its, zones of diffuse pipe-like alteration occur along synvolca- nic faults, consisting of extreme leaching, silica mobility, and Fe metasomatism (e.g., Morton and Franklin, 1987). Typical alteration assemblages are sericite and chlorite, occurring as matrix cement and pervasive replacement of glass-rich clasts (e.g., Gifkins and Allen, 2001). These diffuse pipe-like zones merge outward into more widespread semiconformable alter- ation zones (e.g., Franklin et al., 1975). The geometry of these zones can be distinguished using oxygen isotope mapping, where increasing 818O values of altered rocks are associated with decreasing temperatures of hydrothermal activity (e.g., King et al., 2000; Holk et al., 2008). Importantly, silicified horizons tend to form near the seafloor, acting as imperme- able caps that isolate high-temperature circulation from shal- low, low-temperature hydrothermal regimes (e.g., Franklin et al., 1981; Galley, 1993). This highlights the importance of early hydrothermal processes, such as silicification, in con- trolling the pathways of subsequent fluid flow (cf. Gibson et al., 1983; Skirrow and Franklin, 1994). While hydrothermal fluid flow regimes and associated alteration processes are well studied in the ancient rock record, these processes are largely unknown in modern settings due a lack of seafloor drilling to investigate the third dimension of these systems.
5gui | The Tinakula seafloor massive sulfide (SMS) deposit is the first identified modern analog of a mafic volcaniclastic-domi- nated deposit of the type described by Morton and Franklin (1987). It is located in the Jean Charcot troughs in the northern New Hebrides back arc, centered at 167°36'50"E/12°12'10'S (Fig. 1). This part of the Jean Charcot troughs is characterized by enhanced magmatism where regional structures, including the EW-trending Tikopia fracture zone, extend into the back arc (Fig. 1A). The transition from the arc to the back arc is marked by an abrupt change from tectonic extension associated with normal faulting to magmatic-tectonic extension where dike-fed lavas have erupted along linear fissures (Fig. 1B). Unlike hydrothermal systems in many deep back-arc basins, which are localized along mid-ocean ridge-type spreading centers (e.g., Hannington et al., 2005), hydrothermal activity
82qc | at Tinakula is focused along a row of young mafic cinder cones on the flank of the Starfish stratovolcano (Figs. 1B, 2). Cin- der cones are common volcanic landforms but have not been widely described on the modern seafloor. These features form from the buildup of volcanic tephra associated with Strombo- lian-style eruptions (i.e., fire-fountaining; cf. Cashman, 2004). Submarine pyroclastic deposits associated with fire-fountain- ing eruptions have been described in the ancient rock record (e.g., Mueller and White, 1992). This style of eruption may be more common in arc-proximal settings where mafic magmas have higher water contents compared to those in other tec- tonic settings (e.g., Gill et al., 1990).
ls7d | In this paper, we present a comprehensive three-dimen- sional study of an actively forming massive sulfide deposit, with seafloor and subseafloor components, in a nascent back- arc setting dominated by bimodal mafic volcaniclastic rocks. We investigate how features of the volcaniclastic substrate have influenced the mineralization and alteration at Tinakula, including the possible roles of boiling, fluid mixing, duration of hydrothermal activity, host-rock compositions, and mag- matic contributions to the hydrothermal system.
tzt3 | Regional Geology and Exploration History
t8vv | The Jean Charcot troughs in the northern New Hebrides (Vanuatu-Solomon Islands) constitute one of the youngest back arcs in the world, forming only ~4 m.y. ago in response to eastward subduction and rollback of the Indo-Australian plate beneath the Pacific plate (Fig. 1; Monjaret et al., 1991; Pelletier et al., 1998). Unlike the simple graben morphologies of other young back-arc rifts, such as the Coriolis troughs to the south (cf. Anderson et al., 2016), back-arc extension in the Jean Charcot troughs is characterized by a complex series of horst-and-graben structures that are widely spaced up to ~120 km from the arc front and have variable orientations (Fig. 1A; Pelletier et al., 1993; Maillet et al., 1995). Seafloor depths range from ~800 to 3,600 m below sea level (m b.s.l.), and individual grabens range from 20 to 65 km long and 5 to 15 km wide. The Jean Charcot troughs are bound to the south by the Hazel Holme fracture zone, a seismically active ridge that is considered to be an extensional zone related to opening of the North Fiji basin (Maillet et al., 1995). A sec- ond EW-trending extensional zone (Tikopia fracture zone; Fig. 1A) occurs north of the Hazel Holme fracture zone. Like the Hazel Holme fracture zone, the Tikopia fracture zone displays a slow-spreading trough morphology to depths of ~4,200 m b.s.l. east of Tikopia Island. To the west of this island, the presence of volcanic ridges and aligned seamounts suggests that the basement structure that controls the location of volcanic activity extends at least as far as the volcanic arc. Where the Tikopia fracture zone crosses the back-arc region, there is a notable bathymetric high, interpreted to be recent volcanic complexes that obscure the horst-and-graben mor- phology of the back arc (Fig. 1A; Recy et al., 1986). The Jean Charcot troughs are separated from the North Fiji basin by the West Tikopia Ridge and the Duff Ridge, which are inter- preted to be part of the prerift fossil volcanic arc (Auzende et al., 1995). There is no consensus on the northern extent of the Jean Charcot troughs, although here we consider these to include the NW-SE-trending trough between the Duff Ridge and the Reef Islands.
