You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

2ttg | comes not only from technical noise and feedback regula- tion as described in our hierarchical model, but also from many other potentially complex mechanisms, such as RNA polymerase II recruitment and pause release <LATEX>\left( 1 0 2 - 1 0 5 \right) ,</LATEX> alternative splicing (106,107), post-transcriptional regula- tions via mRNA degradation (108) and nuclear retention (109), chromatin movement (110), etc. (111-114), which all may affect burst kinetics. Second, promoter architecture can be described by a multi-state model since a transcription process would involve many molecular steps (115,116). It is unclear whether the multi-state architecture is more de- scriptive than the two-state model. Determining the num- ber of gene states and studying the effect on burst kinet- ics is a long-term effort. Third, our hierarchical model only considered self-regulatory feedback (117), the simplest feed- back form. More complex regulatory forms may exist in gene-expression systems (118). However, since they reflect high-level structure regulation (10), more complex yet rea- sonable mathematical models and more powerful inference methods need to be developed for better studying tran- scriptional burst kinetics. Fourth, most of the traditional models of gene expression were based on the Markov hy- pothesis (69,119). In organisms, however, the processes of molecular synthesis may be non-Markovian, and increas- ing time-resolved data have verified the extensive existence of molecular memory (120,121). Therefore, it is necessary to extend Markov models to non-Markov ones (122-124). But this is a great challenge to numerical solutions and sta- tistical inferences. Finally, we point out that choosing a suit- able model involves trade-off problems since more complex models would bring less consensus on general principles of transcriptional bursting (4).
his3 | Finally, studying transcriptional burst kinetics may start with a data-driven approach as done in our statistical in- ference framework. Our predictions of burst kinetics us- ing scRNA-seq data were based on the assumption that the abundances of mRNA and protein were highly dependent (65). Recently, more and more studies of sequencing meth- ods have paid attention to measuring the profiles of multi- type molecules in single-cell levels, such as simultaneous quantification of intracellular mRNA and protein (125), which can better describe cell states (126). For feedback loop types our method predicted, we found that many genes have been confirmed by biological experiments (Supple- mentary Table S1). Moreover, the identification of feedback loops can be more convincing by using multimodal data combined with scRNA-seq such as ENCODE (127) and some automated packages (128). In addition, time-resolved data can provide more information compared to static data. We believe that with the continuous progress in measure- ment technologies, time-resolved single-cell data will be pri- mary means to study the transcription burst kinetics in the future (https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.06.19.496754). Mean- while, spatial transcriptome multimodal data (129-132) and chromatin structural data (133) provided good opportuni- ties for in-depth studies of burst kinetics. Analysis of those multimodal single-cell data or integrated data can help us discover more credible biological knowledge but would also bring challenges for developing statistical methods to infer dynamic molecular mechanisms masked in static single-cell data.
