  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,

82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

li1k | Feedbacks modulate burst frequencies and sizes differently
pbea | Having inferred each gene's burst kinetics and feedback forms, we next investigated how feedback regulations af- fected expression variability (CV2) and transcriptional burst kinetics on a genome-wide scale. Interestingly, we found the statistical phenomenon of Simpson's paradox. First, we observed from Figure 3A that there were no sig- nificant differences in variability distributions between the positive-feedback and the negative-feedback genes, but the non-feedback genes exhibited higher expression variabil- ity. The latter result seemed inconsistent with the previous conclusions that positive feedback amplified variability and negative feedback attenuated variability (70). This can be in- terpreted by the fact that the expression level and the expres- sion variability were negatively correlated (57,58,71) (Sup- plementary Figure S9a). To show this point, we introduced the average expressed variable by dividing all the selected genes into five equal boxes based on average expression levels and tracked the expression-variability changes when the average gene-expression levels were increased. Then, we found that the expression variability was indeed negatively correlated with the average expression levels, regardless of feedback forms (Figure 3D). Furthermore, the positive- feedback genes showed relatively higher expression variabil- ity than the negative-feedback genes at the same expression levels (Figure 3D), consistent with the results obtained in previous studies (70,72).
ccpt | Next, we checked the genome-wide effects of feedback regulations on transcriptional burst frequencies and burst sizes. Interestingly, we found that positive and negative feed- back differently modulated burst frequencies and sizes (Fig- ures 3B, C, and Supplementary Figures S9c, d). Specifi- cally, the burst frequencies of positive-feedback genes were significantly higher than those of negative-feedback genes on the whole genome (Figure 3B) and at the same ex- pression level (Figure 3E). By contrast, the burst sizes of positive-feedback genes were smaller than those of

Red dots correspond to positive feedback, blue dots to non-feedback, and green dots to negative feedback. The slope of dashed lines equals 1.

In addition, the ef- fects of negative feedback and non-feedback on burst fre- quencies were difficult to distinguish (Figure 3B, E), but there was a significant difference in burst sizes (Figure 3C, F). This observation suggested that burst size could be a dis- tinguishable characteristic between negative-feedback and non-feedback genes.
cop0 | Finally, in this subsection, we point out that an un- explored issue is how promoter architecture affects tran- scriptional burst kinetics in the presence of feedback regulation on a genome-wide scale. Below, we address this issue from three aspects: promoter motifs, TSS dis- tributions, and enhancer-promoter interactions in the following.
lhkq | TATA genes are expressed with high burst frequencies only in the presence of positive feedback
82ju | It was reported that promoter motifs such as TATA box and initiator regulated transcriptional bursting directly (13,14,16,57,73). On the other hand, we showed in the previ- ous section that different feedback regulations led to differ- ent burst kinetics. This raised an unexplored question: how do promoter motifs modulate transcriptional burst kinetics

rhaz | We first identified promoter motifs (TATA box, initia- tor, GC-box, and CCAAT-box) of each gene from the EPD database (54) (see 'Materials and Methods') (Figure 4A). Then, we found that both the TATA box and initiator pos- itively regulated mean transcriptional levels, in line with the results obtained in previous studies (74) (Supplemen- tary Figure S10a). Besides, we verified that the TATA genes with positive feedback had higher proportions than those genes with negative feedback or without feedback, whereas the other promoter motifs were uncorrelated to feedback forms (Supplementary Figure S10b). These results implied that the TATA box was a critical promoter motif for the reg- ulation of transcription by a positive feedback mechanism, which might be supported by the following experimental observation: TATA boxes were enriched in the promoters of genes with fewer transcriptional pauses (75), and the TATA box sequence was specifically bound by the TATA-binding proteins that acted as general transcription factors to facil- itate the localization of RNA polymerase II and transcrip- tion (76,77).

1k9e | lations, we performed multivariate statistical analysis us- ing linear regression models (Figure 4B-D, see 'Mate- rials and Methods'). We also observed the Simpson's paradox that the effect of promoter motifs on variabil- ity and burst kinetics is different between distinguishing feedback regulation and without distinguishing feedback regulation.
5bjs | First, we studied gene-expression variability. We charac- terized this variability with the residual squared coefficient of variation (rCV2) (see 'Materials and Methods') since this coefficient can disentangle the correlation of the CV2 and the average expression levels across cells (Supplementary Figure S9b). Therefore, we focus on rCV2 instead of CV2. By performing the linear regression of rCV2 (see 'Materi- als and Methods'), we found the synergy between positive feedback and the TATA box (or initiator or CCAAT box) can amplify the expression variability (Figure 4B). This re- sult was actually an extension of the previous result that the TATA box enlarged the gene-expression variability when feedback regulations were not distinguished (Supplemen- tary Figure S10c) (13,78). As an additional evaluation, we used the rCV2 rank to predict the presence of the TATA- box and showed that the area under the ROC (receiver op- erating characteristic) curve, denoted by AUC, was larger in the case of positive feedback than in the case of nega- tive feedback or non-feedback (Figure 4E), indicating that

k16v | TATA boxes led to the larger gene-expression variability in the former case.
b2lm | Next, we assessed burst frequencies and sizes. Similar to the case of expression variability, we also performed multi- variate linear regression analyses on them. When feedbacks were not distinguished, we showed that TATA boxes sig- nificantly boosted burst frequencies of the genes (Supple- mentary Figure S10d). However, when considering differ- ent feedback forms, we observed that only TATA genes with positive feedback increased burst frequencies (Figure 4C). In addition, we observed that other promoter motifs had different degrees of effect on burst frequency, depending on feedback forms. These results were masked without dis- tinguishing feedback forms (Supplementary Figure S10d). For burst sizes, it was reported that the genes with TATA box or initiator had larger burst sizes than those without TATA box or without initiator (16). We reproduced simi- lar results (Supplementary Figure S10e), but observed that the TATA genes were expressed with larger burst sizes, in- dependently of feedback regulation, and the genes with ini- tiator had larger burst sizes only in the case of negative feed- back (Figure 4D). GC-box and CCAAT-box on the distal promoter had opposite effects on burst sizes in the cases of positive and negative feedback (Figure 4D). In particular, no difference was found for all the genes if feedback forms were not distinguished (Supplementary Figure S10e).

Color: significantly higher (red symbol), significantly lower (green symbol), and no apparent effect (gray symbol). Different symbols stand for different feedbacks: square for positive feedback, circle for negative feedback, and triangele for non-feedback. (E) ROC curves are used to distinguish the genes with TATA boxes according to the relative rCV2 rank. AUC is the area under the ROC curves. (F) Scatter plots of mean burst frequencies and mean burst sizes among the genes without TATA (gray), with positive feedback and TATA (red), with negative feedback and TATA (green), and without feedback but with TATA (blue). The solid lines near the scatter are error bars.
oksu | Briefly, the above results indicated that the TATA box played a pivotal role in transcriptional bursting. It worked as a static promoter element to up-regulate burst sizes and simultaneously utilized a dynamic positive feedback regula- tion mechanism to increase burst frequencies (Figure 4F).
wtow | Feedback regulations concealed the effects of TSS distribu- tion on transcriptional burst kinetics
o22k | TSS can be divided into two classes according to its dis- tribution: single TSS (sharp promoter) and multiple TSSs (broad promoter), both being important for gene expression (79,80). It was reported that the shapes of TSS distribution correlated with the category of genes, such as housekeep- ing genes and cell-type-specific genes, both exhibiting differ- ent transcriptional burst patterns (81). On the other hand, some experimental results indicated that feedback can reg- ulate transcriptional initiation (23,82,83). A question nat- urally arose: how do the shapes of TSS distribution affect transcription burst kinetics in the presence of feedback reg- ulation?

mror | To address this question, we used the R package CAGEr (55) to read CAGE data of FANTOM5 MEF cell (see 'Materials and Methods') and classified the promoters into 'broad' and 'sharp' ones (79) according to the median (15bp) of the widths of all sampled promoters as depicted in Figure 5A. Similarly, the influence of the TSS distribu- tion on variability and burst kinetics was subject to Simp- son's paradox in the case of with and without distinguishing feedback regulations.
zlxc | We showed that the impacts of different TSS distribu- tions on the mean expression level did not exhibit appar- ent differences in three cases of feedback regulation and all genes (Supplementary Figure S11a,b). This property can avoid possible errors in evaluating the expression variabil- ity (rCV2). Consistent with the observations in previous ex- perimental studies (13), sharp promoters resulted in a sig- nificantly higher expression variability than broad promot- ers, independent of feedback forms (Supplementary Figure S11c, d). The rCV2 declined with increasing the width (< 15bp) of 'sharp' promoters but was almost unchanged with increasing the width of 'broad' promoters (Figure 5B). No-

sc5y | tably, the curve of rCV2 vs. promoter width for the positive- feedback genes was always above that for the genes with negative feedback or non-feedback (Figure 5B).
0yab | Next, we investigated whether different TSS distributions affected burst frequencies and burst sizes differently. Al- though genes with 'sharp' promoters led to a higher ex- pression variability than those with 'broad' promoters for arbitrary feedback forms, burst frequencies and sizes reg- ulated by TSS distributions can exhibit significant discrep- ancy only in the absence of feedback (Figure 5C, Supple- mentary Figure S11e, f). Broad promoters led to higher burst frequencies and smaller burst sizes than sharp pro- moters (Figure 5C, red box), in agreement with the exper- imental observation that broad promoters tended to oc- cur in the case of low RNA polymerase II pause, whereas sharp promoters tended to occur in the case of high RNA polymerase II pause (84-86). These results implied that on the genome-wide scale, feedback regulations significantly weakened the impacts of TSS distributions on transcrip- tional burst kinetics.
