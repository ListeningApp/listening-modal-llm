They include how to stay attuned to your partner when they are upset with you and how to stay attuned if you get triggered by them. In non-monogamous relationships it can be additionally challenging to stay attuned to your partner when they are talking about one of their other partners, when jealousy arises or when the things they are sharing about others have implications for your relationship with them. When you are with multiple partners at the same time, you might also feel confusion around how to stay attuned to each of your partners. Just as the wants and needs of each relationship are different, the ways that we attune to each of our partners can also be different.\nssmj | Questions to Consider\nnda1 | . How do you experience your partners as attuning to you?\n5mk0 | . How do you know that your partners \"get\" you and care about your experience?\n5bgd | . In what ways do you already attune to your partners?\nm3bl | . How could you better or differently attune to your partners to support them in feeling even more seen and understood?\n7ul5 | . Are there ways that you would like your partners to better or differently attune to you that would support you in feeling even more seen and understood?\n1b57 | Things to Try and to Experiment With\nrwom | . Listen with your heart. When listening to your partner, put your solution-orientated brain aside for a few minutes. Soften your eyes, bring warmth to your face, open up your heart and listen.\nw1qt | . Ask questions from genuine curiosity and the desire to truly understand,\nemp6 | rather than from preconceived notions about what your partner has already done or what you think they should do. Be careful about asking questions that are really just searching for evidence to either make yourself feel better, to prove them wrong or to expose them as lying in some way. Also, be careful not to interrogate or manipulate through your questions.\nvm2i | . Make an effort to track something that your partner is going through. For example, if you know they went to an event or have an aunt in the hospital, follow up by asking them how the event was or how their aunt is doing.\nu7au | . Genuinely ask your partner about how they are doing, whether in general or about something specific. Use open-ended questions that encourage them to share any feelings or needs they have surrounding the situation, what their experience has been, what it means to them and how they have been impacted by it.\n1ti5 | . Bring your bodies into attunement. Sex can be a great way to do this, especially if you take turns just focusing on what one partner likes and wants. You can also explore techniques and exercises such as sitting or spooning and breathing together, bringing your bodies and breath into harmony in non-sexual ways.\nvpp5 | . Take a pause in your day, think about something that you know one of your partners is grappling with and put yourself in their shoes for a few minutes.\ny9yd | . When listening to your partner talk about another partner (or something else that has the potential to trigger you) put your friend hat on instead of your partner hat. Any concerns or questions that you may have can still be brought up eventually, but do your best to initially separate what they are sharing and what it means to them from how it impacts you.\nrwaf | . Slow down your conversation by taking turns paraphrasing what you just heard the other partner say before you respond to what they said.\nxbze | . Learn non-violent communication or other empathy-based techniques that encourage you to empathically reflect back to your partner what they are feeling and needing.\np2wh | . Check out John Gottman's book The Science of Trust: Emotional Attunement for Couples.\nuzhc | R: RITUALS AND ROUTINES\nf2h2 | Our attachment system is comforted by routine and regularity. In our relationships with our attachment figures, we tend to prefer partners who are more reliable and situations where we can experience the ease of generally knowing what to expect and not be surprised to the point of disruption. The mundane rituals of everyday life can put many of our worries to rest and remind us that we are an integral part of our partners' lives, and the profound rituals of commitment ceremonies and rites of passage can significantly deepen and strengthen our bonds. The outer commitment we make to a relationship through ceremonies or officially asking someone to be our partner can offer structure and definition, and the day-to-day ways that we engage with one another-the micro routines and rituals of relationship that we create-can be seen as the inner commitment we make to show up for the relationship wholeheartedly and not just because there might be an outer, more explicit commitment to rely on.\n8z32 | In monogamy, the daily routines of a relationship can be easier to fall into. There are only two people to consider, and the larger rituals and relationship rites of passage such as marriage, having children or moving in together are more obvious, culturally expected and supported. In nonmonogamy, socially recognized ways of honoring the relationship can be less clear, and it can be more difficult to find our rhythm with a partner, especially when we don't live with our partner and/or when one of you already lives with other partners. Nonmonogamous relationships do have their own relationship rites of passage, like first sleepovers, trips away together or having sex without a barrier for the first time, but the significance of these events can be easily missed by normative standards. However, it is just as important in our nonmonogamous relationships to find the special things, big and small, that we do with our partners. The routines that we can rely on and look forward to are an important part of secure functioning in our CNM attachment-based\n0yaq | relationships.\no21p | It is also important to create rituals and routines that honor the transitional moments when you and your partners are parting or reuniting. Our attachment systems are very sensitive to comings and goings. Abrupt departures and sudden arrivals can all be jarring to the nervous system, and hellos or goodbyes left unacknowledged can be disconnective. Understanding what we need to reconnect after being apart from our partner and what we might need to feel secure when saying goodbye might seem like subtle things to focus on, but they should not be underestimated in their impact. One polyamorous colleague of mine intentionally knows the love languages of each of his different partners, and when they reunite after being apart he does his best to immediately give them their primary love language as a way to reinforce their connection and set the stage for the rest of their time together.\n0g5c | Additionally, how partners say goodbye before one of them goes on a date with someone else or how they reunite after having been with other partners can make a big difference in feeling safe and sound with each other. Some people don't want much pomp and circumstance when saying goodbye, while others need moments of connection with each other before their partner goes off on a date with someone else. If partners live together, they may request that the partner who has been with someone else shower before coming to bed, they may desire emotional or physical contact after being apart or they may prefer to sleep in separate rooms on date nights with others.\nql4n | While having routines is definitely important in our attachment-based relationships, having times where we also break out of our routines can be just as significant. We can easily fall into default patterns and ruts in our relationships. Remembering the importance of stepping out of our day-to-day cycles, focusing on some novelty, play and adventure can revivify and strengthen our connections with partners.\neyg6 | Questions to Consider\n00l8 | . What are the routines my partners and I already have that are meaningful to\nojx3 | me and support me in feeling safe and secure together?\n7o0d | Â· What rituals have we participated in or what relationship rites of passage have we gone through that have brought us closer?\n7atk | . How do I like to be celebrated or to celebrate others?\n```",
