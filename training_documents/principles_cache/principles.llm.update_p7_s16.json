        "content": "iwkg | One characteristic of effective teachers is their ability to anticipate students' errors and warn them about possible errors some of them are likely to make. For example, a teacher might have students read a passage and then give them a poorly written topic sentence to correct. In teaching division or subtraction, the teacher may show and discuss with students the mistakes other students have frequently made.\n3tlv | In some of the studies, students were given a checklist to evaluate their work. Checklist items included \"Have I found the most important information that tells me more about the main idea?\" and \"Does every sentence start with a capital letter?\" The teacher then modeled use of the checklist.\naeo9 | In some studies, students were provided with expert models with which they could compare their work. For example, when students were taught to generate questions, they could compare their questions with those generated by the teacher. Similarly, when learning to write summaries, students could compare their summaries on a passage with those generated by an expert.\nsc12 | Nine. Require and monitor independent practice: Students need extensive, successful, independent practice in order for skills and knowledge to become automatic.\n1uzh | Research findings\n031m | In a typical teacher-led classroom, guided practice is followed by independent practice by students working alone and practicing the new material. This independent practice is necessary because a good deal of practice (overlearning) is needed in order to become fluent and automatic in a skill. When material is overlearned, it can be recalled automatically and doesn't take up any space in working memory. When students become automatic in an area, they can then devote more of their attention to comprehension and application.\nvw6d | Independent practice provides students with the additional review and elaboration they need to become fluent. This need for fluency applies to facts, concepts, and discriminations that must be used in subsequent learning. Fluency is also needed in operations, such as dividing decimals, conjugating a regular verb in a foreign language, or completing and balancing a chemical equation.\n4smq | In the classroom\nahxx | The more successful teachers provided for extensive and successful practice, both in the classroom and after class. Independent practice should involve the same material as the guided practice. If guided practice deals with identifying types of sentences, for example, then independent practice should deal with the same topic or, perhaps, with a slight variation, like creating individual compound and complex sentences. It would be inappropriate if the independent practice asked the students to do an activity such as \"Write a paragraph using two compound and two complex sentences,\" however, because the students have not been adequately prepared for such an activity.\nr8rl | Students need to be fully prepared for their independent practice. Sometimes, it may be appropriate for a teacher to practice some of the seatwork problems with the entire class before students begin independent practice.\n4jvz | Research has found that students were more engaged when their teacher circulated around the room, and monitored and\n32nc | The best way to become an expert is through practice-thousands of hours of practice. The more the practice, the better the performance.\nb08m | supervised their seatwork. The optimal time for these contacts was thirty seconds or less. Classrooms where the teachers had to stop at students' desks and provide a great deal of explanation during seatwork were the classrooms where students were making errors. These errors occurred because the guided practice was not sufficient for students to engage productively in independent practice. This reiterates the importance of adequately preparing students before they begin their independent practice.\np0xj | Some investigators have developed procedures, such as cooperative learning, during which students help each other as they study. Research has shown that all students tend to achieve more in these settings than do students in regular settings. Presumably, some of the advantage comes from having to explain the material to someone else and/or having someone else (other than the teacher) explain the material to the student. Cooperative learning offers an opportunity for students to get feedback from their peers about correct as well as incorrect responses, which promotes both engagement and learning. These cooperative and competitive settings are also valuable for helping slower students in a class by providing extra instruction for them.\nykmt | Ten. Engage students in weekly and monthly review: Students need to be involved in extensive practice in order to develop well-connected and automatic knowledge.\n0faw | Research findings\nabix | Students need extensive and broad reading, and extensive practice in order to develop well-connected networks of ideas (schemas) in their long-term memory. When one's knowledge on a\ncc8p | Seventeen Principles of Effective Instruction\n6hpm | The following list of seventeen principles emerges from the research discussed in the main article. It overlaps with, and offers slightly more detail than, the ten principles used to organize that article.\ngl90 | Begin a lesson with a short review of previous learning.\nnojt | Present new material in small steps with student practice after each step.\n0yqb | Limit the amount of material students receive at one time.\n7ooa | Give clear and detailed instructions and explanations.\ne5s0 | Ask a large number of questions and check for understanding.\nfl43 | Provide a high level of active practice for all students.\nia3g | Guide students as they begin to practice.\n2ygc | Think aloud and model steps.\n7vwq | Provide models of worked-out problems.\nfvj3 | Ask students to explain what they have learned.

The more one rehearses and reviews information, the stronger these interconnections become. It is also easier to solve new problems when one has a rich, well-connected body of knowledge and strong ties among the connections. One of the goals of education is to help students develop extensive and available background knowledge.\nbyu1 | Knowledge (even very extensive knowledge) stored in long- term memory that is organized into patterns only occupies a tiny amount of space in our limited working memory. So having larger and better-connected patterns of knowledge frees up space in our working memory. This available space can be used for reflecting on new information and for problem solving. The development of well-connected patterns (also called \"unitization\" and \"chunking\") and the freeing of space in the working memory is one of the hallmarks of an expert in a field.\nkyht | Thus, research on cognitive processing supports the need for a teacher to assist students by providing for extensive reading of a variety of materials, frequent review, and discussion and application activities. The research on cognitive processing suggests that these classroom activities help students increase the number of pieces of information in their long-term memory and organize this information into patterns and chunks.\nm98h | The more one rehearses and reviews information, the stronger the interconnections between the materials become. Review also helps students develop their new knowledge into patterns, and it\nul87 | Principles\nvzym | (Continued from page nineteen)\n66l0 | helps them acquire the ability to recall past learning automatically.\na3u8 | The best way to become an expert is through practice-thousands of hours of practice. The more the practice, the better the performance.\nnwl2 | In the classroom\nv9af | Many successful programs, especially in the elementary grades, provided for extensive review. One way of achieving this goal is to review the previous week's work every Monday and the previous month's work every fourth Monday. Some effective teachers also gave tests after their reviews. Research has found that even at the secondary level, classes that had weekly quizzes scored better on final exams than did classes with only one or two quizzes during the term. These reviews and tests provided the additional practice students needed to become skilled, successful performers who could apply their knowledge and skills in new areas.\nbe78 | Teachers face a difficult problem when they need to cover a lot of material and don't feel they have the time for sufficient review. But the research states (and we all know from personal experience) that material that is not adequately practiced and reviewed is easily forgotten.",
