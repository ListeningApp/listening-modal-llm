As is evident from the axes in Figure Two, such an approach to materiality much more strictly delineates those sustainability issues that are financially material - a concept that SASB indeed has begun using to distinguish it from other forms of materiality. We should note, however, that issues that are judged to be important for the company's business performance by the company itself, may not necessarily be financially material. Thus, to use Figure Two as a visual proxy for the SASB approach to materiality, we need to assume that \"Sustainability issues that are important for the company\" refers to sustainability issues that are deemed financially material for the sector in which the company operates.\nhis3 | Companies increasingly use such materiality analyses and develop materiality matrices to analyze and visualize which sustainability issues are material to them and that therefore needs to be addressed. Such materiality assessments can thus inform sustainability strategy as well as the measurement and reporting of sustainability performance, as they are a tool for identifying and prioritizing between sustainability issues. Consequently, materiality analyses can be found on corporate websites, in strategy documents and in sustainability reports or integrated reports to visualize and communicate such prioritizations.\nm50z | A relatively recent development in sustainability reporting that should be taken into account is the emphasis on so-called dynamic materiality, which reflects the time dimension of materiality. As pointed out by Kuh et al., as companies more rapidly change their business models, what is material to such companies will be changing in stride. Just as the new material topics will emerge for companies as the company evolves, some sustainability issues that were previously material financially to companies will no longer be. This dynamic characteristic of materiality, that the relative importance of sustainability issues to companies and their stakeholders as well as their sustainability impacts can vary over time, requires approaches to materiality that are not static. This is in line with the findings of a field study by Edgley et al., who found evidence of a forward-looking rather than historical focus in the conceptualization of materiality.\nme84 | In a recent paper, Rogers and Serafeim analyze the processes through which sustainability issues become financially material. By systematically shedding light on these \"pathways to materiality,\" the authors accentuate the importance of the dynamic materiality understanding of sustainability. One need only refer to the present situation of the COVID-nineteen pandemic to recognize an ESG issue that companies likely had not expected, but that has had immense financial, social and environmental consequences. Rogers and Serafeim point out the MeToo phenomenon as another social issue that took many companies off guard. For companies and their investors alike, taking on a forward-looking and dynamic perspective on materiality is important to make qualified assessments of which sustainability issues might rise in importance in the time to come. The fundamental concept of financial valuation is to estimate today the value of all future, risky, cash-flows and financially material sustainability issues will necessarily impact these cash-flows and thus the value of a company.\no56m | Tensions between the two approaches to materiality\nslz6 | In principle, there is nothing problematic in having two rival approaches to materiality, as long as both are clearly defined and communicated and the subsequent use of the concepts in practice is well-informed. Arguably, when inspecting the GRI and SASB sources outlined above, the concepts are clearly defined and communicated in the initial sources. We propose, however, that there are tensions between the two approaches to materiality as they are\n90k5 | applied in practice and that these can lead to confusion or wrongful conclusions being drawn by users of sustainability performance information.\n9m8s | There are many examples of tensions between different concepts in corporate sustainability. In this regard, tensions can be defined as \"two phenomena in a dynamic relationship that involve both competition and complementarity\". As pointed out by Haffar and Searcy, many concepts in corporate sustainability have a \"private value versus shared value\" tension, which not at least extends to the question of \"value for whom,\" i.e. which stakeholders are taken into consideration. The difference between the GRI and SASB approaches to materiality is exactly tied to this question, as the difference in the X-axes in Figures One and Two show. Furthermore, this also relates to the tension between short-term and long-term orientation, i.e. between relatively short-term measurement of financial performance versus the need for long-term orientation for environmental protection and social equity. Users of information will typically differ in the degree to which they emphasize performance information related to each of the two. For instance, investors will arguably have an appetite for the former, while an environmental regulatory agency or an NGO will typically emphasize the latter.\n893y | Even if the two approaches to materiality are clearly defined and communicated by the two standard-setting institutions GRI and SASB, however, there might still be conflation among the two in practice, by users of sustainability reports. For instance, the widespread belief, or even hope, that addressing financially material sustainability issues can drive financial performance may increase investor demand for such information. As this relationship has been found for issues that are material in a SASB sense, it does not necessarily hold for issues that are material in a GRI sense. Thus, it is crucial that users of sustainability information receive such claims about materiality in a manner that unequivocally communicates which concept of materiality is assumed. If not, an investor may draw unjustified conclusions about whether any given sustainability effort communicated in a sustainability report is likely to make the company more valuable.\nfavz | Practical illustration\n7szx | Let us consider what such potential tension and conflation might mean in practice. When companies improve their sustainability conduct, investors are particularly interested in the financial implications of those improvements, while other stakeholders may care more about the real sustainability impacts of the improvements. For instance, companies in logistics can pursue strategies to electrify their transportation fleets, which can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and at the same time result in lower fuel bills. Similarly, agricultural companies can reduce the waste from their operations by attempting to make products from the residual resources in their production, for instance, sugar companies that make energy from sugarcane residue. Such efforts can clearly lead to improvements both in sustainability performance and business performance.\nhx9e | However, not all sustainability improvements have such evident potential for positive effects on revenues or costs. To the contrary: many sustainability measures will be unprofitable, especially in the short term, e.g. the current high investment cost of electric lorries. These may be important for many stakeholders, but not necessarily for investors. One could also turn the problem upside-down. Companies that make improvements only on material issues as defined by SASB will be attractive for investors, but they may underperform on issues emphasized by other stakeholders. That sustainability issues are non-material in a SASB sense does not imply that they cannot be important for sustainable development, i.e. have significant impacts on society and the environment. Therefore, users\nywn2 | Sustainability reporting and materiality\na63r | of information benefit from being able to discern between these different types of sustainability improvements and their materiality.\n```",
