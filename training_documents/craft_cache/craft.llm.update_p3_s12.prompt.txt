You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

otkr | In terms of similarities, the authors identify and define key constructs very early in most of these articles, typically either in the introduc- tion or in the first formal section. This is most noticeable in several of the headings of the first sections: "Defining Social Capital" (Adler & Kwon, 2002), "What is Management Innovation?" (Birkinshaw, Hamel, & Mol, 2008), "Defining Cre- ative Deviance" (Mainemelis, 2010), and "What Intuition Is: Bringing Together Intuitive Pro- cesses and Outcomes" (Dane & Pratt, 2007).
ibgs | As noted above, all the articles have a discus- sion and/or conclusion section. In addition to bringing the manuscript to a close and offering implications for future research, in many cases the authors also offer suggestions for manage- rial practice (e.g., Adler & Kwon, 2002; Dane & Pratt, 2007; Makadok & Coff, 2009), recalling Lewin's (1945) oft-cited statement about the prac- ticality of good theory.
colo | ILLUMINATING THE PATH: PROPOSITIONS AND OTHER TOOLS
d6r4 | In his editorial advice about writing theory, Kilduff (2006) argued that while some ap- proaches to theory development lend them-
9mrz | selves to propositions, others do not; indeed, in many cases, propositions may be more dis- tracting than helpful. It is an interesting exer- cise to study how the authors use propositions, as well as other techniques, to advance their ideas in the award-winning articles. Among the ten Best Articles, in five the authors com- municate their theoretical contribution quite effectively without any formal propositions, using other means to accomplish the objec- tives of the paper. Among the five, one article focuses on conceptual synthesis across disci- plines and theoretical perspectives (Adler & Kwon, 2002), one presents an analytic classifi- cation scheme (Biggart & Delbridge, 2004), one is an essay on the self-fulfilling nature of the- ory (Ferraro, Pfeffer, & Sutton, 2005), one fo- cuses on defining and illustrating a process (Birkinshaw et al., 2008), and one utilizes a summary of configurations and theoretical ex- amples, as well as figures (Mitchell & James, 2001). Of those articles that contain proposi- tions, four develop comprehensive sets of propositions; three of these relate to theoreti- cal models aimed at predicting organizational outcomes (innovation and adaptation, organi- zational actions, creative products; Benner & Tushman, 2003; George et al., 2006; Maineme- lis, 2010) and one predicts individual decision- making effectiveness (Dane & Pratt, 2007). The remaining article (Makadok & Coff, 2009) pri- marily uses a formal model with a theorem and formal proof to communicate its main in- sights but also offers an example proposition that illustrates one of the cases derived from the model.
pk06 | Among the articles in which the authors do use propositions, there are important similari- ties. First, the propositions themselves are clearly worded, using the same terminology as is used in the rest of the paper, and they de- scribe the expected direction (positive or nega- tive) of relevant relationships. Many of the prop- ositions in these articles are fairly complex and lengthy; therefore, clarity is especially critical. Further, moderating relationships are identified as such, and the effects of moderators on under- lying relationships are clearly explained in the propositions. One final observation is that the propositions are an organic part of the article and have a logical and coherent flow. By "or- ganic" I mean that the logical arguments in the article build to each proposition and that the
7wn9 | series of arguments and propositions appears in the text this way, rather than as a lengthy dis- course followed by a list of propositions all "or- phaned" together on the last page of the manu- script. A quick way to check for logical and coherent flow is to simply read through the paper from one proposition to the next. Are they consis- tently worded? Taken together do they tell a story that fits with the manuscript's theoretical model as described in the paper and/or figure(s)?
wcd0 | ACCESSORIZING: THE USE OF TABLES AND FIGURES
caos | With the exception of the essay by Ferraro et al. (2005), the ten award-winning articles all include at least one figure or table. Many of the articles illustrate conceptual constructs and relationships using boxes and arrows models, although not all of them use formal propositions to describe those relationships (e.g., Adler & Kwon, 2002). Makadok and Coff (2009) include a figure illustrating a three- dimensional taxonomy of governance forms, to which they refer frequently. Birkinshaw et al. (2008) also use a figure to illustrate a process framework. And in their paper on the role of time in the conceptualization of causal rela- tionships, Mitchell and James (2001) use a va- riety of graphs and figures to convey their arguments. In several of the articles the au- thors use tables to summarize the defining elements of a typology or to organize and pres- ent lengthy literature reviews concisely (e.g., Adler & Kwon, 2002; Biggart & Delbridge, 2004; Birkinshaw et al., 2008; Dane & Pratt, 2007). In addition to creating useful visual aids to help the reader quickly understand a framework or grasp a large body of information, tables can also sometimes help streamline and reduce the length of a manuscript.
qrvy | One common feature of the articles with multiple formal propositions is that in all of them the propositions are labeled as such (Pl, P2, etc.) in the relevant figure. This is im- mensely helpful for guiding the reader through the propositions and for linking the text to the figure. Even in articles without propositions, figures and tables are well inte- grated with the text. As one is constructing a paper, it is important to visualize the final published piece, with the tables and figures embedded adjacent to the ideas being ex-
pn9j | plained. This requires conscious effort, since when we prepare manuscripts for submission, we append the figures and tables to the end of the document, which may make it more likely that they are treated as afterthoughts (i.e., out of sight, out of mind). Effective authors not only use figures and tables that correspond to the text (e.g., same construct labels) but also actively integrate them (e.g., by giving an overview or by referring to them periodically in the text). While it is true, as Sutton and Staw noted, that "diagrams are not theory" (1995: 376), these accessories can be powerful tools for clarifying and enhancing the theoretical ideas in a paper.
