You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

g9du | The revised approaches to income inequality impact on production-based and consumption-based carbon dioxide emissions: literature review
f682 | Abstract
li1k | In recent decades, many authors have investigated possibility of simultaneous reduction of income inequality and pollution related to climate change. However, none of the previous researches reviewed the empirical studies of relationship between inequality and CO2 emissions. The authors of the selected papers, published from 2001 to 2019, found a diverse impact of income inequality on carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. It could depend on different trajectories of Kuznets curves. Furthermore, the majority of authors have provided theoretical analysis (even including human behaviour) of the influence of income inequality on CO2 emissions, considering only territorial (or production-based) emissions. However, this paper recommends to distinguish between the production-based and consumption-based emissions and suggests the revised approaches to the impact of income inequality on CO2 emissions with regard to the production-based and consumption-based emissions. Regarding the production- based emissions, the following approaches are proposed: (i) determination of environmental policies, which also could reveal and explain the leakage phenomenon, and the channels of EKC, i.e. (ii) scale, (iii) composition, (iv) technical and (v) globalization effects. The influence of income inequality on consumption-based emissions can be explained by applying two approaches, namely (i) inequality determined changes in working time (this approach is also related to "Veblen effect") and (ii) individual economic behaviours of households. Therefore, the present study provides a new insight into the subject of the relationship between income inequality and pollution related to climate change.
pbea | Introduction
ccpt | Climate change and economic inequality are faced as the big- gest challenges in recent decades (Jorgenson et al. 2016; Wolde-Rufael and Idowu 2017; Rao and Min 2018). The main consequences of climate change include polar ice shield melt- ing, sea level rising and more frequent extreme weather events as heavy rains, heat waves and droughts. Thus, the reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions is crucial for mitigation of
0fpw | climate change consequences (Matsumoto et al. 2018; Liu et al. 2019). Unequal societies badly affect sustainability and well-being as well (Khan et al. 2018). The authors have iden- tified that inequality influences health and social problems (Wilkinson and Pickett 2009), impels poverty-driven migra- tion (Hübler 2017), decreases economic growth due to chang- es in fiscal policies (Persson and Tabellini 1994; Ostry et al. 2014) and undermines human capital (McGee and Greiner 2018; Chancel et al. 2018). Therefore, a large number of au- thors have investigated whether these two problems, i.e. in- equality and pollution related to climate change, could be solved simultaneously.
dqn8 | A discussion concerning the impact of income inequality on CO2 emissions originated in the 1990s (Mader 2018; Baloch et al. 2018). A majority of studies theoretically and empirically analysed the relationship between inequality and environmental pollution (Torras and Boyce 1998; Liu et al.
cop0 | 2019a). However, to the best of our knowledge, none of them has reviewed the empirical studies of relationship between inequality and CO2 emissions. Thus, in this paper, by reviewing the selected papers published from 2001 to 2019, the impact of inequality on CO2 emissions in developing and developed countries is presented.
lhkq | Empirical studies on inequality and environmental impact offer diverse results (Borghesi 2006; Berthe and Elie 2015; Jorgenson et al. 2017; Grunewald et al. 2017; Chancel et al. 2018). Grunewald et al. (2012) has stated that different links between inequality and environmental impact vary with the level of inequality. Chow and Li (2014) together with Ibrahim and Law (2014) have argued that the links between economic development and pollution are moderated by the income in- equality level. Moreover, the change in relationship between these variables is moderated by the level of economic devel- opment (Jorgenson et al. 2016; McGee and Greiner 2018). Therefore, in this paper, referring to Kuznets curve theory, which was applied to both inequality (Kuznets 1955) and environmental impact (Grossman and Krueger 1995), a par- ticular attention was paid to revealing three possible alterna- tives: (i) the countries trace the same Kuznets curve trajectory (Jun et al. 2011; Zhang and Zhao 2014; Baloch et al. 2018); (ii) the turn points are different, and in the case of inequality reduction, the environmental pollution increases (or vice versa) and (iii) Kuznets trajectories are different; for income inequality, a U-shape is observed, although for environmental impact, it has an inverted U-shape (or vice versa). To my best knowledge, this aspect has still not been considered in scien- tific literature. Furthermore, this article presents the differ- ences between the impact channels through which economic development affects inequality and CO2 emissions.
82ju | Theoretical links of the relationship between environmen- tal degradation (as air pollution level) and the inequality level are still required for complete understanding of the reasons (Chancel et al. 2018). Authors analysing the inequality impact on CO2 emissions mostly used three approaches: (1) political economy explanation, (2) marginal propensity to emit (MPE) carbon dioxide and (3) individual economic behaviour (Liu et al. 2019a). However, these approaches are not suitable to explore the inequality impact on national CO2 emissions, which is production-based. The argument that a different con- sumer behaviour (particularly consumption level) influences national emissions (which are production-based) (Hao et al. 2016; Jorgenson et al. 2015, 2016; Liu et al., 2019, a and etc.) might be a misconception considering that the major share of goods which people consume is imported or exported and thus related to the environmental impact in foreign countries. Therefore, analysing approaches to the relationship between inequality and pollution, the type of emissions (consumption or production-based) should be considered. Therefore, in this paper, the revised approaches to the impact of income inequal- ity on production-based and consumption-based CO2
y2qo | emissions were suggested. These aspects, presumably, have not been analysed yet, and the present paper provides the new insights into the subject.
1piq | The impact of income inequality on CO2 emissions with regard to economic development level
7fqw | In order to thoroughly explore the influence of inequality on CO2 emissions at different economic development levels, the databases ScienceDirect, Google Scholar and Web of Science were exploited by applying a query "inequality AND green- house gas emissions (carbon dioxide)". All papers published from 2001 to 2019 were selected where authors empirically evaluated the links between inequality and CO2 emissions. In the presentation of the results, countries were classified as low-, middle- and high-income countries, and a wide range of developed and developing countries. The relationship be- tween income inequality and CO2 emissions was also distin- guished as positive, negative and neutral (or insignificant). Results in Table 1 revealed diverse results regarding the level of economic development. The impact of inequality on carbon emissions was different in developing and developed coun- tries. These different results highlight the versatile role of in- equality in CO2 emissions.
