The only way you can make a fully informed decision is on the inside, not the outside. So you get on the inside and see if everything we say on this webinar is true and valuable to you. Then, if it is, that's when you decide to keep it. If it's not for you, no hard feelings. You will then, after signing up be able to make a fully informed decision that this isn't for you. But you can't make this decision right now for the same reason you don't buy a house without first looking at the inside of it. And know this ... whether it's twenty-nine minutes or twenty-nine days from now ... if you ain't happy, I ain't happy. For any reason whatsoever, if you want your money back you can get it because I only want to keep your money if you're happy. All you have to do is go to support at xyz dot com and tell us \"gimme my money\" and you got it, and in short order - our response times to any support request average sixty-one minutes over a twenty-four/seven time period. You can only make such a guarantee when you're confident that what you have is the real deal and I'm fairly confident that when you sign up you're getting exactly what you need to benefit.\"\n4wwg | Pro Tip: Name Your Guarantee Something Cool",
