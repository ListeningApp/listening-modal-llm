        "content": "tb74 | For ease of comprehension, modules were labeled with the trait and direction of relationship by superscript plus and minus signs; for example, magenta is the Lifespan plus Weight \"B l o c d to the power of plus\" module. The two modules (magenta with four hundred eighty CpGs, and midnightblue with two hundred forty-nine CpGs) that correlated with life span in lung and liver also correlated significantly with average adult weight across all eutherian species \"R equals zero point four seven\" to zero point five five, \"P is less than one times ten to the power of negative eighteen\" Fig. three). The magenta module (Lifespan plus Weight plus Blood plus) is enriched with developmental genes such as HOXA5, VEGFA, SOX2, and WNT eleven (table S4). The midnightblue (Lifespan plus Weight plus) module implicates genes involved in transfer RNA metabolism \"P equals two times ten to the power of negative six\", e.g., URMI), lipopolysaccharides \"P equals five times ten to the power of negative six\", e.g., CERCAM), development \"P equals ten to the power of negative four\", e.g., the \"H O X L\" gene family), and fatty acids \"P equals two times ten to the power of negative three\", e.g., ACADVL). The magenta module also relates to life span and average weight of dog breeds \"R equals negative zero point three zero\", \"P equals zero point zero zero three\"; Fig. three C). Furthermore, it is related to the hazard of human death [hazard ratio \"H R\" equals zero point nine one, Meta P equals zero point zero zero one six; Fig. three D) in epidemiological cohort studies.\n8l69 | After adjustment for phylogeny, the cyan module relates to mammalian life span phylogenetic contrast \"R equals zero point four two\", \"P equals four times ten to the power of negative fourteen\" fig. S thirteen I). The Lifespan plus Liver (cyan) module consists of genes that play a role in adaptive immunity \"P equals two times ten to the power of negative six\", histone and protein demethylation \"P equals zero point zero zero zero one\", and metabolism \"P equals zero point zero zero zero four\" (table S4).\n1jyv | sake of visualization, the analysis was limited to the top fifty CpGs with the highest module membership value per module. Colors indicate mammalian Net one. The lollipop plot shows the global cluster coefficient (thirty-six) of the proteins within a module (up to five hundred top CpGs) in a PPI network. Our permutation analysis matched the distribution of the original module sizes. We evaluated eleven hundred random permutations, i.e., twenty for each of the fifty-five modules. The boxplot reports the global clustering coefficient per module (y axis) versus permutation status: module resulting from a random selection of proteins (left) versus original module resulting from WGCNA (right). The modules with cluster coefficients larger than the maximum permutation cluster coefficient were considered as significant at P equals zero point zero zero one. The dashed vertical line corresponds to the maximum global clustering coefficient observed in the eleven hundred random permutations.\nolce | P value. (D) Forest plots of the top modules associated with mortality risk in the Framingham Heart Study Offspring Cohort (FHS), and Women's Health Initiative (WHI) study totaling four thousand six hundred fifty-one individuals (one thousand ninety-five, twenty-four percent death). N denotes the number of deaths per total number of individuals in each study. We report the meta-analysis P value in the title of the forest plot. (E) Module that correlates significantly \"P is less than one times ten to the power of negative three hundred\" with relative age (defined as ratio of age divided by maximum life span) across mammalian species using a multivariate regression model. Covariates were tissue, sex, and species differences. Each dot corresponds to a eutherian tissue sample \"n equals fourteen thousand five hundred forty-two\". Dots are colored by taxonomic order as in Fig. one. (F) Volcano plot of the rmCorr of all purple module genes in GTEx data (for additional analysis, see fig. S eleven).",
