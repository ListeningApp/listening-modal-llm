You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,

82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

Additionally, a meta-analysis that included 2583 patients with nonsurgical CS assessed the impact of epinephrine treatment on short-term mortality out- comes. This study found that epinephrine treated pa- tients had significantly greater adjusted risk of mortality (adjusted OR, 4.7 [95% CI, 3.4-6.4]).62 Epinephrine's apparent lack of benefit relating to hemodynamic pa- rameters, increased myocardial oxygen consumption, and the potential increased risk of developing refractory CS and death, when compared with norepinephrine, raise concerns about its use as a first-line treatment in CS. However, further data are required to establish nor- epinephrine's superiority over epinephrine as the first- line therapy in CS with hypotension.

Although these agents increase myocardial contractility and lusitropy like traditional inotropes, they also have the effect of reducing cardiac afterload through vaso- dilation. The use of milrinone and dobutamine has re- cently been compared through the CAPITAL DOREMI (Milrinone as Compared with Dobutamine in the Treatment of Cardiogenic Shock) study, a single-center, double-blinded randomized controlled trial.56 This study included 192 patients (96 participants in each treatment arm) admitted to ICU with CS and randomized to re- ceive either milrinone or dobutamine. There was no dif- ference in the primary composite outcome of in-hospital mortality, resuscitated cardiac arrest, cardiac transplan- tation or mechanical circulatory support, nonfatal myo- cardial infarction, stroke, or renal replacement therapy (relative risk [RR], 0.9 [95% CI, 0.69-1.19]). In a prespeci- fied subgroup analysis, which included 65 patients with AMI-CS, there was also no significant difference in the primary composite outcome between agents (hazard ratio [HR], 1.35 [95% CI, 0.73-2.47]).63 However, the findings from this study should be interpreted with a de- gree of caution due to its small sample size potentially rendering the trial underpowered to detect the smaller than anticipated treatment effects in both the primary composite and secondary outcomes. Furthermore, its generalizability to other clinical settings may be limited as it was a single-center study conducted in a quater- nary level ICU. Nevertheless, considering these findings,

mror | patients who are normotensive and in a low cardiac out- put state, it is reasonable to consider the administration of either dobutamine or milrinone as a first-line therapy, with the exception of severe renal impairment where dobutamine should be used in preference to milrinone.
zlxc | Vasoactive Medications in Refractory Hypotension
k0bw | The treatment of refractory hypotension in CS repre- sents a significant challenge. In the setting of severe metabolic acidosis, which occurs due to tissue hy- poxia and subsequent activation of anaerobic meta- bolic pathways, both in vivo and ex vivo experimental data has demonstrated reduced vascular and cardiac responsiveness to catecholamines.64 The relatively preserved vasopressor effects in the setting of acido- sis of vasopressin and methylene blue render these drugs a reasonable choice to trial as salvage therapy in cases of catecholamine-refractory vasoplegia. 48,65
aq5a | A STEPWISE APPROACH TO VASOACTIVE THERAPY IN CARDIOGENIC SHOCK
sc5y | Presented in Figure 4 is a proposed stepwise approach for the use of vasoactive agents in CS. In the initial phase of therapy, we suggest that patients should be stratified into 2 phenotypes, those with hypotension (systolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg, MAP ≤65 mm Hg, or >30-mm Hg reduction in MAP from baseline with evidence of hypoperfusion) or low cardiac output (de- termined clinically, biochemically, or through an inva- sive hemodynamic assessment) and preserved blood pressure. The algorithm advocates for the initial cor- rection of hypotension, followed by the treatment of the low cardiac output state with the use of inodilator therapy. The timing and role for the use of MCS in this clinical situation remains less certain and is outside the scope of this review. However, persistent severe CS should prompt clinician consideration for MCS therapy at any stage of the proposed treatment pathway. This strategy leverages the emerging data supporting the use of norepinephrine as a first-line therapy, while em- phasizing the need for ongoing and repeated assess- ment throughout the treatment journey to tailor therapy based on the current prevailing hemodynamic status.

p6pq | process and the therapeutic response to vasoactive therapy. The MAP, defined as the average blood pres- sure during a cardiac cycle, can be equated to the end-organ "perfusion pressure."66 Accordingly, MAP is often used as treatment target for patients with CS and has been incorporated into the proposed treatment al- gorithm. The literature guiding specific MAP targets in a population with CS is limited and largely supported by observational data.67 Nonetheless, current guide- lines suggest a target MAP of ≥65 mm Hg.60,68
zse6 | The role of invasive hemodynamic assessment with a pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) is not clearly defined in CS. Although several randomized trials have assessed the use of the PAC in shock, it is important to note that these studies did not explicitly include patients with CS, nor did they assess the use of PAC-derived data to guide a treatment algorithm relating to the use of vasoactive agents or MCS.69 Nonetheless, the use of invasively derived measures of filling pressures and cardiac per- formance are of increasing clinical interest in the setting of CS. From a left ventricular perspective, in AMI-CS the cardiac power output (defined as [(MAP-right atrial pressure) x CO]/451) is a well-defined prognostic marker for short-term outcomes, including mortality.22,70,71 Furthermore, in a population with AMI-CS, there is evi- dence suggesting that the cardiac power output can be used to assess the adequacy of hemodynamic support measures, with a cardiac power output >0.8 Watts as- sociated with improved outcomes.69,70,72 With respect to the right ventricle, there are several parameters includ- ing pulmonary artery pulsatility index (defined as pul- monary artery pulse pressure/right atrial pressure), right atrial pressure, and right ventricle stroke work index (de- fined as stroke volume index x [mean pulmonary artery pressures-mean right atrial pressure]), which have been shown to be predictive of in-hospital mortality in AMI-CS and decompensated heart failure.73,74 In view of the pau- city of randomized data supporting the use of PAC in CS, there is a considerable need for additional evidence to guide the use of PAC in this setting. At present, soci- etal guidelines have insufficient evidence to recommend the routine use of PAC in this setting; however, upcom- ing trials including the ongoing PACCS trial (Pulmonary Artery Catheter in Cardiogenic Shock, NCT05485376) will greatly assist with addressing this knowledge gap.
p2n3 | Biochemical Assessment of Perfusion
ohh7 | Regular biochemical assessment can provide a "win- dow" into the current perfusion status of the patient, in addition to classical clinical signs that may include mentation, skin quality, and urine output. In addition to direct measures of end-organ function and injury, for example dynamic changes in serum creatinine when assessing for renal injury, serum lactate pro- vides an important global measure of tissue perfusion.

gvwz | Absolute lactate levels have been shown to be a pow- erful prognostic biomarker in multiple shock states.66 However, temporal changes in lactate levels may be more meaningful, owing to the highly dynamic na- ture of these measurements. In a cohort of the IABP- SHOCK II (Intraaortic Balloon Pump in Cardiogenic Shock II) study, absolute lactate level and clearance at 8 hours was an independent predictor of mortality.75,76 Furthermore, in the CAPITAL DOREMI study, the time taken for lactate normalization was the most powerful predictor of 30-day mortality.56 Serial measurements of biomarkers, in addition to routine clinical examination, can therefore provide clinicians with ongoing feedback about the effectiveness of the initial pharmacologic

qlbb | generalizability of the available trial data are a consid- erable issue as the majority of studies have exclusively recruited patients once they have undergone their initial prehospital and invasive cardiology management and are receiving supportive care within ICU at the time of randomization. Nonetheless, 2 seminal ICU trials are currently ongoing. First, the CAPITAL DOREMI-II trial (NCT05267886) is recruiting patients with CS and as- signing them to receive either milrinone, dobutamine, or placebo. This study will provide a crucial insight into the role of inodilators in the initial management of CS. Second, LevoHeartShock (NCT04020263) is a French prospective, double-blind, multicenter randomized controlled trialof patients with CS already treated with noradrenaline or dobutamine and assigned to receive the addition of either levosimendan or placebo. This study will help inform clinicians about the utility of ino- dilator therapy, compared with traditional catechola- mine agents.
nhsg | Although these ICU-based trials are likely to be in- structive, given the high rates of prehospital treated CS, randomizing patients at first medical contact with emer- gency medical services may enhance the applicability of any findings to a variety of clinical settings.14,78 As cate- cholamines are frequently used as a first-line therapy in CS, a trial assessing the efficacy and safety of this drug class should be considered as an area of priority. Our group is currently seeking to address this clinical ques- tion through the PANDA trial (Paramedic Randomized Trial of Noradrenaline Versus Adrenaline in the Initial Management of Patients with Cardiogenic Shock, ACTRN12621000805875). This study will randomize pa- tients with CS in the prehospital setting to receive either epinephrine or norepinephrine and will be sufficiently powered to detect a difference in 28-day mortality and therefore guide first-line catecholamine therapy.
hy0l | Comparing Mechanical Circulatory Support With Medical Therapy, an Urgent Need for Randomized Data
4jmz | MCS use in CS has increased dramatically over the past 15years, despite the cost, associated risk of major complications, and limited evidence to sup- port its use.79 The rationale for the use of these de- vices is predicated on their ability to restore systemic perfusion, reduce cardiac filling pressures, limit myo- cardial oxygen consumption, and reduce vasoactive agent requirements. The Impella (Abiomed, Danvers) catheter-based micro-axial flow pump and venoarte- rial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation have been readily adopted to provide hemodynamic support and incorporated into a range of CS treatment algo- rithms.9,72,79 This practice has occurred despite very limited randomized data supporting the safety and ef- ficacy of these treatments, in addition to determining
