You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

yz7j | When we're trying to maximize entropy subject to a constraint, we're doing a prob- lem of the above sort. If you don't know how to do problems like this, it's time to learn about Lagrange multipliers. You can find this in any book on calculus of several variables. But the idea is in the picture above. Say we've got two smooth functions f, g: Rn -> R and we have a point on the surface g = constant where f is as big as it gets on this surface. The gradient of f must be perpendicular to the surface at this point. Otherwise we could move along the surface in a way that made f bigger! For the same reason, the gradient of g is always perpendicular to the surface g = constant. So Vf and Vg must point in the same or opposite directions at this point. Thus, as long as the gradient of g is nonzero, we must have
wsee | Vf =>Vg
ilgr | for some number ), called a Lagrange multiplier. So, solving this equation along with
hrx3 | g = constant
na9n | is a way to find the point we're looking for-though we still need to check we've found a maximum, not a minimum or something else.
8k3d | We can write a formula that means the exact same thing as Vf = \Vg using differentials:
agug | df = \dg
mkb4 | This is what we'll do from now on. Gradients are vector fields while differentials are 1-forms. If you don't know what this means, you can probably ignore this for now: the difference, while ultimately quite important, will not be significant for anything we're doing.
06qs | MAXIMIZING ENTROPY SUBJECT TO A CONSTRAINT
cdth | To maximize the entropy
evax | H = - i=1
gen4 | Pi In pi
2wtm | subject to a constraint on the expected value
ib53 | (A) = p;Ai, i=1 n
0kr1 | it's good to look for a probability distribution such that dH = \ d(A)
58mo | for some number X. This will then be a Boltzmann distribution:
1ghh | exp(-)Ai)
643d | Pi =
58a9 | n exp(-Ai)
hjlr | We've seen how to maximize a function subject to a constraint. Now let's do the case we're interested in: maximizing entropy subject to a constraint on the expected value of some quantity.
0k3o | Suppose we have a finite set of outcomes, say 1, ... , n. Our 'quantity' A is just a number A1, ... , An depending on the outcome. For any probability distribution p on the set of outcomes, we can define its Shannon entropy and the expected value of A:
a1r1 | H = - pi In pi, i=1 n (A) = piAi. i=1 n
bou6 | Here we are using base e for the Shannon entropy, to simplify the calculations. Let's try to find the probability distribution that maximizes H on the surface (A) = c. We'll show that if such a probability distribution p exists, and none of the pi are zero, then p must be a Boltzmann distribution
s7uq | n exp(-Ai)
l11a | Pi
llit | Lexp(-)Ai) i=1
mf1f | for some \ E R. If you're willing to trust me on this, you can skip this calculation.
m61m | To use the method from last time the Lagrange multiplier method-we'd like to use the probabilities pi as coordinates on the space of probability distributions. But they aren't independent, since
pnz9 | pi = 1. i=1 n To get around this, let's use all but one of the pi as coordinates, and remember that the remaining one is a function of those. Let's use p2, P3, ... , Pn as coordinates, so that P1=1-(p2+ ... +Pn). Furthermore, the space of all probability distributions on our finite set is
1abn | PERT| O < P; < 1, [P = 1 }. i=1 n It looks like a closed interval when n = 2, or a triangle when n = 3, or a tetrahedron when n = 4, or some higher-dimensional version of a tetahedron when n is larger. In its interior this space looks locally like Rn-1, so we can use the Lagrange multiplier method, but it also has a boundary where one or more of the pi vanish, and then this method no longer applies. (We'll see an example of that later.)
8un4 | So, let's assume p is a probability distribution maximizing the Shannon entropy H on the surface (A) = c, and also suppose p has p1, ... , Pn > 0. Suppose that not all the values Ai are equal, since that makes the problem too easy-see why? Then d(A) is never zero, so from what I said last time, we must have
s0ti | dH =\ d(A)
yhew | at the point p. So let's see what this equation actually says.
aqjo | Since
opdt | H = - pi In pi i=1 n
j6d4 | we have
wmtt | dH =- >d(p; Inpi) = - >(1 + In pi)dpi. i=1 n i=1 n
u5uc | Similarly, since
0d2r | (A) = piAi i=1 n we have
gly4 | d(A) = > Aidpi. i=1 n
w1gv | So, our equation dH = \ d(A) says
f69a | -(1 + In pi) dp; = > > Adpi. i=1 n i=1 n
ycgz | For these to be equal, the coefficients of dp; must agree for each of our coordinates P2, ... ,Pn. But we have to remember that p1 = 1 - (p2 + . . . +Pn) and thus dp1 = -(dp2 + ··· + dpn). Thus, for each i = 2, ... n we have
jb3e | (1+In p1) - (1 + In pi) = X(-A1 + Ai)
e580 | and fiddling around we get
kwv3 | exp(-XA1) exp(-Ai) P1 Pi =
wxdu | This says something cool: the probabilities <LATEX>p _ { i }</LATEX> are proportional to the exponentials <LATEX>\exp \left( - \lambda A _ { i } \right) .</LATEX> And since the probabilities must sum to 1, it's obvious what the constant of proportionality must be:
zdfh | <LATEX>p _ { i } = \frac { \exp \left( - \lambda A _ { i } \right) } { \sum _ { i = 1 } ^ { n } \exp \left( - \lambda A _ { i } \right) } .</LATEX> So yes: <LATEX>p _ { i }</LATEX> must be given by the Boltzmann distribution!
i1dq | In summary, we've seen that if there exists a probability distribution <LATEX>p</LATEX> that max- imizes the Shannon entropy among probability distributions with <LATEX>\langle A \rangle = c ,</LATEX> and <LATEX>i f</LATEX> all the <LATEX>p _ { i }</LATEX> are positive, then <LATEX>p</LATEX> must be a Boltzmann distribution. But this raises other questions. When does such a probability distribution exist? If it exists, is it unique? And what if not all the <LATEX>p _ { i }</LATEX> are positive?
hwux | In what follows we'll dive down this rabbit hole and get to the bottom of it. I'll just state some facts-you may enjoy trying to see if you can prove them. First, there exists a probability distribution <LATEX>p _ { 1 } , \ldots , p _ { n }</LATEX> with <LATEX>\langle A \rangle = c</LATEX> if and only if
