A caveat to this discussion is that, although the EXAFS samples did not photoreduce during data collection, we cannot exclude the possibility of instantaneous photoreduction upon exposure to X-rays, which would complicate a comparison of EPR and EXAFS data.\n863b | In the first scenario, the dicopper center is occupied by EPR silent, antiferromagnetically coupled copper two copper two and the mononuclear copper site is copper two, giving rise to the type two signal. Upon reduction, the dinuclear site would be converted to copper one copper two, explaining the increase in the copper-copper distance observed by EXAFS. However, the XANES spectra indicate the presence of copper one in the as-isolated pMMO, which would only be consistent with this model if the zinc site were loaded with copper two. If the mononuclear copper site is not present in all pMMOs, the spectroscopic data are not compatible with the first scenario. Another possibility is that the dicopper site is copper one copper two and the mononuclear copper site is EPR-active copper two. The zinc site could be occupied by either copper one or copper two. If pMMOs from other organisms have the dicopper and zinc sites and lack the mononuclear copper site, the zinc site would have to be occupied by copper one. One issue with this scenario is that the increase in the copper-copper distance upon reduction would have to be attributed to a change other than redox chemistry. Finally, the dicopper center could be a trapped valence copper one copper two site. The type two signal would then derive from the dicopper site, and reduction would result in the loss of the EPR signal as well as an increase in the copper-copper distance. Copper at the mononuclear and zinc sites could either be copper one or copper two. Because site-directed mutagenesis is currently not an option for pMMO, which is obtained directly from methanotrophs rather than from\nfj24 | a heterologous expression system, other methods to distinguish among these scenarios, including spectroscopic and structural characterization of pMMOs from other methanotrophs, must be pursued.\nuz3c | In Search of the Active Site\nd5bi | Subunit Localization. Prior to the crystal structure, experiments using radiolabeled acetylene, a suicide substrate, were used to probe the active-site location. In three different studies, the twenty-four kilodalton pmoA subunit was labeled. Similar studies with the related enzyme ammonia monooxygenase are consistent with this result, with a twenty-eight kilodalton subunit acquiring the label. Some labeling of the forty-seven kilodalton pmoB subunit was also observed. The labeling is believed to derive from an activated acetylene intermediate that covalently modifies residues in the active site or nearby. These data thus suggest that the active site is located in the pmoA subunit with perhaps some involvement of pmoB. According to the crystal structure, pmoA is the least involved in metal coordination, contributing only Glu one ninety-five to the zinc site. If the zinc site represents the location of the active site, it is curious that pmoC, which contributes the other three ligands, is not modified. One way to explain the acetylene-labeling results is to consider a cluster of hydrophilic residues in pmoA adjacent to the zinc site. These residues, which include His thirty-eight, Met forty-two, Asp forty-seven, Asp forty-nine, and Glu one hundred as well as Glu one fifty-four from pmoC, are highly conserved and could conceivably form a metal-binding site that was depleted during purification and or crystallization. Labeling of pmoB is easier to rationalize because both the mono- and dinuclear copper centers are located within this subunit.\nba4l | The structural data offer an explanation for why pmoA and pmoB might both be labeled. Dalton and co-workers suggest that the side \"holes\" observed in the cryo-EM and\nffx8 | Structure and Mechanism of pMMO Balasubramanian and Rosenzweig\ns6su | crystal structures represent a route for substrate entry. These openings are near the pmoB dicopper center as well as the zinc site and adjacent pmoA hydrophilic cluster. One possibility is that labeled acetylene products diffuse to the two locations, exploiting these \"holes\". Diffusion between these sites in pmoB and pmoA may be further enhanced by two adjacent cavities. The first is lined by several conserved hydrophobic residues, including Pro ninety-four from pmoB and Leu seventy-eight, Ile one sixty-three, and Val one sixty-four from pmoC. The second includes some of the same residues and extends to the zinc site. Although these observations do not address the exact location of the active site, they do help solve the puzzle of the acetylene labeling data. A corollary to this argument is that the active site probably is not located at the pmoB mononuclear copper center because there is not an obvious path for diffusion of acetylene intermediates from this location to the pmoA subunit.\ny219 | Active-Site Identity. Detailed knowledge of the identity, coordination environment, and oxidation state of the active site is critical to understand how pMMO activates oxygen. There are five possibilities for the active site: the pmoB mononuclear copper center, the pmoC pmoA zinc center, the pmoB dinuclear copper center, the pmoA hydrophilic cluster, and the trinuclear cluster proposed by Chan and co-workers. At this juncture, the mononuclear copper site in pmoB seems unlikely because all of the ligands to the metal at this site are not conserved. Because no evidence for a trinuclear copper cluster was found in the crystal structure, we will not consider this option either, although methane hydroxylation at such a site has been investigated recently by density functional theory calculations. There is currently no evidence for metal binding at the pmoA hydrophilic cluster either. The remaining two options, the pmoC pmoA zinc center and the pmoB dinuclear copper center, warrant further discussion.\n06ht | Oxygen Activation at a Mononuclear Copper Center. Even though the pmoB mononuclear copper site has been discounted, the possibility of oxygen activation at a mononuclear copper center remains if the pmoC pmoA zinc center contains copper in vivo.
