You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

u1ky | Next, there is rs17293632 (C > T) that serves as a Ref-ASB for 25 different TFs and was previously reported to affect the chromatin accessibility in the adjacent region46. rs17293632 is associated with Crohn's disease. This SNP is located in SMAD3 intron and overlaps an eQTL targeting SMAD3, AAGAB, and PIAS1 genes41. Interestingly, a variant of SMAD3 is also associated with Crohn's disease, particularly, with increased risk of repeated surgery and shorter relapse47. Among the TFs displaying ASBs, there are JUN/FOS proteins with the ASB- concordant motif annotation. The AP1 pioneer complex of JUN/ FOS likely serves as a "driver" for changes both in gene expression and chromatin accessibility, and is likely to cause ASB of all 25 TFs.
htm9 | Apart from multi-TF ASBs which are linked to local chromatin changes, non-trivial cases can be found among TF-switching ASBs. For example, SNP rs58726213 is associated with psoriasis and is ASB of CREB1 (reference allele preference, concordant with motif) and JUN (alternative allele preference). rs58726213 is located in the STX4 intron or upstream region depending on a transcript variant. STX4 is significantly downregulated in psoriasis48, and, according to GTEx, rs58726213 serves as an eQTL of STX4 and HSD3B7; the latter is also reported as psoriasis susceptibility locus49.
8hul | Another example is SNP rs11257655 that is associated with type 2 diabetes50. rs11257655 is reported to be located in the CDC123 regulatory region and exhibits ASB of FOXA1 (alter- native allele preference, concordant with the sequence motif),
87vz | ESR1 (reference allele preference), and three other TFs (SPI1, STAT1, and SMC3). According to UniProt51, FOXA1 is involved in liver and pancreas development, and in glucose homeostasis. At the same time, polymorphisms in the ESR1 gene are associated with type 2 diabetes and with fasting plasma glucose 52,53
ym66 | Thus, ASBs highlight the cases where phenotype-genotype associations arise with different mechanisms, either from protein structure variation, or due to altered gene expression caused by nucleotide substitutions in the gene regulatory region.
l0a3 | Discussion
u8nw | The functional annotation of noncoding variants remains a challenge in modern human genetics. Phenotype-associated SNPs found in GWAS are usually located in extensive linkage dis- equilibrium blocks, and reliable selection of causal variants can- not be done purely by statistical means. Additional data for the identification of causal variants come from functional genomics. In particular, an important class of causal variants consists of regulatory SNVs affecting gene transcription. For those variants, there are various approaches, e.g., parallel reporter assays, to obtain high-throughput data on molecular events caused by particular nucleotide substitution. Another common strategy is to check if a variant of interest falls into a known gene regulatory region detected by chromatin immunoprecipitation or chromatin accessibility assay followed by deep sequencing. By assessing the allele specificity, it is possible to further profit from these data through direct estimation of the effect that a particular allele has on the binding of relevant regulatory proteins or chromatin accessibility.
l2v9 | In this meta-study, for each SNV, we integrated the data by considering a TF bound to SNV in different cell types or a cell type and different TFs bound to the same SNV. Surprisingly, ASB identification through data aggregation had better sensitivity than standard ChIP-Seq peak calling at the level of individual data sets. Particularly, in GTRD, the ChIP-Seq peak calls were gathered from four different tools (MACS, SISSRs, GEM, and PICS), but only 85-90% of significant ASBs were detected within peak calls (199,819 of 233,290 and 324,890 of 351,965 for TF-centric and cell type-centric aggregation), suggesting that up to 15% of ASBs could be lost if the ASB calling was restricted to the peak calls only.
