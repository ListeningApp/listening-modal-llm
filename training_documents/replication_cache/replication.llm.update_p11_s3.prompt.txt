You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

a0by | Particularly extensive parallels exist between genome replication in (+)RNA virus RCs and dsRNA viruses. The pathways and (+)RNA/dsRNA replication intermediates (Figure 1a) appear identical. Indeed, (+)RNA and dsRNA virus life cycles are differentiated primarily by which repli- cation intermediate is packaged in virions: (+)RNA/mRNA for (+)RNA viruses, and the entire dsRNA-containing RNA replication compartment or core for dsRNA viruses (81). (+)RNA virus RC crowns also show intriguing parallels with ringed viral protein channels at the fivefold vertices of dsRNA virus cores. Cystoviruses such as dsRNA bacteriophage @6 assemble procapsids whose fivefold axes each bear an exterior hexamer of viral NTPase P4 (82). Similar to emerging models of nodavirus RC assembly (12, 26), these P4 hexamers serve as portals for active import of (+)RNA genome templates and passive release of progeny (+)RNA transcripts (83). Coronavirus DMVs also parallel these @6 capsids in bearing multiple hexameric crowns that are thought to serve as progeny RNA release channels and might serve as RNA template import channels (65).
u1ky | Reoviruses, another family of dsRNA viruses, have cores whose fivefold axes bear pentameric turrets that serve as release channels and 5' capping complexes for viral mRNAs (84). The viral protein A that forms nodavirus crowns also contains the viral RNA capping functions (Figure 2) and may also 5' cap emerging nodavirus RNAs. Finally, paralleling the 12-fold symme- try of nodavirus crowns, herpesviruses and many DNA bacteriophage use 12-mer ringed portal protein complexes as import motors and release channels for their genomic DNA (85). Thus, (+)RNA virus crowns share features with proteins from a wide range of viruses, which might represent links with common ancestors contributing to the evolution of crowns.
htm9 | 4.2. Dynamic Maturational Transitions of RNA Replication Complexes
8hul | Results from many (+)RNA viruses indicate that RCs are dynamic complexes that undergo se- quential maturational changes and interact with a progression of viral and host interaction partners (see also below). Alphaviruses, for example, transition their RCs from (-)RNA to (+)RNA synthe- sis by viral nsP2 protease processing of their nsP1234 polyprotein (28, 30) (Figure 2). In an early step required for RNA synthesis, nsP2 releases nsP4pol from nsP1234 during or immediately after polyprotein translation. The resulting nsP123 and nsP4pol complex is specialized for (-)RNA syn- thesis, which as with nodaviruses is linked to spherule formation (33, 86). Subsequently, (-)RNA synthesis is inhibited and (+)RNA synthesis promoted by cleavages that separate first nsP1 from nsP23, and then nsP2 from nsP3 (87). The timing of nsP1/2 cleavage appears optimized to al- low conformational adjustments of nsP-nsP interactions required for subsequent steps, including nsP2/3 cleavage (88-90).
87vz | This alphavirus polyprotein processing takes on new meaning with the finding that nsP1 assembles a 12-mer ring (41, 42) (Figure 4) that likely serves as a base for at least early nsP123 and nsP1234 complexes. Such high copy nsP1234 multimers would have similarities to the 12-fold symmetric, multi-domain nodavirus crowns (21, 26) and intriguing implications for functional
ym66 | issues such as intra- and intermolecular cleavages by nsP2 and the need to proteolytically release nsP4pol for RNA synthesis.
l0a3 | Further indication of RC maturational changes emerged from recognition that alphavirus-like viruses, flaviviruses, and other Kitrinoviricota exploit cellular oxidizing functions to enable later aspects of (+)RNA synthesis including RNA 5' capping (91). Antioxidant treatment or knock- down of specific oxidases inhibits genome replication by BMV, red clover necrotic mosaic virus, alphaviruses, and flaviviruses (92-94). Conversely, oxidant treatment in vitro or overexpression of specific oxidases in vivo enhances 5' RNA capping by the relevant viral capping enzymes. Disulfide-linked viral RNA capping protein multimers are formed in flavi- and alpha-like virus infections, and their abundance correlates with such oxidant-dependent capping activation (92, 94, 95).
u8nw | How viral RNA capping enzymes could access cellular oxidants was initially unclear be- cause these oxidants are compartmentalized within organellar lumens, while the relevant RCs (Figures 3 and 4) are spherules that connect via their membrane necks and crowns to the highly reduced cytosol (96). Recent studies showed that BMV RNA replication protein 1a, whose mul- tiple functions include RNA capping, permeabilizes the ER membranes on which BMV spherule RCs form, locally oxidizing the adjacent cytosol (94). The effects of 1a mutations and other re- sults suggest that this oxidation induces a 1a-1a disulfide-linked complex whose conformational changes activate la's RNA capping functions (94). These studies also mapped la's membrane- permeabilizing or viroporin functions to an amphipathic alpha-helix conserved among alpha-like viruses (11). Because flavivirus NS2 and picornavirus 2B (Figure 2) also permeabilize intracel- lular membranes (97), members of all three (+)RNA virus superfamilies have RNA replication factors with viroporin activity, whose release of oxidizing potential or other small molecules from secretory or organellar lumens may regulate later steps in RNA replication (91).
l2v9 | 4.3. Multiple RNA Replication Complex Outputs: Genomic RNAs, Subgenomic Messenger RNAs, and Recombination
afbe | The RCs of most (+)RNA viruses host multiple processes such as replicating different RNAs of multicomponent genomes, genomic and subgenomic RNA synthesis, and RNA recombination. Growing understanding of RC structure and compartmentalization enables more effective con- sideration of how these processes are regulated and whether individual RCs might be specialized for particular pathways or RNA templates.
78r8 | To express additional proteins from internal open reading frames, many (+)RNA viruses pro- duce subgenomic mRNAs corresponding to 5' truncated fragments of viral genomic (+)RNA. For BMV (Figure 2), and by inference other alphavirus-like viruses, in vitro and in vivo results show that subgenomic mRNAs are synthesized by (+)RNA initiation at alternate internal promoters on a full-length genomic (-)RNA template (98). While many regulatory questions remain, mutual interference between BMV genomic and subgenomic RNA synthesis suggests that both pathways may proceed on a common genomic (-)RNA template in a single spherule RC (99).
