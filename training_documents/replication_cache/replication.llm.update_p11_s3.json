        "content": "a0by | Particularly extensive parallels exist between genome replication in positive sense RNA virus RCs and double-stranded RNA viruses. The pathways and positive sense RNA slash double-stranded RNA replication intermediates appear identical. Indeed, positive sense RNA and double-stranded RNA virus life cycles are differentiated primarily by which replication intermediate is packaged in virions: positive sense RNA slash mRNA for positive sense RNA viruses, and the entire double-stranded RNA-containing RNA replication compartment or core for double-stranded RNA viruses. Positive sense RNA virus RC crowns also show intriguing parallels with ringed viral protein channels at the fivefold vertices of double-stranded RNA virus cores. Cystoviruses such as double-stranded RNA bacteriophage six assemble procapsids whose fivefold axes each bear an exterior hexamer of viral N T Pase P four. Similar to emerging models of nodavirus RC assembly, these P four hexamers serve as portals for active import of positive sense RNA genome templates and passive release of progeny positive sense RNA transcripts. Coronavirus DMVs also parallel these six capsids in bearing multiple hexameric crowns that are thought to serve as progeny RNA release channels and might serve as RNA template import channels.\nu1ky | Reoviruses, another family of double-stranded RNA viruses, have cores whose fivefold axes bear pentameric turrets that serve as release channels and five prime capping complexes for viral mRNAs. The viral protein A that forms nodavirus crowns also contains the viral RNA capping functions and may also five prime cap emerging nodavirus RNAs. Finally, paralleling the twelve-fold symmetry of nodavirus crowns, herpesviruses and many DNA bacteriophage use twelve-mer ringed portal protein complexes as import motors and release channels for their genomic DNA. Thus, positive sense RNA virus crowns share features with proteins from a wide range of viruses, which might represent links with common ancestors contributing to the evolution of crowns.\nhtm9 | Four point two. Dynamic Maturational Transitions of RNA Replication Complexes\n8hul | Results from many positive sense RNA viruses indicate that RCs are dynamic complexes that undergo sequential maturational changes and interact with a progression of viral and host interaction partners. Alphaviruses, for example, transition their RCs from negative sense RNA to positive sense RNA synthesis by viral N S P two protease processing of their N S P one two three four polyprotein. In an early step required for RNA synthesis, N S P two releases N S P fourpol from N S P one two three four during or immediately after polyprotein translation. The resulting N S P one two three and N S P fourpol complex is specialized for negative sense RNA synthesis, which as with nodaviruses is linked to spherule formation. Subsequently, negative sense RNA synthesis is inhibited and positive sense RNA synthesis promoted by cleavages that separate first N S P one from N S P two three, and then N S P two from N S P three. The timing of N S P one slash two cleavage appears optimized to allow conformational adjustments of N S P dash N S P interactions required for subsequent steps, including N S P two slash three cleavage.\n87vz | This alphavirus polyprotein processing takes on new meaning with the finding that N S P one assembles a twelve-mer ring that likely serves as a base for at least early N S P one two three and N S P one two three four complexes. Such high copy N S P one two three four multimers would have similarities to the twelve-fold symmetric, multi-domain nodavirus crowns and intriguing implications for functional\nym66 | issues such as intra- and intermolecular cleavages by N S P two and the need to proteolytically release N S P fourpol for RNA synthesis.\nl0a3 | Further indication of RC maturational changes emerged from recognition that alphavirus-like viruses, flaviviruses, and other Kitrinoviricota exploit cellular oxidizing functions to enable later aspects of positive sense RNA synthesis including RNA five prime capping. Antioxidant treatment or knockdown of specific oxidases inhibits genome replication by BMV, red clover necrotic mosaic virus, alphaviruses, and flaviviruses. Conversely, oxidant treatment in vitro or overexpression of specific oxidases in vivo enhances five prime RNA capping by the relevant viral capping enzymes. Disulfide-linked viral RNA capping protein multimers are formed in flavi- and alpha-like virus infections, and their abundance correlates with such oxidant-dependent capping activation.\nu8nw | How viral RNA capping enzymes could access cellular oxidants was initially unclear because these oxidants are compartmentalized within organellar lumens, while the relevant RCs are spherules that connect via their membrane necks and crowns to the highly reduced cytosol. Recent studies showed that BMV RNA replication protein one a, whose multiple functions include RNA capping, permeabilizes the E R membranes on which BMV spherule RCs form, locally oxidizing the adjacent cytosol. The effects of one a mutations and other results suggest that this oxidation induces a one a-one a disulfide-linked complex whose conformational changes activate one's RNA capping functions. These studies also mapped one's membrane-permeabilizing or viroporin functions to an amphipathic alpha-helix conserved among alpha-like viruses. Because flavivirus N S two and picornavirus two B also permeabilize intracellular membranes, members of all three positive sense RNA virus superfamilies have RNA replication factors with viroporin activity, whose release of oxidizing potential or other small molecules from secretory or organellar lumens may regulate later steps in RNA replication.\nl2v9 | Four point three. Multiple RNA Replication Complex Outputs: Genomic RNAs, Subgenomic Messenger RNAs, and Recombination\nafbe | The RCs of most positive sense RNA viruses host multiple processes such as replicating different RNAs of multicomponent genomes, genomic and subgenomic RNA synthesis, and RNA recombination. Growing understanding of RC structure and compartmentalization enables more effective consideration of how these processes are regulated and whether individual RCs might be specialized for particular pathways or RNA templates.\n78r8 | To express additional proteins from internal open reading frames, many positive sense RNA viruses produce subgenomic mRNAs corresponding to five prime truncated fragments of viral genomic positive sense RNA. For BMV, and by inference other alphavirus-like viruses, in vitro and in vivo results show that subgenomic mRNAs are synthesized by positive sense RNA initiation at alternate internal promoters on a full-length genomic negative sense RNA template. While many regulatory questions remain, mutual interference between BMV genomic and subgenomic RNA synthesis suggests that both pathways may proceed on a common genomic negative sense RNA template in a single spherule RC.",
