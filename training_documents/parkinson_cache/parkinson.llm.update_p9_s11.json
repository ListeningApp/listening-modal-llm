Under physiological conditions, autophagy plays a crucial role in clearing unwanted proteins, as well as damaged mitochondria through a targeted mechanism called mitophagy. Loss-of-function mutations in PINK1 and Parkin result in recessively-inherited early-onset PD and significantly, both genes were discovered to be essential for mitophagy. PINK1 is a serine/threonine protein kinase that acts as a surveillance molecule for mitochondrial health and accumulates on the outer membrane of abnormal mitochondria. PINK1 attracts recruitment of Parkin to damaged mitochondria, which through its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, coats the mitochondria with ubiquitin triggering autophagosomes to engulf the mitochondria, culminating in lysosomal degradation. Discoveries of PINK1 and Parkin mutations were the first genes to shed\ny51p | Four point two. Synaptic autophagy and axonal transport: a road less travelled in PD research\nx95m | light on the direct involvement of autophagy and E-L system in PD pathogenesis. These observations also helped in validating previous neurotoxic studies which identified mitochondrial dysfunction as one of the primary causes of neurodegeneration. Though the symptoms are indistinguishable from sporadic cases, several studies on brains of PD patients with Parkin mutations do not show alpha-synuclein aggregation and Lewy body pathology. Only one report suggests PINK1-linked parkinsonism to be associated with Lewy pathology. This prompts us to speculate if there are alternative neuropathological cascades in PD that are alpha-synuclein independent but centered around the E-L system. In addition to their well-defined roles in mitophagy, Parkin was identified to modulate E-L system through Rab seven ubiquitination, whereas PINK1 phosphorylates some Rab proteins. It is also worth noting that several of these rab proteins regulate mitochondrial dynamics and quality control independent of Parkin/PINK1. Parkin mutations are also known to directly affect retromer recruitment and interact strongly with VPS thirty-five by ubiquinating it. Parkin binds to endophilin A and functions in its ubiquitination. Parkin also ubiquitinates EPS fifteen to regulate epidermal growth factor receptors and phosphoinositide three-kinase-Akt signaling that plays a role in neuronal survival. These developments suggest mitophagy-independent routes these proteins may take towards PD. Further investigations of Parkin and PINK1 in this direction might provide crucial insights in understanding neurodegenerative mechanisms that are Lewy-body independent.\nyfum | Alpha-synuclein aggregates initially in presynaptic termini, where the protein is enriched. Alpha-synuclein aggregates are a major target for autophagy-mediated degradation. In both genetic and sporadic PD, aggregated alpha-synuclein is likely to enhance autophagosome formation to meet the higher demand for its degradation. Once threshold reaches beyond compensatory limits, mutant/overexpressed alpha-synuclein starts to accumulate, turning detrimental to cellular homeostasis. In fact, A fifty-three T and A thirty P alpha-synuclein mutants blocked their own uptake and other substrates by lysosomes for degradation through the chaperone-mediated autophagy pathway in vitro. Dopamine-modified alpha-synuclein is identified to further exacerbate this process, which may explain the selective vulnerability of dopaminergic neurons in PD. A recent study on mammalian cells and transgenic mice shows that alpha-synuclein overexpression mediated autophagy defects are exerted through Rab one A inhibition. Further understanding of the mechanisms for alpha-synuclein-autophagy crosstalk in PD might have crucial therapeutic applications. Backing this notion, both in vitro and in vivo studies show that enhancing autophagy and autophagosome-lysosome fusion could ameliorate PD-like features by clearing aggregated alpha-synuclein.\nppx4 | Several other PD causing genes associated with the E-L system exert their pathological effects through impairing synaptic autophagy. The R two fifty-eight Q SynJ one mutation directly affects autophagosome biogenesis and maturation at synaptic terminals of flies and neurites of\nqf11 | human iPSC derived neurons. The observation of dopaminergic neuronal loss in these flies suggests autophagosome generation defects as one of the possible mechanisms through which SynJ one mutations lead to dopaminergic neurodegeneration and PD. Presynaptic endocytic membrane bending protein endophilin A also has functions in providing docking sites for autophagy proteins and facilitating autophagosome expansion. This is achieved by phosphorylation of endophilin A-BAR domain by LRRK two, as noted in a fly model. Congruent to these observations, mice lacking endophilin A revealed deficiency in autophagosome formation and developed a Parkinsonian phenotype. These studies, along with recent finding of clathrin involvement in autophagy regulation, suggest a cooperative crosstalk between SV endocytosis and autophagy.\n8oqt | Macromolecules and organelles in the presynaptic terminal travel a long distance from the soma, making them old and vulnerable. Rapid turnover of proteins, membranes, receptors, and vesicles in the pre-synapse assigns autophagy a major role in maintaining synaptic homeostasis. This tasks synaptic autophagy with quality control responsibilities. Though there is compelling evidence that compromised autophagy contributes to PD, these studies primarily looked at the soma from a proteinopathy or mitophagy perspective. Selective inactivation of autophagy by conditional knockout of autophagy protein ATG seven in dopaminergic neurons leads to enhanced dopamine release and rapid presynaptic recovery with abnormal axonal profiles. Conversely, autophagy enhancement through mTOR inhibition slows dopamine release, reduces the number of synaptic vesicles, and increases autophagosome density in the axons. These results emphasize the importance of synaptic autophagy in normal dopamine transmission and further evaluation is warranted to understand if additional synaptic autophagy defects exist, which may lead to PD pathogenesis.\n```",
