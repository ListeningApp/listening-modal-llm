        "content": "90no | intracellular calcium levels, influencing flow-induced, anti-atherogenic and pro-atherogenic responses, such as cell alignment. NOTCH1 mediates stable flow-induced cellular alignment, suppression of cell proliferation and maintenance of cell-cell junctional integrity, and protects against atherosclerosis development. These effects have been suggested to be controlled by tension-induced NOTCH1 signalling and modulation of intracellular calcium levels. However, another study showed that shear stress-mediated activation of the NOTCH1 response requires PIEZO1, warranting additional clarification regarding the mechanosensory role of NOTCH1. G protein-coupled receptors, such as the proton-sensing GPR68, undergo conformational changes in response to flow in endothelial cells, mediating shear-induced calcium influx. Plexin D one, potentially in connection with the junctional mechanosensory complex, mediates flow-dependent atherosclerosis development by regulating calcium uptake, phosphorylation of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor two, AKT, eNOS, ERK one and ERK two, as well as induction of the major flow-sensitive transcription factors, Krüppel-like factor two and KLF four.\njt0y | In cell-cell junctions, platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule, VE-cadherin and VEGFR two form the junctional mechanosensory complex, which mediates integrin activation, cellular alignment and eNOS activation in response to stable flow via PI three K-AKT signalling. On the basal surface of endothelial cells, flow induces conformational activation and expression changes in extracellular matrix-binding integrin mechanosensors. Stable flow activates the integrin alpha v beta three, causing increased binding to the extracellular matrix and inactivation of downstream RHO signalling. In addition,\nqb7o | mechanosensors. Mechanosignal transduction pathways include the PI three K-AKT pathway, ERK one-ERK two pathway, YAP-TAZ pathway and the RHO signalling pathway. Many mechanosignal transduction pathways result in activation of transcription factors including Krüppel-like factor two and KLF four, nuclear factor-KB and hypoxia-inducible factor one alpha. EndMT, endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition; eNOS, endothelial nitric oxide synthase; FAK, focal adhesion kinase; JAM, junctional adhesion molecule; NRF two, nuclear factor erythroid two-related factor two; ROS, reactive oxygen species; SOX thirteen, transcription factor SOX thirteen.\noae5 | the actin cytoskeleton in the cytosol has been shown to serve as a mechanosensory structure.\ns0fl | Flow mechanosensing in endothelial cells activates numerous early-to-intermediate (seconds to minutes) cell signalling pathways that lead to long-term (hours to days) atheroprotective or pro-atherogenic processes. However, it is important to note that both pro-atherogenic disturbed flow and atheroprotective stable flow often activate many of the same early-to-intermediate signalling pathways, especially in in vitro studies. For example, stable flow transiently activates NF-KB signalling without leading to long-term endothelial inflammation, whereas disturbed flow induces persistent NF-KB activation resulting in endothelial inflammation. The mechanisms that distinguish these flow-pattern-dependent activation pathways, especially in vitro, are not well understood and remain crucial knowledge gaps that need to be filled. This uncertainty is due in part to the common experimental strategy of conducting in vitro studies with endothelial cells cultured under no-flow conditions that are suddenly subjected to stable flow or disturbed flow. Under these conditions, early-to-intermediate responses might overlap with common adaptative changes in response to altered mechanical cues regardless of flow patterns and magnitudes. With this caveat in mind, we review the literature that provides crucial knowledge in understanding flow-dependent endothelial cell mechanosignal transduction pathways.\n43ia | PIEZO one mediates both atheroprotective and pro-atherogenic flow-dependent endothelial cell responses. PIEZO one mechanosensing of stable flow induces intracellular calcium influx, leading to ATP\n3g2y | release and eNOS activation and the production of the atheroprotective and vasorelaxant nitric oxide from endothelial cells. The PIEZO one-induced effect on ATP is mediated by the P two Y two and Gag/eleven pathways, which activate AKT, which in turn activates eNOS. PIEZO one also mediates pro-atherogenic endothelial responses of disturbed flow. Disturbed flow stimulates NF-KB activity and endothelial inflammation via PIEZO one Gag/eleven-mediated integrin activation, which in turn activates the focal adhesion kinase. Endothelial cell-targeted deletion of Piezo one in Ldlr-knockout mice inhibited atherosclerotic plaque development in disturbed flow regions, suggesting a pro-atherogenic role of PIEZO one in endothelial cells.\ngc7v | Plexin D one is another mechanosensor that responds to both stable flow and disturbed flow, mediating both atheroprotective and pro-atherogenic responses, respectively. Knockdown of Plxnd one, which encodes plexin D one, in mouse endothelial cells inhibits atheroprotective signal transduction pathways, such as eNOS activation, cell alignment and KLF two and KLF four expression in response to stable flow. Interestingly, Plxnd one knockout in endothelial cells also prevents pro-atherogenic inflammatory responses, including expression of VCAM one and CCL two in response to disturbed flow. Endothelial cell-specific knockout of Plxnd one in mice prevented atherosclerosis development in arterial regions with disturbed flow but exacerbated plaque development in arterial regions with stable flow. These results suggest that plexin D one is a mechanosensor with dual functions depending on blood flow patterns.\nwqfv | Junctional mechanosensory complex\nj30a | Stable flow stimulates eNOS activation through the mechanosensory complex formed by PECAM one, VE-cadherin and VEGFR two or VEGFR three, which in turn activates the PI three K-AKT pathway. Stable flow also induces integrin alpha v beta three and NF-KB activation through the junctional mechanosensory complex. However, Pecam one knockout in mice prevents endothelial inflammation and atherosclerosis in arterial regions with disturbed flow. This finding suggests that PECAM one is a mechanosensor that mediates pro-atherogenic effects of disturbed flow in vivo.\n7bdk | Integrins\nfim0 | Integrin activation in response to stable flow inactivates RHO GTPases through RHO-like GTPase signalling. RHOA inactivation promotes YAP phosphorylation (at Serine one hundred twenty-seven and Serine three hundred eighty-one) in the cytoplasm to maintain an atheroprotective endothelial cell phenotype. These interactions between integrins and RHO GTPases further activate RAC, leading to the assembly of the junctional mechanosensory complexes. Additionally, the RHO GTPase CDC forty-two is polarized and activated in an integrin-dependent manner and subsequently regulates the polarity of the microtubule-organizing centre. Under disturbed flow conditions, the cooperation between RGD-binding integrins (including alpha five beta one and alpha v beta three integrins) and fibronectin has been shown to drive pro-inflammatory signal transduction involving the nuclear translocation of NF-KB, YAP and serine/threonine-protein kinase PAK.\nojro | Flow-sensitive transcription factors",
