Equation eighty-eight can be discretized in the chi direction and become a set of coupled ODEs that can be solved in the k direction in order to obtain a numerical solution.\nzhvt | It is important to note that equation eighty-eight is identical to the flow of the effective potential that corresponds to the equilibrium Boltzmann distribution, see and A P pendix C with R to k k.

B. Wave Function Renormalisation\n9lvu | In the previous subsection we assumed that the effective action Gamma sub k only depends on the renormalisation scale through the form of the potential. We now allow for the field varphi itself to be renormalised which results in a scaling. The new effective action in the SUSY formalism is:\nuy7a | Gamma sub k left parenthesis phi, bar psi, psi right parenthesis equals integral d t one-half Z sub comma phi squared dot phi squared plus one-half left parenthesis W sub comma phi over Z sub comma phi right parenthesis squared minus i bar psi left parenthesis Z sub comma phi squared partial sub t plus Z sub comma phi Z sub comma phi phi dot phi minus Z sub comma phi phi W sub comma phi over Z sub comma phi plus W sub comma phi phi right parenthesis psi.\nlqs6 | where we have suppressed the explicit dependence on k of W and Z to avoid overly cluttered notation. From now on we will in general drop this explicit dependence on k for W, V, Z and zeta, defined below, only restoring it when we are directly comparing it to the original cutoff value.
