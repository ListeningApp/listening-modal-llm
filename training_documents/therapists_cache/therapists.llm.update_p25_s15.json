        "content": "05y4 | Much more can be accomplished interpersonally if a therapist shifts modes clearly and intentionally by applying interpersonal reasoning. When shifting modes, three powerful techniques may be used to separate the communication of one mode from another. The first involves\n2fb0 | between the two phrases or sentences that characterize the different modes, the more likely it is that the client will understand that a different approach to communication is being used. The second concerns body language. If appropriate within the therapeutic context, the therapist should move to a different part of the room, change posture, or, if appropriate, shift the therapeutic activity to mark the new idea being communicated. The third involves announcing one's intention to shift modes to the client. Ideally, any two or, if appropriate, all three of these techniques will maximize the likelihood that the mode shift will take place in a way that the client fully understands that a different approach to communication is being used.\ns9fn | In the example about the client with alcoholism, the therapist could have applied any three of these techniques to shift modes cleanly, improving the clarity and intentionality of communication with the client. If the therapist would have used the pausing technique, she would have taken considerable time to listen to and understand the client's perspective on alcohol use, asking a few additional deepening questions to better understand what initiated and is sustaining the addiction, if appropriate. Then, after the therapist received some nonverbal or verbal indication from the client indicating that she has felt fully seen and heard, the therapist would shift into an instructing\nk5r6 | mode in an attempt to communicate her perspective of educating the client about her balance. If the therapist also applied the second technique involving body language, she could have walked across the room to sit in a different chair and before shifting into the instructing mode. Applying the third technique, the therapist could have stated: \"Now that I have learned a little more about why drinking is important to you, I feel an obligation to switch modes and talk with you about some of the possible consequences of your drinking in terms of your overall functioning.\"\nz9v9 | These and other suggestions for ensuring that each of the modes a therapist selects are received as intended are summarized in the following list:\ngpu9 | Announce the mode shift to the client, if appropriate.\nu5ws | When shifting, let as much time pass between modes as appropriate. This may involve seconds or minutes, depending upon what is appropriate.\nonkh | Shift your body language or the task or activity to earmark your shift in the mode of communication being used.\n8t55 | Think about what message you believe the client needs to hear at the moment and remain utterly loyal to that message. Apply the same process for the new mode upon shifting.\n7imw | Seek justification through interpersonal reasoning for why it is therapeutic for the client to receive the new mode. Is the mode appropriate for the client's interpersonal characteristics and for any interpersonal events of the moment? If you are confident about the appropriateness of the mode, it will be easier to convey that confidence when communicating with the client within the mode.\nlf1t | Take responsibility for what you say or ask of a client, even if you are communicating in a mode that feels interpersonally risky or outside of your own comfort zone. Additional examples of ways in which therapists have drawn upon the various therapeutic modes to manage various interpersonal events in practice are included in later chapters.\ntze7 | Therapeutic Style: Using the Modes\nryvv | modes more often than others when treating clients. Accordingly, they develop a therapeutic style, or a skill set that incorporates the therapeutic modes they view as being maximally therapeutic for their clients.\nzdrh | For example, Jane Melton describes herself as having a \"natural optimistic belief in people\" and as drawing upon her determination, patience, and ability to empathize and listen to clients reflectively as well as her honesty, tact, resilience, and gentleness when providing feedback and working with clients. Although Jane utilizes several interpersonal modes and adapts them thoughtfully depending on the unique needs of each client, her self-description indicates that she draws most heavily on her natural hope and optimism, her belief in her clients' capacity for autonomy and independence, her self-discipline as it manifests in the form of patience, her preference for listening and understanding over activity-focusing or rushing into doing, and her overall gentleness of style. To summarize this in terms of mode, empathizing, collaborating, and encouraging are Jane's primary modes of interaction.\nosmo | However, we saw earlier in this chapter that she also uses the advocating mode to ensure that her clients receive the entitlements they deserve, such as fully accessible housing. Although Jane mostly uses the empathizing, collaborating, and encouraging modes, she maintains and utilizes additional modes as required by the unique demands of any given client or therapeutic situation. As an experienced therapist, Jane possesses a broad repertoire of therapeutic modes.\n0b8v | Broadening One's Repertoire of Modes: A Central Objective of the Intentional Relationship Model\nfucs | The broader the repertoire of modes a therapist can draw upon to adjust to clients' various interpersonal presentations and demands, the more likely it is that the therapist can function effectively with even the most resistant and interpersonally challenging clients. Because therapists' personalities are relatively stable, it is a natural inclination for them to invoke modes that fall within their \"comfort zone.\" For example, a person who is reserved, quiet, and mostly other-oriented during most social interactions likely feels more comfortable in the empathizing and collaborative modes (i.e., empathizing with and listening to clients, allowing them to take the lead in therapy, and facilitating their independence, autonomy, and choice).\nyply | This same therapist may feel less comfortable working with passive clients or those who require a therapist to be more directive, assertive, frank, evaluative, or even appropriately confrontational.\n75n5 | Conversely, a therapist who is extroverted, comfortable asserting her needs in relationships, and self-assured in sharing her knowledge with others may find it relatively easy to be directive, assertive, frank, evaluative, or even confrontational with her clients. This therapist's preferred modes may be the instructing and problem-solving modes. However, a therapist such as this one may unwittingly undermine a client's autonomy and choice; he or she may lack patience, may pace the therapy too quickly, or may be vulnerable to becoming involved in power struggles with clients who behave in resistant or confrontational ways.\nec91 | Any preferred mode that falls within our comfort zone has a benefit and a downside. Moreover, one's preferred modes do not work for all clients or in all circumstances. To function with as much intentionality in therapeutic relationships as possible, therapists have a responsibility to extend their capacity to function within a wide range of interpersonal modes during therapy. A more extensive repertoire of interpersonal modes allows you to communicate more effectively with a wider range of clients. More specifically, it allows you to respond to clients in ways that more accurately address their interpersonal needs. Accurately identifying each client's preference for therapeutic interaction and responding in ways that meet each client's interpersonal preferences conveys to our clients that we are willing to interact and work with them in their comfort zones rather than in our own.\nwul6 | Adjusting our own responses to the covert or expressed interpersonal needs of each client is possible only if we possess the capacity to exhibit a wide enough range of interpersonal behaviors in therapy. When we draw on ways of interacting that are inconsistent with our values or that we simply have not learned or practiced as often in social situations, we are immediately forced out of our own interpersonal comfort zones. However, the departure from our own comfort zone is sometimes the only means by which it is possible to enter the interpersonal worlds of our clients.\n4rhy | For example, Michele Shapiro works with pediatric clients, some of whom are nonverbal and severely developmentally disabled.
