The final multi-dimensional joint model in Stage Four can be built using an ML algorithm, such as neural networks, which uses the most relevant variables from each omics models from Stage Three. This approach allows the analysis of the improvement in the predictive power for individual models and also finds the best discriminating features.\nnmn2 | The different model-based integration methods can be further classed as follows.\ng3tm | Four point two point one. Supervised learning model-based methods\ntfra | Model-based supervised learning methods include a variety of frameworks for developing a model, such as majority-based voting, hierarchical classifiers and ensemble-based approaches, such as XGBoost and KNN.\n5lm9 | Deep learning methods have also been adopted for model-based supervised learning. MOLI, multi-omics late integration, method used type-specific encoding sub-networks to learn features from somatic mutation, CNA, and gene expression data independently and then later concatenated them for predicting the response to a given drug. Lee has proposed a deep learning-based auto-encoding approach for integrating four omics to create a survival prediction model. Also, HI- DFNForest hierarchical integration deep flexible neural forest framework was developed which uses a stacked auto- encoder to learn high-level representations from three omic datasets. Later, these representations are integrated to predict cancer subtype classification. Similarly, Chaudhary has used autoencoders along with SVM for survival prediction in subgroups of hepatocellular carcinoma.\nwp2c | In the past years, ATHENA, Analysis Tool for Heritable and Environmental Network Associations, was developed for analysing multi- omics data. It uses grammatical evolution neural networks along with Biofilter and Random Jungle to investigate different categorical and quantitative variables and develop prediction models.\nus5v | Recently, MOSAE, Multi-omics Supervised Autoencoder, was developed for pan-cancer analysis and compared with conventional ML methods such as SVM, DT, na√Øve Bayes, KNN, RF and AdaBoost. Similarly, Denoising autoencoder has been incorporated along with L one-penalized logistic regression for identifying ovarian cancer subtypes.\nrs2m | Four point two point two. Unsupervised learning model-based methods\nuz9y | Various model-based unsupervised learning methods have been implemented in the past. PSDF, Patient-Specific Data Fusion, is a non-parametric Bayesian model for clustering prognostic cancer subtypes by combining gene expression and copy number variation data. It uses a two-step process and limits the integration to only two datatypes. Similarly, CONEXIC also uses a BN to integrate gene expression and copy number variation from tumour\n8ov0 | samples to identify driver mutations. On the other hand, clustering methods such as FCA, Formal Concept Analysis, consensus clustering, MDI, Multiple Dataset Integration, PINS, Perturbation clustering for data integration and disease subtyping, PINS Plus and BCC, Bayesian consensus clustering, are more flexible and allow late-stage integration of clusters.\nmj9m | Different network-based methods are also available for association analysis. Lemon-Tree implemented ensemble methods for reconstructing module networks which used somatic copy number alterations and gene expression in brain tumour samples. Furthermore, SNF, Similarity Network Fusion, constructs networks of samples for respective data type and then effectively fuses them into a joint network which denotes the complete range of original data. It combines mRNA expression, DNA methylation and microRNA, miRNA, expression data from cancer datasets.\n94h3 | Four point three. Transformation-based integration methods\n9jx1 | Transformation-based integration methods transform each of the omics datasets firstly into graphs or kernel matrices and then combine all of them into one before constructing a model.\nc3lz | Graphs provide a formal means to transform and portray relationships between different omics samples where the nodes and edges of a graph represent the subjects and their relationships, respectively. Similarly, Kernel methods enable the transformation of data from its original space into a higher dimensional feature space. These methods then explore linear decision functions in the feature space which were non-linear in the original space.\n8bwk | The transformation-based integrative methods can be classed as follows.\nez9s | Four point three point one. Supervised learning transformation-based methods\nmqot | In the past, various transformation-based supervised learning methods have been presented. Most of them are kernel and graph-based algorithms. The kernel-based integration approaches include SDP-SVM, Semi-Definite Programming SVM, FSMKL, Multiple Kernel Learning with Feature Selection, RVM, Relevance Vector Machine and Ada-boost RVM. Moreover, fMKL-DR, fast multiple kernel learning for dimensionality reduction, has been used along with SVM for combining gene expression, miRNA expression, and DNA methylation data. Similarly, the graph-based integration approaches consist of graph-based semi-supervised learning, graph sharpening, composite network and BN.\noc99 | Overall, it is evident from the literature that kernel-based algorithms have superior performance to graph-based approaches, but they usually need more time for the training phase. In contrast, graph-based approaches can disclose the relations between samples while taking less computation time.\ngipz | comparison between different graph- and kernel-based integration approaches in a supervised learning context using various standardized test datasets. It highlights the better classification performance of RVM, Ada- boost RVM and SDP-SVM in comparison to semi-supervised learning, graph sharpening, composite network and BN.\nb4wj | Recently, MORONET, Multi-Omics gRaph convolutional NETworks, is introduced, which use graph convolutional networks taking benefit of the omics features and the associations among patients, as defined by the patient similarity networks, for better classification results.\n5xlt | Four point three point two.
