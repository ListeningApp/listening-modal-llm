You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

kpvt | Narrative interviews, in which the informants make sense of their experiences about the implementation of the client information system, are particularly useful as they allow the researchers the opportunity to explore beyond the implementation process as such. In addition, the hidden aspects, emotions and thoughts underlying the felt meanings and lived experiences that ordinary discourse sometimes fails to engage with can be addressed (Allen, 2017; Charmaz, 2006). The aim of the narrative interviews is to give voice, time and possibilities for the informants to express and reflect on their experiences about the studied phenomenon, connecting the past, present and future at the point of telling (Hyvärinen, 2016; Rossi, 2021). In practice, researcher asked open-ended questions so that the informants could reflect on and make sense of the experiences they have had and the expectations they hold to provide examples of situations where experiences took place and how they acted, felt and thought about what has happened (Charmaz, 2006; Hyvärinen, 2016).
jie2 | The phenomenon-driven, interpretive analysis was aimed at gaining understanding about how the professionals justified their actions, decisions and choices
d0ik | in their everyday work about the usage and implementation of the new information system. Therefore, a five-step coding scheme was utilized to systematically describe the meaning of the qualitative data (Gläser & Laudel, 2013; Rossi, 2021):
0x0s | 1. In the first data-driven step of the analysis process, the relevant and meaningful passages from the transcribed data are marked to capture the meaning of the told experiences.
4exe | 2. These meaningful passages are paraphrased in the second step, staying close to the original expressions of the informants in order to ensure data-driven analysis.
0myz | 3. In the third step, the third-level categories are formed by summarizing similar paraphrases. This step can also be regarded as clustering the meanings of the relevant paraphrases. Maintaining the informants' original experiences without interpretation is crucial at this step of the analysis process.
xh3i | 4. In the fourth step the second-level categories are generated by clustering the third- level categories based on their similarities. In this step, theoretically informed concepts can be utilized to interpret and understand the lived experience.
syiw | 5. The fifth and final step is structuring the recently formulated second-level categories under the first-level categories. In this step, the theoretical concepts suitable for explaining the phenomena and experiences play an important role, and the process progresses from a data-driven to a theory-driven analysis. Yet, instead of testing theories, this step focuses on understanding the experiences related to the phenomena under study and through this, exploring what may be helpful to further develop the theoretical and analytical framework.
kg3t | Altogether, 148 third-level categories, 22 second-level categories, and finally, six first- level categories were formed during the analysis.
lvae | In practice, data analysis is always an iterative process alternating between data, analysis and theorizing (Cunliffe & Coupland, 2011; Eisenhardt, 1989; Strauss & Corbin, 1998). To conclude, the research approach relies on the interpretation of experiences of the professionals about the implementation of the new information system and the ability of the case study to identify the being as the logics and mechanisms of institutional arrangements (the ontological dimension) behind the doing as the observed action (the epistemological dimension).
o9sc | Results
121u | Next, we will explore how the professionals experienced the implementation and usage of the new patient information system. The findings reveal that (1) lack of knowledge and practical relevance created uncertainty about how to use the IS in practice; (2) unlearning old practices and operational logic of the previously used IS was seen difficult; (3) attitudes, beliefs and lack of support guided the street-level bureaucrats' expectations towards the implementation process; (4) implementation happened individually during the everyday work practices; (5) ensuring the interaction and engaging with the clients guided the ways street-level bureaucrats used IS in practice; and (6) technical, organizational and institutional aspects affected the implementation process.
zh03 | Lack of knowledge and practical relevance (created uncertainty about how to use the IS in practice)
1mvw | When remembering the time prior to the implementation, the street-level workers recognized a need to familiarize oneself with the IS to reduce uncertainty. They had experienced uncertainty because they did not know what to expect from the new technology. The fear was that they lacked knowledge and skills to use the IS in practice, causing hesitation and negative interpretations about the new IS. In addition, the street- level workers were worried that the IS would be too heavily reliant to the logic of healthcare services.
6d4s | Just because we were the first group [who implemented the new IS in social services] and none of us knew. There was not, what the second and third groups have, that they already know that someone has used it and that they have survived, and we will also survive ... We didn't know what to expect ... although we had used the test system at the trainings, but then, it is just not the same than using the actual system. (H2).
mqah | There was a time gap between the training sessions and the actual implementation of the new IS. The version of the IS used at the training sessions was not completed, causing frustration and lack of trust towards the IS. To ensure the practical relevance of the trainings, the street-level workers emphasized a need to get accustomed with the features and functions of the IS which is eventually implemented. After the training the IS was developed further. Thus, the workers were expecting the implementation with hesitation and even fear. When the implementation finally took place after several months, the IS
xxr8 | seemed difficult due to the changes made, and because the street-level workers had already forgotten what they had learned.
rl4j | Overall, the street-level workers' experience was that the training sessions were too abstract, and it was, for them, difficult to understand how they would be using the new IS in practice during their everyday work. Thus, the training sessions lacked practical relevance which would have fostered the implementation and usage of the IS. Looking back at the time of the interviews, the street-level workers stated that they lacked motivation to learn the IS at the training sessions.
vz32 | Unlearning old practices and operational logic (of the previously used IS was seen difficult)
ncb0 | Prior and also during the implementation, the comparison of the operational logics of the old and new IS' caused uncertainty and frustration among the street-level workers. The workers wondered whether the newly recruited staff was in a better position because they did not have expertise about the previously used IS and, therefore, learning to use the new IS would be easier for them. Thus, without experience of the previous systems there is no need to unlearn old practices.
8mp0 | A: I think that it might just be that ... when you have used a certain system for tens of years, it is then difficult to give up, like I said that it [the old IS] affected even the language they used and the ways one made sense of their work. And this relates to the old IS.
xjyk | Q: It [the implementation] might have been more difficult for those who have unlearned the old ...?
mt0f | A: Yes. Versus me who came in as a new and takes over the new IS. (H7)
awab | The overall impression was that the previously used IS did not guide the work practices, were much more simplistic and, thus, easier to use because workers knew where to find the information needed and how to navigate the system. Due to this simplicity, the previous information systems were also seen as outdated.
ixcc | Our old system was, like, really old [laughs] and really simple. You couldn't do anything with it, like there were perhaps three things that you could do there. It was really simple. And this was a good and bad thing about it, of course. And what was difficult at least for me was that Apotti was so versatile, even too
