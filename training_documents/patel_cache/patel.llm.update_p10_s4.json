        "content": "y2qo | State court was well suited to Patel's strengths as an attorney, his former colleagues told me. He was personable and quick on his feet, and adept at \"marketing\" and \"presenting\" himself. After a few years, however, Patel moved to the federal public defender's office in Miami. There, the work was more complex, more writing- and research-intensive. Despite some successes, he developed a reputation for \"style over substance,\" a former colleague said-one he seemed aware of but not terribly motivated to change. \"He always was like, 'Look, I'm really good at trial skill. But all of this reading and writing and arguing about, like, the intricacies of the law-I'm not really interested,'\" a second former colleague recalled.\n1piq | \"I'm not saying he wasn't capable of it,\" this person added. \"But I think he always liked being the face.\"\n7fqw | Patel seemed caught between a brewing resentment of elites and an abiding desire to be seen as one.\nrhaz | Transcripts from Patel's cases reveal a lawyer comfortable before the bench, many of his presentations sharp and clever and peppered with flatteries for Your Honor. \"Judge, I think you hit it on the head last week.\" They were also embroidered with performative modesties: \"On my best day, I'm an average defense attorney\"; \"I'm not a mathematician, but ... \"; \"I'm not saying I'm a Spanish expert, Judge, but ... \"; \"I know I've been doing this by far the shortest time of any lawyer sitting here.\"\nwak1 | Many times, this worked. \"There were certain judges that he kind of had magic in front of,\" the second former colleague said.\nwtfz | This former colleague began to notice flashes of grievance in the young attorney, but they didn't seem grounded in politics so much as insecurity. This person recalled that when Patel would ask for help on legal research, he would occasionally offer some version of Well, thank God I talked to someone who is book smart and went to all the right schools and checked all the right boxes. \"He would always phrase it like a compliment, but there was an edge to it.\"\nqy1i | It became clear that Patel did kind of have a chip on his shoulder, this former colleague said-that he seemed caught between a brewing resentment of elites and an abiding desire to be seen as one.\n1k9e | By early twenty fourteen, Patel had left Miami to become a federal prosecutor in Washington, D.C. He'd landed a job in the counterterrorism section of the Justice Department's National Security Division. Yet in Patel's telling, what\n5bjs | This education began with Benghazi.\nuodj | Patel was one of the attorneys from the main Justice Department office who assisted the U.S. Attorney's Office in Washington in pursuing foreign militants for the September eleven, two thousand twelve, attacks that killed four Americans. In his book, Patel writes that as the Justice Department moved to bring the Benghazi terrorists to court, \"I was leading the prosecution's efforts at Main Justice.\" He claims that he proceeded to watch firsthand as senior DOJ leadership and other Obama officials-\"political gangsters, frauds, and hypocrites\" such as Attorney General Eric Holder and his successor, Loretta Lynch-chose to \"go soft\" on the terrorists by prosecuting only one perpetrator. It was for this reason, Patel writes-a lack of trust in the prosecution's decisions-that when his supervisors asked him to join the trial team itself, he declined.\nk16v | When I put this version of events to three people familiar with the prosecution, I was met with astonishment. One of these people said simply: \"Good God.\"\nb2lm | Although Patel was Main Justice's representative on the case for a period, the U.S. Attorney's Office led the prosecution, they said. The department prosecuted a single suspect, they added, because he was the only one the government had been able to capture. DOJ later prosecuted a second suspect, and reportedly brought charges against multiple others. Patel was tasked with coordinating approvals for warrants and indictments, among other responsibilities. Moreover, he did not decline an invitation to join the team working on the actual trial; according to two of his former DOJ colleagues, he was never asked. After clashing with the U.S. Attorney's Office, he was removed from the case altogether. Patel denied this, saying he was simply reassigned to a different position.\nti7f | What all parties seem to agree on is that the young attorney had grown bitter toward the system that had employed him for the better part of his career. And an unexpected\noksu | Kash Patel Will Do Anything for Trump - The Atlantic confrontation in Texas transformed the building friction into a personal declaration of war.\nwtow | In January twenty sixteen, Patel traveled to Tajikistan to interview witnesses for an Islamic State-related case. While he was there, a federal judge in Houston scheduled a surprise hearing in another terrorism case Patel was involved in. He had less than twenty-four hours to make it to Texas, and having brought only slacks and a blazer on his trip, he contacted the local U.S. Attorney's Office asking for a tie. But when Patel finally arrived at the courthouse, for reasons that remain in dispute, there was no tie.\no22k | Judge Lynn Nettleton Hughes lost it. \"If you want to be a lawyer, dress like a lawyer,\" Hughes snapped in chambers. \"Act like a lawyer.\" Hughes proceeded to berate Patel as \"just one more nonessential employee from Washington.\" \"What is the utility to me and to the people of America to have you fly down here at their expense?\" he said. \"You don't add a bit of value, do you?\" The judge dismissed Patel from chambers.\nnwfz | Patel's bosses were furious on his behalf. Hughes, then seventy-four, had a history of eruptions in court, including disturbing remarks about race. Three years earlier, an Indian American plaintiff had tried but failed to have the judge removed from his discrimination case after Hughes held forth in a pretrial conference on Adolf Hitler's use of swastikas, the origin of Caucasians and the futility of diversity programs at universities, the Texas Observer reported. DOJ officials' attempts to get a transcript of the Patel exchange only enraged Hughes further; the judge issued an \"Order on Ineptitude\" castigating the \"pretentious lawyers\" at Main Justice.\nnvfy | The Washington Post included all of this in a report on the incident. In the article, Patel comes across as a sympathetic figure. But the Justice Department chose not to comment, and for Patel, this was what counted. He writes in his book that, although his superiors privately praised him for keeping a level head, they \"refused to say any of that publicly,\" standing by as the media \"dragged my name through the mud.\"\nmror | Patel brought complaints again and again to the leadership of the department's National Security Division-adamant that something be done to hold the Texas prosecutors to account for not standing up for him in front of the judge, one of his\nzlxc | former DOJ colleagues recalled. It wasn't that his superiors had failed to understand his frustration; yes, they agreed, the judge was a \"wack job,\" in the words of the second former DOJ colleague, and they had called the U.S. Attorney's Office to express their disappointment. \"I finally said, 'I don't really know what else you want,'\" the first former colleague recalled. \"The U.S. attorney is presidentially appointed, like, I-what do you want us to do?'\"\nk0bw | \"He just felt so aggrieved,\" this person added, \"and this continued throughout the rest of his tenure. And I actually think it was part of why he left.\"\naq5a | The lesson of the bench slap and its aftermath, as Patel explains in Government Gangsters, was this: Although he had tried \"to do my best to serve my country,\" senior government officials had \"refused to step up to the plate\" for him in return. Patel decided to stop working for \"cowards.\"",
