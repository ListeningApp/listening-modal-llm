        "content": "oc99 | Different transformation-based unsupervised methods have been introduced. Some of them are kernel- and graph-based methods. Lately, regularised multiple kernel learning for Locality Preserving Projections was implemented for clustering analysis. It used an individual kernel for each omics along with a graph embedding framework to identify biologically meaningful subgroups for five different cancer types. Similarly, PAMOGK is developed for integrating multi-omics data with pathways using graph kernel, smoothed shortest path graph kernel. It used somatic mutations, transcriptomics and proteomics data to find subgroups of kidney cancer.\ngipz | Meta-SVM, Meta-analytic SVM, is proposed by Kim, which integrates multiple omics data and able to detect consensus genes associated with diseases across studies such as breast\nb4wj | cancer and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Recently, NEighborhood based Multi-Omics clustering is introduced which uses an inter-patient similarity matrix-based distance metric for evaluating the input omic datasets individually. These omics matrices are then combined into one matrix and then analysed using spectral-based clustering. It can work on partial data sets, where measurements are only available for a subset of omics data.\n5xlt | Five. Application of integrative methods in multi-omics studies\n9bz4 | The availability of high-throughput omics provides a unique opportunity to explore the complex relationships between different omics and phenotypic targets instead of mono-omics evaluation. This section describes various multi-omics studies which deployed methods investigated in the previous section. Table Eight summarises different phenotypic target-based, multi-omics studies published and tabulates them across the span of seven main omics namely, genomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, proteomics, glycomics, lipidomics and epigenomics. Genomics is further divided into gene expression, DNA methylation, somatic point mutation and copy number alteration. Similarly, transcriptomics is further classed into long non-coding RNAs and microRNAs. The various multi-omics studies are broadly\nyfv2 | grouped based on the target and the corresponding ML method used.\n3rqe | It is evident from Table Eight that most of the multi-omics studies focus on different forms of cancer. In particular, the presence of many multi-omics studies related to the breast and ovarian cancer highlights the research thrust by the scientific community in these domains.\nnsi3 | Many intra-omics studies have successfully explored the integration of gene expression and DNA methylation. LASSO methods have been used for this particular integration by Taskesen and Lee for acute myeloid leukaemia and breast cancer respectively. LASSO has also been employed for cancer prognosis. Similarly, mRNA - miRNA integration was investigated using Neural Fuzzy Network for colorectal cancer, SVM for pancreatic cancer, and RF for cardiac tissue ageing and ovarian cancer respectively. SVM has also been used for oral squamous cell carcinoma study by integrating different transcriptomics namely mRNA, miRNA and IncRNA.\nnil3 | Metabolomics and proteomics have been integrated using RF for analysis of prostate cancer and thyroid functioning. Similarly, metabolomics is integrated with mRNA for studying ulcerative colitis and cancer survival. On the other hand, glycomics and epigenomics have only appeared once in the multi-omics context and used for the study of age-related comorbidities using a graphical variant of RF.",
