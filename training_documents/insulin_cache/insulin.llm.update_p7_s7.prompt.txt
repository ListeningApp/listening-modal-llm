You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

j30a | Insulin promotes learning of reward associations (such as nutritive value of food) and consequently forms preferences (Woods et al., 2016): Flavor-nutrient-preference learning in food-restricted and ad-libitum mice is dependent on insulin receptor activation in the nucleus accum- bens. However, Figlewicz et al. (2004) revealed that in ad libitum-fed mice intra-ventricular insulin does not impair learning of the reward value of a high-fat diet. But, intra-ventricular insulin inhibits reward retrieval indicating an effect on motivation (Figlewicz et al., 2004). Finnell and Ferrario (2022b) systematically investigated the differential effect of intranasal insulin application in the core of the nucleus accumbens on cue-triggered food approach and motivation: while cue-triggered food approach remained unchanged by insulin the moti- vation to spend effort for food was reduced after insulin application.
7bdk | For effort spending in progressive ratio tasks, the findings were inconsistent though: While (Labouèbe et al., 2013b) and Figlewicz et al. (2008a) reported no effect after intra-VTA and intra-NAc insulin appli- cation, others found reduced motivation after intra-NAc and ICV administration (Figlewicz et al., 2006; Finnell and Ferrario, 2022a). Findings from ICV-application have to be interpreted with caution, as the insulin effects cannot be attributed to specific brain areas or neuron populations. Here, insulin can either act directly on DA-circuitry or indirectly through other insulin receptive brain areas (e.g. hypothala- mus) that modulate DA-signalling through multisynaptic connections. Moreover, it is important to note that most of the rodent studies used food stimuli to assess reward sensitivity, learning, and motivation. This is simply due to the fact that food stimuli are well-established in rodent assays and are easy to apply. However, Bruijnzeel et al. (2011b) lever- aged an intracranial self-stimulation protocol and demonstrated a reward-suppressing effect, indicating that the action of insulin on the brain's DA system has implications far beyond food intake and meta- bolic regulation. These findings demonstrate conclusively that insulin has a reward-suppressing impact via its action on midbrain DA neurons,
fim0 | primarily under conditions of satiety. However, more research is required to delineate the receptors /cell subtypes involved and the different forms of rewarding stimuli such as drugs and social/sexual stimuli that are affected.
ojro | 2.5. Impact of insulin on reward behaviour in humans
l6t9 | Recent human research has provided additional evidence for the insulin-mediated downregulation of reward-related processing (see Appendix, Tables 7-10). In humans, brain function is generally assessed using fMRI, which provides a surrogate marker for neuronal and glial activity through quantifying blood hemoglobin oxygenation (Ogawa et al., 1990). The standard procedure to study central insulin effects in humans is through intranasal insulin application, which enters the nasal mucosa and is transported to the CNS via diffusion and trans-neuronal transport via olfactory and trigeminal pathways bypassing the blood-brain barrier (Dhuria et al., 2010). The exact tem- poral dynamics of insulin's effect on neuronal signalling are unclear, however, there is increasing evidence that the main effect is achieved after 30 min in a dose-dependent manner (Born et al., 2002; Edwin Thanarajah et al., 2019; Kullmann et al., 2018).
1ujy | 2.5.1. Effect of intranasal insulin on mesocorticolimbic connectivity
qzor | Studies using fMRI have shown that intranasal insulin reduces not only the ratings of food palatability but also modulates the connectivity between the VTA and the NAc (Tiedemann et al., 2017), as well as the functional connectivity between the VTA and the ventromedial pre- frontal cortex (Edwin Thanarajah et al., 2019). These findings align with several studies that reported alterations in regional activity and con- nectivity patterns of the reward circuitry after intranasal insulin appli- cation (Heni et al., 2012; Kullmann et al., 2012, 2018). These connectivity changes have been related to peripheral insulin sensitivity and measures of eating behaviour (Heni et al., 2012; Kullmann et al., 2015). Kullmann et al. (2021) performed a combined fMRI and PET study using the D2/D3-receptor ligand [11 C]-raclopride and directly assessed brain DA-signalling. They discovered that intranasal insulin decreased DA transmission in the ventral and dorsal striatum. Interest- ingly, insulin-induced effects in PET imaging were related to functional connectivity changes detected with fMRI 45 min after intranasal insulin intervention indicating that signal alterations, we observe in fMRI are indeed related to DA signalling.
a0by | 2.5.2. Effect of insulin on food preference
u1ky | Tiedemann et al. (2017) reported that after an overnight fast, blood insulin levels predicted food preference in insulin-sensitive participants: Higher blood insulin levels were associated with lower food liking. This suppressing effect was also evident after intranasal insulin application. In insulin-resistant participants, this association between food prefer- ence and blood insulin as well as central insulin was not detectable. Furthermore, the inhibitory effect of intranasal insulin on food prefer- ence seems to be sex-dependent: While in normal-weight men, insulin reduced food preference and food intake in the hungry state (Benedict et al., 2008), this effect was not evident in women neither in pre- nor postmenopausal stage (Benedict et al., 2008; Krug et al., 2010). In contrast, insulin reduced post-prandial snacking and food cravings in women (Hallschmid et al., 2012a). In line, the neuronal processing of food cues after intranasal insulin application has been demonstrated to depend on body weight and sex (Wagner et al., 2022).
htm9 | 2.5.3. Effect of insulin on motivation
8hul | The effect of insulin is not limited to food rewards. Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP1), which has an insulin-enhancing effect, modulates incentive motivation for both food and money (Hanssen et al., 2021). Of course, this effect is not solely attributable to insulin, since GLP1 has direct effects on DA neurons. Furthermore, food intake (elevating insulin levels among other factors) has been shown to reduce susceptibility to
