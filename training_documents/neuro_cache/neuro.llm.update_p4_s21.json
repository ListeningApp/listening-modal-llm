They provide some support for a structured set of hypotheses, but to be compelling each aspect of the overall system must be studied in more depth individually. However, the virtue is that these more precise and circumscribed hypotheses are not conceived in a vacuum, isolated from conceptions of the operation of the system as a whole. The theory outlined above treats each structure and process as part of an integrated system, and this seems highly desirable for questions about how the brain performs information processing.\nsyiw | Which areas implement 'simple systems' (linked operations)?\nkg3t | A second kind of question focuses not on the operation of an entire system that underlies a particular function, but instead on a portion of such a system. The simplest subsystem is the interaction between two processes or between a process and a structure. For example, perhaps the most controversial aspect of the theory illustrated in figure one is the interpretation of the dorsolateral frontal function as being involved in information look-up, and of the angular gyrus or Area nineteen as implementing associative memory. Kosslyn tested this\nlvae | interpretation. We made use of a finding originally reported by Jolicoeur et al.\no9sc | Jolicoeur asked subjects to view pictures and to decide whether simultaneously presented words described the pictures appropriately. There were two important variables: first, the words were either at the 'entry' level (such as 'dog' for a picture of a cocker spaniel, or 'apple' for a picture of a Delicious apple), or were superordinate to that (e.g. 'animal' or 'fruit') or were subordinate (e.g. 'cocker spaniel' or 'Delicious apple'). The idea was that people spontaneously name objects at the 'entry' level, which usually corresponds to the 'basic level'; this is the name that is as general as possible and that names as many similar objects as possible. So, for example, 'Delicious apple' is too specific because 'MacIntosh apple', 'Granny Smith apple,' and so on look similar, but 'fruit' is too general because water- melons, grapes, bananas and so on are not very similar; 'apple' is about as general as one can get while still naming a set of similar objects. As expected, subjects could evaluate an entry-level term faster and more accurately than either a subordinate or superordinate term.\n121u | Second, the pictures were presented for either one second or seventy-five milliseconds. We had two pivotal ideas. (i) If one names a picture spontaneously at the entry level, then one will need to process additional perceptual information to evaluate a subordinate term (e.g. to check whether there are bumps on the bottom of an apple to determine whether it is a Delicious apple, or to see whether the dog has rounded floppy ears). If so, then it should be much more difficult to evaluate subordinate terms than entry-level ones when given only seventy-five milliseconds than when given a full one second. This was in fact so. (ii) In contrast, and here is the crucial idea for present purposes, if one names a picture spontaneously at the entry level, then one will not need to process additional perceptual information to evaluate a superordinate term. In this case, the additional information need only be looked up in associative memory. For example, once one has named a Delicious apple as 'apple,' one needs only to search memory to discover that apples are indeed members of the category 'fruit'. If so, we reasoned, then the exposure time of the pictures should have comparable effects on one's ability to evaluate entry and superordinate terms, because one did not need to encode additional perceptual information after producing the entry-level name. In fact, this was true. Although subjects required more time to evaluate superordinate terms, they required the same amount of additional time compared with entry-level terms in the two exposure conditions.\nzh03 | Given these findings, Kosslyn reasoned that if we used PET to compare the additional activation when subjects evaluated superordinate terms compared with when they evaluated entry-level terms, we should find just the areas involved in looking up information from associative memory. Indeed, Kosslyn found only two areas to be more active during the superordinate condition than during the entry-level condition, namely the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the left angular gyrus. We expected only left-hemisphere activation because the subjects were evaluating words, and therefore the results make good sense in the context of the theory.\n1mvw | These findings were very welcome, but they were not ideal. The specific loci that we found were not precisely the same as those found in the original experiment. However, these were different subjects, and different averaged data. Nevertheless, the locus of the dorsolateral prefrontal area was considerably different in this and the studies described above, which led us to expect activation consequent upon use of the information look-up process and associative memory. It simply is not clear what to make of this; the a priori predictions were clear-cut, and the results were close to the expected areas; but how close is close enough? A major advantage of fMRI is that it is possible to perform many experiments with the same subjects, and to analyse each subject's data separately. If the variability that we noted between the different PET studies was simply sampling error, then for a given person precisely the same dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and posterior areas should have been activated in the original tasks (both picture-verification and imagery) and in this comparison between superordinate and entry-level terms.\n6d4s | It is important to recognize two important assumptions that underlie the logic of this sort of research. First, as noted above, changing the task in small ways can alter the strategy that subjects use, in which case different structures and processes might be used, and hence different areas might be activated. Even a small shift in the location of an activated area could reflect differences in the precise process being used. Second, note that this logic assumes that the same piece of tissue implements the same structure or process when it is embedded in different combinations of other processes. It is possible that some neural tissue is not dedicated to implementing a single process, and that different neural regions can implement more than one process. If so, the precise locus of activation that reflects the use of a given structure or process can shift, depending on what other structures or processes are used at the same time. We shall return to this general issue shortly.\nmqah | What operation is performed by a specific brain area?\n```",
