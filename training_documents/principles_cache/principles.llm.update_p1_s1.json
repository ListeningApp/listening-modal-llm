These principles come from three sources: research in cognitive science, research on master teachers, and research on cognitive supports. Each is briefly explained below.\ngxfd | A: Research in cognitive science: This research focuses on how our brains acquire and use information. This cognitive research also provides suggestions on how we might overcome the limitations of our working memory (the mental \"space\" in which thinking occurs) when learning new material.\ns2v1 | B: Research on the classroom practices of master teachers: Master teachers are those teachers whose classrooms made the highest gains on achievement tests. In a series of studies, a wide range of teachers were observed as they taught, and the investigators coded how they presented new material, how and whether they checked for student understanding, the types of support they provided to their students, and a number of other instructional activities. By also gathering student achievement data, researchers were able to identify the ways in which the more and less effective teachers differed.\njkp9 | C: Research on cognitive supports to help students learn complex tasks: Effective instructional procedures such as thinking aloud, providing students with scaffolds, and providing students with models come from this research.\nz8tt | Even though these are three very different bodies of research, there is no conflict at all between the instructional suggestions that come from each of these three sources. In other words, these three sources supplement and complement each other. The fact that the instructional ideas from three different sources supplement and complement each other gives us faith in the validity of these findings.\n9g22 | Education involves helping a novice develop strong, readily accessible background knowledge. It's important that background knowledge be readily accessible, and this occurs when knowledge is well rehearsed and tied to other knowledge. The most effective teachers ensured that their students efficiently acquired, rehearsed, and connected background knowledge by providing a good deal of instructional support. They provided this support by teaching new material in manageable amounts, modeling, guiding student practice, helping students when they made errors, and providing for sufficient practice and review. Many of these teachers also went on to experiential, hands-on activities, but they always did the experiential activities after, not before, the basic material was learned.\n41fx | The following is a list of some of the instructional principles that have come from these three sources. These ideas will be described and discussed in this article:\n7um8 | · Begin a lesson with a short review of previous learning.\nuow2 | · Present new material in small steps with student practice after each step.\niat7 | · Ask a large number of questions and check the responses of all students.\nywwr | Provide models.\n0i6j | · Guide student practice.\n87cq | · Check for student understanding.\n0qs3 | Obtain a high success rate.\nz8f7 | · Provide scaffolds for difficult tasks.\n7w7j | · Require and monitor independent practice.\n51vd | · Engage students in weekly and monthly review.\nbaj1 | One. Begin a lesson with a short review of previous learning: Daily review can strengthen previous learning and can lead to fluent recall.\nn1wo | Research findings\n5bq3 | Daily review is an important component of instruction. Review can help us strengthen the connections among the material we have learned. The review of previous learning can help us recall words, concepts, and procedures effortlessly and automatically when we need this material to solve problems or to understand new material. The development of expertise requires thousands of hours of practice, and daily review is one component of this practice.\nezla | For example, daily review was part of a successful experiment in elementary school mathematics. Teachers in the experiment were taught to spend eight minutes every day on review. Teachers used this time to check the homework, go over problems where there were errors, and practice the concepts and skills that needed to become automatic. As a result, students in these classrooms had higher achievement scores than did students in other classrooms.\nrsbu | Daily practice of vocabulary can lead to seeing each practiced word as a unit (seeing the whole word automatically rather than as individual letters that have to be sounded out and blended). When students see words as units, they have more space available in their working memory, and this space can now be used for comprehension. Mathematical problem solving is also improved when the basic skills (addition, multiplication, etcetera) are overlearned and become automatic, thus freeing working-memory capacity.\nmagd | In the classroom The most effective teachers in the studies of classroom instruction understood the importance of practice, and they began their lessons with a five- to eight-minute review of previously covered material. Some teachers reviewed vocabulary, formulae, events, or previously learned concepts. These teachers provided additional practice on facts and skills that were needed for recall to become automatic.\ntb74 | Effective teacher activities also included reviewing the concepts and skills that were necessary to do the homework, having students correct each other's papers, and asking about points on which the students had difficulty or made errors. These reviews\n8l69 | ensured that the students had a firm grasp of the skills and concepts that would be needed for the day's lesson.\n1jyv | Effective teachers also reviewed the knowledge and concepts that were relevant for that day's lesson. It is important for a teacher to help students recall the concepts and vocabulary that will be relevant for the day's lesson because our working memory is very limited. If we do not review previous learning, then we will have to make a special effort to recall old material while learning new material, and this makes it difficult for us to learn the new material.\nolce | Daily review is particularly important for teaching material that will be used in subsequent learning. Examples include reading sight words (any word that is known by a reader automatically), grammar, math facts, math computation, math factoring, and chemical equations.\nerx1 | When planning for review, teachers might want to consider which words, math facts, procedures, and concepts need to\nb3bt | The most effective teachers ensured that students efficiently acquired, rehearsed, and connected knowledge. Many went on to hands-on activities, but always after, not before, the basic material was learned.\n0w8m | become automatic, and which words, vocabulary, or ideas need to be reviewed before the lesson begins.\nvcu3 | In addition, teachers might consider doing the following during their daily review:\nhjzj | · Correct homework.\nj79f | · Review the concepts and skills that were practiced as part of the homework.\n6tbv | · Ask students about points where they had difficulties or made errors.\nxb13 | · Review material where errors were made.\ncxqi | · Review material that needs overlearning (newly acquired skills should be practiced well beyond the point of initial mastery, leading to automaticity).\nqfmx | Two. Present new material in small steps with student practice after each step: Only present small amounts of new material at any time, and then assist students as they practice this material.\nrut3 | Research findings\nm3cp | Our working memory, the place where we process information, is small. It can only handle a few bits of information at once-too much information swamps our working memory. Presenting too much material at once may confuse students because their working memory will be unable to process it.\nmq4s | Therefore, the more effective teachers do not overwhelm their students by presenting too much new material at once. Rather,\n95el | these teachers only present small amounts of new material at any time, and then assist the students as they practice this material. Only after the students have mastered the first step do teachers proceed to the next step.\na0a5 | The procedure of first teaching in small steps and then guiding student practice represents an appropriate way of dealing with the limitation of our working memory.\ngocl | In the classroom\nob1z | The more successful teachers did not overwhelm their students by presenting too much new material at once. Rather, they presented only small amounts of new material at one time, and they\nm4cb | taught in such a way that each point was mastered before the next point was introduced. They checked their students' understanding on each point and retaught material when necessary.\nm61y | Some successful teachers taught by giving a series of short presentations using many examples. The examples provided concrete learning and elaboration that were useful for processing new material.\n```",
