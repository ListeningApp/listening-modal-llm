You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

favz | Accounting for BAD. The observed distribution of ChIP-Seq allelic read counts on heterozygous SNVs significantly depends on aneuploidy and the CNV profile of the cells (Fig. 6a, b). The modes of distribution correspond to the most represented copy number, e.g., the distribution is bimodal for mostly triploid K562 cells, Fig. 6b. However, the mixture of two Binomial distributions poorly approximates the data, showing a significant overdispersion. To systematically reduce the over- dispersion from local CNVs and aneuploidy, we reconstructed the genome-wide BAD maps from read counts at the heterozygous variants (see below). The dis- tributions of the allelic read counts at SNVs segregated by BAD show a notably reduced overdispersion (Fig. 6c, d).
7szx | BAD calling with Bayesian changepoint identification. To construct genome- wide BAD maps from filtered heterozygous SNV calls, we developed a novel algorithm, the BAD caller by Bayesian changepoint identification (BABACHI).
hx9e | At the first stage, BABACHI divides the chromosomes into smaller sub- chromosome regions by detecting centromeric regions, long deletions, loss of heterozygosity regions, and other regions depleted of SNVs. At this stage, only the distances between neighboring SNVs are taken into account and long gaps are marked. The sub-chromosome regions with <3 SNVs or chromosomes with <LATEX>< 1 0 0</LATEX> each sub- <LATEX>c h r o m o s o m e \quad r e g i o n \quad t h a t \quad f u r t h e r \quad d i v i d e \quad i t \quad i n t o \quad s m a l l e r \quad s e g m e n t s \quad o f \quad s t a b l e \quad B A D . T h e</LATEX> optimal changepoints are the experimental distribution of allelic read counts at the SNVs, given a region- specific (yet unknown) BAD persist in each region enclosed between neighboring changepoints. Finally, a particular BAD is assigned to each segment according to

a63r | BAD of each segment is selected from the discrete set {1, 4/3, 3/2, 2, 5/2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, considering that the total copy number of a particular genomic region rarely exceeds 7. The prior distribution of BAD is assumed to be <LATEX>a</LATEX> discrete uniform, with the support being the same discrete set as above (non-informative prior). Details and mathematical substantiation of the algorithm are provided in the Supplementary Methods.
dqvj | Practical BAD calling with the ADASTRA pipeline. To provide better genome coverage and robust BAD estimates, we merged the sets of variant calls from ChIP- Seq data sets produced in the same laboratory for the same cell type and in the same series (i.e., sharing either ENCODE biosample or GEO GSE ID). Different SNVs at the same genome position (either originating from different data sets or with different alternative alleles) were considered as independent observations. For each data set, chromosomes with < 100 SNVs were excluded from BAD calling and further analysis.
r17u | To assess the reliability of the BAD maps, for each BAD, we separately estimated ROC and PRC. Here we considered the BAD maps as binary classifiers of according to BAD, with COSMIC CNV data as the ground truth. To plot a

g345 | Construction of an independent BAD map for MCF7 cells. The paired-end reads of MCF7 deep genome sequencing (SRA accession SRR8652105) were aligned to hg38 genome assembly using bowtie2 with default settings. Overall, 28,278,026 (2.5%) of a total of 1,136,666,560 paired reads were marked as duplicates, 112,323,925 (9.9%) were filtered by GATK filter by mapping quality ≥ 10, leaving 996,064,609 reads for SNP calling. A total of 3,969,250 SNPs was reported by GATK HaplotypeCaller, among which 1,427,492 SNPs were annotated as hetero- zygous, passed the basic ADASTRA filter (≥5 reads on each allele), and were used to produce the independent reference MCF7 BAD map with BABACHI69.
