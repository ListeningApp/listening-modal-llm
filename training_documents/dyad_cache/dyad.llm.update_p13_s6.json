        "content": "wtse | Paradoxically, the Chinese preparations for a military intervention were triggered by the North Korean military success during the war's first stage. Being aware of the vulnerability of the KPA because of its long supply lines, on August five, the Central Military Commission under Mao ordered the PLA to complete war preparations before September thirty. During the third week of August, high-ranking officers of the Chinese Operation Office and senior Foreign Ministry officials conducted a series of discussions and concluded that the American amphibious landing and counteroffensive was to be launched soon. Of six potential ports suitable for such a landing, Inchon was the most likely one. This estimate was delivered to the Chinese leaders on August twenty-three, precisely the same day that MacArthur made his final decision to land at Inchon. A senior American civilian official in Japan noted in his memoirs that the fact that Inchon was the site of the planned landing \"became almost an open secret in Tokyo.\" It is possible, then, that besides brilliant strategic thinking, the Chinese also had relevant intelligence information.\nbm7g | Mao warned Kim Il Sung about the incoming American Inchon landing, but the KPA avoided taking the necessary measures to meet this threat and continued focusing on the occupation of the Pusan perimeter. The decision to cross the Yalu and meet the UN forces in North Korea, which from the Chinese perspective constituted a preemptive strike, was taken during the first week of October, and the order to \"enter Korea immediately\" was given on October eight. The crossing of the two hundred sixty thousand-strong force started on the night of October eighteen-nineteen and a first, unexpected, clash between a CPVF division and the Seventh Regiment of the Sixth ROK Division took place three days later. According to Chinese sources, during this first campaign the CPVF\njr68 | eliminated about half a dozen ROK battalions as well as some small American forces. Due to insufficient firepower, the CPVF failed in reaching its original mission-an annihilation of three enemy divisions.\naxix | Following the first campaign, the Chinese generals began preparations for a larger one. In addition to resupplying and reinforcing the CPVF, the Chinese generals implemented a deception plan, creating the impression that their forces were weak and were retreating in an unorderly manner to the Yalu. The goal was to lure MacArthur's forces to the north, extending their supply lines. The CPVF also released a hundred POWs, including some Americans, who were told that owing to supply problems, the Chinese forces had to return to China. MacArthur fell into the trap, and on November twenty-five, a day after he had started his main offensive to end the war by Christmas, the CPVF launched a counteroffensive, causing the American army its worst defeat since the nineteen forty-four Battle of the Bulge. At its root was a major intelligence fiasco.\n05y4 | B. The American surprise\n2fb0 | One. The intelligence information and its estimate\ns9fn | The poor state of American intelligence prior to the war did not change much after the war had started. This owed not only to the lack of adequate linguists and equipment but also rigid regulations, bureaucratic rivalry, and leadership deficiencies. The result during the war's first months was a low level of combat intelligence.\nk5r6 | Humint, which was of low quality prior to the invasion, was almost entirely wrecked when the KPA moved south, capturing, killing, or neutralizing whatever networks had been active before the war. Although according to one official history, Willoughby requested the CIA to bridge the intelligence gap at the outset of the war, other sources emphasized his attempts to get rid of the CIA and take complete control. In any event, CIA and G-2 attempts to infiltrate agents into the occupied territories by line-crossing, parachuting, or boat landing failed. Most of the agents were lost and the information that was brought by the others was old and useless. Consequently, combat information from Humint sources came mainly from interrogations of refugees and of a few KPA POWs. Aerial reconnaissance was mainly used to support air bombings in North Korea and provided no significant support for the UN ground warfare.\nz9v9 | Although AFSA moved to full shifts, Sigint provided only minor support to the fighting forces. During the war's first weeks, much attention was devoted to the Soviets. Only when it became evident that the USSR had made no preparations to intervene were twelve intercept positions transferred from Chinese and Soviet coverage to Korean duties. Here, COMMINT suffered from a shortage of high-quality monitoring equipment and skilled manpower. The entire US military had only twenty Korean-speaking linguists, and non-Americans linguists, primarily former Japanese intelligence officers, who had served in Korea, had to be used. Willoughby, moreover, regarded his only duty to be providing intelligence to MacArthur.\ngpu9 | Consequently, he prevented, despite requests from Washington, the transfer of Sigint units to the Pusan perimeter. He also avoided distributing, allegedly for security considerations, operational intelligence to the Eighth Army, which was defending the Pusan perimeter, thus denying its commander, General Walton Walker, the information he needed to carry out his missions. The only Sigint support that the Eighth Army received was from an improvised South Korean unit called Group M. Despite its being plagued by many deficiencies\nu5ws | The efforts to monitor China, primarily its preparations for a massive intervention in the war, went somewhat better, and the source of the failure here lay within the sphere of analysis. Although the CIA had\nonkh | lost all its assets in mainland China following the Communist victory there, it succeeded in receiving some relevant information through other sources. On October nineteen, the same day the PLA started crossing the Yalu, a Hong Kong-based Chinese businessman warned that four hundred thousand PLA troops had started or were about to start crossing into North Korea. CIA officers in Tokyo warned twice of a three hundred thousand-strong PLA force deployed near the Yalu. These warnings had no impact on intelligence estimates. MacArthur himself rejected them, and threatened to arrest a CIA officer stationed in Tokyo for warning about a coming Chinese intervention.\n8t55 | Aerial reconnaissance occasionally yielded some useful information. In early September, one warning indicator concerning possible Chinese intervention involved aerial photographs that showed three air-force bases, capable of handling a total of three hundred aircraft, had been built in close proximity to the Yalu. On October eighteen, aerial photographs showed that close to a hundred Soviet-made aircraft had been deployed in those fields. The obvious conclusion should have been that the Chinese were building air support for a potential large-scale confrontation with the UN forces.",
