        "content": "dgcw | To assess the impact of Gamma star over C sub C on the Kok effect, C sub C has to be known. To that end, we estimated G sub M using all data from combined gas exchange and Chl fluorescence measurements. G sub M is known to vary with temperature, but whether G sub M varies with widehat C sub i or widehat I sub inc or O sub two is uncertain. Furthermore, recent literature suggests the necessity to dissect mesophyll resistance into its components and to consider the intracellular arrangements of organelles. Here we consider three G sub M modes: mode i assumes that G sub M varies only with temperature, but not with either C sub i or I sub inc or O sub two; mode ii assumes that G sub M varies with all these factors; and mode iii is similar to mode ii but uses an additional factor m that lumps subresistance proportions and several intracellular properties of mesophyll organelles. For mode i, we estimated G sub M by fitting, the NRH-A method based on the non-rectangular hyperbolic equation for CO2-assimilation, described by Yin and Struik to all data (including A-C; curves). Like photosynthetic rate, G sub M has generally an optimum response to temperature, and we assumed that this response followed a normal distribution function, with an optimum temperature of thirty degrees Celsius: G sub M equals G sub M thirty exp left brace negative left bracket left parenthesis T minus thirty right parenthesis over Omega right bracket squared right brace, which has a minimum number of parameters to estimate. We incorporated these relationships into the NRH-A method to fit parameter Omega. For modes ii and iii, we used an equation described by Yin et al., G sub M equals delta left parenthesis A plus R sub d right parenthesis over left parenthesis C sub c minus Gamma star right parenthesis, which can semi-empirically accommodate the response (if observed) of G sub M to I sub inc, C sub i, O sub two, and temperature. Here, it is the unitless coefficient delta that is an explicit parameter to be estimated, and delta represents the carboxylation resistance to mesophyll resistance ratio. For each mode, the simultaneously estimated parameters together with G sub M or delta were: the calibration factor(s) that converts Chl fluorescence-\ngvwz | based PSII photochemical efficiency left parenthesis Phi sub II right parenthesis into linear electron transport rate slash J equals s I sub inc Phi sub II; and Rubisco specificity at twenty-five degrees Celsius left parenthesis S sub c slash zero twenty-five right parenthesis. The values of S sub c slash c for other temperatures were calculated from the relation Gamma star equals zero point five O over S sub c l sub O (where O is the concentration of oxygen) and the Arrhenius equation using twenty-four thousand four hundred sixty J mol to the negative one of Bernacchi et al. as the activation energy for Gamma star (using other activation-energy estimates had little impact on our calculated Gamma star to C sub c ratios). In view of the reasoning of Farquhar and Busch, we used R sub D one of each curve as input for the R a term of the model in fitting. The fitting procedures for three modes were implemented using the GAUSS method in PROC NLIN of SAS, and the SAS codes can be obtained upon request. The SAS output gave the fitted A for each measurement point, with which C sub c was then solved from the model of Farquhar et al. as:\nsk5m | C sub c equals Gamma star left bracket J over four plus two left parenthesis A plus R sub d right parenthesis right bracket over left bracket J over four minus left parenthesis A plus R sub d right parenthesis right bracket.
