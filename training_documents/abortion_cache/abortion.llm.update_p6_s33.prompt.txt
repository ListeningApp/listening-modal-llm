You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

wtow | abortion was similar to other studies examining medica- tion abortion in the late first trimester,24 and medica- tion self-management after 13 weeks using an accompaniment model.25 Those self-managing after 10 weeks in our study also tended to have experienced ship- ping delays and some received modified instructions according to the WHO protocol for medication abortion at 12 weeks and over14 and additional support from Aid Access. In addition, no ectopic pregnancies were reported after using the medications and indeed a small number were diagnosed quickly by the service at the time of initial contact.
o22k | This study has several limitations. The first is that abortion outcomes were self-reported by people who self-managed. However, since these abortions take place outside of the formal healthcare system, self-reporting is by definition the only possible method of follow-up. Moreover, a previous large randomized controlled trial showed that self-assessment of the outcome of medica- tion abortion was non-inferior to clinical follow-up, indi- cating that people are capable of determining on their own whether or not their abortion has been success- ful.26 Since an examination of the outcomes of medica- tion abortions taking place outside the formal healthcare setting cannot be dealt with by a randomized controlled trial or clinical trial, we have drawn on the best available "real world" data to answer these impor- tant questions.
nwfz | Second, although the 70% follow-up rate in this study is incomplete, it is on par with or better than many clinical studies, since most outcomes are only recorded if patients decide to follow up with the clinic.27
nvfy | Moreover, we took a more conversative approach than most clinical studies in that we did not consider those for whom no outcome data were available as presumed successful abortions. Third, while self-reporting could be subject to recall or social desirability bias, the short time period between the abortion and the collection of follow-up information should minimize recall bias.
mror | While treatment for serious adverse events was a rarely reported outcome in our study, rates were still higher than those reported in studies of abortions tak- ing place in the clinical setting.19,28 We note, however, that we are not able to verify whether the treatment received by users of the service who did engage with the formal healthcare system was appropriate to their situa- tion. For example, most of those who reported receiving surgical intervention also received antibiotics, which may have been given prophylactically or to treat an exist- ing infection. Studies in other countries have shown that rates of intervention and additional treatment dur- ing clinical abortion follow-up are highly variable, espe- cially in countries where hospital staff are not trained to care for abortion patients.29 While we did examine whether any deaths were reported to the service, we were of course unable to fully assess whether any deaths occurred in the group that did not provide follow-up information.
zlxc | It is also important to consider the rates of self- reported adverse events shown in this study in the con- text of the other possible outcomes for people in the U. S. who cannot access in-clinic abortion care. Between 200,000 and 1.2 million unsafe abortions are estimated to have taken place per year in the U.S. in the 1950s and 1960s pre-Roe, with the resulting burden of morbidity and mortality falling disproportionately on racially minoritised people.3º While we do not expect the same prevalence of unsafe abortion today, we cannot assume that none will occur. Moreover, those forced to carry a pregnancy to term would also be at higher risk than those who self-manage using Aid Access. Rates of hem- orrhage postpartum in the U.S. are over five times higher than those reported in this study, with Black women at disproportionately high risk.31,32
k0bw | The trajectory of highly restricted access to in-clinic abortion in the U.S. and the future possibility of full abor- tion bans in some states means that self-managed abor- tion is likely to become an increasingly used alternative. The FDA recently permanently suspended the in-person dispensing requirement on mifepristone, paving the way for expanded clinic-based telemedicine abortion services. However, at least 19 states already have laws banning telemedicine for medication abortion and in these juris- dictions the FDA ruling will have little effect.33 These states are the also the ones with the highest rates of requests to Aid Access.4 In the majority of U.S. states, self-management is not illegal, and clinicians who may provide follow-up care have no reporting obligation.34 It is important to note, however, that there have been 24
