You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

06yq | Microdosing with psychedelics to self-medicate for ADHD symptoms in adults: A naturalistic study
dpv6 | ARTICLE INFO
8r5j | ABSTRACT
2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

qcfr | TALE OF HATIM
idjq | When Hatim al-Asamm, of Balkh (now in Afghanistan) went to Baghdad, people surrounded him, saying:
p07t | 'You are a non-Arab of halting speech, yet you silence everyone.'
deod | He answered: 'Three things enable me to overcome my oppo- nent. I am happy when he is right, and I am sad when he is wrong, and I try not to behave foolishly towards him.'
tzks | Ibn Hanbal asked Hatim what things would save humanity from the world. He said:
9f7o | 'There are four things. Accept the ignorance of others and spare them yours; spare for them from your substance, and do not expect any of theirs.'
5n75 | The posture of honesty is not the same as its reality, as everyone knows. But how many people can tell whether they are honest or behaving as if they were honest?
3ljd | A certain tale has been coined to give this important subject expression. In order to illustrate, it has been put into the mouth of two lunatics; which should not really make any of us feel that its equivalence could not occur among us marvellously normal people:
2oqd | First lunatic religionist: 'God spoke to me!'
c4uf | Second ditto: 'I did no such thing!'
gmje | 152
a8px | How can one method be as good as another?
uz6l | Q: What you have said about the same person, or the same group of people, being able to employ entirely different techniques to achieve the same object interests me. But how can one method be as good as another?
xaka | A: If a house is on fire, two ladders may be propped against one window. Both lead to the ground. The different colours of the paint on them may obscure the fact that they are ladders.
p46y | Q: But how do we know that either is a ladder?
4rcq | A: You know by learning to recognise a ladder when you see one.
zie9 | Q: How is that done ?
qx9z | A: By familiarising yourself with ladders.
otrq | Q: And climbing ladders?
ule8 | A: While you are learning recognition, climb them as a part of it.
6yp6 | Q: But some people insist that there is only one ladder, their own.
qx7g | A: They are right, if they are only saying that to focus attention on a specific escape-ladder as an instrument. If it works, it is equivalent to being the only true one. For practical purposes, it is.
17ou | Q: Are they right under any other circumstances?
l7mi | A: Seldom, because if they really were right they would teach not 'There is only this ladder', but 'Look at all these ladders; they can-or could-work. Ours, however, is applicable to you and to me.' Failure to do this reveals ignorance.
odfd | 153
zlby | Remark: But they are short of time. Comment: So is everybody.
k37v | Q: Are some ladders too short?
77oz | A: Ladders are in all conditions: new, old, rotten, short, long, blue, green, weak, strong, available, in use elsewhere, and all the rest of the possibilities.
aw8u | Q: What should one do about all this?
ktnk | A: Try to conceive that the house is on fire. If you can do so without becoming obsessed or irrational about it, particularly without becoming suggestible through dwelling on this idea, you may get out. But while you are full of hope or fear, of sentiment or desire for social activity or personal prominence or even recog- nition, you will not be able to use a ladder, you may not be able to recognise one, certainly you should be spending your energies in circles which abound for the purpose of welcoming such ten- dencies.
qiri | People learn by methods which correspond with the kind and extent of their aspiration: this is the constant Sufi dictum.
aapk | In the Anwar-i-Suñaili it is said:
b3dl | Nobody found the way to ascend Until he found the step of aspiration. Seek the stage, to mount to the Moon: None drinks rain from a well.
30p1 | Equally, of course, there are many people who cannot learn something at a given time, because they have some other expecta- tion, some preoccupation, probably an emotional one. Reflect on this news item:
jp3l | More than 3,000 worshippers fled in near-panic from the famous Church of the Blessed Mary of the Rosary at Pompeii on Saturday night, when a bottle of Coca Cola exploded .**

a9ul | Twenty-three Study Points
9jxp | Twenty-Three Study Points
ejzi | Q: May I have any brief aphorisms or statements which I can register and study, which will help to progress on the Sufi path?
lgbb | A: If you are not a viable unit in the ordinary world, you will not become one elsewhere. If you have a poor capacity for making human contacts, we cannot offer you the substitute of a community where 'we understand one another'. That belongs to play-life, what some, of course, generally call real life.
hdy5 | If you are accustomed to being supported and kept going by social, psychological and other pressures in the everyday world, there is a sense in which you do not really exist at all. The people who collapse in the often unpressured-dervish atmosphere and who slack, become tiresome to others, or seek to attract or obtain attention: they will fall to pieces and one cannot help them.
rlsz | Try to remember; and, if you cannot remember, try to become familiar with this idea:
wf16 | Lots of people who imagine that they are with us because they are physically present, or because by the ordinary tests (feelings of loyalty, indoctrination) are ostensibly present, lots of those people are not effectively here at all. If you are one of those people, there is nothing we can do for you. If you are like an ordinary person: that is, if you have the tendency to 'be here' only for limited and primitive amusement, but have it only as a tendency and not a way of life: then we can perhaps make some progress.
syuf | Remember that the human being is so intensely standardised
n8b1 | 157
wurf | that an outside observer, noting his reactions to various stimuli, need not infer an individual controlling brain in each person. He would be more likely to infer the existence of a separate, outside brain, and the people as mere manifesters of its will.
v7s4 | Register the fact that:
yg3g | Virtually all organisations known to you work largely by means of your greed. They attract you because what they say or do appeals to your greed. This is concealed only by their appear- ance. If you stop listening to their words and look at the effect, you will soon see it.
7fo3 | Remember that greed includes greed for being not greedy. So, if someone says: 'Do not be greedy, be generous', you may in- wardly interpret this in such a manner that you will develop a greed for generosity. This, however, remains greed.
mwxk | There are some things which you have to do for yourself. These include familiarising yourself with study-materials given to you. You can only really do this-and thus acquire real qualities -if you suspend the indulgence of desire for immediate satis- factions.
ovs7 | All members of contemporary societies, with few exceptions, are in need of graduating from primitive morality to a higher one. The primitive one is the one which tells you, like a child, that honesty will make you happy, make you successful, get you to higher things. Honesty, you may now be informed, is essential as an instrument, not to be worshipped as a seldom-attained emotion-loaded ideal.
0dyv | 158
sl16 | Sufis have their own methods of deterring unsuitable people. You may only know one or two ways. Pay attention to the tech- niques which, for instance, deter by compelling people to conclude that they are worthless.
lrz1 | What you may take to be attractive, or even spread out by us to be attractive to you, may well not be intended in this manner at all. That which attracts you, or others, about us may be that which is laid down by us as a tool which enables us to regard you (or others) as unsuitable.
ku5c | One can give or withhold in a manner far more effective, sophisticated, useful, which is quite invisible to people who think that giving or withholding is done by external assessment. If you seek some mark of favour or 'promotion', know that you are not ready for it. Progress comes through capacity to learn, and is irresistible. Nobody can stand between you and knowledge if you arc fit for it.
u2qd | Anybody or anything may stand between you and knowledge if you are unfit for it.
4kpx | You can learn more in half an hour's direct contact with a source of knowledge (no matter the apparent reason for the con- tact or the subject of the transaction) than you can in years of formal effort.
2xnd | You can learn and equip yourself with latent knowledge, whose development comes at a later stage. Only those who insist upon instant attention want anything else.
8rp1 | 159
0z93 | The role of the teacher is to provoke capacity in the student, to provide what there is when it will be useful, to guide him towards progress. It is not to impress, to give an impression of virtue, power, importance, general information, knowledge or anything else.
we3s | Systematic study or behaviour is valuable when it is of use. When it is not, it can be poisonous.
vuhu | Those who seek consistency as a major factor, in people or in study materials, are seeking system at a stage where it is not indicated. Children and savages do this, when they ask for in- formation which will explain or make possible 'everything'. Con- sistency is, however, on offer from those people whose business it is to offer comfort and reassurance as objectives.
q679 | If you seek illumination or understanding when what you really need is information or rest from pressures, you will get none of these things. If you know what you want, you should go and get it.
tkda | If you carry the habit of judging things into an area where it does not apply, you will judge in a manner which will not correspond with your needs.
jbzr | You cannot work on a higher level entirely with the concepts, language and experiences of a lower level. Higher level work is in a combination of manners and relationships.
34rr | The ultimate absurdity, incapacitating from real learning beyond
txr8 | 160
jb8d | the stage you have reached, is to imagine that one thing is an- other. If you think that a book is a sandwich, you may try to eat it, and will not be able to learn what a book can teach. If, too, you imagine that you are being 'open' or 'working" or eager to learn when you are only playing a social game, you will learn nothing. The people who refuse to play that game with you will also, of course, sooner or later annoy you.
gj4l | Human organisations can take two forms: entities which are set up to express or attain the aspirations of their members; and those which exist in order to acquire or provide something which is needed. Wants and needs are not the same. The difference is in information. If people know what they need, they do not have to confuse wants with needs.
x4ti | If you do not know already the difference between opinion and fact, you can study it in the daily and weekly newspapers.

ocyy | Overall 7 Study
3vef | Learning and Non-Learning
9zxr | Q. Why is it that so many people read so much and yet are not changed by it? Can people not absorb Sufi information through the written word?
l47i | A; To learn something, you may have often to be exposed to it many times, perhaps from different perspectives; and you also have to give it the kind of attention which will enable you to learn.
ml9u | In our experience, people fail to learn from Sufi materials for the same reason that they do not learn other things-they read selectively.
0ml0 | The things that touch them emotionally, or which they like or are thrilled by, they will remember or seek in greater quantity and depth.
3f5x | Since these are often the last materials which they will probably need, and since such an unbalanced attitude towards anything makes the person in need of balance in his approach, we have the situation to which you refer.
kh8s | We may at once admit that cultures which seek to highlight crudities, things which immediately appeal, and to project them in attractive forms and endorse and sustain them are unlikely to produce, on the whole, people with appetites for other than more of the same thing. But this behaviour will merely perpetuate the same kind of personality and attitude which created it in the first place.
plxa | If you have a chocolate cake decorated with sixteen cherries, and you gobble up the cherries because you like them, and then want to know why you have not eaten the cake-what does that make you? And if I tell you, would you like me?
6wac | This is the barrier to surmount. It is crossed by observing it in action, deciding to surmount it, and taking action to study com- prehensively and not to pretend to be a student and then wonder why one has not learned.
vil5 | 165
2s5u | SEE THE MINE INSIDE THE MOUNTAIN
k9cc | Reading does not change people unless they are ready to change, Rumi said: 'You have seen the mountain, you have not seen the mine inside the mountain.'
6t52 | Just because a book is available, even one of the very greatest books, does not mean that one can, or perhaps should, try to learn correctly from it at any given moment. The Sufi Sadruddin said, in his Testament, 'Hereafter let not every man seek to learn from the writings of the Sheikh Ibn Arabi or from mine, for that gate is barred to the majority of mankind.'*
08mw | This is because teachers may not need what is in books, but can use them for students, while students may not know, but might well not profit from studying them as arbitrarily as they ordinarily do.
6iat | Even the self-styled 'specialists', some of them scholars, do not translate the various levels and implications of Sufi materials correctly. In fact, there are indications that many of these people do not see the extra dimensions and alternative readings in the classical literature at all. Some even admit that they have not been able to do this .** Somewhat characteristically they do not seem to stop translating or to enrich their perceptions of the material.
pony | The Sufi usage of Hafiz's works is not at all the same as the ordinary translator's or reader's .*** I have noted elsewhere **** that, although it has been translated many times and quoted many thousands of times, there is hardly a correct rendition of the very first couplet of Rumi's major classical Sufi work, The Masnavi.
spym | We could give hundreds of examples. In fact, let us just open the Gulistan (Rose Garden) of Saadi and look at a passage and see what we find. Here is a passage; it runs in Persian:
rms6 | Kasani ki yazdan-parasti kunand/Bi-awazi dtdab masti kunand. One English translation gives the meaning, literally enough, as:
