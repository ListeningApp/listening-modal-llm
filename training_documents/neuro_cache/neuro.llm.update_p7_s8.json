This finding provided support for the idea that there are at least two distinct ways in which to imagine objects rotating, one that involves motor processes and one that does not. These findings are all the more compelling because prior data showed that some of the areas that were activated during rotation of hands are in fact used in motor control, and showed that other areas were not so involved. Thus, although the mere fact that there were distinct patterns of activation in the two tasks is evidence that they are performed in different ways, the ability to interpret the differences adds meat to these bones. A plausible interpretation allows one to eliminate the possibility that the differences were due to chance or due to some incidental difference in the experimental designs.\nmagd | A crucial aspect of this logic is that the patterns of activation arising from the two strategies must actually be different. It is not enough to show that, relative to a baseline, in one task areas X-Y are activated, whereas in another task areas P-Q are activated. 'Activation' is a continuous variable, and sub-threshold activation is common. Thus, even though activation in an area might be significant in one task (relative to baseline), and not in another, there might be no difference between the two when they are directly compared. Thus, one must compare the tasks directly, not simply rely on visual comparisons of what was and was not over the threshold under separate conditions.\ntb74 | Three. When are specific types of information processing used?\n8l69 | One virtue of beginning by asking questions about how information processing is implemented in the brain is that the answers can later be used as a basis for asking and answering other types of questions. We can distinguish two broad classes of questions that can be asked about when specific processing is used. First, one can ask simply whether a given process or structure was drawn upon\n```",
