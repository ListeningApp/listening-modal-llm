        "content": "sb1e | A number of different forms of creatine (e.g., creatine salts, creatine complexed with other nutrients, creatine dipeptides, etc.) have been marketed as more effective sources of creatine than creatine monohydrate. However, there are no peer-reviewed published papers showing that the ingestion of equal amounts of creatine salts or other forms of creatine like effervescent creatine, creatine ethyl ester,\nw2yn | buffered creatine, creatine nitrate, creatine dipeptides, or the micro amounts of creatine contained in creatine serum and beverages (e.g., twenty-five to fifty milligrams) increases creatine storage in muscle to a greater degree than creatine monohydrate. In fact, most studies show that ingestion of these other forms have less physiological impact than creatine monohydrate on intramuscular creatine stores and/or performance and that any performance differences were more related to other nutrients that creatine is bound to or co-ingested with in supplement formulations. This makes sense given that these other forms contain less creatine per gram than creatine monohydrate and that ninety-nine percent of ingested creatine monohydrate is absorbed into the blood, then taken up into muscle, or excreted in urine.\nap6l | Creatine monohydrate crystallizes from water as monoclinic prisms that hold one molecule of water of crystallization per molecule of creatine. Subsequent drying of creatine monohydrate at about one hundred degrees Celsius removes the water of crystallization yielding anhydrous creatine (one hundred percent creatine). Creatine is considered a weak base (pK sub b eleven point zero two at twenty-five degrees Celsius) that can only form salts with strong acids (i.e., pK sub a less than three point nine eight). Creatine can also serve as a complexing agent with other compounds via ionic binding. Creatine monohydrate powder contains the highest percentage of creatine (eighty-seven point nine percent) other than creatine anhydrous. Creatine monohydrate manufactured in Germany involves adding acetic acid to sodium sarconsinate, heating, adding cyanamide, cooling to promote crystallization, separation and filtration, and drying has been reported to produce ninety-nine point nine percent pure creatine monohydrate with no contaminants. Meanwhile, other sources of creatine monohydrate that have different starting materials (e.g., sarcosinates and O-alkylisourea, sarcosinates and S-alkylisothiourea) and methods of creatine synthesis, particularly from sources produced in China, have been found to contain up to five point four percent dicyandiamide, zero point zero nine percent dihydrotriazine, one point three percent creatinine, dimethyl sulphate, thiourea, and/or higher concentrations of heavy metals like mercury and lead due to use of different chemical precursors, poorly controlled synthesis processes, and/or inadequate filtration methods that more readily produce these contaminants. While the effects of ingesting these compounds on health are unknown, contamination with dihydrotriazine has been suggested to be of greatest concern since it is structurally related to carcinogenic compounds. For this reason, German sourced creatine monohydrate has been primarily used in research to establish safety and efficacy and is therefore the recommended source of creatine monohydrate to use in dietary supplements.\niest | Creatine monohydrate powder is very stable showing no signs of degradation into creatinine over years, even at elevated storage temperatures. However,\ncox8 | creatine is not stable in solution due to intramolecular cyclization that converts creatine to creatinine especially at higher temperatures and lower pH. The degradation of creatine can be reduced or halted by lowering the pH under two point five or increasing the pH above twelve point one. This is the reason that less than one percent of creatine monohydrate is degraded to creatinine during the digestive process and creatine is taken up by tissue or excreted in urine after ingestion. Moreover, since creatine is an ampholytic amino acid, it is not very soluble in water (e.g., creatine monohydrate dissolves at fourteen grams per liter at twenty degrees Celsius with a neutral pH of seven). Mixing creatine in higher temperature solution increases solubility, which is the reason why initial studies administered creatine in hot tea but the solubility has no influence on tissue uptake. The lack of solubility and stability of creatine in solution is the reason that creatine is primarily marketed in powder form and efforts to develop stable beverages containing physiologically effective doses of creatine (e.g., three to five grams per serving) have been unsuccessful.\nppqi | In summary, while some forms of creatine may be more soluble than creatine monohydrate when mixed in fluid, evidence-based research clearly shows creatine monohydrate to be the optimal choice.\noxou | Conclusions\n495n | Based on our evidence-based scientific evaluation of the literature, we conclude that:\nawri | One. Creatine supplementation does not always lead to water retention.\nbl28 | Two. Creatine is not an anabolic steroid.\nd5bz | Three. Creatine supplementation, when ingested at recommended dosages, does not result in kidney damage and/or renal dysfunction in healthy individuals.\nap5o | Four. The majority of available evidence does not support a link between creatine supplementation and hair loss or baldness.\n7zvf | Five. Creatine supplementation does not cause dehydration or muscle cramping.\nmov9 | Six. Creatine supplementation appears to be generally safe and potentially beneficial for children and adolescents.\nks7m | Seven. Creatine supplementation does not increase fat mass.\nw1w1 | Eight. Smaller, daily dosages of creatine supplementation (three to five grams or zero point one gram per kilogram of body mass) are effective. Therefore, a creatine 'loading' phase is not required.\nh8gv | Nine. Creatine supplementation and resistance training produces the vast majority of musculoskeletal and\nkwkp | Antonio et al.

Creatine supplementation alone can provide some muscle and performance benefits for older adults.\newfp | Ten. Creatine supplementation can be beneficial for a variety of athletic and sporting activities.\noczy | Eleven. Creatine supplementation provides a variety of benefits for females across their lifespan.\n2ttg | Twelve. Other forms of creatine are not superior to creatine monohydrate.\nhis3 | Abbreviations\nm50z | Acknowledgments\nme84 | Not applicable.\no56m | Funding Not applicable.\nslz6 | Availability of data and materials\n90k5 | Not applicable.\n9m8s | Ethics approval and consent to participate Not applicable.\n893y | Consent for publication Not applicable\nfavz | Competing interests\n7szx | JA is Chief Executive Officer of the ISSN, an academic non-profit that receives support and/or sponsorship from companies that manufacture and/or sell creatine or creatine-containing products.\nhx9e | DGC has received research grants and performed industry sponsored research involving creatine supplementation, received creatine donation for scientific studies and travel support for presentations involving creatine supplementation at scientific conferences.
