        "content": "slz6 | Self-Esteem and Behavior Plasticity\n90k5 | Research on self-esteem as a main effect has yielded weak and inconsistent results. To address this issue, Brockner developed behavior plasticity theory. This theory proposes that self-esteem moderates the relationship between situational factors and individual behavior such that those with low self-esteem are more responsive to external cues (situational factors) than those with high self-esteem. Brockner gave three reasons for this relationship. First, low self-esteem individuals are less certain of their own beliefs and behaviors and are more influenced by their environments. Second, because low self-esteem individuals are dependent on others for positive feedback, they respond to others by conforming in an attempt to gain approval. Finally, low self-esteem individuals are especially sensitive to negative feedback. They tend to overgeneralize, apply the feedback broadly, and change their behavior in a variety of situations. In contrast, those with high self-esteem are less influenced by situational factors and are more likely to exhibit behavioral autonomy.\n9m8s | Many studies have demonstrated that self-esteem moderates the relationship between events and circumstances in the workplace. Mossholder, Bedeian, and Armenakis, for instance, demonstrated that self-esteem moderated the relationship between peer-group interaction and performance, tenure, stress such that those with low self-esteem were more responsive to the elements in their work environment.\n893y | Overall, the literature on self-esteem suggests that low self-esteem individuals tend to be more responsive to a\nfavz | variety of organizational stimuli including peer-group interaction, evaluative feedback, socialization, leadership influence, role strain, and work layoff. In contrast, those with high self-esteem are less responsive to external cues and influence. Applying this logic to our study, we hypothesized that self-esteem would moderate the link between situational factors and voice behavior. Individuals with low self-esteem should be more responsive to the contextual influence of group size and style of management (self- versus traditional management). More specifically, those with low self-esteem would be more sensitive to the diffusion of responsibility that typically occurs in large groups. They would feel less involved, less influential, and would be less willing to engage in challenging behavior such as voice. Thus, low self-esteem would enhance the negative relationship between group size and voice.\n7szx | Likewise, we hypothesized that the predicted relationship between style of management and voice will be stronger for those with low self-esteem. That is, those with low self-esteem will be more responsive to the personal responsibility, job complexity, and accountability of self-managed work teams and this will enhance their willingness to be proactive and exhibit voice. On the basis of the above we hypothesized the following:\nhx9e | Hypothesis five a. Voice will be an interactive function of self- esteem and group size such that the negative relationship between group size and voice will be stronger (more negative) for individuals with low self-esteem relative to those with high self-esteem.\nywn2 | Hypothesis five b. Voice will be an interactive function of self- esteem and self- versus traditional management such that the relationship between self-management and voice will be stronger (more positive) for individuals with low self- esteem relative to those with high self-esteem.\na63r | Satisfaction With the Group and Behavior Plasticity\ndqvj | Although behavior plasticity theory was developed by Brockner specifically to explain self-esteem by situational factor interactions, it also seems reasonable to propose that satisfaction may have plasticity characteristics. That is, just like for self-esteem, we suggest that satisfaction with the group will moderate the relationship between situational factors and individual behavior.\nr17u | Satisfaction is based on individuals' assessment that they are fulfilling important values. Satisfaction with the group implies that individuals believe they are fulfilling their values, in part, through the group. They are attached to the group, the group is important to them, and they are willing to reciprocate by taking the time to develop and express ideas for change. Their behavior, therefore, is a function of their own values and their preference for fulfilling these values through their group.\n3c47 | This article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and is not to be disseminated broadly.\ng345 | This document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.\nsvhz | Voice in Work Groups\noaen | As such, they should be less sensitive to contextual factors and should not increase or decrease their voice in response to those factors. That is, highly satisfied group members will engage in voice regardless of the situation.\n5u67 | In contrast, those who are less satisfied are also less attached and less dependent on the group. Their behavior in the group is not based on fulfilling their values through group involvement. Instead it is more a function of the characteristics of the situation. That is, situational factors are more salient to individuals who are less satisfied with their group and their behavior is more \"plastic.\" Therefore, we expected individuals with low satisfaction to be more responsive to the conformity pressure, feelings of anonymity, and diffusion of responsibility that are characteristic of large groups. Similarly, we expected individuals with low satisfaction to be more responsive to feelings of accountability and personal responsibility that are characteristic of self-managed groups. In essence, we propose that low satisfaction magnifies the relationship between situational factors and voice. That is, low satisfaction strengthens the negative relationship between group size and voice and the positive relationship between style of management and voice. Accordingly, we hypothesized the following:\ndvms | Hypothesis six a. Voice will be an interactive function of satisfaction with the group and group size such that the negative relationship between group size and voice will be stronger (more negative) for individuals who are less satisfied with their group relative to those who are more satisfied with their group.\nqrd3 | Hypothesis six b. Voice will be an interactive function of satisfaction with the group and self- versus traditional management such that the positive benefit of self-management on voice will be stronger (more positive ) for individuals who are less satisfied with their group relative to those who are more satisfied with their group.\nrxrg | Summary\ntf43 | Consistent with the notion that voice in work groups is a function of more than just satisfaction, we have used theory and related empirical findings to hypothesize relationships for two person-centered constructs (satisfaction with the group and global self-esteem), two situational constructs (group size and style of management), and their interaction in expanding our understanding of the antecedents of voice. In the next section, we report a study that assessed these hypotheses using a construct valid measure of voice behavior.\nfcco | Method\n8uji | Respondents and Procedure\ndf3e | The proposed relationships in this study are not limited to any particular type of employee, job, or organization.
