        "content": "8p6h | Thirdly, many positions will argue - in different ways - that there is a moral difference between anthropogenic and non-anthropogenic extinctions. In Holmes Rolston's the Third words, 'natural extinction opens doors, anthropogenic extinction closes them'. Independently from whether Rolston's view on the matter is convincing, some people will intuitively find it morally objectionable that a species in the form of all the individuals belonging to that species abruptly disappears due to human actions and thereby also ending an evolutionary process, instead of taking issue with natural evolutionary processes in themselves. This distinction not only assumes that anthropogenic and non-anthropogenic extinctions are conceptually different, but usually also relies on the judgement that human-caused extinctions are morally more problematic than non-anthropogenic extinctions. So, for many authors it is relevant to know whether human causation is at play for the ethical assessment of the extinction in question and that, in turn, is closely related to judgements about moral responsibility. Contrasting views consider all species extinctions to be similarly morally problematic and thereby downplay the moral relevance of anthropogenic causation by adding 'wrongness'.\npmgl | The fourth conceptual distinction needs to be made between mass extinctions and non-mass extinctions, with mass extinctions differing from an ordinary extinction event in several ways.\n90no | Because of these differences, evaluative judgements about the current sixth mass extinction event on earth seem to be often based on the intuition that mass extinctions are morally more problematic than single extinction events. For example, consider how different terms such as 'environmental atrocities' or 'ecocide' can be potentially linked to extinction. While many might think that single extinction events added together are as bad as a mass extinction event involving the same number of species lost, some authors argue that a mass extinction is worse - for example due to additionally involving a 'planetary shift'.\njt0y | Why or when might anthropogenic extinctions be morally problematic?\nqb7o | Returning to our question from the introduction, conservation biologists Soul√© and Wilcox famously claimed that 'death is one thing; an end to birth is something else'. This implies an evaluative judgement about the badness of species extinctions, but what might that mean? In the more recent environmental ethics literature, we can find a variety of reasons given to explain why anthropogenic extinctions might be or might not be morally problematic. We will present the main but not sole reasons found in this literature focusing on one the value of species, two harming nonhuman individuals, three the value of biodiversity and four duties to future human and nonhuman generations. In the last part of this section, we will also turn to five instances where extinctions might even be morally desirable.\noae5 | Involving loss of value due to the loss of species\ns0fl | Because species extinctions involve the loss of species, the most obvious place to start is to think about whether this loss is in itself problematic. A common argumentative route in this regard is to argue that species are valuable and, thus, their extinction involves a loss of something that has been important to someone. For example, certain species might be instrumentally valuable because they are useful for human purposes. However, species might also be valuable independently from their actual or potential use value. That is, in contrast they might have intrinsic value as entities that we value in themselves. Let us briefly introduce three non-exhaustive versions of this position.\n43ia | For one, authors such as Rolston have argued that species - not understood as classes but as 'living historical forms' - are objectively intrinsically valuable 'some values are objectively there-discovered, not generated, by the valuer'.\n3g2y | Cambridge Prisms: Extinction\ngc7v | one hundred sixteen, which means that with each species that disappears, we lose something of value even if we fail to recognize this loss. In his words,\nwqfv | the species defends a particular form of life, pursuing a pathway through the world, resisting death, extinction, by regeneration maintaining a normative identity over time. It is as logical to say that the individual is the species' way of propagating itself as to say that the embryo or egg is the individual's way of propagating itself. The value resides in the dynamic form; the individual inherits this, exemplifies it, and passes it on.\nj30a | However, only anthropogenic extinctions are subject to moral evaluation a duty to avoid extinctions in Rolston's account. He relies for this purpose on the analogy between 'natural death' a natural extinction and 'murder' an anthropogenic extinction, which leads him to assess each anthropogenic extinction as a 'superkilling'. That is, on Rolston's account the metaphor of a superkilling illustrates the badness of extinctions by putting an end to an evolutionary 'story' and precluding its future evolutionary possibilities. Other authors such as Lawrence E. Johnson have spelled out similar ideas, but with less emphasis on evolution and rather in terms of the species' interests and their resulting moral standing.\n7bdk | Criticism of accounts such as Rolston's or Johnson's position, in turn, has been aimed at different aspects of their theories. Two primary areas of debate stand out. Firstly, the plausibility of the underlying theory of objective intrinsic value in Rolston's account is a matter of debate. Against the background that intrinsic values were intensely discussed in the field of environmental ethics at the time when Rolston published his account, it should be noted that other authors such as Callicott defended alternative value accounts relying on subjective values or human sentiments as the basis of a non-anthropocentric environmental ethic. Secondly, Johnson's position relies on the idea that species can be considered to be akin to living beings i.e. it relies on a specific species concept - as a living entity - that has been widely criticised not only by individualist perspectives but also by other holistic accounts and, thus, also be morally considerable in the same way. However, whether that analogy is convincing and whether species have morally relevant interests are also a matter of debate. Consequently, in the more recent literature other arguments in favour of the moral value of species that are not based on such an understanding of species are more widespread.",
