        "content": "nvfy | Another way in which stress can play a role in word recognition is via canonical correlations between stress pattern and word class. Words which can be either nouns or verbs, such as rescue or control, show slight prosodic differences consistent with the canonical patterns when read in their two word class realizations. Listeners know and can use this; in studies by Kelly and colleagues, subjects who were asked to use bisyllabic nonwords in a sentence as if they were words treated initially-stressed nonwords as nouns and finally-stressed nonwords as verbs. Further, when asked to use verbs as nonce-nouns subjects chose verbs with initial stress, while for nouns acting as nonce-verbs they chose nouns with final stress. This is analogous to knowledge of other stress regularities which has been demonstrated in production studies.\nmror | However, canonical patterning again does not directly speed spoken-word recognition, so that, for instance, whether or not a bisyllabic word conforms to the dominant noun and verb pattern does not affect how rapidly its grammatical category is judged - cigar is perceived as a noun just as rapidly as apple, and borrow is perceived as a verb as rapidly as arrive. Arciuli and Cupples replicated this result. Davis and Kelly also found no significant difference in the same classification task for native English speakers, but interestingly nonnative speakers of English - whose responses were of course much slower than those of the native speakers - did show a response advantage in their study for words which conformed to the canonical stress pattern for nouns and verbs respectively.\nzlxc | Gating is a task in which words are presented in fragments of increasing size; the dependent variable is how large a fragment is needed for listeners to recognize the word. Jongenburger and van Heuven, using Dutch minimal pairs such as voornaam in sentence context, found that listeners' word guesses only displayed correct stress judgments for the initial syllable of the target word once the whole of that initial syllable and part of the following vowel were available. This result suggests again that minimal stress pairs may not exhibit the strongest possible effects of stress information on word activation, since it contrasts with another gating study, in which listeners could correctly assign just the first syllable of a word, in sentence context, to one of two words in which it was respectively stressed versus unstressed.\nk0bw | For English, Lindfield, Wingfield, and Goodglass conducted a gating study in which the presentation of word-initial fragments was contrasted with a condition in which the same fragments were presented along with additional information about how long the target word was, or how many syllables it had and what the stress pattern was. Recognition of the target occurred earlier in the latter condition. Arciuli and Cupples found however that adding low-pass filtered versions of the remainder of a gated word did not lead to earlier recognition compared with the gated fragment alone.\naq5a | Related to gating studies are experiments in which listeners are presented with parts of words and asked to select, usually in a two-way forced choice, the source word. In Dutch, van Heuven, Jongenburger, and Cutler and Donselaar found that listeners could correctly select between two Dutch words with a segmentally identical but stress-differentiated initial syllable when presented with only the first syllable; Cutler and Donselaar found that the second syllables of minimal stress pairs could also be accurately judged.\nsc5y | The high proportion of correct responses in the Dutch studies, for example, eighty-five percent for first and eighty percent for second syllables in Cutler and Donselaar's experiment, was not equaled in a similar study in English by Mattys, though here too listeners performed above chance with both two-syllable and one-syllable word-initial fragments, on average sixty-two percent and fifty-four percent correct, respectively. Similarly, Cooper et al. found that English listeners correctly assigned fifty-nine percent of initial syllables to source words such as music versus museum. Remarkably, however, Dutch listeners outperformed the native speakers in the same experiment, scoring seventy-two percent correct assignments. As discussed in section eleven point three point one, the contribution of stress information in resolving lexical competition may be greater in some other languages than in English, and this difference may allow some proficient non-native users of English to exploit English stress cues more effectively than native speakers do.\n0yab | Eleven point three point three Lexical mismatch\nw95z | Other evidence that English listeners do not make maximal use of stress information in speech comes from studies of the perception of mis-stressed words. Small, Simon, and Goldberg found that mis-stressing did not inhibit word recognition if it effectively created the target word's stress pair, though recognition was significantly inhibited if the mis-stressing created a nonword. Similarly, Bond and Small found that word recognition in shadowing was achieved despite mis-stressing as long as the mis-stressing did not result in an alteration of vowel quality; Slowiaczek found the same for word identification in noise. Cutler and Clifton found that shifting stress without altering vowel quality had a much smaller adverse effect on recognition than stress shifts which changed full vowels to reduced or vice versa.\n0i1k | In contrast, Dutch experiments on the perception of mis-stressed words, using gating, or a semantic judgment task have shown that mis-stressing harms word recognition in that language, and at least in Koster and Cutler's study the effects of mis-stressing were of similar magnitude to the effects of segmental mispronunciation. Mis-stressing of finally-stressed Dutch words is more harmful than mis-stressing of initially-stressed words both in gating and in a semantic decision task.\ndqlg | In German, the same result appeared when ERPs were recorded as listeners made decisions about correctly stressed versus mis-stressed words: KAnal instead of kaNAL produced a deviant electrophysiological response, while kaNU instead of KAnu did not.",
