After concluding that any traditional land rights of the Australian indigenes had long since been extinguished, Dawson J wrote:\ngocl | Accordingly, if traditional land rights (or at least rights akin to them) are to be afforded to the inhabitants of the Murray Islands, the responsibility, both legal and moral, lies with the legislature and not with the courts.\nob1z | Similarly, in the context of Australia's history of European settlement, Dawson J concluded:\nm4cb | There may not be a great deal to be proud of in this history of events. But a dispassionate appraisal of what occurred is essential to the determination of the legal consequences, notwithstanding the degree of condemnation which is nowadays apt to accompany any account. The policy which lay behind the legal regime was determined politically and, however insensitive the politics may now seem to have been, a change in view does not of itself mean a change in the law. It requires the implementation of a new policy to do that and that is a matter for government rather than the courts. In the meantime it would be wrong to attempt to revise history or to fail to recognize its legal impact, however unpalatable it may now seem. To do so would be to impugn the foundations of the very legal system under which this case must be decided.\nm61y | WHAT IS THE SEPARATION OF POWERS DOCTRINE?\nu2ob | In its most basic formulation, the separation of powers doctrine prohibits one single branch of government (the parliament, executive and judiciary) from exercising the powers of another branch of government. The three traditional branches of government are essentially regarded as separate in function. In this respect, the Australian Constitution is much influenced by its American counterpart, in turn affected by the philosophical teachings in vogue at the time when the United States Constitution was written.\n2gnm | In the context of the United States, James Madison wrote:\nemgw | The accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive and judiciary, in the same hands, whether of one, a few, or many, and whether hereditary, self-appointed, or elective, may justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny.\nxaqt | Such a sentiment was stated in its purest form by the Supreme Court of the United States in Springer et al v Government of the Philippine Islands:\n5rcb | ... unless otherwise expressly provided or incidental to the powers conferred, the legislature cannot exercise either executive or judicial power; the executive cannot exercise either legislative or judicial power; the judiciary cannot exercise either executive or legislative power.\n524j | That the doctrine of separation of powers has relevance to the Australian Constitution cannot be denied. However, it is significant that in the Constitution, the executive powers (although nominally vested in the Queen and exercisable by the Governor General) were, from the start, to be administered by the Queen's Ministers of State. Those Ministers were required by the Constitution to secure a seat in Parliament no later than three months after their appointment as such. The significance of this requirement is that it is indicative of a rejection of a strict separation of powers doctrine in Australia.\nxd3m | The high watermark of the separation of powers doctrine in Australia was the Boilermakers' case. In that case, it was held that the Federal Parliament could not, by legislation, confer upon a federal court both judicial and non-judicial functions. To purport to do so was inconsistent with the provisions of the Australian Constitution and also with the very structure of the Constitution. Upon this basis, the Court of Conciliation and Arbitration could not validly exercise both judicial and non-judicial powers. The outcome of the decision was the division of those functions respectively between the Industrial Court (from which has grown the Federal Court of Australia) and the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission (from which has grown the Industrial Relations Commission of Australia).\n8qb6 | The decision of the High Court of Australia in Boilermakers' was affirmed by the Privy Council. Their Lordships observed:\nwkbn | ... in a federal system the absolute independence of the judiciary is the bulwark of the constitution against encroachment whether by the legislature or by the executive. To vest in the same body executive and judicial power is to remove a vital constitutional safeguard.\nftfg | The context of the Boilermakers' decision is important. It was decided at a time when the declaratory theory of judicial function was almost universally accepted in Australia. Any notion that the judges invented the law was strongly rejected. Dixon CJ asserted that the law would have no meaning as a discipline if there were not pre-existing norms which the\n7xi5 | In Defence of Mabo\nw8r5 | judge merely had to find and then to apply. Such a task might be difficult and, at times, taxing. But aided by 'strict and complete legalism', the application of logical rules and analogous reasoning, the relevant principles of law would always be found.\nybik | While this declaratory theory of strict and complete legalism is still probably accepted by many in the general community and by politicians in Australia, it is a view which is now held by very few Australian and English judges. Lord Reid, in nineteen seventy-two, denounced such a view as a 'fairy tale' in which we did not believe 'any more'.\ngii5 | An assertion that a court has breached the separation of powers doctrine by creating law which was more properly the domain of parliament is closely linked to the criticism of the judiciary for being too creative in the particular case. Such an assertion typically calls for a return to greater judicial restraint.\nq5eu | SEPARATION OF POWERS, JUDICIAL RESTRAINT AND THE HIGH COURT\na7ao | For the purist, the strict separation of powers doctrine requires absolute judicial restraint. The classical theory of judicial restraint dictates that the judges do not have regard to 'changing economic, social and political ideas' in the exercise of their judicial power, 'unless [such considerations] are specifically commended to the court's attention by the legislature'. Strict adherence to the notion of judicial restraint is given considerable weight by two undeniable factors: first, the judiciary's exercise of a power legislative in character is illegitimate as the judiciary lacks accountability and therefore democratic authority to make radical new laws. Second, the judicial process is inapt to provide the appropriate consultative processes which significant reform or change in the domain of the legislature requires.\n29a3 | In recent years there has been a slow, but steady, drift in Australia away from the strict theory of judicial restraint. The exact limits of judicial creativity are yet to be defined - assuming that the boundary could ever be defined with precision. In Caltex Oil Pty Ltd v The Dredge 'Willemstad', Stephen J in the High Court of Australia recognised that 'policy considerations must no doubt play a very significant part in any judicial definition of liability and entitlement in new areas of the law'.\nsb1e | However, he warned that to 'apply generalized policy considerations directly ... instead of formulating principles from policy and applying those principles ... is ... to invite uncertainty and judicial diversity.'\nw2yn | Deane J in Oceanic Sun Line Special Shipping Co. Inc. v Fay expressed what he took to be the correct approach to be adopted when a judge is invited to change the existing common law and to adopt a new approach. He said:\nap6l | There are three main reference points to which regard should be paid in deciding whether the United Kingdom doctrine should be accepted as the law of this country. They are legal principle, decided authority and policy.\n```",
