        "content": "d0ik | We elucidate the appearance and robustness of quantum skyrmion lattices as a function of the external magnetic field, the strength of DMI, and perturbations of the form equation two due to uniaxial anisotropy. For this calculation, we have concentrated on a triangular lattice with disk boundary conditions of diameter L equals nine sites, for which we obtain a single centered skyrmion for B equals J equals negative zero point five D in the unperturbed case K equals zero. We relax the fine-tuned parameter lines of figure two by variations of B, J, and consider nonzero uniaxial anisotropies for J less than zero by varying K.\n0x0s | Based on our simulations, we predict the existence of at least three distinct quantum phases of our model: one, a region hosting HS states for weak field amplitudes, two, a valley for field strengths of the order of B approximately negative zero point five D, which features a lattice formed by quantum skyrmions of radius r approximately three a, SKX3a, and three, an FP phase where spins align parallel to the external field.\n4exe | Helical spin spiral states are characterized by a vanishing average polarization m squared, whereas field-polarized states are maximally polarized, up to finite-size effects. As shown in figure two, quantum skyrmions are embedded in a background of field-polarized spins, and as a consequence, the state in the skyrmion lattice phase will have a finite polarization smaller than a corresponding field-polarized state. We numerically confirm this intuitive picture and find disjoint intervals of average polarization m z uniquely linked to each phase, which can be summarized in the zero-temperature phase diagram presented in figure nine. Note that figure nine is obtained by simulations of a fixed flake system size and is therefore only qualitatively correct in the thermodynamic limit. Furthermore, the interplay between system size and skyrmion length scale might lead to incommensurate phases which will be the subject of future work. In order to determine the exact position of quantum critical points or the nature of the quantum phase transition, a finite size extrapolation is necessary, a study which we leave for future work.\n0myz | Our results about the dependence of the skyrmion phase on the uniaxial anisotropy are in qualitative agreement with corresponding classical systems, where it is known that a weak uniaxial anisotropy tends to stabilize skyrmion configurations at smaller magnetic fields. Furthermore, we observe that the skyrmion radius increases with negative J over D, such that quite large spin-half systems might be needed to resolve even individual quantum skyrmions. Based on our results for J equals negative zero point five D we conjecture that the skyrmion lattice phase should also exist for such cases where the individual quasiparticles have a larger radius, but due to limitations dictated by the numerical complexity, which we discuss in Appendix A, other numerical techniques must be consulted to make quantitative predictions about the phase diagram for negative J over D much greater than zero point five. Similar values of the exchange coupling are expected in present thin film experiments, thereby making our results of practical relevance.\nxh3i | Besides the ferromagnetic SKX3a phase, which is the focus of this work, we find signatures of a quantum skyrmion lattice phase in the absence of exchange coupling and even for antiferromagnetic couplings J less than or equal to zero. However, because of the significantly enhanced entanglement, the MPS ansatz for this phase requires an exponential scaling of the bond dimension with the system size, and\nsyiw | QUANTUM SKYRMION LATTICES IN HEISENBERG ...\nkg3t | therefore simulations of large clusters are out of reach for DMRG.\nlvae | Seven. Summary\no9sc | We have demonstrated that the ground state of the two-dimensional ferromagnetic spin-half Heisenberg model in the presence of DMI hosts quantum skyrmions at intermediate magnetic fields B approximately J equals negative D over two. The resulting magnetic textures are characterized by a central spin pointing opposite to the direction of the applied magnetic field and winds radially outwards toward the field-polarized environment, similar to a classical NÃ©el skyrmion. For periodic boundary conditions and in the thermodynamic limit, we expect the ground state of the skyrmion lattice phase to be degenerate, scaling with the area of the individual skyrmion quasiparticles, such that the bulk of a system with open boundary conditions corresponds to a spontaneously symmetry broken state. The existence of quantum skyrmions yields experimental signatures in the position-dependent magnetization, the average polarization, and the structure factor, and we showed that these observables allow a distinction between a spin spiral phase at small magnetic fields, a skyrmion phase at intermediate magnetic fields, and a field-polarized phase at large magnetic fields.\n121u | While the spin texture is reminiscent of classical skyrmions, we should point out that in the present case, the skyrmion phase arises as a quantum ground state at zero temperature with open boundary conditions. In contrast, classical skyrmions typically occur at finite temperatures and result from a minimization of the free energy. Moreover, our examination of the resulting quantum state using the entanglement entropy and the concurrence has revealed that the quantum skyrmion state features significant entanglement shared between spin pairs of the skyrmion boundary. We argued that the quantum and classical states can be distinguished by the norm of the polarization S r less than or equal to one half, conserved for classical states, and by corrected correlation functions, vanishing for classical states. We therefore conclude that a semiclassical treatment of the quantum skyrmion based on a classical magnetic texture would not necessarily capture the internal degrees of freedom of a quantum skyrmion.\nzh03 | Towards larger system sizes, we found that the quantum skyrmion phase is characterized by a regular lattice of skyrmions. As the size of individual skyrmions is determined by the system parameters B, J, D, and K, a regular lattice requires commensurability between the lattice size and the skyrmion size. While our numerical simulations cannot reach the limit of infinite system size, our results allow us to extrapolate that the ground state in the thermodynamic limit features a dense packing of quantum skyrmion textures. Each of these quantum skyrmions has entanglement localized near its domain wall, but the entanglement between different skyrmions is small, which suggests that they can be approximated as individual quasiparticles.\n1mvw | We expect that our results may guide the development of an effective analytical field theory of the quantum skyrmion phase. Based on our experience, we conclude that variational tensor networks provide a suitable numerical technique to study these systems. This is not surprising for gapped quantum phases with short-range interactions and bounded entanglement. Nevertheless, using MPS for a two-dimensional system is not without pitfalls, as the necessary mapping on a one-dimensional system causes non-local interactions. We have made sure that our results have fully converged for lattice sizes corresponding to individual skyrmions. However, we have seen that the numerical errors grow for the system sizes required for four by four skyrmion lattices, twenty-nine by twenty-nine spin-half in total. For such large systems, we expect our results to be only qualitatively correct.",
