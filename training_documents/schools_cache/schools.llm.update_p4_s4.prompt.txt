You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

e8nr | Organizational theories have an underlying rationality theory in theoretical logic and provide conceptual tools to understand relations between organizations and the external environment. Rational and open systems theories tend to focus attention on the organizational unit and actors within them with open systems acknowledging a greater role for the external environment. While natural systems theorists such as Follett (1918) explicitly considered informal structures and power relationships, they did not integrate understandings of individuals' habitus and cultural capital into their explanations regarding the creation of informal structures.
k78w | 4 Empirical Studies in Culturally Diverse, High Needs Schools
g9du | Over time, scholars have applied organizational theories and other social theories that emphasize the external environment, including students' socioeconomic and racial/ethnic backgrounds. Since the 1970s, many scholars have examined effec- tive schools in which students perform better than expected given the prerequisites. Classic school effectiveness studies of leaders in high-needs schools (Edmonds 1979; Levine and Lezotte 1990) were conducted in the wake of the Coleman Report (1966) that identified students' socioeconomic background as more important to student success than the work of schools. Thus, Edmonds (1979) and Levine and Lezotte (1990) among many others studied those schools there were effective for all students regardless of socioeconomic status. More recently, the term "turnaround school" has emerged as a description of schools in which school principals led declining schools with high populations of children living in poverty and children of color to educational improvement in a short amount of time (Peck and Reitzug 2014).
f682 | Research on effective schools and turnaround schools (and leaders thereof) focuses on characteristics and practices of school organizations that contribute to student outcomes, including the development of a clear school mission, monitoring of student progress, protection of instructional time from interruptions, and main- tenance of high standards for teachers and students (Bossert et al. 1981; Brookover and Lezotte 1979; Murphy at al. 1985; Stallings and Mohlman 1981; Wellisch et al. 1978). These studies demonstrated the quality of the school principal plays a central role in school management, facilitating effective teacher instructions, and improving student learning outcomes (Chapman at al. 2016; Edmonds 1979; Teddlie & Reynolds, 1999). Studies conducted in the US, Canada and England concluded
li1k | that student learning outcomes and school improvement cannot be achieved without effective school leaders; leadership has direct and indirect positive effects on student outcomes (Day et al. 2016; Louis et al. 2010). While the above literature refers to the external environment, until recently, few scholars have specifically examined the ways in which school participants, including leaders, respond to student culture.
pbea | Johnson (2007) applied the notion of culturally responsive pedagogy (Ladson- Billings 1995) to leadership in high needs schools, defining culturally responsive leaders as those who support high academic achievement, value and affirm the home cultures of their students, empower parents from all economically and cultur- ally diverse settings, and actively seek societal change in an effort to make the surrounding communities better places for all. However, even in schools identified as highly successful, principals were inhibited in their abilities to provide a multi- cultural curriculum and involve parents in a meaningful way due to the high stakes policy environment focused solely on closing the achievement gap (Johnson 2007). Johnson (2007) contends, "Culturally responsive leaders also need models of how they might challenge the status quo of inequitable assessment practices, incorporate students' cultural knowledge into the school curriculum, and work with parents and community activists for social change in the larger community" (p. 55). Since 2007, leadership scholars such as Khalifa, Gooden and Davis (2016) also posit the impor- tance of culturally responsive leadership in schools. However, we see a continued need to theorize and apply explanations of culture from Bourdieu as part of leadership capacities needed in effective schools.
ccpt | As the International Schools Leadership Development Network (ISLDN) researchers and others (Belchetz and Leithwood 2007; Bennis and Thomas 2002; Gurr and Drysdale 2018; Mayo 2007) argue, the vast literature regarding school lead- ership frequently identifies the importance of context regardless of specific leadership approach (instructional, transformational, transformative, or culturally responsive), but the relationship between leadership and community/cultural context is not fully (theoretically) explained nor understood. As Gurr and Drysdale (2018) put it, "The interplay between leadership and context to some extent remains a 'black box': a process whose inputs and outputs (and the relationships between them) are known, but whose internal structure or working is not known or well understood" (p. 149).
0fpw | The ISLDN was developed as a joint initiative of the British Educational Lead- ership, Management, and Administration Society (BELMAS) and the University Council for Educational Administration (UCEA) (Baran and Berry 2015). The aim of ISLDN is to contribute to knowledge in the field of educational leadership by facilitating an international comparative study of how those involved in school lead- ership are supported in their preparation and development as leaders (Barnett and Stevenson 2011).
dqn8 | Selection criteria for participants in ISLDN research across countries such as Mexico, Sweden, USA, and Australia include high percentages of individuals from families with incomes below the poverty line; high teacher/leader turnover rates; and high percentages of historically socially excluded groups. More specifically, in terms of leadership, research teams in the participating countries focused on new principals or principals with greater than two years in their post where the school showed signs
cop0 | of improvement. Data collection sources featured interviews with the school leader, teachers and other senior staff members, parents, and students as well as observations and relevant document analysis. Interview questions focused on learning, leadership, and context. In ISLDN literature and related leadership literature (Hallinger 2018a, b), context is challenging to define, as context can be an element or layer or conceived as several layers. Findings from ISLDN scholars (Gurr and Drysdale 2018; Okilwa and Barnett 2018) indicate, not surprisingly, that school leaders adapt their leader- ship practices to suit the context. Okilwa and Barnett (2018) describe this leader- ship ability as contextual acuity. Contextually driven leadership practices include entrepreneurial strategies such as marketing to neighboring schools for students, strategic interventions to improve student outcomes, adaptability to changing circum- stances, building trust and relationships to bring people together around a common purpose of providing quality education, and transformative leadership practices aimed at equity and social justice.
lhkq | This literature not only synthesized current school leadership practices, but also pointed out the direction of future inquiry and capacity development for leader- ship culturally diversity, responsiveness, and social justice. And while we appreciate extant attempts to define culture as part of the context for empirical study, we see the need to extend and enhance this work theoretically and empirically in light of the contemporary situation of increasing cultural diversity among students. For this, we draw primarily on the work of Pierre Bourdieu (1977a) as well as Lingard and Christie (2003), two scholars who have applied Bourdieu's theories to educational leadership.
