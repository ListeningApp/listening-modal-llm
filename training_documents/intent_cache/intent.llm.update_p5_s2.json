        "content": "4xe7 | As shown, the occupational therapist employs several therapeutic strategies, usually rooted in existing models of practice, to facilitate the client's engagement in occupation. Depending on the occupational needs, capacities, and diagnosis of the client, any number of occupational therapy practice models might be employed alone or in combination to promote occupational engagement. However, this main task of promoting occupational engagement through employing the specific methods and strategies of occupational therapy does not exist in isolation of a larger process of relating that occurs between client and therapist.\npg4b | The IRM explains the relationship between client and therapist that is part of the overall process of occupational therapy. Accordingly, the model is intended to complement existing occupational therapy conceptual practice models rather than to replace any single model. It explains the detailed and overarching aspects of the client-therapist relationship, an aspect of occupational therapy not addressed by other practice models in as much detail or as the sole focus. Figure Three point three shows how the intentional relationship is designed to supplement the use of other occupational therapy conceptual practice models. As shown, the IRM should complement the usual concepts and strategies of occupational therapy that are directly aimed at facilitating occupational engagement.\nb0d0 | The model's utility for occupational therapy lies in addressing the otherwise unarticulated aspects of the\nd7eu | Occupation\nxndr | Existing Occupational Therapy Models (e.g., Biomechanical, Cognitive Disabilities, Model of Human Occupation,\nm6hi | Sensory Integration Model, etc.)\nvpkf | interpersonal relationship that occur during the therapy process and that influence both occupational engagement and therapy outcomes. If a therapist utilized only this model, the essential work of occupational therapy would not occur. Instead, the model was designed to fill a gap in our practical knowledge about how to manage the interpersonal aspects of therapy, particularly the more challenging ones. This model should complement the field's existing methods and models by making the process of establishing a successful relationship with clients easier, clearer, and more straightforward. The next section defines the elements of this model and provides an explanation of how the elements interact to optimize the circumstances for a successful client-therapist relationship in occupational therapy.\n4d67 | Elements of the Intentional Relationship Model\ne7j2 | The IRM views the therapeutic relationship as being comprised of four central elements.\nlqzt | One. The client's interpersonal characteristics\n1ocm | Two. The inevitable interpersonal events that occur during therapy\n527v | Three. The therapist's use of self (i.e., mode use, interpersonal skill base, and ability to apply interpersonal reasoning)\nlrri | Four. Occupational engagement, which is viewed as the mechanism of change\n5cl9 | A summary diagram of the model is presented in Figure Three point four. The model explains the requirements for a productive client-therapist relationship. It incorporates guidelines for responding to each client's unique interpersonal characteristics and to the interpersonal events that commonly occur during therapy. The relevant aspects of each element of the model and their relations with one another are described in the section that follows.\nu7a3 | The Client's Interpersonal Characteristics\nw409 | According to the IRM, achieving an empathic understanding of the client is the focal point of effective use of self\nm04y | (rather than the client's) to develop a working and predictable communication with the client and to respond appropriately when interpersonal events occur. To develop this relationship and respond appropriately to the client, a therapist must work to understand the client from an interpersonal perspective. This involves getting to know the client as an interpersonal being. The IRM calls for us to understand the most salient interpersonal characteristics of our clients as they present themselves during occupational therapy.\n23jk | The IRM asks us to strive to know our clients' interpersonal characteristics and behaviors within fourteen categories. The most critical aspect of understanding our clients as interpersonal beings involves a therapist's recognition of characteristics that make it more challenging to com-\noa63 | A client's lips are pursed and her shoulders are tight when she recol-\ne3lv | lects a conflict that occurred with her daughter just before the accident.\nrqv6 | A client is cold and would be more comfortable if she had her sweater, which she left in another room. She shivers through the rest of the session because she does not want to impose on or interrupt the therapist.\noa48 | fourteen categories of interpersonal characteristics. Each category may be a product of the situation (i.e., situational) or a more stable interpersonal style (enduing). Each characteristic is accompanied by an example of what would indicate a need for closer attention from the therapist.\n3fp1 | Our understanding of each of these characteristics should not be approached from a strengths versus liabilities perspective; the IRM is not interested in stigmatizing or pathologizing clients. Instead, the IRM calls for us to understand the interpersonal characteristics of our clients that may be most salient in terms of facilitating or interfering with the client's ability to do one or both of the following:\n557x | Effectively communicate and relate to the therapist\nep8e | Engage in whatever occupation is the focus of therapy\n7mv3 | According to the IRM, each of these fourteen interpersonal characteristics may also be understood along two dimensions:\nder6 | Situational\n8xg2 | Enduring\nnjvp | Situational Interpersonal Characteristics\ns8b5 | When one or more of the fourteen client interpersonal characteristics referenced in the preceding paragraph is described as situational, it means that the characteristic is generally inconsistent with how a client typically and consistently behaves when interacting with others. Instead, a situational characteristic reflects a client's acute behavior or reaction to a specific situation. Situational characteristics that interfere with communication or occupational engagement are most likely to reveal themselves when the client is facing a situation where some immediate aspect of the impairment or the environment is experienced as painful, frustrating, or stressful. Impairments, particularly when they are new or when there is a medical crisis or exacerbation in severity that disrupts one's usual routines or relationships, often cause people to experience stress. Therapists are encouraged to assume, on some level, that a client's impairment situation or the client's interaction with an unaccommodating or difficult environment causes the client to be more vulnerable to experiencing a variety of reactions, many of which may be perceived as negative or at least atypical for that individual.\np450 | PRACTICAL APPLICATION Three point one\nrsvo | Feelings of loss are common among newly disabled individuals, and they may manifest in terms of sadness, irritability, anxiety, insecurity, or anger. A health provider's interpersonal behavior, if perceived as insensitive, judgmental, or uncaring, may also serve as a source of stress and cause the client to interact in a manner that is generally inconsistent with his or her usual way of relating. It is important for new therapists to recognize that these and other acute emotional reactions are normative. In fact, they are \"givens\" in many health-care situations. They may bear no reflection on the client's character. However, they do have the potential to play out within the therapy relationship, and the way in which a therapist chooses to respond to them is often vital to the future of that relationship (Figure Three point five).\nz4m8 | Enduring Interpersonal Characteristics\nukf0 | By contrast, enduring characteristics are more stable and consistent aspects of the client's interpersonal behavior. Unlike a situational characteristic, enduring characteristics are not necessarily related to the situation of acquiring an impairment, an acute reaction during a brief moment of distress, or to problems in the environment, such as the lack of appropriate accommodations.
