You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).

y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

uodj | If We Could Just Join Hands: Led Zeppelin as Supergroup
k16v | R ock music's unprecedented international success from the mid- 1960s onward, in terms of economic impact, media notice, and critical respect, was marked by the growing numbers of acts com- prised of members sprung from bands that had already enjoyed some mea- sure of popularity. The term supergroup was first applied to Blind Faith in 1969, made up of Eric Clapton and Ginger Baker of Cream, Steve Winwood of Traffic, and Rick Grech of Family, all of them (especially Cream) with strong histories of record and ticket sales. Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young were another example of the phenomenon (they too debuted in '69), as David Crosby had emerged from the chart-topping Byrds, Graham Nash from the Hollies with their own string of hits ("Bus Stop," "Carrie-Anne"), and Stephen Stills and Neil Young from the Buffalo Springfield ("For What It's Worth"). Later the "supergroup" label was put to various highly successful bands, but it was most accurately employed as a description of ensembles made up of musicians boasting proven backgrounds in the business: Beck, Bogert & Appice; Emerson, Lake and Palmer; Asia; Damn Yankees; the Traveling Wilburys; and so on.
b2lm | By some standards, Led Zeppelin was a supergroup, but by most they were not. Jimmy Page, Robert Plant, John Paul Jones, and John Bonham were all full-time working players when they joined forces in 1968; Page and Jones had established solid reputations as session men, and Page had been a member of the world-touring Yardbirds; Plant had recorded and released songs under the CBS label; and by '68 Bonham was drumming for the rising star Tim Rose as well as catching the ears of other comers such as Joe Cocker and Chris Farlowe. The 1968 Atlantic Records press release that announced the label's signing of Led Zeppelin boasted that the group "consists of four of the most exciting musicians performing in Britain today," portraying Plant as "one of England's outstanding young

oksu | blues singers" and claiming that Bonham "caused a sensation with his drum solos." In contrast to previous generations of rock 'n' roll groups, Zeppelin were not a gang of teenage friends who'd worked their way up together playing dances, parties, and clubs in their home town-they were adult veterans signed on into serious performing and recording commitments from the start, and they were expected to deliver.
wtow | On the other hand, of all the men of Led Zeppelin only Page had been connected to a truly successful act, and it was his link to the Yardbirds that was put front and center in the group's earliest publicity handouts. Though Jones would certainly have continued to have an access to the higher levels of music production and management had Zeppelin not taken off, and though Plant and Bonham might have eventually found their own footings in the British music scene had Page taken on Terry Reid and B. J. Wilson as vocalist and drummer, respectively, none of them would have had the star factor of genuine supergroup recruits. If anything, it was generous of Page and Peter Grant not to extract a Jimmy Page Group or a Jimmy Page and the Mad Dogs out of the defunct Yardbirds, although in the long run the equal billing would give the foursome more credibility. Groomed to be a lucra- tive project of seasoned experts, Zeppelin nevertheless can't be properly put into the supergroup category. Surviving members have been involved in supergroups, though: Jones in Them Crooked Vultures, alongside Josh Homme of Queens of the Stone Age and Dave Grohl of Nirvana and the Foo Fighters, and Page in the Firm, with Paul Rodgers of Bad Company.
o22k | Have You Heard the News: Led Zeppelin as "Hype Band"
nwfz | Just as Zeppelin's "supergroup" status may be confused by Page and Peter Grant's registering their music publishing company as "Superhype," so did the name virtually invite accusations that the band itself was no more than a product of corporate manipulation and capitalist greed. The charge is not without foundation, but neither is the way Led Zeppelin conclusively disproved it.
nvfy | Following the watershed impact of Sgt. Pepper and the groundbreaking attractions of Cream and the Jimi Hendrix Experience, the record industry of 1968-69 had begun to codify some of the market trends observable during the era. Albums could be as lucrative as singles; artists didn't need Top 40 hits to draw a steady audience; blues-based, improvisatory electric guitar workouts were followed reverently by college-age fans; sexual, chemi- cal, or other countercultural references in the music and on the record covers could be more and more overt; talking up the "mind-blowing" poten- tial of new acts was a valid sales strategy. Atlantic Records took all these into

zlxc | account when signing Led Zeppelin in 1968 for a trade-headline-grabbing $220,000, a huge amount at the time and a sum few new acts have been granted since. With Cream disbanding and Jimi Hendrix, Iron Butterfly, Fleetwood Mac, the Who, and Vanilla Fudge more than demonstrating the continuing appeal of their heavy rock formula, Zeppelin looked and sounded like a good investment.
k0bw | From the point of view of many punters, however, and certainly of many of the youthful reviewers writing for US rock magazines like Rolling Stone, Creem, and Crawdaddy, Led Zeppelin seemed to be a calculated ploy-a deliberately packaged band whose sound and style were designed to resemble those of a roster of famous acts, touted in the pseudo-groovy language that was even then creeping into the lexicon of Wall Street, Madison Avenue, and Hollywood. The aforementioned Atlantic press release, ascribed to Bob Rolontz of the label, told of the "hot new group" whose "pulsations" had caught the ears of "top English and American rock musicians," prompting comparisons "to the best of Cream and Hendrix." "Led Zeppelin is the eighth British group to be signed by Atlantic during the past 24 months," the statement closed. "The others are Cream, Bee Gees, Julie Driscoll-Brian Auger & The Trinity, The Crazy World of Arthur Brown, The Marbles, The Magic Lanterns, and Jimmy James & The Vagabonds." Oh yes, the incomparable Marbles and Magic Lanterns. Led Zeppelin's first promotional flyers and zeppelin-shaped giveaway balloons were replete with slogans like "The Only Way to Fly," "Isn't that a gas!" and "Led Zeppelin 2 . . . Now Flying!"
aq5a | This was all hype-PR efforts to stimulate interest in a fresh act Atlantic Records had already wagered a lot of money on and which had to earn its keep. Around this time other big entertainment companies had tried to push the countercultural authenticity of their artists or movies and were met with suspicion by the hip youth market. There was MGM's "Bosstown Sound" attempts to sell Boston-based bands like Ultimate Spinach, Kangaroo, and Chameleon Church, all of whom flopped; ditto "now" Hollywood films like Getting Straight and Zabriskie Point, attempting to cash in on 1967's blockbusting The Graduate and 1969's Easy Rider. In this climate, given the kind of promo motifs used to introduce Led Zeppelin to North America, listeners had a right to be skeptical. An early Creem review called the band "only redone joplinshake heavybody drughendrix," while Rolling Stone dismissed the premier Led Zeppelin album as a template taken up in "the aftermath era of such successful British bluesmen as Cream and John Mayall."
sc5y | Such criticism frustrated the four members of Led Zeppelin, and their intense run of touring and recording between 1969 and 1973 may be seen
