These substrates with a deposited silver layer are denoted in the text as GC/Ag or Au/Ag. Before the reference membrane casting, the surfaces of the Ag, GC/Ag, or Au/Ag were rinsed with methanol and THF. The reference cocktails were allowed to dry for at least twenty-four hours, and after that the quality of the dry REF-Br membranes was inspected using an optical microscope to check for possible faults, namely, adhesion to the substrate, compactness of the membrane layer, the presence of cracks, and uncovered substrate areas,\nccmb | and to select the membranes without faults for further experiments.\nma93 | Apparatus. The potentiometric measurements were performed using a homemade sixteen-channel setup. The input impedance was greater than ten to the thirteenth power Ohms and the input current was lower than twenty femtoamperes for each of the sixteen inputs as well as for the reference electrode input. The multichannel potential-meter was coupled with a personal computer equipped with a sixteen-bit resolution data acquisition card PCI DAS six thousand fourteen and custom-made software. In typical conditions, the potential resolution was better than zero point zero two millivolts.\nc6hh | In the potentiometric measurements the double junction REF two five one reference electrodes were used. All the experiments were performed at room temperature (twenty-two to twenty-four degrees Celsius). Stirring up to five hundred revolutions per minute did not significantly affect the readouts.\ny7ea | RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nnav4 | One. The rate of standard potential stabilization and its repeatability. Freshly prepared electrodes with dry REF-Br membranes were immersed in two Molar KBr and their potential changes were recorded. The shortest soaking time (usually several tens of seconds) was needed for electrodes with REF-Br-nano membranes. A longer soaking (several hundreds of seconds) was required for the electrodes with REF-Br-photo membranes, while the longest was for the electrodes with REF-Br-QB membranes. The short-time behavior of the electrodes is similar for the metallic silver and the substrates with a deposited silver layer on nonsilver electronically conducting substrates, for example, glassy carbon, as shown in Figure one.\ngem8 | The results show the convergence of the short-time potentials, for the five electrodes used, to less than three millivolts after a few minutes of soaking. The mean potential after twenty minutes is negative one hundred fifty-seven point six three plus minus one point zero nine millivolts.\ne8nr | Two. Long-Term Potential Stability of the Electrodes with REF-Br Reference Membranes. For several hundreds of all the types of REF-Br membranes studied, the stable and reproducible potential readouts collected are all located in a rather narrow potential range to the mean potential negative one hundred fifty-seven plus minus ten millivolts. No systematic lifetime experiments were undertaken. However, for the same subtypes of electrodes, typically in a series of five to sixteen electrodes, the potentials were reproducible within plus minus two millivolts during continuous measurement for ten days in two\nk78w | Molar KBr. These were the electrodes with the reference membranes deposited on Ag substrate embedded in a PVC body. This design facilitates the adhesion of PVC membrane to the PVC body which is advantageous to the electrodes' lifetime.\ng9du | Three. Substrate Influence on the Standard Potential Value and Its Stability. Excellent potential reproducibility and long-term potential stability were observed for all REF-Br membranes deposited on silver substrate or with GC or Au substrate covered with the silver layer. The membrane was unattached from the substrate and the presence of silver, potassium, and bromide was analyzed by SEM/EDAX on both sides of the membrane, Figure two.\nf682 | The largest amount of silver and bromide were determined on the side of the membrane in contact with Ag substrate, whereas for the other side, mainly bromide and potassium signals were detected.\nli1k | If the reference membranes were placed directly on GC or Au substrate, unpredictable and unstable potential values were recorded.\npbea | Four. EIS Spectra for Electrodes with REF-Br Membranes Deposited on Silver or Nonsilver Substrate. The influence of the Ag phase was inspected by electrochemical impedance.\nccpt | A striking difference in the impedance spectra for electrodes with reference membranes deposited on Ag substrate or nonsilver substrate was observed. Namely, the difference is manifested by a disappearance of a low-frequency branch for the membranes deposited on Ag substrate which is present if the substrate is a nonsilver one. The EIS results indicate a slower electrochemical process rate in the membrane without dispersed Ag. The appearance of Warburg type behavior at lower frequencies can be attributed to a slower ion-transport in the membrane. It can be hypothesized that dispersed silver facilitates the overall electrochemical process.\n0fpw | The EIS spectra illustrating this effect, recorded for electrodes with REF-Br-photo membranes deposited on a bare GC substrate and for the GC substrate covered with Ag are presented in Figure S-2.\ndqn8 | Five. Mechanism of the Br-REF Response. Undoubtedly, the fact that the metallic silver, both as the layer on the substrate and in the form of dispersed nanosilver in the membrane, significantly contribute to stabilizing the potential of the REF-Br systems is of general importance to solid contact\n```",
