So, like the individualist arguments extinctions are again not problematised because of the loss of species themselves, but rather due to what this loss means for other valued entities or other matters of moral concern.\niat7 | Future generations\nywwr | A further reason for why species extinctions might be morally problematic concerns our duties to future human generations. In essence, if we believe that the interests of future generations put current generations under an obligation to not frustrate these interests, we have a reason to protect species and biodiversity that future generations might intrinsically and instrumentally value and, thereby, avoid irreversible loss. While there might be considerable uncertainty about what species, ecosystems and/or ecosystem services future generations will actually value and/or need, this ultimately involves again an assessment of different arguments pertaining to the value of species and biodiversity. Moreover, considerations about duties towards future generations in terms of species conservation provide a bridge between the ethics of extinction and the ethics of sustainability.\n0i6j | In addition to these human-focused arguments, we can also consider non-anthropocentric arguments pertaining to the future. There\n87cq | are two main argumentative routes open in this regard. Firstly, one can consider potential duties towards future nonhuman beings or species in so far as the extinction of other species will affect them negatively. Like how in intra-human intergenerational ethics a lot of thought has been given to the nonidentity problem, also here we face a nonhuman nonidentity problem, in so far as anthropogenic species extinctions will affect which individuals will come into existence in the future. That is, the extinction of some species will have a knock-on effect on which individuals of still remaining species will meet and mate, which in turn will influence which individuals will live in the future. The underlying philosophical problem is that those future individuals would not have come into existence without the extinction. Secondly, the case of extinctions also leads to a non-existence problem in so far as nonhuman individuals, species and ecosystems in the future will not only be affected by prior extinctions, but many nonhuman individuals will simply never come into existence.\n0qs3 | Can anthropogenic extinctions ever be justified?\nz8f7 | Some readers might assume that all anthropogenic extinctions are morally problematic, but does that judgement hold up in all cases? Consider these two examples from species conservation practice. Firstly, concerning local as opposed to global extinctions consider restoration-based reasons in favour of the extinction of a population of an invasive species. Secondly, other conservation practices such as captive breeding and release programmes have in turn been criticised on the grounds of not allowing for a death with dignity. While in this case the extinction might still seem morally problematic, such programmes might not present an appropriate response. In both cases, it is possible to claim that an extinction can be all-things-considered better than an alternative course of action, for instance, on ecocentric or sentientist argumentative grounds.\n7w7j | Also, consider the case of disease-transmitting species such as certain mosquitoes that transmit malaria, dengue fever, zika and so on, which is the most discussed case of potentially justified extinction. The global health burden of these diseases is very high, which provides a good reason to consider whether the eradication of such disease-transmitting species would be an appropriate means to address this problem. While it is an empirical question to decide whether this constitutes an approach that is likely to succeed while minimising the risks in comparison with alternatives, this also generates a range of ethical questions to consider, such as regarding the moral standing of individual nonhuman animals, ethical aspects of risk and the intrinsic and/or instrumental value of species. A particular emphasis found in the literature on bioethics concerns questions of research ethics, risk and consent regarding genetically engineering species such as mosquitoes in this context. Notably, even some authors who consider\n51vd | anthropogenic extinctions to be highly morally problematic acknowledge exceptions for disease-transmitting species such as malaria-transmitting mosquitoes. While the use of synthetic biology such as gene drives remains controversial, the health burden of vector-borne diseases constitutes a weighty reason to take them into consideration.\nbaj1 | Intended species extinctions are also considered for other - even more controversial - purposes, which include the case of predation raised in animal ethics. While some animal ethicists consider wild animal suffering to be of serious moral concern, a few authors go as far as arguing that there are reasons speaking in favour of the extinction of predatory species. The benefit hoped for would be the reduction of non-anthropogenic suffering in the wild caused by predation. Such proposals to alleviate wild animal suffering by a range of means aimed at de-wilding or redesigning nature are in turn not shared by other animal and environmental ethicists on more general terms, as well as specifically on the question of removing predatory species. Reasons include the difficulties of implementing such proposals and more principled objections towards such interventions into nature.\nn1wo | How to respond to extinctions?\n```",
