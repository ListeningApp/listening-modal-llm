        "content": "gocl | All the optimal solutions of D four Ht four O twelve correspond to the real crystals shown in Figures four (a), four (b), four (c), and four (d). The cation D makes coordination polyhedra of anticuboctahedron or cuboctahedron. Besides, we find that D three Ht six O fifteen has the optimal solution corresponding to the BaTi two O five structure shown in Figure four (f). The optimal solution consists of eleven LGCs, but we find another optimal solution consisting of only five LGCs with the Cmmm symmetry shown in Figure four (e).\nob1z | Our results indicate that De four Ht two O eight and De nine Ht four O sixteen have only one optimal solution corresponding to the crystal structure of La two minus z Sr two CuO four as shown in Figure five (a). The cation De makes coordination polyhedron of capped square antiprism. Besides, our calculations indicate that D one De two Ht two O seven and D two De four Ht four O fourteen also have a unique optimal solution corresponding to the crystal structure of La two minus z Sr one plus two Cu two O seven which consists of three kinds of coordination polyhedra as shown in Figure five (b).\nm4cb | In the pyrochlore-o structure found as one of the optimal solutions for Do four Hd four O fourteen and Uo four Hd four O fourteen, one oxygen ion is placed in the center of the tetrahedron composed of large cations, and the distance of ionic bond\nm61y | must be smaller than those of the other ionic bonds, and thereby a large cation makes coordination polyhedron of distorted cubic as shown in Figure five (c). In fact, our calculations indicate that the pyrochlore-a structure is difficult to obtain without soft sphere, while both the Do four Hd four O fourteen and Uo four Hd four O fourteen have the optimal solution corresponding to the pyrochlore-o structure, which has the lowest number of LGCs with highest symmetry. Note that the interatomic distances can be as small as possible with-\nu2ob | out attractive forces since the volume of the unit cell is minimized. The optimal solution consisting of the second lowest number of LGCs for the Uo four Hd four O fourteen is the layer-by-layer structure of cubics and octahedra with the P one symmetry as shown in Figure five (d).\n2gnm | The cubic coordination can also be realized by the cation Eo. Eo six O twelve has the optimal solution corresponding to the zirconia structure shown in Figure five (e). The cation Eo can also make the coordination polyhedra of\nemgw | square antiprism as shown in Figure five (f).",
