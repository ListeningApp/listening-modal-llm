        "content": "cbb5 | Six) Two-Hidden-Layer Fully Connected Multilayer Neural Network: To see the effect of the architecture, several two-hidden-layer multilayer neural networks were trained. Theoretical results have shown that any function can be approximated by a one-hidden-layer neural network. However, several authors have observed that two-hidden-layer architectures sometimes yield better performance in practical situations. This phenomenon was also observed here. The test error rate of a twenty-eight by twenty-eight by three hundred by one hundred by ten network was three point zero five percent, a much better result than the one-hidden-layer network, obtained using marginally more weights and connections. Increasing the network size to twenty-eight by twenty-eight by one thousand by one hundred fifty by ten yielded only marginally improved error rates: two point nine five percent. Training with distorted patterns improved the performance somewhat: two point five zero percent error for the twenty-eight by twenty-eight by three hundred by one hundred by ten network, and two point four five percent for the twenty-eight by twenty-eight by one thousand by one hundred fifty by ten network.\n5qcf | Seven) A Small Convolutional Network-LeNet-One: Convolutional networks are an attempt to solve the dilemma between small networks that cannot learn the training set and large networks that seem overparameterized. LeNet-One was an early embodiment of the convolutional network architecture which is included here for comparison purposes. The images were down-sampled to sixteen by sixteen pixels and centered in the twenty-eight by twenty-eight input layer. Although about one hundred thousand multiply-add steps are required to evaluate LeNet-One, its convolutional nature keeps the number of free parameters to only about two thousand six hundred. The LeNet-One architecture was developed using our own version of the USPS database and its size was tuned to match the available data. LeNet-One achieved one point seven percent test error. The fact that a network with such a small number of parameters can attain such a good error rate is an indication that the architecture is appropriate for the task.\n8u2c | Eight) LeNet-Four: Experiments with LeNet-One made it clear that a larger convolutional network was needed to make optimal use of the large size of the training set. LeNet-Four and later LeNet-Five were designed to address this problem. LeNet-Four is very similar to LeNet-Five, except for the details of the architecture. It contains four first-level feature maps, followed by eight subsampling maps connected in pairs to each first-layer feature maps, then sixteen feature maps, followed by sixteen subsampling maps, followed by a fully connected layer with one hundred twenty units, followed by the output layer, ten units. LeNet-Four contains about two hundred sixty thousand connections and has about seventeen thousand free parameters. Test error was one point one percent. In a series of experiments, we replaced the last layer of LeNet-Four with a Euclidean nearest-neighbor classifier, and with the \"local learning\" method of Bottou and Vapnik, in which a local linear classifier is retrained each time a new test pattern is shown. Neither of those methods improved the raw error rate, although they did improve the rejection performance.\nc1e3 | Nine) Boosted LeNet-Four: Following theoretical work by Schapire, Drucker et al. developed the \"boosting\" method for combining multiple classifiers. Three LeNet-Fours are combined: the first one is trained the usual way; the second one is trained on patterns that are filtered by the first net so that the second machine sees a mix of patterns, fifty percent of which the first net got right and fifty percent of which it got wrong; the third net is trained on new patterns on which the first and the second nets disagree. During testing, the outputs of the three nets are simply added. Because the error rate of LeNet-Four is very low, it was necessary to use the artificially distorted images, as with LeNet-Five, in order to get enough samples to train the second and third nets. The test error rate was zero point seven percent, the best of any of our classifiers. At first glance, boosting appears to be three times more expensive as a single net. In fact, when the first net produces a high confidence answer, the other nets are not called. The average computational cost is about one point seventy-five times that of a single net.\n7pez | Ten) Tangent Distance Classifier: The tangent distance classifier is a nearest-neighbor method where the distance function is made insensitive to small distortions and translations of the input image. If we consider an image as a point in a high-dimensional pixel space (where the dimensionality equals the number of pixels), then an evolving distortion of a character traces out a curve in pixel space. Taken together, all these distortions define a low-dimensional manifold in pixel space. For small distortions in the vicinity of the original image, this manifold can be approximated by a plane, known as the tangent plane. An excellent measure of \"closeness\" for character images is the distance between their tangent planes, where the set of distortions used to generate the planes includes translations, scaling, skewing, squeezing, rotation, and line thickness variations. A test error rate of one point one percent was achieved using sixteen by sixteen pixel images. Prefiltering techniques using simple Euclidean distance at multiple resolutions allowed to reduce the number of necessary tangent distance calculations.\nqs5t | Eleven) SVM: Polynomial classifiers are well studied methods for generating complex decision surfaces. Unfortunately, they are impractical for high-dimensional problems because the number of product terms is prohibitive. The support vector technique is an extremely economical way of representing complex surfaces in high-dimensional spaces, including polynomials and many other types of surfaces.\nen4s | A particularly interesting subset of decision surfaces is the ones that correspond to hyperplanes that are at a maximum distance from the convex hulls of the two classes in the high-dimensional space of the product terms. Boser et al. realized that any polynomial of degree k in this \"maximum margin\" set can be computed by first computing the dot product of the input image with a subset of the training samples (called the \"support vectors\"), elevating the result to the k-th power, and linearly combining the numbers thereby obtained. Finding the support vectors and the coefficients amounts to solving a high-dimensional quadratic minimization problem with linear inequality constraints. For the sake of comparison, we include here the results\ncsb5 | obtained by Burges and Schölkopf and reported in. With a regular SVM, their error rate on the regular test set was one point four percent. Cortes and Vapnik had reported an error rate of one point one percent with SVM on the same data using a slightly different technique. The computational cost of this technique is very high: about fourteen million multiply-adds per recognition. Using Schölkopf's V-SVM technique, one point zero percent error was attained. More recently, Schölkopf has reached zero point eight percent using a modified version of the V-SVM. Unfortunately, V-SVM is extremely expensive: about twice as much as regular SVM. To alleviate this problem, Burges has proposed the RS-SVM technique, which attained one point one percent\ni096 | on the regular test set, with a computational cost of only six hundred fifty thousand multiply-adds per recognition, that is, only about sixty percent more expensive than LeNet-Five.\ntlzt | D. Discussion\n6iyf | A summary of the performance of the classifiers is shown in Figures nine through twelve. Figure nine shows the raw error rate of the classifiers on the ten thousand example test set. Boosted LeNet-Four performed best, achieving a score of zero point seven percent, closely followed by LeNet-Five at zero point eight percent.",
