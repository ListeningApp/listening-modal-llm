You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

06yq | The Nature of Emerging Practice in Occupational Therapy: A Pilot Study
dpv6 | ABSTRACT. The profession of occupational therapy is responding to changes in the health care system by expanding the contexts and models for service provision, typically referred to as emerging practice. As a pilot study, a survey was completed by 174 occupational therapists to gather information and opinions about emerging practice. Results indicated oc- cupational therapists hold diverse perceptions about emerging practice settings and services as well as the role and significance of emerg- ing practice within the profession. Occupational therapists engaged in emerging practice described numerous rewards and challenges inherent within the process of developing and delivering services. The findings indicate continued professional dialogue and research are needed to sup- port the development and efficacy of occupational therapy services in emerging settings and roles.

ls7d | INTRODUCTION
tzt3 | The health care system in the United States is dynamic with continuous changes in policies, models of service delivery, and reimbursement sys- tems. Ongoing challenges include the number of medically uninsured indi- viduals in the United States at 45.7 million in 2007, down slightly from 47 million in 2006 (DeNavas-Walt, Proctor, & Smith, 2008), and those under- insured estimated at 25 million (Reinberg, 2008). As well, the management of chronic diseases among an increasingly aging population (Clarke, 2007) and the continual growth of health care expenditures at approximately 6.7% annually (Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, 2008) fur- ther strain the existing system. During the 1970s and 1980s, philosophical and policy decisions began to shift the focus of health care away from the medical model to alternative models of care. Baum (2000) described these elements of change in the health care system as a "progression from an institution-centered medical model, with treatment delivered episodically, to a community-based sociopolitical model, the goal of which is to plan or manage health care delivery" (p. 12). Accompanying the development of alternative and managed models of care is a stronger emphasis on wellness, health promotion, and disease prevention. Experts believe future changes will include larger, integrated care systems, an increasing focus on patient- centered care, the shift of procedures from hospitals to outpatient and home settings, and a continued emphasis on facilitating reimbursement for pre- ventive care (Carpenter, 2007; Clarke, 2007). This ongoing evolution com- pels health care professionals to examine their philosophy of services, cur- rent and future roles within the health care system, and methods for service delivery.
t8vv | The profession of occupational therapy experienced both challenges and opportunities brought about by these changes in the health care system. As an example, during the 1990s, occupational therapy practitioners increas- ingly found their daily practice shaped by restrictive reimbursement poli- cies and a decreasing availability of employment in medical settings (Fisher & Cooksey, 2002a, 2002b; Reiss, 2000). More recently, data show an in- creasing availability of occupational therapy positions nationwide with school systems, early intervention programs, and hospitals employing the majority of practitioners (52.6%) and a 4% annual growth in available po- sitions in several regions of the country (American Occupational Therapy Association [AOTA], 2006). Concurrently, the context for providing occu- pational therapy services began to expand beyond facility-based environ- ments, such as rehabilitation programs and hospitals, to community-based and emerging practice settings (Baum & Law, 1998; Fazio, 2008; Scaffa,
qvnu | 191
kggw | Holmes and Scaffa
xrd1 | 2001). These developments align with the call for occupational therapy practitioners to evaluate their roles and services in light of the philosoph- ical foundations of the profession and the therapeutic goal of engagement in occupations for the promotion of health, well-being, and full participa- tion in life (Baum, 2000; Fidler, 2000; Jacobs, 2002a, 2002b; Kornblau, 2004).
5746 | The Centennial Vision (AOTA, 2003) outlines broad practice categories from which emerging practice may meet new and growing needs of com- munities and individuals. These categories are children and youth, health and wellness, productive aging, work and industry, and rehabilitation, dis- ability, and participation. Examples of emerging practices within these cat- egories include ergonomic consultation, driver rehabilitation and training, health promotion for aging communities at senior centers, welfare-to-work services, and life skills training at homeless shelters (Johansson, 2000).
7toz | Although the provision of occupational therapy services in community- based settings is often a component of emerging practice, multiple settings and roles may be considered an emerging practice. However, it remains a limited area of practice for the profession as a whole. The results of a recent workforce and salary survey conducted by the AOTA (2006) showed few occupational therapy respondents reporting community (1.6%) or emerg- ing practice settings (other, 1.9%) as their primary work setting. Because emerging practice is a relatively new development within the profession, its nature and significance to the profession is not clearly understood. Accord- ingly, the purpose of this pilot study was to investigate the characteristics of emerging practice prior to an exploration of the competencies for emerging practice (Holmes & Scaffa, in press).
j346 | METHODOLOGY
v8uq | A written survey was developed for this study to answer the following questions. What is the nature of emerging practice today and what are its challenges and rewards? Survey research was chosen as the method to collect information from the population of occupational therapists in order to complete an initial description and exploration of the topic (Babbie, 2001). Survey research provides information about a targeted population or sample at one point in time and in that respect can be considered cross- sectional (Bailey, 1997). The written survey results offered preliminary information relevant to understanding and further investigating emerging practice.
x972 | Participants
cwrw | The population included occupational therapists who were current U.S. residents and initially certified for practice by the National Board for Certification in Occupational Therapy (NBCOT). The study sample was recruited using convenience and purposive sampling techniques. The sam- ple comprised 700 occupational therapists who were current members of AOTA and who either identified the AOTA Home and Community Health or Education Special Interest Sections (SISs) as their primary in- terest on their initial or renewing membership applications from 1999 to 2000. These SISs were thought to include members with interest or expertise in emerging practice. Names and addresses of the SISs mem- bers were selected by the AOTA List Rental Service and purchased in electronic format. Each of the 700 therapists received a letter inviting them to participate in the study. The survey and a return envelope were also included in the packet. Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval to conduct the study was obtained from Gonzaga University. Return of the survey form was considered voluntary consent to participate in the study.
4i0e | Instrument
h2l3 | To address face and content validity of the instrument, five occupa- tional therapists who had emerging practice expertise reviewed a draft of the survey and provided feedback on the format and content of individ- ual survey questions. The written survey requested information about the respondents' current occupational therapy practice setting, job title, and employment status. Respondents were asked to identify whether they were providing occupational therapy or occupational therapy-related services in an emerging role or setting. If respondents answered yes, a series of questions followed requesting information about the emerging practice role or setting, services provided, population(s) served, the respondents' educational background, years of professional experience, and factors con- tributing to the development of the knowledge and skills for practice in the emerging roles or settings. Last, all respondents completing the sur- vey were asked to answer two open-ended questions about the nature of emerging practice and its challenges and rewards. Intentionally, a defini- tion of emerging practice was not provided within the recruitment letter or on the survey instrument to facilitate broad consideration of the research questions.

u6ty | Data Analysis
awvu | The survey yielded both qualitative and quantitative data. Quantitative data were analyzed using SPSS version 11.5 software for numerical data (2001), and version six (N6) of NUD*IST software (2002) was used to analyze qualitative or text data. Narrative responses to the open-ended questions from the survey were coded and analyzed for content and specific themes. Descriptive statistics were computed for the numerical responses obtained from the closed-ended questions included in the survey.
on9b | RESULTS
a8ge | All Survey Respondents
h27a | One hundred and seventy-four occupational therapists (24.9%) of the 700 therapists in the sample returned the survey. The response rate, while low for survey research, was considered adequate for analysis and reporting given the lack of a comparable survey published in the literature (Babbie, 2001). At the time of the survey, 166 (95.4%) of the respondents reported themselves to be currently employed. Of those currently employed, 132 (79.5%) reported their job duties to include the provision of occupational therapy services, 132 (79.5%) were employed 30 hr or greater weekly, and 34 (20.5%) were employed on a part-time basis of less than 30 hr weekly. Table 1 presents information about the respondents' years of experience, current employment settings, and educational backgrounds. Notably, 101 (58.4%) of the respondents reported 20 or more years of occupational therapy experience.
pdjh | The Nature of Emerging Practice
xmgs | All 174 participants were asked to describe emerging practice in occupa- tional therapy; 167 (96.0%) valid responses were received. Responses were organized into two themes according to the frequency of the responses: (a) the settings and services associated with emerging practice and, (b) the rationale for emerging practice. Frequently, a participant's description of emerging practice fits more than one theme. Consequently, the number of responses tallied for each theme does not correlate directly to the number of valid responses. Table 2 summarizes the results for the two themes.
bd9h | Theme one: settings and services associated with emerging practice. The greatest number of responses identified nontraditional occupational

gy8c | therapy services provided in settings other than health care systems, school systems, clinics, and long-term care facilities as emerging practice. Spe- cific examples of nontraditional services included health and wellness promotion, low vision services, or injury prevention programs. Although labeled nontraditional services, participants correlated the services pro- vided with the promotion of occupational performance, the philosophy of occupational therapy, and the Occupational Therapy Practice Framework: Domain and Process (AOTA, 2002).
y4mj | Respondents also identified those practice settings believed to be more conducive to occupational performance and to achieving independence, such as the home environment, as emerging practice settings. The next most frequent response included community-based services, such as occu- pational therapy services to the homeless population, programs for persons with mental illness or addictions, day programs for adults with develop- mental delays, and transitional housing and employment programs, as emerging practice. Sixteen responses explicitly labeled emerging practice as reemerging practice. These respondents related the nature of emerging

m4ju | practice to services provided at an earlier time in the profession by the profession's founders and by practitioners in the 1960s and 1970s, thereby classifying emerging practice as a new name for a familiar concept. One respondent commented, "We return to our roots in the settlement house system. Settlement houses were change-making institutions. We are return- ing to being change makers rather than servants of a consumer society." Additional descriptions of emerging practice included the delivery of novel or innovative occupational therapy services in traditional practice settings. Examples offered included a mini-putting green for orthopedic patients and educational programs for home health aides. The theme of research support for emerging practice included the recognition that research evi- dence is needed to justify emerging practice services and to demonstrate meaningful outcomes that will be reimbursed. Additionally, respondents noted that as academic communities develop emerging practice opportu- nities, there is a delay in time before the profession as a whole accepts and incorporates the practice strategies.
a0mb | Theme two: rationale for emerging practice. One rationale for emerg- ing practice was the successful promotion of participation in occupations among individuals, groups, or communities through the development of
ki8m | occupational therapy services to underserved or unserved clients. In this process, respondents described the importance of practitioners conducting a needs assessment as a first step in developing a service delivery model for a new population. A practitioner described this concept, "Therapists do not enter with preconceived notions about what needs to be done, rather they identify needs that emerge as an outgrowth of interactions among what people need and what the environment has to offer."
km8w | A second rationale for emerging practice related to its perceived sig- nificance to the profession. Respondents indicated that emerging practice areas are critical for development despite the inherent challenges to the pro- cess of developing and delivering services. However, an alternative view of emerging practice was that of being problematic for the profession. A respondent pointed out:
wzno | It is difficult, for me, to look out at "emerging practice" when "current practice" remains nebulous. As an educator, I see students of all ages who are unfamiliar with OT and its role. If OT practice in "emerging practice" helps identify the role of OT for all involved parties, let the research begin!
xagm | Equally important was the deliberation about the greater risk to the profession from the development of emerging practice. One participant questioned, "Are we making a big mistake professionally as we decide to move away from [the] medical model towards a more social work/social justice model-what will we gain [or] lose? Immediately and [for the] long term."
iwn5 | Rewards and Challenges of Emerging Practice
uooz | All 174 participants were asked to identify the rewards and challenges of emerging practice; 163 (93.7%) valid responses were received. Re- sponses to the question were organized into themes that were inclusive of all comments provided by the participants. Participants identified mul- tiple rewards and benefits to emerging practice. The narrative analysis resulted in the following themes: (a) rewards for the profession, (b) re- wards for clients, and (c) rewards for individual practitioners as shown in Table 3.
pxbq | The rewards of emerging practice for the profession and its clients were many; however, the theme of individual rewards for the occupa- tional therapy practitioner yielded the greatest number of responses. En- gagement in emerging practice offered distinct benefits to the therapist,
