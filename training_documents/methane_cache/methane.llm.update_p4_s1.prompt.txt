You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

zse6 | subunit from Nitrosocaldus yellowstonii AMO, indicating conservation of this site over the broad pMMO/AMO superfamily. However, in this structure, the copper ion is involved in a crystal lattice contact, and the N-terminal histidine ligand is disordered.34 In the M. capsulatus (Bath) pmoB subunit, an additional copper ion is present at the interface of the two cupredoxin domains, coordinated by His48 and His72 (Figure 5). The His48 ligand is not conserved in other pMMO sequences, and the site is not observed in the other pMMO structures. 24-26
p2n3 | Several lines of evidence suggest that the crystallographically modeled dicopper center is the active site of pMMO. First, the ligands to the dicopper center are conserved in almost all methanotroph pmoB sequences as well as in homologous subunits from all members of the pMMO/AMO superfamily.34 The only exceptions are a few pmoB sequences from methane- oxidizing Verrucomicrobia.36,37 These sequences are evolutio- narily distant, and it is possible that their extreme growth environments (pH 0.8-5, 22-88 ℃) require a different type of active site." Second, metal loading of apo membrane-bound pMMO only results in methane oxidation after addition of 2-3 copper equivalents per 100 kDa aßy pMMO protomer, consistent with an active site requiring more than one copper 26,38 Third and most important, a recombinant soluble fragment of the M. capsulatus (Bath) pmoB subunit (spmoB, Figure 5) can oxidize methane to methanol in the presence of copper, and this activity is abolished upon mutagenesis of two or all three of the ligands to the dicopper site. 8,39 Consistent with this model, mutagenesis of the ligand equivalent to His139 in a homologous Mycobacterium NBB4 hydrocarbon mono- oxygenase (HMO) that oxidizes C2-C4 alkanes reduces activity significantly. However, in that enzyme, ~20% residual activity is retained,40 perhaps due to copper binding by the other ligands, as has been observed for spmoB.39

vbni | Both Cul and Cu" are routinely detected in pMMO by X-ray absorption spectroscopy,33 and all samples of pMMO exhibit an electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopic signal attributable to a type 2 Cu" site.39,41,42 Correlation of EPR signals with specific crystallographic copper sites in M. capsulatus (Bath) pMMO has been facilitated by comparative analysis of pMMO and the spmoB proteins.3 EPR and metal analysis using pMMO and spmoB variants that disrupt the monocopper (H48N,H72A), dicopper (H33,137,139A), or both copper (H48N_H33,72,137,139A) sites indicate the presence of a valence localized, mixed valence Cu'Cu" center at the dicopper site and a Cu' ion at the monocopper site. The location of the Cu" is proposed to be valence scrambled between the two copper binding sites with one copper coordinated by His137 and His139, and one coordinated by His33 and the N-terminal amino group. No water or hydroxide ligands to the Cu" ion are detected.
dgcw | An additional metal binding site is present in the pmoC subunit of pMMO. This site can bind zinc or copper, and the metal ion is coordinated by residues Asp156, His160, and His173 (M. capsulatus (Bath) numbering) (Figure 5).23-26 Recent metal binding studies using pMMOs from M. capsulatus (Bath) and Methylocystis sp. str. Rockwell suggest that zinc binding at this site partially inhibits activity, perhaps by interfering with proton transfer, and that this site is likely unoccupied by metal ions in vivo.20 Interestingly, a structure of Methylocystis sp. str. Rockwell pMMO soaked in zinc reveals a fourth ligand to this site, Glu201 (Glu 228 using M. capsulatus (Bath) numbering) (Figure 5), which derives from a loop region of pmoC that is disordered in all previous structures. This region spanning pmoC residues 200-223 (Methylocystis sp. str. Rockwell numbering) contains many strictly invariant residues, including Glu211, Phe213, His218, Phe221, and Val222 (Glu238, Phe240, His245, Phe248, and Val249 using M.

The potential importance of this pmoC region is underscored by mutagenesis studies of the Mycobacterium NBB4 HMO in which individual mutations in the residues corresponding to ligands Asp156, His160, and His173 (M. capsulatus (Bath) numbering) completely abro- gated hydrocarbon oxidation activity.40 Replacement of the residue equivalent to Asp166 (M. capsulatus (Bath) numbering) also abolished activity, which is interesting because this residue is located on a flexible loop that points away from the metal binding site in the pMMO structures.

This assay was preferred historically because the product, propylene oxide, is not further oxidized by methanotroph cells and extracts.43 For M. capsulatus (Bath) sMMO, the turnover number for methane is in the range of 0.2-1.0 s 1 at 45 ℃ and that for propylene is ~0.7 s-1 (Table 2).44,45 The Km values for
