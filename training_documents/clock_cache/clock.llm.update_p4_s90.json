        "content": "ohh7 | GC analysis of hydroxylation reactions with two revealed only a single product, which was identified by comparison to an authentic standard as the alcohol two a. No peaks that might arise from rearranged alcohol two b or aromatic hydroxylation products were detected. A plot showing the rate of product formation is given in Figure S two.\nvbni | Analysis of the extracts from reactions with trans one, two dimethylcyclopropane three revealed only one product, the concentration of which increased linearly with time over a ten-minute period. It was identified as the unrearranged alcohol, trans two-methylcyclopropyl methanol three a, through comparison of its GC retention time with that of an authentic standard. No four penten two ol three b or two methylbut three en one ol three c was detected.\ndgcw | The substrate bicyclo two point one point zero pentane four afforded three products upon reaction with MMO, each of which had its parent ion at m over z eighty-four as determined by GC MS analysis. No authentic standards were available for the expected products, but one product could be positively identified as endo two hydroxy bicyclo two point one point zero pentane four a by comparison of its mass spectrum with one published previously. The second major peak in the gas chromatogram was assigned as exo two hydroxybicyclo two point one point zero pentane four b. Unfortunately no mass spectral data for this compound were available for comparison. The peak had approximately the same intensity, about eighty-five percent, in the total-ion chromatogram of the reaction extracts as that of four a. Its mass spectrum differed from those of four a and three cyclopenten one ol four c, for which mass spectral data are also available. Hydroxylation of four by cytochrome P four fifty yielded only four a and four c. The failure of this enzyme to afford four b was attributed to constraints at the active site. It may be that the active site of MMO is less discriminating, which could account for the formation of both four a and four b.\ngvwz | The third product from reactions with four was present in only trace amounts and was assigned as three cyclopenten one ol four c. It has been reported previously that four a undergoes thermal rearrangement to four c. In particular, when four a isolated from the hydroxylation of four by MMO was injected into the GC MS, the ratio of four c to four a was found to be about one to thirty. Compound four b is expected to behave similarly. The intensity of the peak corresponding to four c was also found to increase relative to those for four a and four b when the reactions were run at forty-five degrees celsius for longer times. Increasing the injector and oven temperatures of the gas chromatograph produced a similar effect. The ratio of four c to four a was one to forty, or including both four a and four b, one to eighty, and increased with longer\nsk5m | Hydrocarbon Hydroxylation by Methane Monooxygenase\nqws8 | incubation times at forty-five degrees celsius to about one to fifteen. It is therefore likely that a significant amount, if not all, of four c obtained in these experiments is due to thermal rearrangement of four a and four b. The amount of four c present in the enzymatic reactions is small enough that its presence could be solely the result of thermal rearrangement of four a and four b.\n877u | Experiments were also carried out with one and the hydroxylase from M. trichosporium OB three b. In contrast to reactions with MMO from M. capsulatus Bath, three products were observed. They were identified as unrearranged alcohol one a, two para hydroxy phenyl methylcyclopropane one c, and rearranged product one b. The ratio of unrearranged to rearranged alcohol was found to be thirty-two to one in reactions performed with coupling protein and reductase from M. capsulatus Bath and twenty-two to one for reactions using hydrogen peroxide.\nrzhj | Discussion\nbfax | Analysis of Products Formed. In this work, four hydrocarbon substrates were employed as mechanistic probes in oxidations catalyzed by the MMO of M. capsulatus Bath. In each case, if a hydrogen atom were abstracted from the probe, the resulting radical could either rebound to form the unrearranged product or ring open to afford the rearranged product. In no case was rearrangement observed. For trans one, two dimethylcyclopropane three only a single product formed, corresponding to the unrearranged alcohol three a, e q two. No allylic alcohol was detected\nf2y8 | \"C H two\no7qm | three b, e q three, implying that no more than one percent of this product formed during the hydroxylation reaction. From the known rate constant for rearrangement of the corresponding cyclopropylcarbinyl radical and assuming that this rate constant is the same for substrate free in solution and bound to the enzyme, we estimate that the rebound rate constant of a radical intermediate would have to be at least four times ten to the power of ten per second at forty-five degrees celsius. A similar analysis of the results for reactions with compounds four, one, and two raises the rebound rate constant limits to three times ten to the power of eleven, four times ten to the power of thirteen, and one times ten to the power of thirteen per second, respectively. The latter two values exceed the rate constant of decomposition of a transition state and are incompatible with a discrete radical intermediate.\nd52l | The rate constants for ring opening of radicals derived from one and two have been measured indirectly by competition against P H Se H trapping. At room temperature, the ring\nqlbb | \"\"I C H\nnhsg | openings have rate constants of three times ten to the power of eleven per second and five times ten to the power of eleven per second, respectively, which places these reactions among the fastest reported radical rearrangements involving a bond-breaking step. With such a velocity, detectable amounts of ring-opened products are expected to be produced from these radicals even when the fastest possible trapping reactions compete. Therefore, the absence of ring-opened alcohols one b and two b suggests that probes one and two were converted directly to alcohols one a and two a without formation of radicals. On the other hand, a small amount of rearranged product one b was observed in the studies of MMO from M. tri\nhy0l | chosporium OB three b. From the ratio of unrearranged to rearranged alcohol the rate constant for rebound was calculated to be six to ten times ten to the power of twelve per second. The observed differences in the results for MMO from the two different sources will be discussed later.\n4jmz | In the case of the chiral substrate probe one, oxidation occurred not only at the methyl group but also at the phenyl ring to form two para hydroxyphenyl methylcyclopropane one c. The fact that one a and one c are produced in equal quantities over the course of the reaction suggested that the two products might arise from different enantiomers of the probe. Preliminary studies with partially resolved one tend to confirm this possibility, but more data are required for the hydroxylation of both pure enantiomers before a definitive statement can be made.",
