        "content": "u1ky | Insofar that these efforts to harmonize the materiality concepts in sustainability reporting are unsuccessful, it may have detrimental effects for users of such information and for society at large more broadly. From a policy risk standpoint, there is a ditch on both sides of the road. On the one hand, the future might hold a concept of materiality that is purely oriented towards financial materiality, which would make it possible to anchor standards in empirical analyses of which sector-specific sustainability issues are financially material for companies. While perhaps being attractive for investors owing to its specificity on financial materiality, such a solution would do little to respond to the needs of other users of information and would likely lead to important sustainability impacts being omitted from sustainability reporting. On the other hand, one could envision that the future holds a concept of materiality that is highly inclusive in terms of capturing both double and dynamic materiality, but without the clarity and guidance that allows users of information to discern between the types of materiality assumed for each sustainability issue or indicator. While allowing for comprehensive disclosure of sustainability impacts, such a future might carry the risk of perpetuating the confusion that is already experienced by many users of information and which is indeed reported by the respondents of the present study. The future development of standards for sustainability reporting and the approaches to materiality therein therefore needs to navigate between these two pitfalls.\nhtm9 | As these developments continue, there is ample need for research. From a user of information perspective, several empirical strategies could be fruitful. For instance, conducting in-depth qualitative studies into the process by which different users of information make sense of and discern between different types of material information in sustainability reports would be useful. This could for instance be done by means of in-depth interviews or observation studies. An alternative empirical strategy would be to conduct experimental investigations of reporting formats. For instance, one could develop treatments that present the various types of material information differently and measure differences in respondents' abilities to discern between financially material sustainability information and other types of sustainability information. In addition, one might study how different stakeholders and financially interested actors assess materiality dependent on their own roles and responsibilities in their respective organizations.\n8hul | There is also room for further research - perhaps mostly qualitative - on the processes by which different approaches to materiality emerge, evolve and are used in practice. Previous work has shed light on the genealogy of the materiality concept as well as the adoption of the concept in practice. The present paper has attempted to add to the understanding of how practitioners understand the application of the materiality concept in sustainability reporting and as new frameworks and standards emerge, further research into perceptions, tensions and resolutions is much needed.\n87vz | Notes\nym66 | One. A stream of research documents the value relevance of material sustainability information. In recent work, the relevance of materiality for understanding this relationship has become influential. Khan et al. found that firms with good ratings on material sustainability issues significantly outperformed firms with poor ratings on such issues. Grewal et al. moreover found that only forty-two percent of shareholder proposals relate to sustainability topics that are material, whereas Grewal et al. found that companies that disclose more material sustainability information have higher stock price informativeness.\nl0a3 | Two. The definition is quoted from the SASB website and is based on the US Supreme Court's definition of material information.\nu8nw | Three. We note that a materiality matrix with similar axes as Figure Two was indeed published by the GRI in its Technical Protocol Applying the Report Content Principles. It has since been superseded by the matrix shown in Figure One. We are grateful to an anonymous reviewer for pointing this out.\nl2v9 | Four. There is ongoing debate in the field of law on the question of whether the specific reference to dynamic materiality is actually needed, or if it is already implicit in the materiality definition used by the SEC.\nafbe | Five. One might even add that there are sustainability issues that are neither deemed important by the company nor on the radar of stakeholders but might still be important issues from social or environmental standpoints. That is, there may even be \"silent voices\" that are never heard and that will clearly not be emphasized in materiality assessments whether in a GRI or a SASB perspective.\n78r8 | Six. As pointed out by SASB in its conceptual framework, there are important implications of sustainability issues for the risk profile of the company, in the sense that it can influence its cost of capital. In the conceptual framework, \"Better disclosure enables a more complete understanding of exposure to risk and more accurate pricing of risk associated with volatile performance and/or industries with an unstable outlook.\"\n320g | Seven. See Global Reporting Initiative and Sustainability Accounting Standards Board for an example of such combined disclosure.\ntp8g | Eight. Not at least, this also needs to be seen in relation to the proposed development of an International Sustainability Standards Board by the IFRS Foundation. In a recent consultation paper, the IFRS discusses the need for such international standards and explicitly addresses the potential compatibility with double materiality reporting based on standards. Perhaps one could envision that such ISSB standards could serve as a backbone or starting point, which could be combined with standards developed by the Value Reporting Foundation.\ngxfd | Sustainability reporting and materiality\ns2v1 | Sustainability reporting and materiality",
