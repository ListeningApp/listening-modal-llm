        "content": "877u | These scenarios will surprise few researchers familiar with irregular settlement in Mexico (notwithstanding some important differences), but the extensive irregularity of lot titles is highly unusual in the United States, so much so that an NGO-Community Resources Group was commissioned by the Texas Government to undertake the regularisation of the affected settlements. The Community Resources Group programme targeted fifteen colonias outside Rio\nrzhj | Grande City and served over two thousand households and two thousand five hundred lots. Of these, some one thousand households and lots were the focus of land title regularisation, usually because claimants had defective papers, or where their lot ownership was challenged in some way-multiple claimants, living in the wrong lot, or in an arroyo floodplain. The Community Resources Group's portfolio included the colonias and land that had been sequestrated from the developers, and the agency's brief was to carry out the title and servicing regularisation of these settlements. Thus, the aim was to provide clear title to those with legitimate claims and to move some households to new lot sites particularly those living in dangerous locations, or where there were multiple claimants to the same piece of land.\nbfax | Here is not the place to describe the details of the regularisation process or an evaluation of the agency's performance. Suffice to note that the findings reported here were collected as part of a detailed analysis and evaluation of the Community Resources Group regularisation programme and its impacts for the period nineteen ninety-five to two thousand two, with particular emphasis on the five years between nineteen ninety-seven and two thousand two which was when the clearing of 'clouded' lot titles began in earnest. Data-gathering over a single year (two thousand two) comprised a number of sources. It began with a systematic review of Community Resources Group files and documents; and a major household survey was undertaken primarily between January and June of two thousand two. The study embraced a range of methods of data collection: archival analysis, Community Resources Group database analysis, key informant interviews and focus groups, as well as the household survey of a total of some two hundred sixty-six families from a randomly pre-selected four hundred thirty-six households (i.e. sixty-one percent were interviewed) living in six of the larger colonias that had been affected by the Community Resources Group intervention (of which there were fifteen in all). The purpose-designed household survey was applied to two sample groups. First, those who had no titles or who had experienced major difficulties and challenges associated with their titles or\nf2y8 | residence and who ultimately received titles as part of the Community Resources Group intervention. These were one hundred ninety-five of the three hundred three pre-selected cases and, in the following analysis, these households are referred to as the \"Study Group\". Secondly, we interviewed a sample of resident households who had not experienced serious title problems and who were therefore not affected by Community Resources Group intervention. Although they also lived in the same settlements, they had received Contracts for Deeds or had completed the purchase of their lots such that they had been able to secure a warranty deed for their properties. Although they formed part of the Community Resources Group Receivership plan and hoped and expected to benefit equally from any later service provision, households in this group held secure title. We proposed to use them as a benchmark sample for comparative purposes and to help us assess the degree to which title provision made any significant differences to home improvement, land values, etc. Of the one hundred thirty-three households identified for pre-selection in this 'Control Group', seventy-one (i.e. fifty-three percent) were eventually successfully interviewed. While open refusal rates were very low, notwithstanding multiple call-backs, it proved impossible to interview everyone in the pre-selection group. While we cannot be exactly sure of the degree of bias this reduced sample may have introduced, we have no reason to suspect that it was important, or that it detracts significantly from some of the findings reported below.\no7qm | The detailed questionnaire was conducted in Spanish and covered information about housing trajectories, land market transactions, the 'meanings' attributed to titles by owners, property valuations in the area, the perceived impact of titles on colonia improvements and upon home improvements, as well as standard socioeconomic indicators information. It took about twenty-five to thirty minutes to complete.\nd52l | Land Price Analysis and Land Market Performance\nqlbb | The remainder of this article analyses land\nnhsg | price trends for a number of the Community Resources Group-intervened colonias in Starr County and seeks to define the main trends of prices over time. Two principal sources are used: first, we drew upon the detailed data contained in a database that had been generated by Community Resources Group contact with residents as the agency sought to examine individual claims of ownership as a precursor to the actual clearing of property titles. Secondly, we cross-checked these data with information that we had collected from the questionnaire survey and, in so doing, were able to tie the analysis to responses from the deeper set of questions, and to the independent variable data that were collected. Although the data come from the same broad constituency, the advantage of this dual approach is that it allows us to triangulate the larger Community Resources Group database as well as undertake a deeper level of analysis in relation to a smaller 'panel' of respondents whom we interviewed in greater depth. We were also able to compare some of the socioeconomic data from these two sources with that of the two thousand Census in those cases where these colonias coincided with census-defined 'places'. In such cases, the coincidence of findings between the census and the sample data were reassuringly close, providing greater veracity to our sample survey findings.\nhy0l | Methodology and the Database Samples\n4jmz | The first database that we analyse below is the one generated by Community Resources Group employees who gathered specific data from colonia residents as part of the individual files created to verify that they were eligible to benefit from the titling scheme, and to create a paper trail about who owned what land, how much they had already paid and what papers they had to prove 'ownership'. Thus, households were asked: to document the types of papers that they had received originally from the vendor, and which established their claim of ownership; to state the price they had paid at that time; to provide the name of the previous owner(s), or more usually the developer, who\nb7cq | sold them the lot; to describe the state of the lot at the time of purchase and whether or not there was any house or construction already on the lot at the time; and to outline what, if any, problems they had encountered when making their payments. This generated an overall database of some one thousand seven hundred ninety records, with data stretching over some seventeen years from nineteen seventy-two to nineteen ninety-nine. However, although the information dates as far back as the earliest purchases in the nineteen seventies and includes records up to the late nineteen nineties, in fact most people bought lots during the nineteen eighties. The database includes information for all fifteen of the sub-divisions included in the Community Resources Group programme, from which data for the following variables were extracted: the sub-division name; the purchase date (year); the price paid; from whom it was bought; and, whether or not the lot was sold with or",
