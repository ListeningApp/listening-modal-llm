You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

gxfd | As mentioned before, cancer 3D models can be applied to various fields of research and development, such as the preclinical testing of metallodrugs. Next, we describe and discuss the importance of metallodrugs in cancer, as well as the application of cancer 3D models for the preclinical evaluation of these types of drugs.
s2v1 | 4. Metallodrugs in Cancer
jkp9 | Currently, there are several targeted therapies available to treat different types of cancer, for example, anti-hormonal treatments and monoclonal antibodies against cancer cell-specific receptors. Nevertheless, conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy remain the key tools for cancer treatment. Thus, there is an unmet need to develop innovative and improved pharmacological options for cancer therapy [130,131], but the design and development of effective anti-cancer drugs with high selectivity, minimal toxicity, and reduced side effects is still a challenging endeavor [132,133].
z8tt | Metal-based compounds have been used throughout history for their therapeutic properties [134]. Despite the widespread use of this type of compound, the absence of a clear demarcation between therapeutic and hazardous dosages posed a significant obstacle [135]. In the 1960s, the "accidental" discovery by Barnett Rosenberg of cisplatin (cis-[Pt(NH3)2Cl2]), a platinum (Pt) compound, paved the way for modern metal-based anti-cancer drugs [136,137]. Besides platinum, research regarding the application of other transition metals, such as ruthenium (Ru), gold (Au), silver (Ag), iron (Fe), copper (Cu), arsenic (As), and cobalt (Co), as anti-tumoral compounds have gained increasing interest among the scientific community, and a wide range of metal-based compounds has been developed [138-144].
9g22 | Transition metal complexes have been particularly explored for therapeutic applica- tions in cancer due to their distinctive properties such as redox activity, various coordination modes (allowing for the design of different metal complexes), d orbitals partially filled (al- lowing for electrons to be easily removed or added to these orbitals, making them suitable to act as catalysts or to develop compounds with multiple oxidation states), and reactivity towards organic substrates (allowing for the design of drugs that preferentially interact with a biomolecular target) [145]. Additionally, metals have the important characteristic of forming positively charged ions in an aqueous solution, which can bind to negatively charged biomolecules. Therefore, the compound 's charge can be modified according to the coordination environment, directing the drug to the desired biological target [134,146-148]. Furthermore, the metal itself, the ligand, and the metal-ligand interactions endow different characteristics to metal complexes, and thus metal-based anticancer agents can be generally classified as functional compounds, structural compounds, metal ions as carriers of active ligands, metal compounds that behave as catalysts, and photoactive metal compounds.
41fx | The chemical and anti-tumoral properties, as well as the potential mechanism of action of metallodrugs, have been extensively reviewed elsewhere, and the reader is referred to excellent publications for further information on this topic, which is out of the scope of the present review [149-153].
7um8 | Despite the intense research in the design and biological evaluation of novel anti-cancer metallodrugs with very promising results that, in some instances led to advancement to clinical trials (particularly for Pt and Ru-based compounds), very few have been approved for clinical use. Cisplatin was approved in 1978 for the treatment of advanced bladder, testicular, and ovarian cancers [154], followed by two other Pt-based drugs: carboplatin, which started to be used in clinical practice in 1989 for the treatment of initial ovarian cancer, and oxaliplatin, which was approved in 1996, in Europe, and 2003, in the USA, for advanced colorectal cancer [144,155]. Other than these, the only metallic non-Pt drug that was clinically approved in the 2000s for cancer therapy is arsenic trioxide (As2O3) [144].
uow2 | 5. Three-Dimensional Models as Tools to Test Metallodrugs
iat7 | When considering the preclinical testing scenario of different types of anticancer drugs such as organic and inorganic small molecules, antibodies, or biological-based drugs and metallodrugs, 3D cellular models present favorable characteristics that promote a more realistic evaluation of the antitumoral potential of these different classes of drugs, and potentially improve drug discovery and development. However, in the pharmaceutical in- dustry, drug portfolios are increasingly diversified with only 40-50% being small molecules, and there are now a broad diversity of chemistries and mechanisms of action or toxicity to consider [156]. Therefore, for 3D models to become widely implemented as new preclinical models, there is still the need for a demonstration that their performance is reliable across a suitably broad set of compounds, such as large molecules and biologic therapies in a robust and repeatable manner, and the definition of ways for companies to implement the technology within routine preclinical workflows [156].
ywwr | In the case of metallodrugs, despite the numerous advantages of 3D models described in the previous sections, the application of these platforms is still quite scarce. Conventional 2D and animal models appear to be the standard tools to test the biological response to metallodrugs. As mentioned previously, there is not an ideal model that is able to fully recapitulate in vivo tumor characteristics; therefore, 2D, 3D, and animal models should be incorporated into cancer research, each one allowing for evaluating different aspects of the therapeutic potential of a metallodrug.
0i6j | Particularly relevant for metallodrugs is the establishment of oxygen gradients within the 3D multicellular structure, as some complexes are redox active, and this feature allows for a more realistic evaluation of their predicted in vivo activity. Additionally, the availabil- ity of several analytical techniques suitable for the determination of the metal distribution and the metallodrug's active species is an experimental advantage in the applicability of 3D models for this type of anticancer drug. Nevertheless, there are some important practical challenges in the adaptability of cancer 3D models for metallodrug testing that need to be acknowledged. For instance, suspension cultures might not be the ideal model for high-throughput assays, while some of the materials used in microengineering-based and coating-dependent models may absorb hydrophobic compounds, a common feature in several classes of metallodrugs. Several other important hurdles still need to be overcome, such as a lack of harmonization of protocols and assays, limited access to biological materi- als in uncommon tumor types, and particularly the time-sensitiveness o tumoroids due to the number of passages between tissue collection and drug testing.
