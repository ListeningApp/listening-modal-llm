        "content": "v3r2 | is important to note that the ligands will likely be different from those coordinating zinc in the crystal structure. For example, several potential copper ligands, such as Met one hundred ninety-nine from pmoA, are in the vicinity. Binding and activation of O two occurs at mononuclear copper centers in the enzymes peptidylglycine alpha-hydroxylating monooxygenase (PHM), which hydroxylates the alpha atom of a terminal glycine residue, and dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBM), which converts dopamine to norepinephrine. In PHM, there are two noncoupled mononuclear copper centers, CuA and CuB, that are separated by eleven angstroms. Substrate and O two bind at the CuB site, which is coordinated by two histidines, a methionine, and a solvent molecule. Crystals of PHM soaked with substrate analogues under reducing conditions show electron density at the CuB site that is best modeled as O two. Surprisingly, O two binds with an end-on eta one geometry, with distances of two point one and two point eight angstroms from the copper ion to the two oxygen atoms. This crystallographic model is consistent with biochemical and computational data, suggesting that Cu two-superoxide is the reactive species, as well as with the recent characterization of an end-on eta one superoxo-Cu two complex that is able to hydroxylate and hydroperoxylate phenols.\nnv42 | Could a similar species be important in pMMO? One difference is that the C-H bond dissociation energy in methane is one hundred four kilocalories per mole as compared to eighty-seven kilocalories per mole for the PHM substrate. In addition, DFT calculations suggest that Cu two-superoxide cannot abstract a hydrogen atom from methane. On the basis of calculations using a model with two imidazoles and one acetate to mimic the pmoB monocopper center, Yoshizawa and Shiota propose a mechanism for methane hydroxylation involving a Cu three-oxo reactive species. According to their hypothesis, the initial reaction of Cu one with O two results in Cu two-superoxide, which is converted to Cu two-hydroperoxide by hydrogen atom transfer from a tyrosine residue in the active site. Abstraction of a hydrogen atom from a second tyrosine would then yield the Cu three-oxo species and a water molecule. The idea that tyrosine residues are involved derives from mechanistic proposals for PHM and DBM, which have actually been ruled out by mutagenesis data. Yoshizawa and Shiota invoke participation of specific tyrosine residues near the pmoB mononuclear copper center. Their proposal could be modified to apply to the zinc site because two conserved tyrosines, Tyr one hundred ninety-six from pmoA and Tyr one hundred seventy-eight from pmoC, are adjacent. At present, these ideas remain highly speculative.\nxags | O two Activation at a Dinuclear Copper Center. The case for the dicopper center as the active site is stronger than that for a monocopper center for several reasons. First, all of the ligands to this site are highly conserved. Second, the existence of the dicopper center is clear from both EXAFS and crystallographic data. In contrast, the pmoB monocopper center observed in the crystal structure may not be conserved, and the existence of a monocopper center at the crystallographic zinc site has not been established definitively. Third, a bis(mu-oxo)dicopper core in copper-loaded zeolites has been demonstrated to oxidize methane selectively. Fourth, there is ample\njc47 | Structure and Mechanism of pMMO Balasubramanian and Rosenzweig\nko3c | precedence for O two binding and activation at dinuclear copper centers. In tyrosinase and catechol oxidase, dicopper centers catalyze the hydroxylation of tyrosine and the conversion of catechols to quinones, respectively. The active sites in these enzymes differ from the pMMO dicopper center, in that the two copper ions are ligated by six rather than three histidines and the Cu-Cu distances are longer. In these enzymes, the active species is likely to be a side-on eta two two eta two peroxo dicopper two complex. The isoelectronic species in which the peroxo O-O bond is cleaved to yield a bis(mu-oxo)dicopper three complex has been characterized in model compounds, although not yet in biology. Interconversion between the bis (mu-oxo)dicopper three and eta two two eta two peroxo dicopper two cores has been observed for many synthetic systems and is the subject of several theoretical studies.\nxek3 | Could one of these moieties be involved in methane oxidation by pMMO? By analogy to the above enzymes and model complexes, O two could react with a dicopper one center in pMMO to yield either a eta two two eta two peroxo dicopper two or a bis(mu-oxo)dicopper three species. Injection of an electron might then generate the mixed valent bis(mu-oxo) Cu twoCu three complex, which has been suggested to be more reactive. Yoshizawa and Shiota have investigated this possibility by computational methods. Using a dicopper model ligated by three imidazoles and one acetate, their results suggest that the mixed valent species is more reactive than the bis(mu-oxo)dicopper three species and better suited to activation of the C-H bond in methane. Although the mixed valent species is similar in reactivity to the mononuclear Cu three-oxo complex, its formation is energetically more favorable. One important caveat to these results is that the assumed starting model may not represent the dinuclear copper center accurately. In particular, residue Glu thirty-five is modeled as a ligand, although its side-chain oxygen atoms are greater than four angstroms from the copper ions in the crystallographic model. In addition, the Cu-Cu distance of two point six five angstroms in reduced pMMO is significantly shorter than that the greater than four angstrom Cu-Cu distance observed in reduced catechol oxidase and tyrosinase.\nbbpr | Catalytic Mechanism. According to DFT calculations, methane oxidation by the mononuclear Cu three-oxo species discussed above begins with methane weakly bound to\n5zyf | the monocopper center followed by C-H bond cleavage, formation of a nonradical intermediate, and recombination of OH and CH three. A similar mechanism was computed for the bis (mu-oxo)Cu twoCu three complex. Chan and co-workers have investigated the pMMO mechanism using M. capsulatus (Bath) membrane preparations. Hydroxylation of both chiral ethane and chiral butane proceeds with the retention of the configuration. These data combined with hydrogen deuterium kinetic isotope effects are consistent with a concerted, nonradical mechanism. In other studies, the absence of a carbon kinetic isotope effect for propane oxidation was interpreted as evidence of minimal structural change at the carbon center during transition-state formation in the rate-limiting step.\n9own | Conclusions",
