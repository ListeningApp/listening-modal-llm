You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

8r5j | THE ART OF POWERFUL QUESTIONS Catalyzing Insight, Innovation, and Action
2taz | "If I had an hour to solve a problem and my life depended on the solution, I would spend the first 55 minutes determining the proper question to ask, for once I know the proper ques- tion, I could solve the problem in less than five minutes." -ALBERT EINSTEIN
o3ya | W hen was the last time you sat through a meeting and said to yourself, "This is a complete waste of time!"? Was it yesterday, or even just a few hours ago? Why did that gathering feel so tedious? Perhaps it's because the leaders posed the wrong questions at the start of the session. Or, worse yet, maybe they didn't ask any engaging questions, and as a result, the meeting consisted of boring reports-outs or other forms of one- way communication that failed to engage people's interest or curiosity.
r5il | The usefulness of the knowledge we acquire and the effectiveness of the actions we take depend on the quality of the questions we ask. Questions open the door to dialogue and discov- ery. They are an invitation to creativity and breakthrough thinking. Questions can lead to movement and action on key issues; by generating creative insights, they can ignite change.
5gui | "I WENT FOR THE JUGULAR QUESTION."
82qc | Consider the possibility that every- thing we know today about our world emerged because people were curious. They formulat- ed a question or series of questions about something that sparked their interest or deeply concerned them, which lead them to learn something new. Many Nobel laureates describe the "Eureka!" moment of their dis- covery as when the "right" question finally revealed itself-even if it took them considerable time to come up with the final answers. For example, Einstein's the- ory of relativity resulted from a question that he had wondered about when still a teenager: "What would the universe look like if I were riding on the end of a light beam at the speed of light?" Einstein regularly practiced this kind of "thought experiment," which,
ls7d | THE ART OF POWERFUL QUESTIONS
tzt3 | over time, led to significant advances in the field of physics. Many years later, an empirical demonstration showed that light from distant stars actually curved as it passed through the gravitational force of our sun. Einstein's graduate students rushed to him as he was walking through the Princeton campus and exclaimed, "Dr. Einstein, light really does bend!" Einstein looked at them quizzically and said, "Of course!" He had come to this conclusion through exploring the question in his own thought experi- ment years before.
t8vv | Another Nobel-prize winner, physicist Arno Penzias, when asked what accounted for his success, replied, "I went for the jugular question." Still practic- ing his questioning discipline today, Penzias recently commented at a Fast Company Conference, "Change starts with the individual. So the first thing I do each morning is ask myself, 'Why do I strongly believe what I believe?' Constantly examine your own assump- tions." It's this type of self-questioning that keeps creativity alive.
qvnu | In other key examples of the impor- tance of powerful questions, a query by James Watson and Francis Crick, "What might DNA look like in a 3D form?" led to the discovery of the double helix and for- ever altered the scientific landscape. During the Tylenol crisis in the early 1980s, considering the question, "What is the most ethical action we might take?" enabled Johnson & Johnson to restore consumer trust and become a leader in corporate responsibility. And asking, "Where can I get a good hamburger on the road?" motivated Ray Kroc to create McDonald's, the fast-food chain that became an international icon. Even for ordinary folks, asking a question as simple as, "What does all this mean?" or "What can we do that could help shift this situation?" or "What haven't we thought of that could make a difference?" can have a startling impact on creating new knowledge and insight.

xrd1 | Why Don't We Ask Better Questions?
5746 | If asking good questions is so critical, why don't most of us spend more of our time and energy on discover- ing and framing them? One reason may be that much of Western culture, and North American society in par- ticular, focuses on having the "right answer" rather than discovering the "right question." Our educational system focuses more on memorization and rote answers than on the art of seeking new possibilities. We are rarely asked to discover compelling questions, nor are we taught why we should ask such questions in the first place. Quizzes, examinations, and aptitude tests all reinforce the value of correct answers. Is it any wonder that most of us are uncomfortable with not knowing?
7toz | The aversion in our culture to asking creative questions is linked to an emphasis on finding quick fixes and an attachment to black/white, either/or thinking. In addition, the rapid pace of our lives and work doesn't often provide us with opportunities to participate in reflective conversations in which we can explore catalytic questions and innovative possi- bilities before reaching key decisions. These factors, coupled with a prevailing belief that "real work" con- sists primarily of detailed analysis, immediate deci- sions, and decisive action, contradict the perspective that effective "knowledge work" consists of asking profound questions and hosting wide-ranging strate- gic conversations on issues of substance.
j346 | The reward systems in our organizations further reinforce this dilemma. Leaders believe that they are being paid for fixing problems rather than for foster- ing breakthrough thinking. Between our deep attach- ment to the answer-any answer-and our anxiety about not knowing, we have inadvertently thwarted our collective capacity for deep creativity and fresh perspectives. Unfortunately, given the unprecedented challenges we face both in our own organizations and
v8uq | as a global community, we need these skills now more than ever.
x972 | Are there organizations that do place a high value on questions? Consider this: In Germany, the job title Direktor Grundsatzfragen translates as "Director of Fundamental Questions." As a German colleague said: "Yes, there's a job title of Direktor Grundsatz- fragen. Some of the larger German companies have an entire department of Grundsatz- fragen. These are the people who are always thinking about what the next questions will be. Of course, these people are only in the German companies headquartered in Germany, such as Daimler, Bayer, Siemens, or SAP. If the German company is acquired by a U.S. compa- ny, they usually eliminate the Grundsatzfragen positions."
cwrw | The German understanding and appreciation of Grundsatzfragen may stem from a culture that high- ly values philosophy and the ongoing questioning of priorities and the meaning of life. Even today, this focus is reflected in some unique aspects of high- school education. In the German Gymnasium, from the ages of 14 to 17, students are typically assigned to study groups with 30 of their peers. In the words of one graduate, "We work intensely together in every subject, and then in the second year, we meet Goethe (the famous 19th-century German philosopher), and we question our entire world for two years. We emerge with a greater appreciation for the power of questions and the power of conversation."
4i0e | As we enter an era in which systemic issues often lie at the root of critical challenges, in which diverse perspectives are required for sustainable solutions, and in which cause-and-effect relationships are not immediately apparent, the capacity to raise penetrat- ing questions that challenge current operating
h2l3 | THE ART OF POWERFUL QUESTIONS
dfzb | assumptions will be key to creating positive futures. As Einstein said, "The problems we have cannot be solved at the same level of thinking that created them." And in her book The Art of the Question, Marilee Goldberg adds, "A paradigm shift occurs when a question is asked inside the current paradigm that can only be answered from outside it." It's this kind of paradigm shift, based on powerful questions, that may be necessary to create truly innovative solutions to our most pressing concerns.
u6ty | What Makes a Question Powerful? In a wonderfully evocative description, Fran Peavey, a pioneer in the use of strategic ques- tions, observes:
awvu | "Questions can be like a lever you use to pry open the stuck lid on a paint can. . . . If we have a short lever, we can only just crack open the lid on the can. But if we have a longer lever, or a more dynamic question, we can open that can up much wider and really stir things up. . . . If the right question is applied, and it digs deep enough, then we can stir up all the creative solutions."
on9b | "A PARADIGM SHIFT OCCURS WHEN A QUESTION IS ASKED INSIDE THE CURRENT PARADIGM THAT CAN ONLY BE ANSWERED FROM OUTSIDE IT."
a8ge | MARILEE GOLDBERG, THE ART OF THE QUESTION
h27a | While you may not immediately know the characteristics of a powerful question, it's actually quite easy to recognize one. For instance, if you were an Olympic judge scoring the power of questions on a scale from one to ten (with ten being the highest), how would you rate the following queries?
pdjh | 1. What time is it?
xmgs | 2. Did you take a shower?
bd9h | 3. What possibilities exist that we haven't thought of yet?
m047 | 4. What does it mean to be ethical?
gy8c | We have tested questions such as these in several different cultures. In the process, we've discovered that, despite cultural differences, people quite consis- tently rate questions one and two as being less power- ful, and questions three and four as being more power- ful. Clearly, powerful questions are ones that transcend many boundaries.
y4mj | Not long ago, we hosted a conversation with a group of international colleagues about what makes
vpgq | THE ART OF POWERFUL QUESTIONS
ousl | a compelling question. Here are some of their reflections:
m4ju | Finn Voldtofte (Denmark): The question has to catch people where they are, to meet them where there is the most energy and relevance for them, and then use that energy to go deeper. Action will flow naturally from that energy.
a0mb | Felipe Herzenborn (Mexico): The question also needs to be simple and clear and penetrating. It's like a laser beam. A good question invites and chal- lenges you to reflect at a deeper level-to find the knowledge or wisdom that's already there beneath the surface.
ki8m | Verna Allee (U.S.): To me, the most energizing questions are those that involve people's values, hopes, and ideals-questions that relate to something that's larger than them, where they can connect and con- tribute. People don't have a lot of energy around questions that are only about removing pain.
km8w | David Isaacs (U.S.): Even though it's useful to acknowledge pain, I think it's also important to shift the ques- tion away from a problem focus or fix-it focus to a possibility focus. There's always a subtle feeling of dis- empowerment in a problem, a feeling that all the doors are shut. "We've got a problem ... oh no! Not another problem!"There's a weariness and stuckness about it. Simply asking, "What's the possibility we see in this situation?" can make a big difference.
wzno | Toke Moller (Denmark): Here's an example of that approach. I was working with a local school to frame a possibility-oriented question. We asked teachers, students, parents, and administrators, "What could a good school also be?" This way of posing the question helped people to see their school in a different light. It resulted in some amaz- ing new ideas. I'm quite sure they would not have been as innovative if the question had focused only on fixing problems.
xagm | Carlos Mota (Mexico): It's a real art to find as well as to shape the right question for your situation. Once a friend told me about a time she was being inter- viewed. The interviewer said, "We're just going to ask you one question: What's the question we
iwn5 | should be asking?" Sometimes the most important thing to do is to help the people themselves shape the questions in the most powerful way, since they know their own situation the best of anyone.
uooz | Thus, a powerful question:
pxbq | · generates curiosity in the listener
jfsr | • stimulates reflective conversation
u15r | · is thought-provoking
lq35 | · surfaces underlying assumptions
3g9w | · invites creativity and new possibilities
d09o | · generates energy and forward movement
ylhz | · channels attention and focuses inquiry
a3td | · stays with participants
ex5k | · touches a deep meaning
9d4o | · evokes more questions
cjq2 | A powerful question also has the capacity to "trav- el well"-to spread beyond the place where it began into larger networks of conversation throughout an organization or a community. Questions that travel well are often the key to large-scale change. As we'll explore below, how such queries are crafted can make a differ- ence in their capacity to move a system toward innova- tive futures.
5esx | The Architecture of Powerful Questions
m5ka | As shown at the start of this volume, powerful ques- tions can dramatically improve the quality of insight, innovation, and action in our organizations, in our communities, and in our lives. Therefore, understand- ing the basic architecture of formulating powerful questions is a key skill in today's knowledge economy. There are three dimensions to powerful questions: construction, scope, and assumptions. Each con- tributes to the quality of learning and knowledge cre- ation that emerges as we engage with others in a gen- erative inquiry.
byu8 | THE FIRST DIMENSION: The Construction of a Question
76b0 | The linguistic construction of a question can make a critical difference in either opening our minds or nar-
zxz6 | rowing the possibilities we can consider. Is it a yes/no question? Is it an either/or question? Does it begin with an interrogative, such as Who, What, or How?
xnth | WHO WHAT
vafm | WHEN WHERE WHICH
2zmw | WHY HOW?
bf9k | Just for fun, try placing these words in a pyramid of lower to higher power. Don't think too much; use your intuition.
otkr | When asked, most people rank these words from more powerful to less powerful as follows:
ibgs | By using the words toward the top of the pyra- mid, we can make many of our questions more robust. For example, consider the following sequence:
colo | · Are you satisfied with our working relationship?
d6r4 | · When have you been most satisfied with our working relationship?
9mrz | . What is it about our working relationship that you find most satisfying?
pk06 | . Why might it be that that our working relationship has had its ups and downs?
7wn9 | As you move from the simple "yes/no" question at the beginning toward the "why" question at the end, you'll notice that the queries tend to stimulate more reflective thinking and a deeper level of conversation.
wcd0 | THE ART OF POWERFUL QUESTIONS
caos | That's what we mean by a powerful question-one that provokes thoughtful exploration and evokes cre- ative thinking.
qrvy | However, a note of caution: Unless a "why" ques- tion is carefully crafted, it can easily evoke a defensive response, as people try to justify their answer rather than proceed in a spirit of inquiry. For instance, the questions, "Why can't you ever tell me exactly what you are thinking?" or "Why did you do it that way?" can cause someone to defend a given position or rationalize some past decision, rather than open new possibilities. In contrast, when a "why" question stems from genuine curiosity, such as "I wonder why that happened?" then the inquiry has the potential to cre- ate useful insights.
