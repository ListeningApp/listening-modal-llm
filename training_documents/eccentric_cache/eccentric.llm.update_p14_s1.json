        "content": "2285 | numerical investigation of Richards and Uang, subsequent experimental studies by Okazaki and his colleagues on wide-flange links constructed from A nine ninety-two steel confirmed that the above relaxation can be safely applied to short links. However, Okazaki et al. observed strength degradation due to flange buckling in some of the intermediate link specimens. Taking into account previous studies, it was permitted as per AISC three forty-one zero five to use moderately ductile flanges for I-shaped links with the slenderness limit of zero point three eight times the square root of E over F sub y only in short links where rho is less than one point six. It should be noted that in the numerical study of Richards and Uang and also the recent tests of Okazaki and his colleagues, no axial force was imposed on the links. Nevertheless, the above relaxation in the flange slenderness requirements includes all shear yielding links regardless of the level of axial force.\nys0g | Based on the results obtained from an exhaustive numerical parametric study containing more than two hundred analyses as well as a subsequent experimental study, Berman and Bruneau concluded that the flange slenderness of built-up box links should be limited to zero point six four times the square root of E over F sub y. Until two thousand five, this limit was the seismically compact limit for walls of rectangular H S S members as per AISC three forty-one. However, in two thousand ten the more stringent limit of zero point five five times the square root of E over F sub y was adopted by AISC three forty-one ten for flanges of highly ductile built-up box sections, which is the case for tubular links.\n7zvp | In general, compact webs are used in links to prevent or delay the deteriorative effect of web buckling. Berman and Bruneau suggested that the web slenderness for built-up box shear links should be limited to one point six seven times the square root of E over F sub y. However, this limit was reduced to zero point six four times the square root of E over F sub y for intermediate and long built-up box links in which local buckling of both webs and flanges can cause strength degradation.\nww6u | Three point two. Web Stiffeners\nhpi6 | The proper use of end and intermediate web stiffeners in links is a major parameter for achieving stable and controlled hysteresis behavior. End stiffeners are usually full-depth stiffeners provided for all link length ratios located on both sides of the web at link ends. In nineteen seventy-seven, Roeder and Popov provided the rationale for the necessity of using end stiffeners to ensure local stability at a brace-link-\n4uhb | beam connection panel. In the previous and current E B F specifications, the use of end stiffeners has always been mandatory with an aim of improving the link shear force transfer to reacting elements as well as preventing premature local buckling in links.\nepyi | In the early experiments by Popov and his colleagues it was observed that in short links tearing of web and severe strength degradation usually occurred shortly after web buckling. Although in some tests a considerable amount of energy was also dissipated by the link in the post-buckling phase, since post-buckling behavior and its subsequent failure are difficult to predict and more hazardous, web buckling is generally considered as the design ultimate state for short links. Popov and his colleagues demonstrated that providing intermediate stiffeners could substantially improve the strength and energy dissipation capacity of links. In nineteen eighty-three, Hjelmstad and Popov proposed the first relation for determining the required intermediate stiffener spacing based on the expected energy dissipation of a link. However, later tests by Kasai and Popov demonstrated that such a relation does not exist and instead, the required intermediate stiffener spacing is dependent upon the expected ultimate link rotation, Yu. In nineteen eighty-six, Kasai and Popov proposed a conservative spacing formula for intermediate stiffeners using a cyclic plastic theory and the experimental data obtained from tests on short links constructed from A thirty-six steel. The stiffener spacing was expressed as a function of the depth of the I-shaped link and its web thickness for three different ultimate rotations. The maximum spacing allowed for the intermediate stiffeners of short links per AISC three forty-one ten is based on this proposal with slight modifications. It is worth noting that a number of recent studies have mentioned that the shear link stiffener spacing requirements of the AISC Seismic Provisions are somewhat conservative and might be relaxed if justified by further experimental research.\ny51p | Malley and Popov investigated the required area and moment of inertia of link intermediate stiffeners using Basler's theory for plate girders and the approach adopted by Bleich. The requirements proposed by Malley and Popov were not included in AISC three forty-one, and instead, the regular requirements of plate girder web stiffeners were recommended for determining the required moment of inertia of link stiffeners with the addition of a minimum thickness limit. Bruneau et al. further discussed this issue and mentioned that the previous reasonable performances of\nx95m | E B F s designed as per AISC three forty-one indicate that the recommendations of Malley and Popov were based on overly conservative assumptions.\nyfum | Intermediate stiffeners are also required in links with flexure-dominant behavior. The comprehensive experimental study by Engelhardt and Popov on long links revealed that, unlike shear links, local buckling of flanges will not necessarily cause strength degradation in stiffened long links. It was concluded that placing stiffeners at a distance of one point five b f from each end of the link, while not preventing flange buckling, would limit the strength loss due to flange buckling. The large scale pseudo-dynamic tests by Tsai et al. indicated that such stiffeners may still be beneficial if substantial axial force is also available in the link. Engelhardt and Popov also mentioned the beneficial effect of placing stiffeners outside the link region, in the brace-link-beam connection panel. Furthermore, it was concluded that intermediate links, which will experience both shear and flexural yielding, should have intermediate stiffeners at one point five b f from the link ends, and also equally spaced additional stiffeners through the link length based on the requirements of short links. These recommendations have generally been adopted by AISC three forty-one ten. However, the provisions require no intermediate stiffeners when the link length ratio (p) is larger than five point zero.",
