A discrete-time stochastic process X(Zero : N) has the Markov property if its pdfs satisfy\nfavz | f X(n:N)|x(Zero:n-1)(X(n: N)) = f X(n:N)|x(n-1)(X(n:N)), n equals One, and so on, N, for all X(n : N). A discrete-time stochastic process that has the Markov property is called a Markov chain.\n7szx | Intuitively, the Markov property says that, to predict future observations X(n : N) of the stochastic process, it is sufficient to know the immediate past X(n-1). Additional knowledge of the more distant past X(Zero : n-2) does not change the predictions of the future. An induction argument shows that the joint distribution of X(Zero : n) can then be written as a product of conditional distributions,\nhx9e | f X(Zero:n)(X(Zero: n) = f X(Zero)(X(Zero))] [f X()|X(j-1)(X(j)), n equals one, two, and so on j equals one n\nywn2 | The functions f X(i)|X(j-1)(X(j)) are called transition probabilities of the Markov chain. We shall also assume throughout that\na63r | f X(one:n)x(:)(y(one : n) equals f X()|X(j)(y(j), n equals one, two, and so on j equals one n\ndqvj | This identity implies that, given the sequence of process variables X(Zero : n), the observations Y(one : n) are independent of one another and their distributions do not depend on X(Zero). In particular, it follows that given X(i), the observation Y(i) is independent of all other observations Y(j) (j does not equal i).\nr17u | We can now formulate a basic algorithm for filtering and forecasting of Markov chains.\n3c47 | Algorithm Twenty point one (Filtering and prediction). Given\ng345 | (i) a prior distribution f X(Zero)\nsvhz | (ii) transition probabilities f X(i)X(i-1) (i equals one, and so on N) for the process variables, and\noaen | (iii) conditional distributions f y(i)|X(i) (i equals one, and so on N) for the observations, the following algorithm gives the filtering distributions f X(i)y(one:i) and forecasting distributions f X(one)y(one:one-1):\n5u67 | Step one. Set\ndvms | f X(one)y(one)(X(one)) x f X(one)|X(one)(y(one))f X(one)(X(one)),\nqrd3 | f X(one)(X(one) equals f X(one)X()(X(one)f X()(X(Zero)dX(Zero),\nrxrg | where the proportionality constant is chosen such that a pdf with respect to X(one) is generated.\ntf43 | \nfcco | Twenty point five. Kalman Filtering\n8uji | Step Two. Suppose i belongs to the set two , three , and so on N and the filtering pdf of X at i minus one given y from one to i minus one is given. Set\ndf3e | f of X at i given y from one to i minus one of x at i is equal to the integral of f of X at i given x at i minus one of x at i times f of X at i minus one given y from one to i minus one of x at i minus one d x at i minus one , f of X at i given y from one to i of x at i is proportional to f of Y at i given x at i of y at i times f of X at i given y from one to i minus one of x at i , where the proportionality constant is chosen such that a pdf with respect to x at i is generated.\n53eu | The correctness of this algorithm can be proved with induction. Step one is just the law of total probability to obtain f of X at one and Bayes' rule to obtain f of X at one given y at one . For the induction step, the formula for the forecasting distribution is again just the law of total probability, and the filtering distribution can be obtained from",
