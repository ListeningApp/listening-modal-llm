You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

zdrh | the enrichment factor (EF). The reconstructed composition (RC) of the altered sample was calculated for each element by multiplying its concentration in the altered sample (nor- malized to 100% volatile free) by the EF. Finally, the mass change for each element in the sample was calculated by sub- tracting the precursor concentration of that element in the least altered sample from the RC. The largest mass changes are associated with moderate to intense alteration, generally increasing with depth (App. Figs. A26, A27). Mass changes for each assemblage are outlined below (Fig. 17; Table 5):

94ul | Mass dilution effects caused by anhydrite and pyrite precip- itation were partially mitigated through handpicking of indi- vidual altered clasts, avoiding veins and cement/infill. Despite this procedure, not all of these materials could be omitted, thus contributing CaO, Fe2O3, and S and accounting for some apparent loss of SiO2. The main difference between the low- temperature alteration stage (dominated by illite/smectite + pyrite) and the higher-temperature alteration stage (domi- nated by chamosite + corrensite) is the mass change of MgO (higher in chamosite) and K2O (higher in illite/smectite), typi- cal of VMS-style alteration in permeable volcaniclastic rocks (e.g., Shikazono et al., 1995; Franklin et al., 2005).
0vdu | Conditions of Alteration and Mineralization
a230 | The high permeability of the volcanic substrate at Tinakula has had a large impact on the composition, size, and morphology
dvoe | of the seafloor mineralization and subseafloor alteration. The conditions of alteration and mineralization have been con- strained in this study by fluid inclusion microthermometry, stable isotope data, and dating of the hydrothermal barite.
677t | Fluid inclusion microthermometry
5hk6 | Fluid inclusions were investigated in five samples of hydro- thermally altered volcaniclastic rocks recovered in drill hole TKAD001 between 14.8 and 19.3 m b.s.f. Details of the petrography and microthermometry are provided in Appen- dix Table A4. Fluid inclusions occur in three distinct para- genetic stages: early anhydrite in veins and rimming altered volcanic clasts, sphalerite at the margins of the early anhydrite veins in the deepest samples (MA13-090 and P005), and later infills of anhydrite and barite.
viei | Primary and secondary inclusions in large (up to 1.4 mm), tabular anhydrite crystals are generally 10 to 20 um, reach- ing maximum diameters of 60 um (Fig. 18A). All inclusions
rk0j | are liquid dominated with 1 to 10 vol % vapor (Fig. 18B).

g5at | Large crystals of barite (up to 1 mm), after anhydrite, con- tain mostly secondary inclusions, between 4 and 40 um in size and with a maximum of 10 vol % vapor (Fig. 18C). The inclusions in sphalerite (after anhydrite) include both pri-
re3j | mary liquid-vapor inclusions up to 50 um in diameter with
6z45 | 5 to 30 vol % vapor (Fig. 18E) and groups of smaller sec-
20af | ondary inclusions (<10 um) distributed along healed cracks (Fig. 18F). Two inclusions in sphalerite contained a dark solid

6t1g | heating (e.g., Ulrich and Bodnar, 1988), so these homogeniza-
