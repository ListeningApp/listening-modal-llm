The appointment of the Chairman of Convocation to chair the Special Committee constituted by the Board of Convocation is problematic since the Special Committee was expected to submit its report to him.\nfyp8 | iii. The composition of the Special Committee is unconventional because all the members of the Special Committee are members of the Board of Convocation.\nz994 | iv. The report submitted to the Board of Convocation by the Special Committee without explicit terms of reference is unacceptable.\nvvqn | V. The report submitted by the Special Committee, which was not signed by the members, is an anomaly because it raises questions about the authenticity of the report.\np6xg | vi.
