You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

ti7f | Radical Clock Substrate Probes and Kinetic Isotope Effect Studies of the Hydroxylation of Hydrocarbons by Methane Monooxygenase
oksu | Abstract: Four mechanistic probes, trans-2-phenylmethylcyclopropane (1), 2,2-diphenylmethylcyclopropane (2), trans-1,2- dimethylcyclopropane (3), and bicyclo[2.1.0]pentane (4), were used as substrates to investigate the possible formation of radical intermediates in the catalytic cycle of the methane monooxygenase (MMO) system from Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath) in reactions conducted at 45 ℃. Hydroxylation of 1 gave two products in equal amounts, the alcohol trans-(2-phenyl- cyclopropyl)methanol (1a) and the phenol trans-2-(p-hydroxyphenyl)methylcyclopropane (1c). The two different products are attributed to discrimination by the enzyme of the two enantiomers of probe 1, one of which leads to hydroxylation of the aromatic ring and the other to formation of the primary alcohol. The absence of ring-opened product, 1-phenylbut-3-en-1-ol (1b), is noteworthy and suggests that the hydroxylation reaction may not proceed through formation of the cyclopropylcarbinyl radical or cation. The former species rearranges to the 3-butenyl radical with a rate constant of <LATEX>4 \times 1 0 ^ { 1 1 } s ^ { - 1 } \text { at } 4 5 ^ { \circ } C ,</LATEX> which would require a rebound rate constant for MMO from M. capsulatus (Bath) in excess of <LATEX>1 0 ^ { 1 3 } s ^ { - 1 } .</LATEX> The possibility of a stereoelectronic barrier to ring opening in the active site of the enzyme is addressed through a semiquantitative analysis of the rate constant with Marcus theory. Studies with the other radical clock probes support the notion that a significant component of the hydroxylation reaction pathway does not proceed through a radical intermediate. Compound 2, the cyclopropylcarbinyl radical of which has a ring-opening rate constant of <LATEX>5 \times 1 0 ^ { 1 1 } s ^ { - 1 } ,</LATEX> yields exclusively (2,2-diphenylcyclopropyl)methanol (2a); <LATEX>3 \left( k = 4 . 4 \times 1 0 ^ { 8 } s ^ { - 1 } \right)</LATEX> affords only trans-(2-methylcyclopropyl)methanol (3a); and <LATEX>4 \left( k = 3 \times 1 0 ^ { 9 } s ^ { - 1 } \right.</LATEX> gives mainly a mixture of endo- and exo-2-hydroxybicyclo[2.1.0]pentane (4a and 4b). Kinetic isotope effect experiments were also carried out with derivatives of 1, mono-, di-, and trideuterated at the methyl position. No intermolecular isotope effect, assessed by comparing the rate of conversion of the undeuterated and trideuterated probes, was observed, a result consistent with C-H bond breaking not being involved in the rate-determining step of the enzymatic reaction. Intramolecular kinetic isotope effects of <LATEX>k _ { H } / k _ { D }</LATEX> = 5.15 and 5.03 were obtained from studies of the mono- and dideuterated probes, respectively, which indicates that the hydroxylation reaction involves a substantial C-H bond stretching component. The MMO hydroxylase from Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b gave both unrearranged and a small amount (3-5%) of rearranged products with 1, the ratio of which corresponds to a rebound rate constant of <LATEX>6 - 9 \times 1 0 ^ { 1 2 } s ^ { - 1 } \text { at } 3 0 ^ { \circ } C .</LATEX> These results are discussed in terms of several possible detailed mechanisms for the MMO hydroxylase reaction.
wtow | Introduction
o22k | Methane monooxygenase (MMO) is a protein system employed by methanotrophic bacteria to oxidize methane to methanol, a process that provides these organisms with their sole source of carbon and energy (eq 1).1 The soluble MMOs from Methy-

nvfy | lococcus capsulatus (Bath)2 and Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b,3 two of the better studied systems, comprise three proteins. Included are a hydroxylase enzyme that binds substrate and dioxygen, a reductase that contains Fe2S2 and FAD moieties and accepts electrons from NADH, and a coupling protein that reg- ulates electron transfer between the reductase and the hydroxylase4 and also modulates the substrate specificity5,6 and redox potentials7 of the latter. Recently, much attention has been focused on the hydroxylase enzyme, which is capable of hydroxylating a wide variety of substrates, in addition to methane.8,9 EXAFS, EPR, Mössbauer, ENDOR, and other physical studies have shown that the active site in this enzyme contains a dinuclear non-heme iron center in which the metals are probably each coordinated to a histidine and several carboxylate ligands and linked to one another by a monodentate oxygen atom, either from water, hydroxide, or monodentate carboxylate, as well as by a bidentate carboxylate bridge.10-12 The center resembles that in the crystallographically characterized R2 protein of ribonucleotide reductase.13

zlxc | The catalytic mechanism of the MMO hydroxylase has fre- quently been compared to that of its widely studied heme analogue, cytochrome P-450.8,14-16 In P-450-catalyzed hydroxylations, it is postulated that a high-valent iron oxo, or ferryl, moiety is generated which abstracts a hydrogen atom from the substrate
k0bw | Especially important in establishing the presence of radical in- termediates in this mechanism were studies with substrate probes that, following hydrogen atom abstraction to form a radical, isomerize to form, ultimately, a rearranged alcohol product.21-23 This process is illustrated for a specific probe, trans-2-phenyl- methylcyclopropane (1), in Scheme I. Attempts to employ this methodology in studies of the hydroxylation of 1,1-dimethyl- cyclopropane with the MMO hydroxylase from M. trichosporium OB3b were consistent with radical formation, although cationic intermediates were also invoked.14 Other experimental evidence for the involvement of radical intermediates in the hydroxylation chemistry of MMO from the same organism has been report- ed.8.15,24
