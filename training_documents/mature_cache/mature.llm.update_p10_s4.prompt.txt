You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

ppx4 | Don then goes on to give an account for the non-immature 'act'. The account is a scripted formulation that plays on motives. The initial 'just act like that' (line 17) and the 'we wanna have fun' (line 18) are constructed in the iterative present tense, suggesting a regular action and motive pattern (see Edwards, 1995). The repeated use of 'just' works to downplay the seriousness of the scripted action and motives, and the 'that's just the way we are' (line 18) is a dispositional account for their motives and actions. The claim is that they have been misunderstood by the moderator and that they are not really complicit with immaturity here, although it may look that way from an outsider's perspective. By privileging an interior realm of motives and playing it against an exterior world of particulars (something speakers routinely do in talk), Don is able to claim misinterpretation, which allows him to counter the dispositional inference that they are immature by scripting the event as 'just having fun' and their disposition as 'just the way we are', thus inoculating themselves from appearing literally or seriously preoccupied with girls' physical appearances. He is also able to position the moderator as a member of the 'naïve adult category', uninformed about what is really going on. Maturity is accomplished in the subtle and shifting discursive space where empirical particulars, motives, and dispositions are played off one another.
qf11 | In the following excerpt, the boys position themselves as being motivated in their voyeuristic interest for seeing girls in bathrooms and locker rooms, and thus not responsible or immature. In order to manage the moderator's challenges, they work up a dispositional and scripted account of the girls' motives as having causal force. Although maturity is not explicitly mentioned, the boys defend against the charge that they are habitually 'invading' the girls' privacy, which is hearable as a general index of immaturity.

tfra | In this excerpt, the boys are positioned as potentially immature because of the way they describe the 'coolness' (line 6) of walking into girls' changing areas. There are four soft challenges by the moderator that construct the boys as potentially immature. The first two (lines 4 and 7) are minimized by being constructed as misplaced concerns ('they didn't see us'), by playing dumb ('I thought it was co-ed'), or by claiming an emergency ('I had to pee'). These forms of mitigation are fairly common in our data as flippant excuse-making strategies. The third challenge of the moderator comes in line 12. It is hearable as a more general concern, as indexed with the dramatic 'so wait' preface, followed by a general request ('let's think about that') and the generalized action sequence of 'that guys are walking into girls' ' locker rooms or bathrooms. Unlike the first two, this challenge is a generalized challenge that scripts the boys' actions as potentially reoccurring or habitual, which can be heard as dispositional immaturity. As such, managing this kind of challenge requires special work. It makes relevant a rejoinder where motives are central.
5lm9 | Interestingly, Wilson and Ernie's reply is a scripted account of the girls' behaviour. They draw up a generalized account of what the girls are doing by using the following devices: the iterative present tense ('be always trying', 'be doing', 'be like'), event pluralization with extreme case formulations ('AL :: WAYS trying to model'), and manner expressions ('they'd be like OHH lemme see'). The account works to secure that the phenomena of concern (the boys' voyeuristic activity and interest - and by extension, their immaturity) are habitually 'in the object', rather than being caused by the boys, who can be held accountable. It is the girls who regularly motivate them to be interested in seeing the girls' bodies, because it is the girls who model for them. In addition, Ernie seems to create a bit of symmetry between the sexes by noting that 'girls do the very same thing' (line 14), even going so far as to impersonate a girl gawking over seeing a guy's 'package' (line 15). The moderator's final challenge takes issue with such a symmetrical characterization of girls ('not girls' - line 16), which makes relevant Wilson's rather robust statement that girls 'are just as perverted as guys', and to think they are not is a 'misconception' (lines 17-18). Again, this positions the moderator as 'misunderstanding', and it positions girls as having actual motives which contradict their supposed 'politeness'. This places girls' motives on a symmetrical footing with boys' motives. By doing this, the boys are able to characterize their motives as normative, and not deviant or immature in any kind of unique way.
wp2c | Denials with built-in concessions
us5v | Another way the boys maintain a position of 'maturity' while not appearing overly preoccupied in their attraction to girls' looks is to craft denials with built-in concessions. This type of denial often comes in three parts (see Antaki & Wetherell, 1999; Couper-Kuhlen & Thompson, in press; Speer & Potter, 2000). The concession often follows an initial proposition in order to soften and repair the original overstated claim and is then followed by a revised, weaker statement than the original proposition. The structure is as follows:
rs2m | (1) Initial proposition (hearable as extreme)
uz9y | (2) Concession (positions the original proposition as disputable)
8ov0 | (3) Revised, weaker statement (hearable now as more reasoned)
