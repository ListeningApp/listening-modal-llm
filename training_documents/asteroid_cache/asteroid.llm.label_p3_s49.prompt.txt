You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

The detailed analytical protocols and calibration methods are given in Takahata et al. (2008) and Koike et al. (2014). A 2-nA <LATEX>\mathrm { O } ^ { - }</LATEX> beam was focused with a spot size of approximately 10 um. To obtain the 238U_206Pb age, secondary ions of 31 p+, 43 Ca+, 204Pb+, 206Pb+, <LATEX>2 3 8 U ^ { 1 6 } O ^ { + } ,</LATEX> and <LATEX>{ } ^ { 2 3 8 } U ^ { 1 6 } O _ { 2 } ^ { + }</LATEX> were simultaneously collected for 600 s per spot using the NanoSIMS multi-collectors. Then, in the magnetic peak jump- ing mode, the secondary ions of <LATEX>2 0 4 P b + ,</LATEX> <LATEX>2 0 6 p b ^ { + } ,</LATEX> <LATEX>2 0 7 P b +</LATEX> measured at the same spot for ~1 h to determine <LATEX>{ } ^ { 2 0 7 } P b - { } ^ { 2 0 6 } P b</LATEX> age. A natural apatite standard from Canada (called "PRAP" in Sano et al., 1999) was used to calibrate the measured 238 U/206 Pb ratios in the <LATEX>2 0 6 p _ { D } + p ^ { 2 3 8 } U ^ { 1 6 } O ^ { + } - 2 ^ { 2 3 8 } U ^ { 1 6 } O _ { 2 } ^ { + } / ^ { 2 3 8 } U ^ { 1 6 } O ^ { + }</LATEX> diagram. The <LATEX>2 3 8 \quad U J \_ 2 0 6 P b</LATEX> and <LATEX>2 0 7 \quad P b \_ 2 0 6 P b</LATEX> isochron ages were calculated using Isoplot software (Ludwig, 2012). The isochron ages were calculated for the individual meteorites, assuming that all phosphates in one meteorite (except for Juvinas, discussed later) recorded the same history. The model <LATEX>2 0 7 p b ^ { * } / 2 0 6 p b ^ { * }</LATEX> ages were calculated for the in- dividual data, which provide in-situ thermal histories for individual analyzed areas. We assumed an initial 207/206/204 Pb composition (same to the Canyon Diablo troilite) and a specific <LATEX>2 3 8 U ^ { 2 3 5 } U</LATEX> ratio for the model <LATEX>2 0 7 p b * / 2 0 6 p b ^ { * }</LATEX> calculations, which does not affect our results and discussion. For details concerning the age calculations, see the supplementary information.

lq35 | 4.1. U-Pb chronology of phosphates in the brecciated eucrites
3g9w | In Juvinas, several anhedral grains of F-rich apatite and mer- rillite were found in both lithic clasts and around the fine-
d09o | grained high-porosity matrix (Fig. 1). The matrix contains nu- merous opaque minerals with size variations from submicron to ~10 um. A large elongated silica grain composed of quartz and tridymite, with a size of 100 um (wide) x ~3 mm (long), ap- pears abruptly between the coarse-grained lithic clasts and the fine-grained porous matrix (for details concerning the silica min- erals, see the supplementary information). These silica polymorphs provide additional information about thermal and metamorphic histories (Liao et al., 2019). All phosphates in the matrix areas are located adjacent to the quartz-tridymite grain. The apatite in the coarse-grained lithic areas (Fig. 1a) does not exhibit such a relationship. Three apatite grains, two from the from the lithic clast, with four spot data, define <LATEX>\begin{array}{} { \text { natrix and one } } \\ { 2 0 7 p h - 2 0 6 p t } \end{array}</LATEX> isochron age of <LATEX>4 5 5 2 \pm 8 5 M a</LATEX> (mean square weighted devia- tion <LATEX>\left( \mathrm { M S W D } \right) = 0 . 4 8 .</LATEX> Hereafter, the age uncertainties are at the 95% confidence level. The model <LATEX>2 0 7 p b ^ { * } / 2 0 6 p b ^ { * }</LATEX> ages were calcu- lated to be ~4630-4485 Ma, with a weighted mean of 4516.9 ± 10.4 Ma (Fig. 4).

The large MSWD value of 5.0 means that the isotopic data are highly scattered. The model <LATEX>{ } ^ { 2 0 7 } \mathrm { P b } ^ { * } / { } ^ { 2 0 6 } \mathrm { P b } ^ { * }</LATEX> ages vary between ~4570 Ma and 4370 Ma. Their weighted mean value was calculated at <LATEX>4 4 9 1 . 4 \pm 1 3 . 5 M a</LATEX> (Fig. 4), except for the youngest outlier, which had an age of 4372 +26/-27 Ma (Cmd-4). There is no apparent correlation between the textural/chemical properties of the individual apatite grains and their 207 Pb* /206 Pb* ages.
5esx | Stannern also contains several F-rich apatite and merrillite grains in igneous lithic clasts and in the granulitic recrystallized matrix (Fig. 3). Apatite grains in the granulitic areas appear as an intergrowth with ilmenite, plagioclase, and silica-rich mesostasis (Fig. 3). Numerous fractures intersect both the granulitic areas and the surrounding igneous clasts. The apatite and merrillite grains in the igneous clasts are anhedral and highly fractured and are ad- jacent to equilibrated pyroxene, plagioclase, and isolated ilmenite (Fig. 3). The six apatite grains and one merrillite grain yielded isochron age of <LATEX>3 9 7 5 \pm 1 1 0</LATEX> Ma (MSWD = <LATEX>\left. 0 . 2 7 \right) \text { and } a ^ { 2 0 7 } p b - 2</LATEX> isochron age of <LATEX>4 1 3 4 \pm 4 7 M a</LATEX> <LATEX>\left( \mathrm { M S W D } = \right.</LATEX> 5.3). The high MSWD value indicates that the U-Pb system in the Stannern phosphates has been disturbed. The model <LATEX>2 0 7 p b ^ { * } / 2 0 6 p b ^ { * }</LATEX> ages vary from ~4,270 Ma to 4,080 Ma. Their weighted mean value is <LATEX>4 1 4 3 . 0 \pm 1 2 . 5 \mathrm { M a }</LATEX> (Fig. 4), except for the oldest outlier (Stn-5; 4202

The horizontal lines represent the weighted mean values of the in- dividual meteorites. The two outliers, Cmd-4 (207 Pb*/206Pb* age at 4372 +26/-27 Ma) and Stn-5 (207 Pb*/206Pb* age at 4202 +24/-25 Ma), were excluded from the weighted mean calculations.
