You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

8s7w | Because board approval is necessary for VC exits, VCs negotiate aggressively for board seats when investing in startups.39 While data on board composition in private, VC-backed firms are scarce, two persistent patterns emerge from various small-scale studies of VC contracting documents and VC-backed firms. First, VC board representation tends to increase with new financing rounds, especially outside rounds that bring in new VCs.40 Second, in a plurality of firms, neither common shareholders nor VC-appointed directors ever achieve outright control; the swing vote remains in the hands of an independent director.41 Keeping the swing vote in the hands of an independent director makes it more difficult for either the common shareholders or the preferred shareholders to act opportunistically with respect to the other class of shareholders.42 But as one of us has argued in
kyrg | CARROTS AND STICKS
n4zo | other work, these studies (and the outwardly neutral appearance of independent directors) may understate the extent of de facto VC control over startup boards.43
9l9c | 2. Shareholder Rights
hef7 | As noted above, for VCs seeking an exit transaction, board approval is not sufficient. Shareholder approval is also necessary.
8zhn | As a matter of corporate law, some shareholder approval is always required. The nature of that approval will depend on the corporate law of the state in which the firm is domiciled as well as the firm's charter and other organizational documents. In some states, such as Delaware, the default arrangement is that a majority of preferred and common shares (voting together) must approve exit transactions.44 But alternative arrangements, including provisions giving particular series of preferred stock veto rights, are common.45 In other states, including California, a majority of each class of shares (including common stock) must approve exit transactions. 46
bodo | As a matter of business practice, the buyer in a trade sale may also insist on shareholder approvals not required by corporate law or the firm's organizational documents. For example, a buyer might be concerned about appraisal rights. Under corporate law, dissenting shareholders in a merger (those voting against the transaction) can exercise appraisal rights and have a court determine the "fair value" of their shares; the buyer is then forced to pay fair value to these dissenters.47 If the court's determination of fair value is much higher than the amount paid per share in the transaction, the cost of acquiring the target could rise substantially. To minimize potential appraisal claims, an acquirer may insist that a supermajority of shareholders approve the transaction.48 The bottom line is that corporate law may provide only a floor
u2tw | CARROTS AND STICKS
8yt6 | for shareholder-approval requirements.
ltcv | Because common shareholders' approval is sometimes needed as a matter of corporate law (in states where approval by each class of stock is required) or business practice, VCs can (and sometimes do) negotiate for "drag-along" rights that allow them to force common shareholders to vote for any transaction favored by the VCs.49 If the common shareholders have agreed to vote their shares as directed by the VCs, they cannot block an exit transaction via a class vote.50 Instead, they must seek other means to stop the transaction.
01hw | II POTENTIAL ENTREPRENEURIAL-TEAM RESISTANCE TO TRADE SALES
mda3 | This Part explores why the entrepreneurial team may resist a trade sale that the VCs propose. Subpart A explains why founders and other executives may oppose, and may be able to impede, a trade sale. Subpart B explains why common shareholders may oppose, and may be able to impede, a trade sale.
w5v8 | A. Resistance by the Founder and Executives
nqdq | The founder and other executives may have both reasons and the means to oppose a trade sale.
59n0 | 1. Incentive
7iv7 | Consider a founder who is still the CEO. The founder-CEO may have ambitious (perhaps grandiose) financial and nonfinancial aspirations for the startup. He or she may believe that these aspirations can be realized only if the startup remains independent and he or she remains in control. A trade sale may well snuff out these aspirations. To the extent the founder-CEO wants to keep the startup independent so that it can realize its full "potential," he or she may oppose a trade sale.
blvr | Whether or not the founder is still part of the management team, the firm's executives might have two very practical reasons to oppose a trade sale. First, the executives may well be replaced or subject to tighter supervision as the firm comes under the control of a single shareholder (the acquirer). The acquirer could thus force the executives to give up the pay, perquisites, and
8spn | CARROTS AND STICKS
5ev7 | prestige associated with their positions-or to work harder for them.51
efbz | Second, executives may own substantial amounts of common stock in the firm, especially if they are part of the founding team. As we discuss below, a trade sale may yield little for common shareholders while eliminating the option value of their stock.52 To the extent executives own common stock that they will be forced to give up for less than its option value, they have another reason to try to block a trade sale.
iwje | 2. Ability
kww0 | Executives of VC-backed firms seeking to block a trade sale have three potential means to do so. First, and most importantly, they can refuse to cooperate in the sale of the firm. They can refuse to report acquisition interest to the VCs, they can drag their feet in dealing with a potential acquirer, and they can refuse to provide information or emphasize negative aspects of the business to a potential acquirer. Moreover, if a potential acquirer wants members of the executive team to stay on after the acquisition (for example, to continue developing a startup's technology), executives can block the deal by refusing to work for the acquirer. In short, executives can use their positional power in the firm to undermine and sabotage efforts to sell it.
tcsa | Second, to the extent executives have seats on the board, they can threaten to vote against a sale and try to persuade independent directors to oppose the transaction. Attorneys advising a board may prefer a vote to be unanimous because it reduces litigation risk. The desire for a unanimous vote would increase the ability of even a single director to impede a sale.
63wj | Third, if common-shareholder approval is necessary for the deal and executives own a large block of common shares, they can threaten to vote their shares against the deal and lobby other common shareholders to oppose the deal. This brings us to common-shareholder opposition to trade sales.
e9du | B. Opposition by Common Shareholders
81jd | Common shareholders, like executives, may also have an incentive (and some ability) to impede a trade sale.
c9eb | VCs exiting via trade sale can always choose to retain their preferred shares rather than convert them into common shares. In this scenario, the
4id4 | CARROTS AND STICKS
hgxi | VCs have liquidation preferences that must be paid in full before common shareholders receive any payout. Thus, common shareholders may not receive much, if anything, in a trade sale. However, even if the VCs' liquidation preferences exceed the sale price, the common stock might have considerable option value at the time of sale: if the firm is not sold now, it might later hit a home run and be sold later for a price that far exceeds the preferred shareholders' liquidation preferences, giving a large payout to common shareholders.53 The less common shareholders receive, and the greater the loss of option value, the more common shareholders will wish to block a trade sale.
hzpf | In blocking a sale, the common shareholders' goal may not be to keep the startup independent so that it can later go public. Rather, these shareholders may resist a trade sale today because they believe that, if the startup remains independent, there is a good chance that the future will bring a more attractive trade sale-one that provides significantly more value for common shareholders.
z69t | 2. Ability
hqle | Common shareholders can block a trade sale in three ways: by (a) using their shareholder voting rights; (b) litigating or threatening litigation; or (c) using their influence over the board.
