You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

h1zo | If you feel that you can understand a poem, providing that you are given time or peace to absorb it, and will not consider it otherwise, you can be cutting yourself off from a poem which may have been written specifically to be read or recited only under certain circumstances, which themselves may involve a negation of the conditions which you seek to impose. One example is conven- tion, which you have created or copied from someone else. It is not enough to claim that these canons are sacrosanct They are not, cannot be - and cannot be shown to be.
kgew | The famous phrase: 'C'est magnifique, mais ce n'est pas <LATEX>l a</LATEX> guerre' is a typical example of something that should not be, according to the Sufi belief. Indeed, it CANNOT be.
m6i0 | There is an interesting saying involving the use of the technical term 'madman' for 'Sufi':
z2ac | 'A fool can easily drop a rock into a well, but a hundred scholars may not be able to raise it out again. It may need a Sufi.'
1tj9 | This saying refers to the difficulty which certain intellectuals (scholars) have in dealing with fixed ideas or psychological prob- lems (a fool).
dbw1 | What seems madness to some may be sanity to others: and, of course the converse. In this connection, remember the words of Sheikh Abdullah Ansari of Herat:
kdd3 | 'The skilled artisan uses the same iron to make a horseshoe As he does for a polished mirror for the King.'
bhj2 | Thirty thousand Americans die each year as a result of taking medicines prescribed by their doctors. Ten times that number need hospital treatment because of the adverse reactions produced by medicines .*
j34e | What may be good for some is certainly not at all good for others. The random application of Sufic and other processes, taken from books or transmitted by shallow imitators, is the madness: not the measured and understood application of real specifics to properly diagnosed conditions.

rmpr | 'Dye your Prayer-Rug with Wine'
gb8g | IN one of his best-known poems, the great poet Hafiz says that you should dye your prayer-carpet with wine if your teacher tells you to do so.
0kvy | This advice, alarming though it may be to the limited mind of the literalist, is extensively admired by Sufis - and not only for its poetic beauty in the Persian original.
zdyq | Sufis admire this admonition because it is a classical example of multiple-meaning, where a precise developmental formula is rendered in several dimensions. Let us look at some of the ingre- dients separately, which, together, give the instruction and the content which can only be called a living exercise: -
h5ye | 1. Shock: 'Dye your rug with wine' is designed to shock anyone whose faith is based on the conditioning, e.g., that 'Wine can only mean something evil';
psgz | 2. Allegory: wine stands for an inner experience, similar to 'mystical rapture' in other systems;
ft29 | 3. Obedience: the orders of the teacher are absolute;
k3n0 | 4. Occasion: the teacher orders one to do something when it is indicated for one's progress. He does not say, 'Dye your rug constantly", not "Until you dye your rug you cannot be a Sufi'. He says: 'When I tell you to dye your rug - dye it'.
60ib | 5. Analogy: Just as the prayer-carpet is not prayer, is rather, an external thing, so, too, on that level, is wine an external thing, and therefore secondary. Similarly, obedience to the teacher, though taken by the superficial as implying a great sacrifice and high merit, is only of the crude and superficial order in the relationship between master and disciple as rug is to prayer and wine is to real mystical experience.
vkqr | 6. Multiplicity of exercises: It is not said that 'Dyeing the rug with wine is the golden key'. On the contrary, it is more than hinted that this is just one activity, one part of a measured and known activity which will lead somewhere. This is the most powerful distinguishing sign of this system. To the extent to which
n4yz | the student can learn that he is working within a complex and refined system, and only to that extent, will he be able to move out of crude fanaticism and superficiality. The followers of 'systems' are always looking for-or think that they have found - the single practice, or the only one magic wand, which will give them what they want: illumination or whatever it is.
b2p3 | The value of this teaching cannot be over-emphasised. It will deter and annoy those who cannot profit from it. It will be utterly useless to those who want to turn the Sufi way into a mere cult. It will show up and make obvious those who are simply copyists or romantics, because they will be unable to benefit from the terms in which we have analysed it.
6knj | And all this is contained in a few lines of something which a literary observer imagines is perhaps only lyricism and the poetic outpourings of a man who approves of ecstatogenic processes.
2sn2 | Until the real spirit of such technical documents as this is appreciated by the student, we are not dealing with a real student at all; a consumer of poetry, perhaps, a follower, perhaps, a poseur, even, who doesn't know that he is such. But we are not dealing with someone who, in this condition, can progress beyond the exterior.
eon5 | I have actually heard of people who have set themselves up as teachers and who drink wine and ask their disciples to do so, in an attempt to 'follow what Hafiz said'.
oddi | Any comment on such doubly absurd mimetic behaviour should not, I believe, be on any higher level than the joke:
hk6w | 'What effect did the banana diet have on your wife?'
m5y4 | "Well, she isn't any thinner, but you should see her climb trees !'
xlnh | The Master-Dyer
ftun | Q: What kind of planning can Sufis do that people are un- familiar with in current cultural terms?
lfqn | A: Try this example:
ztjs | THE KING AND THE SUFI
53hs | There was once a King who found nobody in his realm wise or great enough to succeed him. So he spent some years in enquiries and study until a possible successor, named Arif el Arifin, was located. Now the King, perplexed by the problem of how to intro- duce the wise man in the face of the inevitable inertia, jealousy and expectations which existed in the absence of a wise man's constant presence and recognition, asked Arif himself to make a plan.
gorn | 'Who are the people most notorious in your realm for their envy and inflexibility?' Arif asked.
yb5a | 'The dyers of wool and cloth' said the King. 'Each one thinks that he is a master-dyer, and that his techniques and knowledge are the best. These men combine with one another very seldom, and then generally only to oppose the occasional intruder or minor dyer trying to rise in the profession.'
wfqx | 'Very well' said Arif; 'cause it to be announced to the dyers that the world's greatest master of their art is coming to take up his abode in your capital city.'
v3re | When the dyers heard the talk of this possibility spread through- out the city, and were shown samples of Arif the Master Dyer's work, which was magnificent, they went into transports of rage. So bitterly did they begin to hate their unknown rival that it very soon became obvious to almost everyone else that powerful emo- tion, not justice or fidelity to their craft, lay behind their vicious, bitter and often irrational denunciations of the interloper.
n068 | Now the people of the country in general whom the dyers had
