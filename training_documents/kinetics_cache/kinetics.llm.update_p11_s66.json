        "content": "oxou | tably, the curve of rCV two versus promoter width for the positive-feedback genes was always above that for the genes with negative feedback or non-feedback.\n495n | Next, we investigated whether different TSS distributions affected burst frequencies and burst sizes differently. Although genes with 'sharp' promoters led to a higher expression variability than those with 'broad' promoters for arbitrary feedback forms, burst frequencies and sizes regulated by TSS distributions can exhibit significant discrepancy only in the absence of feedback. Broad promoters led to higher burst frequencies and smaller burst sizes than sharp promoters, in agreement with the experimental observation that broad promoters tended to occur in the case of low RNA polymerase two pause, whereas sharp promoters tended to occur in the case of high RNA polymerase two pause. These results implied that on the genome-wide scale, feedback regulations significantly weakened the impacts of TSS distributions on transcriptional burst kinetics.\nawri | E-P interactions mainly modulate burst frequencies only in the presence of positive feedbacks\nbl28 | Enhancers, DNA sequences located upstream of the promoter, are important regulators of eukaryotic development. Several lines of experimental evidence supported that E-P interactions may facilitate gene transcription and can regulate transcriptional burst kinetics.\nd5bz | In addition, some studies showed that enhancer and promoter activations might require positive and negative feedback regulations, each contributing elements of the protein complement required for activation of other genes. These results raise important questions: does the genome-wide control of burst kinetics by E-P interactions involve feedback regulations? If so, how do feedbacks affect burst kinetics?\nap5o | To address these questions, we first recovered the intensities of E-P interactions and performed LOESS regression. With the involvement of feedback regulations, the modulation of variability and transcriptional burst kinetics by E-P interactions also presents Simpson's paradox. We then showed that, for all genes, increasing the E-P intensities led to the rise of mean gene-expression levels but to the decline of variability, indicating that stronger enhancers raised the expression levels but lowered cell-to-cell variability in contrast to weaker enhancers. However, when distinguishing genes by feedback types, this pattern only appears in the case of positive feedback, implying the important role of positive feedback in E-P interactions.\n7zvf | Next, we focused on burst frequencies and sizes. Previous molecular experiments and genome-wide inferences from scRNA-seq data showed that burst frequencies and sizes increased with promoting E-P interactions, and that enhancers mainly controlled burst frequencies. The same conclusion was obtained when we\nmov9 | performed analysis without distinguishing feedback types. Notably, when the feedback types was considered, we found that as the E-P intensity increased, changes in burst frequencies and sizes were most apparent in the case of positive feedback. Moreover, the slope of the line for the dependence of burst frequencies on E-P intensity was larger than that for the dependence of burst sizes on E-P intensity. In addition, we observed that this regulation effect of enhancers was saturated when the E-P interaction intensity exceeded a threshold of approximately forty. This result indicated that the function of the enhancer was not unlimited, in agreement with the theoretical prediction in our previous study.\nks7m | The above genome-wide results provided direct support for the fact that the control of burst kinetics by E-P interactions was constrained by positive feedback regulations, in accordance with previous experimental results for a small number of genes.\nw1w1 | DISCUSSION\nh8gv | As the core process of life, gene transcription occurs stochastically, leading to variability in the M R N A and further protein abundances. This variability is believed to be mainly attributed to transcriptional bursting, a phenomenon that occurs commonly in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. From the viewpoint of biophysics, the sources of transcriptional bursting are multilevel and multiscale. In this study, we have developed a statistical framework of the model-driven and data-driven integration to infer dynamic feedback regulations and transcriptional bursting kinetics from static scRNA-seq data, using a mechanistic mathematical model as the connecting thread.\nkwkp | The mechanistic model used in our inference framework was interpretable. It captured the scRNA-seq measurement process and the molecular mechanisms of transcriptional bursting processes. We showed that not only burst frequencies and sizes as well as expression variability but also feedback forms can be effectively and robustly inferred to explain biophysical phenomena, which were masked in the\nyj0m | scRNA-seq data. Meanwhile, our inference method made the interpretable model tractable. We utilized the Gauss-Laguerre Quadrature Rules instead of the classical M C M C method to compute M R N A distribution with a high-order integral that is difficult to solve, thus making our scalable inference applicable on genome-wide scales. Our statistical inference framework laid a solid foundation for exploring the molecular mechanisms of stochastic gene expression based on single-cell data.\newfp | Our inference method provided a powerful tool for analyzing the joint effects of feedback regulation and promoter architecture and for revealing the genome-wide mechanisms of transcriptional burst kinetics. First, we found that at the same gene-expression levels, positive-feedback genes exhibited significantly higher gene-expression variability and higher burst frequencies as well as smaller burst sizes than negative-feedback genes on genome-wide scales. This finding indicated that different regulatory networks played distinct roles in modulating transcriptional burst kinetics. Second, we revealed that the TATA box, apart from being indicative of enlarging the expression variability and raising burst sizes as suggested in previous studies, can utilize a positive feedback mechanism to increase burst frequencies. This result may explain the phenomenon that the RNA polymerase two on the TATA box gene had better localization and fewer transcriptional pauses. Third, broad promoters with multiple TSSs led to higher burst frequencies and smaller burst sizes, which were concealed by the feedback regulations. Finally, we showed that enhancer-promoter interactions modulated burst kinetics and primarily controlled burst frequency in the presence of positive feedback. All these results were obtained under the hidden hypothesis that the intrinsic behaviors of the different gene were statistically identical. Overall, these genome-wide evidences indicated that transcriptional burst kinetics was not only encoded by static promoter architectures but also constrained by dynamic gene regulatory networks.\noczy | Our inference framework based on the model-driven and data-driven combination was an extensible one for studying the general principles of transcriptional bursting.
