You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

g9du | A Ferric-Superoxide Intermediate Initiates P450-Catalyzed Cyclic Dipeptide Dimerization
f682 | INTRODUCTION
li1k | The regio- and stereo-selective formation of C-C and C-N bonds represents a fundamental yet synthetically challenging step required for the production of many valuable drugs and agrochemicals. Genome mining efforts have revealed several enzymatic strategies employed by nature to catalyze these reactions for the biosynthesis of important natural products. Arguably, the best characterized class of enzymes known for this type of reactivity are radical S-adenosylmethionine (rSAM) enzymes, which use powerful radical-mediated chemistry to catalyze various types of C-C bond formation and a breadth of other reactions. In addition to rSAMs, the analysis of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) has shown a preponderance of mononuclear heme and nonheme enzymes responsible for catalyzing the oxidative formation of Csp2-Csp3> Csp2-Nsp2, and Csp3-Nsp2 bonds. Inter- and intra-molecular bond formation by cytochrome P450s (CYPs) is prevalent in the biosynthesis of pharmacophores that include phenol cross-link formation during the assembly of glycopeptide antibiotics (GPA) (e.g., teicoplanin and vancomycin)" and desertorin or orlandin alkaloids, flaviolin dimerization, tryptophan nitration,7 and amination for indolactam generation, among others. CYPs have also been recently shown to dimerize tryptophan-containing cyclic dipeptides.9,10
pbea | Tryptophan-linked dimeric 2,5-diketopiperazine (DKP) alkaloids are a large family of natural products that are found in numerous species and exhibit broad and often potent (e.g., antimicrobial and antiparasitic) cytotoxicity.""" One route for dimer biosynthesis consists of a cyclodipeptide synthase enzyme (CDPS) that converts two amino acid charged
ccpt | tRNA molecules to form a cyclic dipeptide.13,14 CYPs, prevalent in many bacterial CDPS-containing BGCs, have been found to catalyze the downstream dimerization of DKP dipeptides through an oxidative mechanism that has yet to be clarified.15 One such pathway, shown in Figure 1A, is found in Streptomyces sp. NRRL S-1868 and consists of the CDPS AspA that generates cyclo-L-Trp-L-Pro (cWP), also termed brevianamide F. The CYP AspB subsequently forms the N1- C7'-linked dimer termed aspergilazine A (Figure 1A).16 CYPs that share a very high degree of sequence identity to AspB have been found to catalyze different modes of cWP dimerization, including the C3-C6' and intramolecular C-N linkage of naseseazine C by NascB. Another recently discovered CYP NzeB was found to have more relaxed regio- and stereo- specificity to form mixtures of both aspergilazine A and naseseazine C.18,19 The divergent chemoselectivity of CYP dimerases provides an attractive alternative to synthetic routes for late-stage functionalization, particularly for the assembly of asymmetric DKP-dimers.
0fpw | Despite the prevalence of CYP-catalyzed C-C/C-N bond formation in a number of important natural product biosyn- thesis pathways, very little is known regarding the enzymatic
dqn8 | basis for catalyzing a reaction outcome that profoundly differs from the "oxygen addition" (e.g., monooxygenation) reactions that have been the subject of intense scrutiny for many decades. Both radical coupling and cationic pathways have been shown to be energetically plausible, and the most commonly invoked mechanism involves a primary oxidation catalyzed by an iron(IV)-oxo pi cation radical intermediate (compound I, or CYP-I), followed by a secondary oxidation by the resultant Fe++-OH compound II (CYP-II).8,20,21 However, direct insight into this process is extremely limited due to the complexity in preparation of the substrates involved (a carrier- protein-linked peptide in the case of GPAs),3,22 direct access to the fleeting intermediates in the catalytic cycle, or both.
cop0 | In this study, we use a combination of steady-state and transient kinetics, alternative substrate analogs, and single turnover approaches to evaluate the mechanism for C-N bond formation by the CYP DKP-dimerase AspB. The data provide kinetic and spectroscopic evidence for the unexpected reactivity of an iron-superoxide intermediate for initiating substrate dimerization to form aspergilazine A. We also demonstrate that this reaction trajectory is generalizable to C-C bond formation catalyzed by NzeB. This catalytic strategy rationalizes the circumnavigation of canonical CYP ferryl reactivity to promote selective bond formation that may be extended to the biosynthesis of many other natural products.

82ju | Inverse Steady-State Kinetic Solvent Isotope Effect in AspB-Catalyzed Formation of Aspergilazine A. As very little is known about the mechanism for CYP-catalyzed oxidative DKP-dimerization, we sought to explore the basis for C-N bond formation using the DKP dimerase AspB. In vitro multiple turnover studies with recombinant AspB and a surrogate redox partner system composed of spinach ferredoxin, ferredoxin reductase (sp. Fd/FdR), and NADPH as a source of reducing equivalents resulted in nearly complete consumption of the cWP substrate to form one major product (≥98%) and minor amount of another product with m/z = 565 corresponding to a DKP dimer (Figure 1B). The highly chemoselective profile is in good agreement with prior in vivo fermentation experiments by Li et al., which showed that 98% of the substrate was converted to aspergilazine A, while the other ~2% corresponded to two other DKP dimers with varying linkages. Thus, we assigned the major product peak as aspergilazine A.
