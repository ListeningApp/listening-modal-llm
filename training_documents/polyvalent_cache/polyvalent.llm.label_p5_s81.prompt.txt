You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

fj24 | In silico modeling of wild-type, pIII N-terminal 30-amino- acid fragment and several peptides fused at that site showed a probable secondary structure of the peptide and terminal region of pIII (Figure 2).39-41 The native helical fragments at N-terminus for the analyzed A3, C9, and D11 clones were quite affected. Nevertheless, undisturbed amplification and titration of these clones exclude the significant impact of additional fragments on bacteria recognition and infection, consistent with the literature reports." 42-44 N-terminus of cardiac TnT is a long, helical structure exposing polar residues outside the helix, according to in silico simulation of appropriate sequence45 45 in PEP-FOLD3.39-41

ba4l | Phage Concentration Determination Using ELISA.
ffx8 | Non-specific protein immobilization at the liquid/solid inter- face (of a microtiter plate) is one of the most commonly used methods of preparing wells for ELISA. This immobilized target is recognized by soluble molecules like antibodies or peptide- displaying phages. Stages of ELISA, which assumes specific recognition, may be described using a modified Langmuir-like isotherm.46 It should be noted that this model cannot be applied for initial non-specific precaution.46 Since wells are coated with TnT molecules and the number of available target molecules (active sites), they may bind a limited number of phages. Moreover, the number of bound phages limits the amount of bound HRP-conjugated antibodies. The surface density of HRP enzyme (i.e., the amount of HRP immobilized on the liquid/solid interface) is a crucial factor affecting the rate of substrate (3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine, TMB) oxidation. The reaction rate may be expressed by the rate of the change of absorbance at 370 nm (which is the maximum absorption of the yellow byproduct47) under the assumption that the kinetics of the enzymatic reaction is zero order (Michaelis-Menten model and enzyme saturation). In this case, the measured signal is the enzyme activity defined as the slope of the linear time function of absorbance (eq 13).

06ht | Enzyme activity is proportional to the amount of bound HRP- conjugated antibodies and indirectly to the number of bound phages (eq 14). When the reaction is stopped by the addition of sulfuric acid, the enzyme is denatured. As a result, the blue complex dissociates into a yellow product (adsorption maximum at 450 nm) and transparent TMB.47,48

xags | The application of kinetic-based ELISA (also shortened to k- ELISA) was previously described and developed by several authors.49 : 49-52 The signal recorded in this way has significant advantages such as independence from time-shifting, path length, wells material heterogeneity, and air bubbles.35 Single- data-point absorbance reading is easier and more high- throughput but generates a higher error.

xek3 | the A3 clone gave the calibration curve as y = 0.0010x + 0.0006 and R2 = 0.9961, indicating specific interaction with the studied target, while for the wild-type variant, it was y = 0.0006x + 0.0013 and R2 = 0.6323. Such a low R2 coefficient may suggest mainly non-specific interaction of the wild-type phage. For the A3, we also calculated sensitivity to be 0.264 x 109 abs.mL.pfu-1.min-1. The empirically found range of the linearity of the signal enables the calculation of Ka via ELISA. In this range, da/d(CM13) equals the constant value of sensitivity calculated above. The range of the linearity limits and indicates the range of analysis. To maximize the reproducibility of experiments, we decided to work with a phage concentration of about (1.0-10.0) × 109 pfu/mL, which corresponds to about 1.6-16 pM.
bbpr | Determination of Ka via k-ELISA. ELISA (also k-ELISA) can be used to measure the dissociation constant (Ka), which is commonly applied to describe affinity." According to the mathematical model presented above, the Ka value can be calculated via pre-incubation of a receptor with varied concentrations of ligand and subsequent detection of the soluble receptor (phage) via ELISA. This approach was

Moreover, the authors applied a wide range of ligand concentrations, high excess compared to the receptor and treated the concentration-signal function as logarithmic, while the discussion above concluded that it is not possible to apply Frigeut's method for almost completely saturated receptors (due to ligand excess).
bqfb | In our work, analysis was performed for clones: A3, B7, D11, and wild-type M13. These clones were selected for further analysis because they exhibited the highest affinity in screening and could be easily amplified; therefore, the C9 clone was not chosen. The phages' total concentration was about 1 × 1010 pfu/mL (16 pM) and was carefully determined using the biological method immediately before analysis. The range of ratios of total TnT and total phage concentration was 1:2, 1:1, 2:1, and 4:1. Increasing TnT concentration causes an increase in the saturation of phage-displayed receptors. As a result, a decrease in the ability to bind to immobilized TnT molecules occurs. Experimental data were analyzed according to the presented mathematical model. Calculated values of Ka (from linear slope regression) are listed in Table 3.
wwdt | Table 3. Calculated Values of the Dissociation Constant for Different Assumed Stoichiometriesª
mn1r | For all phages, calculated Ka vary for different assumed complex stoichiometries. For the 1:1 stoichiometry, Ka values are the lowest (highest affinity). Then, they rise for bivalent receptors and slightly decrease for pentavalent. The M13 phages usually have three to five copies of the pIII protein.25 Therefore, the expected valency is between 2 to 5. For every variant, the difference between Ka calculated under the receptor's mono- and bi-valency assumption is higher than the difference between the 1:2 and 1:5 stoichiometries. It suggests that the accurate stoichiometry is closer to 1:2 or 1:5 than to 1:1. The determined values are very low compared to typical Ka for immunological complexes. However, the presented method requires working under similar concen- trations of M13 and TnT. The linear range of concentrations obtained for phages using k-ELISA was in the picomolar range; therefore, TnT concentration also had to be picomolar. A significant disadvantage of this method is that phage titer biologically measured may differ from the real physical concentration of phage particles in solution measured during ELISA.54,55 In the biological method, phages are only detected if they can infect bacteria and induce dye (x-gal) metabolism to a blue product. In solution, phages may form aggregates that produce false low phage titers from biological assays. For A3, B7, and D11 clones, values of Ka are in a similar range which does not correlate with their distribution in the recovered pool (Table 2). This fact may be explained by the varied rate of

The same explanation is suggested by the manufacturer of the Ph.D .- 12 kit as justification for advising against the amplification of phage-displayed peptide libraries. For the wild-type M13, it was impossible to calculate a <LATEX>K _ { d }</LATEX> that may have a physical sense (calculated <LATEX>K _ { d }</LATEX> values were negative), which shows that the model may be applied only for specific interactions.
s2g2 | If a phage is treated as monovalent, the measured <LATEX>K _ { d }</LATEX> does not refer to the thermodynamical strength of single peptide- TnT interactions. However, the resultant affinity (strength of single interaction) and valency (number of binding sites per particle) are known in immunology as avidity. 43,56,57 Avidities are most significant for IgM antibodies that consist of five subunits presenting two antigen-binding domains on each one. As a result, a single IgM antibody can theoretically bind ten epitopes, causing 1:10 antibody-ligand complex stoichiom- etry. Moreover, bivalent IgG antibodies' <LATEX>K _ { d }</LATEX> is affected by non- monovalency in the same manner. Due to avidity's different nature, compared to affinity, a relative dissociation constant maybe <LATEX>1 0 ^ { 2 }</LATEX> to <LATEX>1 0 ^ { 4 }</LATEX> lower than a single paratope-epitope <LATEX>K _ { d }</LATEX> However, in several publications, 16-18 <LATEX>K _ { d }</LATEX> was calculated without correction for non-monovalency of the antigen- binding particle (e.g., phage). One should be aware that the <LATEX>K _ { d }</LATEX> calculated from ELISA in these papers is more avidity than affinity.
q1q2 | Several minor modifications of the presented method may be considered to improve the accuracy of <LATEX>K _ { d }</LATEX> determination via ELISA. Limitation of non-specific interaction between phage particles and plate/surface-immobilized proteins and revision of phage concentration measurement would be the most significant improvements. However, the proposed mathemat- ical interpretation of interactions between polyvalent receptors sheds new light on the field of affinity determination in phage- peptide systems, similar to the theory presented by the previous authors."" The presented model was compared with empirical results that confirm the hypothesis about the mixed valency of phage particles depending on the number of pIII. Studies on peptide-protein complex formation and dissociation in other experimental systems may be discussed in a separate paper to provide comprehensiveness of the field of <LATEX>K _ { d }</LATEX> determination in biochemical sciences.
cb7r | The described method consumes low amounts of a target protein. Moreover, the phage material is easily amplified in bacteria culture. Owing to this, the presented assay is very suitable and valuable for research aimed at developing new high-affinity protein-specific receptors. The identified TnT- specific peptides might also find applications in research, especially connected with heart and cardiovascular diseases. Moreover, we anticipate that the selected TnT binding phages or peptides can be used to optimize a sensing layer toward implementing this concept for detecting the markers of cardiovascular diseases and transferring them into feasible applications in clinical diagnostics. The applied method may also cover other systems where monovalent molecules interact with multiple active sites of the receptor-like natural antibod- ies.
