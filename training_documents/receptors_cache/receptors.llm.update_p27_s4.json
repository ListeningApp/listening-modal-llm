        "content": "z4mi | DNA damage and repair mechanisms underly the ability of cells to acquire genetic alterations that can drive cancer initiation and progression. One exciting emerging field suggests that GPCRs and their regulated signalling systems can functionally participate in DNA damage response and repair systems. Lysophosphatidic acid, for example, has been shown to mediate enhanced survival and mitigate chemotherapeutic and radiation-induced DNA damage in the intestinal epithelium via engagement of LPA one and LPA two receptors. LPA two in particular has a potent pro-survival effect against gastrointestinal radiation-induced injury by regulating DNA damage response and repair pathways (Figure one). Damage to the intestinal epithelium is a frequent and dose-limiting complication of common chemo- and radio-therapies. While exogenous LPA is rapidly processed and metabolized in the gastrointestinal tract limiting its activity, synthetic and metabolically stable LPA mimetics may be used as protective agents to promote gastrointestinal integrity during chemo- and radio-therapy.\nhkft | CXCR four, best-studied for its role in metastasis and modulation of the tumor microenvironment, has also been found to regulate cell survival in ovarian cancer. Blockade of CXCR four with a small peptide antagonist was not only found to inhibit metastasis but induced ovarian cancer cell death by weakening DNA damage checkpoints and leading to mitotic catastrophe. The CXCR four CXCL twelve signalling axis has also been shown to protect hematopoietic stem cells from oxidative stress injury by reducing mitochondrial reactive oxidative species and subsequent genotoxic stress.",
