        "content": "4i6r | Two. Cooking healthy food will take too much time\na3i4 | Three. Cooking healthy food is expensive. It's not worth it.\nheua | Four. I will not be able to buy healthy food forever. My family's needs will get in my way. If I travel I won't know how to cook healthy.\ng2u7 | Next thing they must do: Eating healthy food\n5l9k | One) Etc ...\n5zaz | Next thing they must do: Exercise Regularly\npc7u | One) Etc ...\n5554 | Now we're gonna go full circle here. Each of the above problems has four negative elements. And you guessed it, each aligns with the four value drivers as well.\nbijr | OTE\ni2gp | PERCEIVED LIKELIHOOD OF ACHIEVEMENT\nxq5u | Zero\nkbyk | DREAM OUTCOME\nuulj | less than\ne3k9 | equals VALUE\n5biw | TIME DELAY\nn108 | EFFORT AND SACRIFICE\nnyac | Times\n2cn1 | One. Dream Outcome-> This will not be financially worth it\nc3m1 | Two. Likelihood of Achievement-> It won't work for me specifically. I won't be able to stick with it. External factors will get in my way. (This is the most unique and service-specific of the problem buckets).\n9yo6 | Three. Effort and Sacrifice-> This will be too hard, confusing. I won't like it. I will suck at it.\nkiqm | Four. Time-> This will take too much time to do. I am too busy to do this. It will take too long to work. It won't be convenient for me.\n6n7u | Now, go ahead and list out all the problems your prospect has. Don't let these buckets, which are just meant to get your brain going, constrain you. If it's easier for you, just list out everything you can possibly think of.\ncodw | What I showed here isn't just four problems, though. We have sixteen core problems with two to four sub problems underneath. So thirty-two to sixty-four problems total. Yowza. No wonder most people don't achieve their goals. Do not get overwhelmed. This is the best news ever. The more problems you think of, the more problems you get to solve.\nsuvf | So, to recap, just list out each core thing that someone has to do. Then think of all the reasons they wouldn't be able to do it, or keep doing it (using the four value drivers as a guide).\npsc6 | Now we get to the fun part: turning problems into solutions.\nm69t | Step Number Three: Solutions List\nylr1 | Now that we have our dream outcome and all the obstacles that will get in someone's way, it's time to define our solutions and list them out.\n7xmx | Creating the solutions list has two steps. First, we are going to first transform our problems into solutions. Second, we are going to name these solutions. That's it. So let's take a look at our list of problems from earlier. What we're going to do is simply turn them into solutions by thinking, \"What would I need to show someone to solve this problem?\" Then we are going to reverse each element of the obstacle into solution-oriented language. This is copywriting one-oh-one. It's beyond the scope of this book to get into, but simply adding \"how to\" then reversing the problem will give most people new to this process a great place to start. For our purposes, we are giving ourselves a checklist of exactly what we are going to have to do for our prospects and what we are going to solve for them.\nspty | Once we have our list of solutions, we will operationalize how we are actually going to solve these problems (create value) in the next step. And I want to be one hundred percent clear. You will solve every problem. We'll explore how together, in the next step.\nfosi | PROBLEM TO SOLUTION\ntsuw | PROBLEM: Buying healthy food, grocery shopping\nl0hr | . . . is hard, confusing, I won't like it. I will suck at it-> How to make buying healthy food easy and enjoyable, so that anyone can do it (especially busy moms!)\n5jk8 | . . . takes too much time-> How to buy healthy food quickly\n4cms | .. . is expensive-> How to buy healthy food for less than your current grocery bill\niynx | .. is unsustainable-> How to make buying healthy food take less effort than buying unhealthy food\nub6m | . is not my priority.

That's a lot of problems (and a lot of intuited solutions courtesy of divergent thinking). You'll also notice that a lot of them are repetitive. That's totally normal. The value drivers are the four core reasons. Our problems always relate to those drivers, and our solutions provide the needed answer to give a prospect permission to purchase. What's even crazier: is that if only one of these needs is missing in a solution, it can cause someone not to buy. You would be amazed at the reasons people do not buy. So don't limit yourself here.\nyw9n | Brooke Castillo is a friend who runs an enormous life coaching business. To give you a different take on the problems-solutions list, Brooke sent me her list as she was going through this book to make a Grand Slam Offer for a ninety-day relationship course. Take a look to see this process through a totally different lens. The main takeaway, though: Don't be fancy. Just get all the problems down then turn them into solutions.\n8u3s | Regardless of whether the offer you're creating is around fitness (like the example), a relationship course (like Brooke), or something wildly different (like ear aches), we now know what we need to do. Step four is the how (and how to do it without breaking the bank).\nhmg7 | Dream Outcome -P\np0a7 | amazing, loving relationship in ninety days\nochb | Problems-> no good options\npcum | not attractive not available boring no chemistry poor communication not hot enough sex isn't good no intellectual stimulation not enough effort into relationship no time insecurity needs not met too many unmet expectations acting crazy, emotional relationship is dull want different things not good at relationships too much pressure moves too slow fizzles out fast kids involved sexual incompatibility\nbu0s | Solutions List\njr8i | How to get a list of prospective partners to invite into ninety day How to be attracted to your partner chosen How to find an available partner\n7mby | How to make sure ninety days is exciting and never boring How to create chemistry like you've never known",
