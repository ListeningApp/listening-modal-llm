You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

m047 | matters worse again. Down upon the ground they fall, glasses, bread, knives forks and all" (Hoffmann 1846, English edition). The fact that Philipp's parents become very angry in the story (Hoffmann 1948) may hint at another DSM-IV-TR criterion, i.e. the behavior of children suffering from ADHD often causes conflicts and a "sig- nificant impairment in social ( ... ) functioning" (American Psychiatric Association 2000).
gy8c | Another story in Hoffmann's "Struwwelpeter" relevant to the present review is that of "Johnny Look-in-the-air", which was added in the 5th edition in 1847 (Seidler 2004). In this story, Hoffmann depicts a boy showing significant symptoms of inattention. Johnny was always "looking at the sky and the clouds that floated by" (Hoffmann 1846, English edition) and was therefore "often easily distracted by extraneous stimuli" (American Psychiatric Association 2000). Johnny's inattentiveness resulted in the collision with an approaching dog and climaxed in an accident as "Johnny watch'd the swallows" (Hoffmann 1846, English edition). He finally fell into a river.
y4mj | Some authors are convinced that the stories of Johnny Look-in-the-air and Fidgety Phil are early descriptions of ADHD (Burd and Kerbeshian 1988; Kopf 2006; Thome and Jacobs 2004). However, Johnny Look-in-the-air's ret- ropulsion of the head may also be interpreted as a description of a petit mal absence (Nissen 2005). Petit mal absences show a wide variety of mild to moderate motor accompaniment, and retropulsion of the head is quite common (retropulsive petit mal, Janz 1969). There are also critics who advance the view that Hoffmann's Fidgety Phil is simply an example of a naughty child (Seidler 2004). Seidler (2004) refers to the fact that the final version of the scene's pictures published in 1859, which is the artwork still used in modern editions, differs from the original version of 1845. Seidler (2004) sees in the slightly different gestures of the protagonists a completely different situa- tion, namely an open conflict between a father and his naughty, misbehaving son. The father's initial admonition provokes the son's deliberate defiant behavior indicated by eye contact and the active gripping of the tablecloth by the son (Seidler 2004). Hoffmann's storybook was published at a time when educational warning stories were very popular (Herzog et al. 1995). Each of Hoffmann's stories demon- strates a child's misconduct leading to fatal consequences including death of the child. It is therefore possible that he wanted children to learn from his stories. Hoffmann's script is an illustrated children's book and he is therefore unlikely to have intended to address a broad medical readership and to describe a pathological condition. Since at his time the symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity were not established as a psychiatric disorder, Hoffmann may have presented observations of conspicuous behavior without considering describing a disorder. One cannot

m4ju | conclude whether or not Hoffmann's described a case of ADHD in the early nineteenth century, since the story of Fidgety Phil is too short and the depicted behavioral fea- tures are not sufficient to establish the diagnostic criteria of ADHD. Fidgety Phil has nevertheless become a commonly used allegory for ADHD.
a0mb | Defect of moral control (Sir George Frederic Still, 1868-1941)
ki8m | The Goulstonian Lectures of Sir George Frederic Still in 1902 are by many authors considered to be the scientific starting point of the history of ADHD (Barkley 2006a; Conners 2000; Palmer and Finger 2001; Rafalovich 2001; Rothenberger and Neumärker 2005). Still was a British pediatrician who was born in Highbury, London, in 1868. He became involved in research into childhood diseases and wrote several medical textbooks about his findings (Farrow 2006). The most widely known findings are his descriptions of "a form of chronic joint disease in chil- dren" (Still 1897), which today is called "Still's disease" (Farrow 2006). In 1906, Still became the first professor of pediatrics in England at King's College Hospital London (Farrow 2006). In 1933, he was president of the first international pediatric congress (Hamilton 1968). Still has therefore frequently been called "the father of British pediatrics" (Dunn 2006).
km8w | In his Goulstonian Lectures, a series of three lectures to the Royal College of Physicians of London "On Some Abnormal Psychical Conditions in Children" (Still 1902), Still discusses "the particular psychical conditions ( ... ) which are concerned with an abnormal defect of moral control in children" (Still 1902, p. 1008). He defines moral control as "the control of action in conformity with the idea of the good of all" (Still 1902, p. 1008). Still states that "moral control ( ... ) is dependent upon three psychical factors, a cognitive relation to environment, moral con- sciousness, and volition" (Still 1902, p. 1077). Since both "cognitive relation to environment", which implies a "capacity for reasoning comparison", and moral con- sciousness are intellectual capacities (Still 1902, p. 1008), Still states that defective moral control as a morbidity can often be observed in cases of mentally retarded children (Still 1902). However, "there are other cases which cannot be included in this category" (Still 1902, p. 1008) and which, as he points out, "in particular ( ... ) call for careful observation" (Still 1902, p. 1008). They comprise the cases considered as historical descriptions of ADHD, i.e. children with a defect of moral control but without a "general impairment of intellect" (Still 1902, p. 1077). Still divides these cases in two further groups, children with a "morbid defect of moral control associated with
wzno | The history of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
xagm | physical disease" (Still 1902, p. 1077), such as a cerebral tumor, meningitis, epilepsy, head injury or typhoid fever, and children with a "defect of moral control as a morbid manifestation, without general impairment of intellect and without physical disease" (Still 1902, p. 1079). Some of the latter group, however, showed a "history of severe cerebral disturbance in early infancy" (Still 1902, p. 1081). This differentiation was the origin of later concepts of brain damage, minimal cerebral dysfunction, and hyperactivity as historical precursors to ADHD (Rothenberger and Neumärker 2005).
iwn5 | Still described 20 cases of children with a "defect of moral control as a morbid manifestation, without general impairment of intellect and without physical disease" (Still 1902, p. 1079). Interestingly, Still observed 15 cases of boys and five cases of girls. This is "a disproportion which [in Still's opinion] ( ... ) is not altogether accidental" (Still 1902, p. 1080) and which is consistent with the commonly observed uneven male to female sex ratio of 3:1 in child and adolescent ADHD (Barkley 1990, cited by Palmer and Finger 2001). Most children for whom the first manifes- tation of the defect was determined showed symptoms before the age of 7 (7 out of 9 cases), which currently is a diagnostic criterion of DSM-IV-TR. Still furthermore rec- ognized that a morbid manifestation of a child's moral control can be considered only when the child does not meet the standard for moral conduct at a certain age within a "range of variation which we arbitrarily recognize as normal" (Still 1902, p. 1009). The American Psychiatric Association also states that for a diagnosis of ADHD, symptoms have to be present "to a degree that is mal- adaptive and inconsistent with developmental level" (American Psychiatric Association 2000). Still argued that a "lack of moral control may be shown in many ways" (Still 1902, p. 1009). The symptoms listed are:
uooz | (1) passionateness; (2) spitefulness - cruelty; (3) jealousy; (4) lawlessness; (5) dishonesty; (6) wanton mischievousness - destructiveness; (7) shamelessness - immodesty; (8) sexual immorality; and (9) viciousness. The keynote of these qualities is self-gratification, the immediate gratification of self without regard either to the good of others or to the larger and more remote good of self. (Still, 1902, p. 1009).
pxbq | Although most of these symptoms are not directly associ- ated with the current concept of ADHD, the keynote identified by Still fits an important finding of modern ADHD research. Delay of gratification appears to be "a major problem for children with ADHD" (Barkley 2006b) and reactions without regard to consequences, whether "to the good of others or ( ... ) [the] good of self" (Still 1902, p. 1009), are strongly associated with impulsivity, a main symptom of ADHD. The most common symptom observed
jfsr | 245
u15r | by Still in these cases was "an abnormal degree of passionateness" (Still 1902, p. 1009). Passionateness did not mean affection (Barkley 2006b), but some "impulsivity regarding some immediate goal" (Conners 2000, p. 176) and a kind of "quickness to display all emotion and especially those of frustration, anger, hostility, and aggres- sion" (Barkley 2006b, p. 137), for example expressed "in outbursts of rage" (Still 1902, p. 1165). Similarly "jeal- ousy" does, according to Still, not mean "the mere emotion but its uncontrolled expression" (Still 1902, p. 1009). Still attributes these symptoms to "a morbid failure to control ( ... ) emotional activities" (Still 1902, p. 1165), which is due to an "exaggeration of excitability" (Still 1902, p. 1165). These descriptions are similar to the current concept of impulsivity. Although not explicitly mentioned in DSM-IV-TR, impulsivity as a main symptom of ADHD is often associated with a lack of emotional impulse control, a low frustration tolerance and some abrupt outbursts of rage (Barkley 2006b). Still describes some cases with signs of impulsivity,
lq35 | for instance, the case of the boy, aged 111/2 years ( ... ): his mother stated that in the midst of playing quietly with other children he would suddenly seize two of them and bang their heads together, making them cry with pain and ( ... ) he seems unable to resist it. (Still, 1902, p. 1165).
3g9w | Still also mentions that many of his depicted cases showed "a quite abnormal incapacity for sustained attention. Both parents and school teachers have specially noted this feature in some of my cases as something unusual" (Still 1902, p. 1166). An attention deficit is a main symptom of ADHD and, according to the current DSM-IV-TR criteria, a child with ADHD "has difficulty sustaining attention in tasks or play activities" (American Psychiatric Association 2000). Difficulties at school are frequently observed in children with ADHD. In particular, the notion of children with a significant attention deficit, but "without general impairment of intellect" (Still 1902, p. 1079) fits modern- day ADHD. Recent studies have shown that the IQ of children with ADHD is within the normal range (MTA Cooperative Group 1999; Schuck and Crinella 2005). Some of the cases cited by Still showed remarkable symptoms of inattention, for example,
d09o | the case of a boy with moral defect who would repeat the process of saying 'Good-night' several times before he was aware that he had done so; the same boy would often put his boot on the wrong foot apparently without noticing it. Another boy, aged six years, with marked moral defect was unable to keep his attention even to a game for more than a very short time, and, as might be expected, the failure of

a3td | attention was very noticeable at school, with the result that in some cases the child was backward in school attainments, although in manner and ordinary conversation he appeared as bright and intelligent as any child could be (Still, 1902, p. 1166).
ex5k | Many of Still's descriptions appear to indicate that children in the early twentieth century showed clear symptoms of ADHD. However, most of the symptoms listed by Still and described in his cases do not refer to ADHD. Still also reported children who "seemed to take a delight in tormenting the other children" (Still 1902, p. 1080), for example by throwing other children's toys in the fire and laughing at their grief. He furthermore described children who pathologically stole or lied with extraordinary insen- sitivity to any punishment, children who were aggressive and attacked strange children or threatened to hurt their mothers (Still 1902, p. 1081), "lawless" children with "a reckless disregard for command and authority" (Still 1902, p. 1009), children with "a complete lack of natural affection" (Still 1902, p. 1165) even to their parents, and children who showed cruelty to animals for example by attempting to put a cat in the fire (Still 1902, p. 1081) or by "cutting a rabbit alive ( ... ) smothered in blood" (Still 1902, p. 1081).
