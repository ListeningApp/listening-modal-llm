The sea-surface temperature data were derived from long-wave eleven micrometer sea-surface temperature algorithm. Only nighttime data were used to avoid any surface skin created by diurnal warming. The satellite-derived sea-surface wind data are from a daily near-real-time product derived from WindSat Polarimetric Radiometer instrument. These satellite images were downloaded from the Remote Sensing Systems under the sponsorship of NASA. The\n0i1k | Hydrobiologia\ndqlg | time span of the MODIS images is from fourth August, two thousand twelve to thirtieth October, two thousand twelve, and the geographic area covers in one hundred twenty-one to one hundred twenty-three degrees north and seventeen to nineteen degrees south, with a resolution of four kilometers by four kilometers. The satellite wind data are from the same area and time period but with a resolution of zero point two five degrees by zero point two five degrees. For statistical analysis of daily satellite wind data, an average of only the sixteen data points comprising a one degree square (seventeen point five degrees south to eighteen point five degrees south and one hundred twenty-one point zero degrees east to one hundred twenty-two point zero degrees east) immediately off Cable Beach was used. The depth in the area of this grid is zero to one hundred eight meters, with three quarters of the area between thirty and one hundred meters deep. Additional wind speed and direction data (daily averages of anemometer and wind vane) along with tide data were obtained from the land-based Broome station of the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, which is within ten kilometers of all our study sites. The land-based wind data are more readily available than satellite data (which have data gaps) but are less relevant to affecting sea conditions in the offshore location of the jellyfish swarms. In addition, the land-based wind data can be influenced by factors such as the daily land/sea breeze cycle, which sometimes occurs. Modelled surface current data were derived from BOM's OceanMAPS model using the analysis phase data. Model data are available on a zero point one degree by zero point one degree grid with fifty-one layers; the surface layer represents the top five meters and does not take into account tides. Daily surface velocities for the region bounded by seventeen point five degrees south to eighteen point five degrees south and one hundred twenty-one point zero degrees east to one hundred twenty-two point zero degrees east were extracted and spatially averaged to produce a daily time series of current velocity and direction relative to north and magnitude in meters per second for twenty-fourth August two thousand twelve to twentieth October two thousand twelve inclusive. Comparisons of swarm occurrence and the Southern Oscillation Index were made using data reported by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\np6pq | Predictors of beach stranding events\nzse6 | In order to test the hypothesis that the incidence of beach strandings was independent of local wind, current and tide conditions we sought to compare the incidence of jellyfish strandings (nineteen out of fifty-eight days) with the prevailing offshore oceanographic and weather conditions. We compared the conditions on days with strandings to conditions on days without strandings for the fifty-eight day period from twenty-fourth August to twentieth\np2n3 | Hydrobiologia\nohh7 | October (three days before the first and three days after the last major stranding) using the chi-squared statistic. As Cable Beach is oriented north-south, we were interested in the influence of onshore (north-west through to south-west) and offshore winds and currents (north-east through to south-east). Thus for wind and current, we used the satellite wind/current direction to determine for each day whether the wind/current was predominantly blowing/flowing from each of the north-west (e.g., two hundred seventy degrees to three hundred sixty degrees), south-west, north-east, or south-east quarters. On days where both a morning (around six a.m.) and an evening (around six p.m.) wind reading was available and they were not the same (onshore versus offshore), we used the wind direction from the observation with the highest wind speed. This only occurred on three occasions and it made no difference to the result of the chi-squared hypothesis testing whether we chose the wind direction with the slowest speed or omitted these three data points altogether. When the satellite did not provide any wind data (twenty-three of fifty-eight days), these days were not included in the analyses. For tides, we compared tidal ranges of less than five or greater than or equal to five meters (approximately half the maximum range of nine point eight two meters observed in this period). To calculate the tidal range, we used the difference between the highest and lowest of the semi-diurnal tides for that day. The reason we chose to do the likelihood test on wind direction and tide as categorical variables, in addition to the more dynamical multivariate approach described below, was to attempt to have an easy-to-use decision tool for lifeguards patrolling what is a popular tourist beach.\nvbni | Logistic regression analysis has previously been used to relate jellyfish presence/absence data to environmental variables. We used a similar approach using the LOGIT module in SYSTAT to determine which predictor variable contributed the best fit to the regression, and which combination of environmental variables best described the relationship between the occurrence of jellyfish strandings and the potential environmental predictor variables of tide range, model current direction and speed, wind speed and wind direction at Broome. We used only environmental variables for which we had data over all the jellyfish sampling dates. For this reason, chlorophyll-a, sea-surface temperature and satellite wind data obtained were not used because of gaps resulting from intermittent cloud cover. A total dataset of fifty-eight days including nineteen days when jellyfish strandings took place\ndgcw | Hydrobiologia",
