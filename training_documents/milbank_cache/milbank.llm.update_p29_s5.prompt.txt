You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

hjzj | At some level, there is little that researchers can do to overcome these forces. Nonetheless, well-designed translational materials and strategies that reflect an understanding of the constraints that policymakers face certainly have a greater chance of carrying the day than do research reports that are physically and cognitively inaccessible to policymak- ers. In addition, building strong relationships with public health law practitioners can help ensure that researchers and their work are re- sponsive to practitioners' needs. When the streams of problem, policy, and politics merge, events often move quickly (Brownson, Chriqui, and Stamatakis 2009). Policy actors thus need answers to specific questions when the time is right for them, not when it serves the needs of funding, peer-reviewed publication, and promotion. As a field, PHLR must be dedicated to both the long-term work that builds a rigorous evidence base for policy and to a practice of "translational service." The lat- ter includes maintaining contact with policy actors, pursuing models of scholarship that can generate answers on a policy-relevant timeline (such as synthesizing existing evidence and applying it to current issues, or conducting simulation studies), and taking time from academic pursuits to serve as consultants (Fielding and Briss 2006; Jacobson, Butterill, and Goering 2005). In the long run, all participants in PHLR-researchers, funders, consumers-have to work to narrow the gap between research that is fundable and research that is needed, and to invest in knowl- edge translation for its own sake. None of this is peculiar to PHLR, but researchers in this emerging field can aspire to be exemplary in their
j79f | efforts, attending to and putting into practice the insights of research on translating evidence into policy.
6tbv | Conclusions
xb13 | Lawyers have long proclaimed the maxim that "the health of the peo- ple is the supreme law," but in practice, making law work for public health is a constant challenge. PHLR's contribution is to provide the evidentiary foundation for these efforts. Through policymaking studies, PHLR can identify forces that shape public health policy and strategies for effecting policy change. Mapping studies can show what has been done and thus what kind of action various government units can take. Through implementation studies, PHLR can provide information about how best to ensure that "law on the books" becomes effective "law on the streets." Through intervention studies, it can determine which legal approaches are most efficacious in improving health environments, be- haviors, and outcomes and can identify harmful legal side effects. Finally, PHLR mechanism studies can tell us why laws have the effects they do, and what mechanisms we can use to improve the effectiveness of legal interventions.
cxqi | Although researchers carrying out this work and collectively advanc- ing this vision face significant challenges, a combination of forces has brought us closer to meeting these challenges than ever before. The interest of research sponsors, the broader trend toward interdisciplinary research, the increasing number of legal scholars trained in social science disciplines, and signals from Washington that policy will increasingly be driven by evidence and expertise are all cause for optimism (Obama 2009).
qfmx | A recent posting on a law professor's blog raised the question of "whether empiricism is a methodology or a philosophy" (Lipshaw 2009). We argue it is both. We urge scholars of public health law to explore and recognize the value of empirical methods. We also hope that scholars and policymakers will adopt the philosophy that evidence derived from rigorous research ought to inform, if not drive, health policy decisions. Through the production of knowledge and conscientious efforts to trans- late research findings for decision makers, PHLR can make the case for laws that improve health.
