        "content": "43ia | Identification of promoter motif and T S S distribution. The recognition and coordinates of the promoter motifs, T A T A box, Initiator, C C A A T box, G C box, are downloaded from the Select/Download Tool of the E P D New database. In order to determine the T S S distribution of mouse embryonic fibroblasts, M E Fs FANTOM five Cap Analysis of gene expression data is retrieved through the CAGEr R package. After normalization and T S S clustering, T S S distribution is defined as sharp if the promoter width is less than fifteen base pairs, this length is taken as the median of all genes, and as broad otherwise.\n3g2y | Identification of enhancer-promoter intensity. The data about the interaction between enhancer and promoter is downloaded. The dataset is used to compare the correlation between burst kinetics and enhancer activity of fibroblasts and M ESCs. Enhancer activity is calculated according to the intensity of the H three K twenty-seven acetylation peak measured in the defined E P Us region, which is considered that enhancer and promoter interactions occur more possibly, via CHIP sequencing in a previous study. In our study, we only utilize the collated data that includes the peak of H three K twenty-seven acetylation in E P Us of M E Fs.\ngc7v | Statistical analysis\nwqfv | Gene expression variability. Gene expression variability is usually quantified by the square of the coefficient of variation, C V squared, which is defined as the ratio of the variance over the square of the mean. According to this definition, we calculate gene-expression variability in a given set of observed data Y for gene G. Similarly, we use the inferred estimate to calculate the theoretical C V squared of our hierarchical model for gene G, that is,\nj30a | C V squared E of open square bracket Y semicolon estimate close square bracket squared Variance open square bracket Y semicolon estimate close square bracket\n7bdk | When fitting C V squared with a cubic spline, we find that there is a strong correlation between the mean expression level and\nojro | C V squared. Many studies have discussed the relationship between gene-expression variability and mean. Note that in the classical telegraph model, the total mRNA variability can be decomposed into two parts: the mRNA internal variability generated from transcription and the promoter variability due to the switching between active and inactive states. Inspired, we adjust the variability by subtracting the inverse of the logarithmic mean, logarithm base two, thus obtaining the residual squared coefficient of variation, rC V squared. For example, for gene G, we have\nl6t9 | rC V squared equals C V squared logarithm base two of mu subscript G minus one\n1ujy | where mu subscript G equals E of open bracket Y semicolon estimate close bracket. As a result, the influence of the mean expression level on the expression variability is basically eliminated after performing a linear regression on rC V squared.\nqzor | Linear regression model in promoter motif analysis. After having obtained the promoter motifs of each gene from the E P D database and its burst kinetics, rC V squared, burst frequency, burst size, by inference, we conduct multivariate linear regression with interaction terms to find the correlations between quantities of interest in cases of positive, negative, and non-feedbacks. Specifically, we perform multivariate linear regression according to\nu1ky | rC V squared is approximately equal to open bracket T A T A multiplied by Initiator plus C C A A T multiplied by G C close bracket times feedback,\nhtm9 | logarithm base ten of burst frequency is approximately equal to open bracket T A T A multiplied by Initiator plus C C A A T multiplied by G C close bracket times feedback, logarithm base ten of burst size is approximately equal to open bracket T A T A multiplied by Initiator plus C C A A T multiplied by G C close bracket times feedback.\n8hul | In Figure four B through D and Supplementary Figure S ten c through e, we show the t-value in the regression results. The absolute of t-value is larger in the test of the linear regression coefficient, indicating that the resulting correlations are significant.\n87vz | RESULTS\nym66 | An integrated statistical framework for learning promoter-dependent yet feedback-constrained transcriptional burst kinetics on a genome-wide scale\nl0a3 | Cell-to-cell heterogeneity in gene expression is primarily attributed to transcriptional bursting, which is represented by a vector y of components including burst frequency, burst size, expression variability, etc. Transcriptional bursts result from complex molecular processes on multilayered sources, which are represented by a vector x of components including static D N A sequences, epigenetic modifications, transcription, translation, dynamic network regulations, etc. Then, the question of how these molecular processes coordinate transcriptional bursting can be mathematically described as y equals f of open bracket x close bracket, where f is a vector function describing the correlation of x to y.\nu8nw | Static promoter architecture is an essential D N A sequence for binding transcription factors during mRNA synthesis. Specifically, promoter motifs, such as initiator, T A T A box, C C A A T box, G C box, broad and sharp T S S\nl2v9 | distributions, and enhancer-promoter interactions are essential features of eukaryotic promoter architecture. Meanwhile, variability in gene expression can propagate from mRNA to protein and further to target genes, possibly through a dynamic and complex gene regulatory network. A common form of dynamic regulation is auto-regulation which directly or indirectly regulates the corresponding target gene itself through a feedback loop, resulting in a repressing or activating expression. For clarity, we let vectors x one and x two represent static promoter architecture and dynamic feedback regulation, respectively. The information on promoter architecture, x one, can be recovered from public bioinformatics databases such as the E P D database, Bioconductor, and U C S C Genome Browser. In general, the mechanisms of dynamic regulation, x two, and burst kinetics, y, are not directly measurable but hidden in data sets. Unlike some imaging-based technologies such as M S two system that were limited to a few genes and could not be extended to the whole genome, single-cell sequencing technologies made it possible to recover the information on dynamic regulations, x two, and burst kinetics, y, from static snapshots. Figure one B through E summarizes the\nafbe | genome-wide inference procedure proposed here. This procedure used a statistical framework of the model-driven and data-driven combination to infer dynamic feedback regulations and transcriptional burst kinetics from static sc R N A sequencing data under the assumption that the abundances of mRNA and protein were highly dependent.\n78r8 | Specifically, our statistical inference framework used a mechanistic model of gene expression, which simultaneously considered transcriptional burst kinetics, y, and feedback regulations, x two, to obtain true gene expression distributions. On the other hand, the known sc R N A sequencing data gave observed gene expression distributions, implying possible errors in the sequencing technologies. A hierarchical statistical model, see Materials and Methods, was proposed to link true gene-expression levels and observed mRNA counts, thus determining key kinetic parameters, expression variability, burst size, burst frequency, and dynamic regulation. We emphasized that the proposed framework was a scalable genome-wide inference, which was particularly useful in revealing how both static promoter architecture and\n320g | dynamic feedback regulation coordinate transcriptional bursting.\ntp8g | A hierarchical model provides the genome-wide inference of transcriptional burst kinetics and feedback regulations from single-cell snapshots",
