You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

uow2 | What is common to all these types of biodiversity-focused arguments - regarding the instrumental value of variety, the intrinsic value of variety and pertaining alternative concepts (harmony, design, otherness, etc.) - is that for them the focus of moral concern shifts from species extinctions towards biological variety or those other concepts. So, like the individualist argu- ments (section "Resulting from harm to nonhuman individuals") extinctions are again not problematised because of the loss of species themselves, but rather due to what this loss means for other valued entities or other matters of moral concern.
iat7 | Future generations
ywwr | A further reason for why species extinctions might be morally problematic concerns our duties to future human generations (see Feinberg, 1974; Sandler, 2021b). In essence, if we believe that the interests of future generations put current generations under an obligation to not frustrate these interests, we have a reason to protect species and biodiversity that future generations might (intrinsically and instrumentally) value and, thereby, avoid 'irre- versible loss' (Spiekermann, 2022). While there might be consider- able uncertainty about what species, ecosystems and/or ecosystem 'services' future generations will actually value and/or need, this ultimately involves again an assessment of different arguments pertaining to the value of species and biodiversity (as seen in sections "Involving loss of value due to the loss of species" and "Leading to the loss of valuable biological variety"). Moreover, considerations about duties towards future generations in terms of species conservation provide a bridge between the ethics of extinction and the ethics of sustainability (see Norton, 2003; Arm- strong, 2021).
0i6j | In addition to these human-focused arguments, we can also consider non-anthropocentric arguments pertaining to the future (building on some of the arguments found in sections "Resulting from harm to nonhuman individuals" and "Resulting from harm to nonhuman individuals"; see also Nolt, 2021; Whyte, 2022). There
87cq | are two main argumentative routes open in this regard. Firstly, one can consider potential duties towards future nonhuman beings or species in so far as the extinction of other species will affect them negatively (and consider cases where species might benefit from the extinction of other species; related to this, see Palmer, 2011 and Cripps, 2013 for reflections about how certain species will benefit from climate change). Like how in intra-human intergenerational ethics a lot of thought has been given to the 'nonidentity problem' (see Norton, 1982; Parfit, 1986), also here we face a nonhuman nonidentity problem (Palmer, 2011), in so far as anthropogenic species extinctions will affect which individuals will come into existence in the future. That is, the extinction of some species will have a knock-on effect on which individuals of still remaining species will meet and mate, which in turn will influence which individuals will live in the future. The underlying philosophical problem is that those future individuals would not have come into existence without the extinction (which, in turn, is relevant for underlying considerations about how the 'harm' of extinction is understood). Secondly, the case of extinctions also leads to a 'non- existence problem' (Wienhues, 2020) in so far as nonhuman indi- viduals, species and ecosystems in the future will not only be affected by prior extinctions, but many nonhuman individuals will simply never come into existence.
0qs3 | Can anthropogenic extinctions ever be justified?
z8f7 | Some readers might assume that all anthropogenic extinctions are morally problematic, but does that judgement hold up in all cases? Consider these two examples from species conservation practice. Firstly, concerning 'local' (as opposed to 'global') extinctions consider restoration-based reasons in favour of the extinction of a population of an 'invasive' species (for critical discussions, see Rawles, 2004; Odenbaugh, 2022; Thresher, 2022). Secondly, other conservation practices such as captive breeding and release pro- grammes have in turn been criticised on the grounds of not allowing for a 'death with dignity' (Chessa, 2005). While in this case the extinction might still seem morally problematic, such programmes might not present an appropriate response. In both cases, it is possible to claim that an extinction can be all-things- considered better than an alternative course of action, for instance, on ecocentric or sentientist argumentative grounds (which both, in turn, can also be engaged to criticise the moral desirability of such extinctions).
7w7j | Also, consider the case of disease-transmitting species such as certain mosquitoes that transmit malaria, dengue fever, zika and so on, which is the most discussed case of potentially justified extinc- tion. The global health burden of these diseases is very high (WHO, 2017; Greisman et al., 2019), which provides a good reason to consider whether the eradication of such disease-transmitting species would be an appropriate means to address this problem (Fang, 2010; Bates, 2016). While it is an empirical question to decide whether this constitutes an approach that is likely to succeed while minimising the risks in comparison with alternatives, this also generates a range of ethical questions to consider, such as regarding the moral standing of individual nonhuman animals, ethical aspects of risk and the intrin- sic and/or instrumental value of species (see Pugh, 2016; Wienhues, 2021; Callies and Rohwer, 2022). A particular emphasis found in the literature on bioethics concerns questions of research ethics, risk and consent regarding genetically engineering species such as mosquitoes in this context (see Resnik, 2014; Emerson et al., 2017; Resnik, 2017; Neuhaus and Caplan, 2017; Patrão Neves and Druml, 2017; Meghani and Boëte, 2018). Notably, even some authors who consider
51vd | anthropogenic extinctions to be highly morally problematic acknow- ledge exceptions for disease-transmitting species such as malaria- transmitting mosquitoes (e.g. Rolston, 2001; Smith, 2016).4 While the use of synthetic biology such as gene drives remains controversial (Preston and Wickson, 2019), the health burden of vector-borne diseases constitutes a weighty reason to take them into consideration.
baj1 | Intended species extinctions are also considered for other - even more controversial - purposes, which include the case of predation raised in animal ethics. While some animal ethicists consider wild animal suffering to be of serious moral concern (Horta, 2017), a few authors go as far as arguing that there are reasons speaking in favour of the extinction of predatory species.5 The benefit hoped for would be the reduction of (non-anthropogenic) suffering in the 'wild' caused by predation (see McMahan, 2010, 2016). Such pro- posals to alleviate 'wild' animal suffering (by a range of means aimed at 'dewilding' or 'redesigning nature', see Duclos, 2022; Kianpour and Paez, 2022) are in turn not shared by other animal and environmental ethicists on more general terms (see Palmer, 2010, 2015; Donaldson and Kymlicka, 2011; Aaltola, 2014; Hettin- ger, 2018), as well as specifically on the question of removing predatory species (Vincelette, 2022). Reasons include the difficul- ties of implementing such proposals and more principled objec- tions towards such interventions into 'nature'.
