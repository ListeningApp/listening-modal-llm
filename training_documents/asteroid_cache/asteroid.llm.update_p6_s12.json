In contrast to Juvinas, both the apatite and merrillite in Stannern yielded identical ages. This may be because the host rock of Stannern was reheated more homogeneously to the uranium-lead reset temperature. According to geochemical studies of the trace incompatible element trends, the geological backgrounds of Stannern and Juvinas should be different, which means that they resided at different locations on Vesta. Their identical reheating ages of approximately four thousand one hundred fifty mega-annum indicate that there were two (or more) impact events on Vesta during this period, where the reheating temperature was high enough to reset the uranium lead system in the phosphates greater than approximately five hundred ninety to one thousand degrees Celsius discussed later but inadequate to reset that of the zircon. Moreover, the two hundred seven lead two hundred six lead age of the Stannern pyroxene and plagioclase also recorded this event at four thousand one hundred twenty-eight plus minus sixteen mega-annum. The Stannern forty argon thirty-nine argon age was disturbed at approximately four thousand two hundred to three thousand eight hundred mega-annum and did not present a plateau age. Conversely, several radiometric chronologies place the early crystallization of Stannern at four thousand five hundred sixty-three mega-annum. Its zircon two hundred seven lead two hundred six lead age recorded early thermal metamorphism at four thousand five hundred fifty plus minus ten mega-annum. Therefore, the metamorphic history of Stannern can be summarized as follows: one, ancient crystallization at four thousand five hundred sixty-three mega-annum, two, thermal crustal metamorphism at four thousand five hundred fifty mega-annum, three, a reset of the uranium lead system in the phosphates and silicates at approximately four thousand one hundred forty mega-annum through intense impact reheating, and four, a subsequent weaker impact at sometime between approximately four thousand five hundred and approximately three thousand six hundred mega-annum, where the potassium argon chronometer was disturbed. Events three and four may indicate the same event.\ns2g2 | heating temperature was high enough to reset the uranium lead system in the phosphates greater than or equal to approximately five hundred ninety to one thousand degrees Celsius discussed later) but inadequate to reset that of the zircon.

Unbrecciated achondrites represent the initial cooling of asteroids\ncb7r | The U-Pb systems in the unbrecciated samples, Agoult and Ibitira, recorded significantly ancient events prior to four point five giga-annum. The model P B two zero seven star over P B two zero six star age of the Agoult apatite, four thousand five hundred twenty-four point eight plus minus nine point six mega-annum, is identical to or slightly younger than the two hundred seven lead two hundred six lead age of its oxide fraction four thousand five hundred thirty-two point three nine plus minus zero point eight seven mega-annum and is significantly younger than that of the zircon four thousand five hundred fifty-four point five plus minus two point zero mega-annum. The age differences between the different minerals may reflect the slow cooling of the Agoult host rock. It is likely that the rock was buried within the crust after its original crystallization and was subsequently heated by the hot interior of Vesta. The original internal heat source, a short-lived radionuclide Aluminum twenty-six with half-life approximately zero point seven mega-annum, had mostly decayed by this time approximately four thousand five hundred fifty-five to four thousand five hundred twenty-five mega-annum. However, according to a thermochemical evolution calculation, the interior of the mantle of Vesta likely maintained a high temperature for greater than one hundred mega-annum after differentiation. The recrystallized textures of Agoult, with no apparent evidence of impact brecciation, further support this hypothesis of crustal thermal metamorphism. The forty argon thirty-nine argon plateau age of the Agoult plagioclase at four thousand four hundred ninety-six plus minus eight mega-annum recorded the end of its subsequent slow cooling. To summarize, Agoult has the following thermal history: one, ancient crystallization at greater than four thousand five hundred sixty mega-annum, two, high-temperature crustal metamorphism at four thousand five hundred fifty-five mega-annum, and three, subsequent monotonic cooling with a low eleven plus minus two degrees Celsius per mega-annum in the deep crust.\n```",
