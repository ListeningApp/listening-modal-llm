WHY POLLINATION IS INTERESTING\nhntf | The flowering plants account for about one in six of all described species on earth and provide the most obvious visual feature of life on this planet. In the terrestrial environment, their interactions with other living organisms are dominant factors in community structure and function; they underpin all nutrient and energy cycles by providing food for a vast range of animal herbivores, and the majority of them use animal pollinators to achieve reproduction. Most of the routine \"work\" of a plant is carried out by roots and leaves, but it is the flowers that take on the crucial role of reproduction.\n99fo | A flower is usually hermaphrodite, with both male and female roles. Hence it is essentially a structure that produces and dispenses the male gametophytes (pollen), organizes the receipt of incoming pollen from another plant onto its own receptive surfaces on the stigma, and then appropriately guides the pollen's genetic material to the female ovules. The flower also protects the delicate male and female tissues (stamens and pistils) and has a role in controlling the balance between inbreeding and outbreeding, hence influencing the genetic structure and ultimately the evolutionary trajectory of the plant. But the plant itself is immobile, so that incoming pollen has to be borne on some motile carrier, sometimes wind or water but much more commonly on a visiting animal. To quote one source, \"among plants, the nuptials cannot be celebrated without the intervention of a third party to act as a marriage priest\"! A pictorial overview of the stages is shown in figure one point one, covering the processes of pollination that are the focus of this book.\nlrry | A flower also serves to protect the pollen as it germinates and as the male nucleus locates the egg and then to protect the ovules as they are fertilized and begin their development into mature seeds. However, these later events (germination of the pollen and fertilization of the ovule) are technically not part of pollination, and they are covered here only as needed to understand the characteristics and effects of pollen transfer.\nhvhm | Since flowers bring about and control plant reproduction, they are central to much of what goes on in the terrestrial world, and pollination is a key mutualism between two kingdoms of organisms, perhaps the most basic type of exchange of sex for food; the plant gains reproductive success, and the animal—usually—gains a food reward as it visits the plant. But the visitor does not \"want\" to be a good pollinator and has to be manipulated by the plant to move on and to carry pollen to another plant. In practice, only about one percent of all pollen successfully reaches a stigma.\n863b | Nevertheless, pollination by animals is both more common and usually more effective than alternative modes of abiotic pollen movements using wind or water, and animal pollination is usually also associated with more rapid speciation of plants. Discussion of animal pollination therefore dominates this book, and around ninety percent of all flowering plants are animal pollinated. Furthermore, plants are, of course, the foundation of all food chains on the planet, and their efficient pollination by animals to generate further generations is vital to ensure food supplies for animals. Natural ecosystems therefore depend on pollinator diversity to maintain overall biodiversity. That dependence naturally extends to humans and their agricultural systems too; about one-third of all the food we eat relies directly on animal pollination of our food crops (and the carnivorous proportion of our diet has some further indirect dependence on animal pollination of forage crops). Pollination and factors that contribute to the maintenance of pollination services are vital components to take into account in terms of the future health of the planet and the food security and sustainability of the human populations it supports.\nuz3c | Beyond its practical significance, the flower-animal mutualism has been a focus of attention for naturalists and ecologists for at least two hundred years and provides almost ideal arenas for understanding some of the fundamental aspects of biology, from evolution and ecology to behavior and reproduction. It is perhaps more amenable than any other area to providing insights into the balance and interaction of ecological and evolutionary effects. Flowers are complex structures, and their complexity admirably reveals the actions, both historical and contemporary, of the selective agents (mainly, but not solely, the pollinators) that we know have shaped them. These factors make floral biology an ideal resource for understanding biological adaptation at all levels, in contrast with many other systems, where there are multiple and often uncertain selective agents.\nba4l | In this first chapter, some of these central themes are introduced to set the scene for more specialist chapters; it should be apparent from the outset that while each chapter might stand alone for some purposes, it cannot be taken in isolation from this whole picture.\nffx8 | One. Which Animals Visit Flowers?\ns6su | At least one hundred thirty thousand species of animal, and probably up to three hundred thousand, are regular flower visitors and potential pollinators. There are at least twenty-five thousand species of bees in this total, all of them obligate flower visitors and often the most important pollinators in a given habitat.\ny219 | There are currently about two hundred sixty thousand species of angiosperms, and it has been traditional to link particular kinds of flowers to particular groups of pollinators. About five hundred genera contain species that are bird pollinated, about\n06ht | two hundred fifty genera contain bat-pollinated species, and about eight hundred seventy-five genera predominantly use abiotic pollination; the remainder contain mostly insect-pollinated species, with a very small number of oddities using other kinds of animals.\nv3r2 | The patterns of animal flower visitors differ regionally. In central Europe, flower visitors over a hundred years ago were recorded as forty-seven percent hymenopterans (mainly bees), twenty-six percent flies, fifteen percent beetles, and ten percent butterflies and moths; only two percent were insects outside these four orders. But in tropical Central America, the frequencies would be very different, with bird and bat pollination entering the picture and fewer fly visitors, while in high-latitude habitats the vertebrate pollinators are absent and flies tend to be more dominant. Some of these patterns will be discussed in chapter twenty-seven.\nnv42 | Two. Why Do Animals Visit Flowers?\nxags | The majority of flower visitors go there simply for food, feeding on sugary nectar and sometimes also on the pollen itself. Chapters seven and eight will therefore deal in detail with these commodities, and chapter nine will cover a few more unusual foodstuffs and rewards that can be gathered from flowers; chapter ten will take an economic view of all these food-related interactions, in terms of costs and benefits to each participant. Major themes in other chapters include the ways that flower feeders can improve their efficiency: learning recognition cues to select between flowers intra- and interspecifically, learning handling procedures, learning to avoid emptied flowers, and avoiding some of the hazards of competing with other visitors.\n```",
