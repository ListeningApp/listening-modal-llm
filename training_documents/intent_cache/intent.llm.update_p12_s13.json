        "content": "mnaf | At the same time, sharing all this information would have taken time out of the therapy session\n0yxe | and would have taken the focus off of Vera and her unique experience of cancer. Therefore, the best responses would have been those described as therapeutic in the preceding paragraphs.\nerre | Nonverbal Cue\n835g | An interpersonal event that took place following Erika's disclosure involved a nonverbal cue. Rather than saying something compassionate or empathetic, Vera was not satisfied with Erika's disclosure and, instead, stared blankly.\nx3l9 | Therapeutic Response\nd2fj | At this point one example of a therapeutic response might have involved asking about the nonverbal cue. Knowing that one of Vera's central interpersonal characteristics involves a high need for control, Erika might have said, \"I am wondering if my responses are not hitting the mark for you? I am wondering if there is anything else I can do to help understand your experience and to show you how I might be able to support your rehabilitation?\" By venturing an interpretation of Vera's blank look and asking a question such as this, Erika would have reasserted her central goal, which was to understand Vera's cancer experience. Additionally, it would have allowed Erika to maintain an appropriate (and, in this case, necessary) leadership role within the therapeutic relationship, limiting the extent to which Vera could continue her excessive questioning.\ngeyi | Suboptimal Response\n2181 | Erika either did not recognize Vera's blank stare as a nonverbal cue or chose not to respond to it. This allowed Vera to continue to challenge Erika's credibility and assume a more dominant position within the interaction. In many cases, it is desirable when our clients take charge within the therapeutic relationship. Participation and independence are among the core values of our profession. However, there are situations in which a client may assert dominance during an interaction in a way that is uncomfortable, condescending, or overly assertive. The interaction between Vera and Erika is one such circumstance.\n9ubl | Power Dilemma\no8pj | Unabated, Vera continues questioning and confronting Erika whenever she feels that she is avoiding a question or does not have the correct answers\n27b9 | about cancer treatment and rehabilitation. Erika tries to avoid openly arguing with Vera, but she now feels as if she is trapped within an uncomfortable interaction. The undercurrent to Vera's behavior is that she is angry and unhappy about the fact that her breast cancer and all the requisite treatments have interrupted her life and functioning. Because she has always felt in control of her own destiny and now feels out of control, Vera is having difficulty not lashing out at others around her.\n09xa | Therapeutic Response\nyi97 | At this point, Erika should attempt to stop the negative dynamic in order to avoid the occurrence of additional interpersonal events and the possible deterioration of a new relationship with her client. To do this, she might say something such as, \"I am getting the feeling that my responses to your questions are not aligning with your experience. I am wondering if there is anything else I can do to help understand your experience and better support your experience here?\"\n4zj7 | Suboptimal Response\n3wgh | Erika thought she was being as kind and empathetic as possible with Vera by actively ignoring her overly assertive questions and provocative comments. Instead, Vera experienced Erika's behaviors as dismissive, and her passivity only stoked Vera's need for control and dominance.\nuvo3 | Empathic Break\nyjbv | Having been pushed to the limits of her patience, Erika communicated an empathic break by introducing a research article touting the virtues of chemotherapy to Vera. She missed or ignored the fact that Vera did not respond and only learned that Vera did not appreciate the therapy session when her supervisor informed her that Vera had requested to work with a different therapist.\nl6it | In summary, Erika missed several opportunities to interrupt the interpersonal event cascade that developed with Vera. Had she learned and practiced the skills and concepts of the IRM, she might have approached the interaction with a greater level of intentionality and a more therapeutic approach to developing an empathetic understanding of her client.\nh8x1 | Interpersonal Skill Base\n6qtq | The therapist's interpersonal skill base comprises a continuum of skills that are judiciously applied by the therapist to build a functional working relationship with the client. The perspective of the model is that, depending on the unique experiences, knowledge, and innate capacities of the therapist, some of these skills come naturally whereas others require significant effort and practice to develop.\nwm3n | These interpersonal skills are summarized in terms of nine categories.\n1anr | Therapeutic communication\n600w | Interviewing skills and strategic questioning\n60w7 | Establishing productive relationships with clients\n1a5g | Working effectively with spouses, partners, families, social systems, and groups\n0oof | Working effectively with supervisors, employers, and other professionals\np930 | Understanding and managing difficult interpersonal behavior\nxhc7 | Resolving empathic breaks and conflicts\n6a60 | Professional behavior, including maintaining appropriate interpersonal boundaries, values, and ethics\ndfgj | Therapist self-care and professional development\n6ptp | The first category, therapeutic communication, involves activities such as verbal and nonverbal communication skills, therapeutic listening, assertiveness, providing clients with direction and feedback, and seeking and responding to client feedback. Interviewing skills comprise another skill set that involves being watchful and intentional about the way in which one approaches the process of asking a client questions. Strategic questioning is a specific approach to questioning born out of cognitive psychology. It involves asking questions in a way that guides the respondent to think more broadly or differently. Establishing relationships with clients includes rapport building, matching your therapeutic style to the interpersonal demands of the client, managing a client's strong emotion, judicious use of touch, understanding the roles of spiritual and religious diversity in occupational therapy, and cultural sensitivity.\nqjlj | Because many clients have spouses or partners, caregivers, family members, or other individuals with whom they have regular contact, understanding and working\nkva7 | Taylor, Renich RfaTheintentiona Relationship Occupational Therapy and Uses of Saltil A.

It includes using the guiding principles of IRM in combination with prominent systems theories to gain the collaboration of partners, parents, other family, and friends to serve the goals of therapy. It also involves understanding the structure, process, and interpersonal dynamics of group therapy.\n108o | Another fundamental skill involves knowing how to work collaboratively with supervisors, employers, and other professionals. It involves knowing how to communicate with other professionals about clients both in the presence and in the absence of those clients. Additionally, it requires understanding the power dynamics and value systems that underlie supervisor and student, as well as employer and employee, relationships. Understanding and managing clients' difficult behavior is another category of necessary interpersonal skills required in many practice situations. It involves knowing how to respond effectively to behaviors that involve manipulation, excessive dependence, symptom focusing, resistance, emotional disengagement, denial, difficulty with rapport and trust, and hostility. Responding effectively helps limit the extent to which this behavior disrupts the goals and processes of therapy.",
