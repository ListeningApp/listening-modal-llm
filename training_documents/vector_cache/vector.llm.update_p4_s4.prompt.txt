You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

xek3 | In general, while the dopamine nerve terminals are destroyed in the striatum/putamen after toxin administration, transport of neurotrophic molecules to the substantia nigra may still be possible retrogradely, as described above, or anterogradely via medium spiny projection neurons, thus demonstrating that striatal injection of AAV carrying neurotrophic factors is a viable therapy for Parkinson's disease. Although, the anterograde transport of GDNF to the substantia nigra may not be as effective on functional restoration as compared with retrograde transport, it may be beneficial not to overexpress proteins in stressed substantia nigra dopamine neurons in patients.
bbpr | 3. AAV to Target Substantia Nigra
5zyf | Taking into consideration the special characteristics of substantia nigra dopaminergic cells (see above), targeting these neurons with AAV vectors can be challenging. For example, if a promoter driving a gene of interest is giving exceptionally high expression levels, this can naturally cause excessive protein accumulation and lead to further stress on the cells [23]. Safe transduction of the dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra is an important aspect in therapeutic approaches, and there have been several studies testing AAV preparations to target substantia nigra dopamine neurons. It has been demonstrated that injection of AAV-GFP to the substantia nigra of rats showed long lasting expression in both the nigral areas (up to 25 months) and striatum (up to 18 months) [57]. Similar results have been obtained in mice, with various vector serotypes able to label the whole substantia nigra, ventral tegmental area, as well as the striatum [58]. In regards to AAV-GFP and dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra, studies in rats have shown that several different vector preparations carrying GFP are able to transduce TH-positive neurons effectively in the substantia nigra as well as in fibres of the striatum [59,60]. Transduction efficiency of AAVs in substantia nigra neurons has also been tested successfully in monkeys, a relevant model when considering the clinical implication of viruses since the size differences between the rodent, primate, and human brain need to be taken into account, particularly concerning spreading. As such, studies have shown that injecting AAV-GFP to the substantia nigra of monkeys results in efficient transduction of the neuronal [61] and dopaminergic cells [62] of the substantia nigra. It is clear that choosing the virus serotype is dependent on the species and the areas or neurons that need to be transduced; therefore, selecting the correct preparation for one's experiment will depend on these factors. It is also evident that it is possible to transduce TH neurons in the substantia nigra with AAVs successfully.
9own | In relation to neurotrophic factors, though they are usually given to the striatum, a study compared striatal and nigral delivery in rats where the AAV-NRTN was given simultaneously with the 6-OHDA lesion. This was performed with an idea that enhancing the survival of the substantia nigra neurons by nigral AAV-NRTN injection may induce greater protection of the connecting striatal fibres. Indeed, the results showed that targeting both the striatum and substantia nigra was the most effective strategy [63]. However, in the case of therapeutic proteins, the overall detrimental effects of overexpression of transgene or RNA can be 'hidden' by the positive effect of the therapy itself. Specifically, using only a non-AAV control may not show the damaging effects. Moreover, caution should be exercised when trying to overexpress any proteins in dopamine neurons, as this can induce stress response pathways affecting their functions and survival, as in [64] and [65]. As a way to overcome the detrimental effect
bqfb | of constitutive protein overexpression or to regulate signalling of neurotrophic factors that are known to be very potent, regulated vectors have been developed. A destabilizing domain that can be regulated with trimethoprim has been effectively used with AAVs carrying GDNF [66]. A single AAV vector for tetracycline-regulated expression with rtTA (reverse tetracycline transactivator) has also been used for GDNF transgene expression in Parkinson's disease models [67]. Mifepristone-controlled vectors have also been shown to restore motor function in the 6-OHDA rat model of Parkinson's disease [47,68]. The mifepristone-regulated vectors are based on binding to a human progesterone receptor, fused to a human p65 transactivation domain and a yeast Gal4 DNA-binding domain. As endogenous neurotrophic factors are biologically active at very low doses, these regulated approaches could be used for neurotrophic factor therapies and may be safer options for targeting substantia nigra dopamine neurons. However, similar to the regulated vectors that express any other foreign protein, there is caution to be considered since there are indications of astrocyte expression-mediated toxicity and a widespread inflammatory response caused by non-self transgenic protein overexpression [69].
