You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

yeoh | 2.5 Task Structure
b8hf | As suggested by the preceding discussion, ChatGPT substantially changes the structure of writing tasks. Figure 3 Panel A shows that prior to the treatment, participants spend about 25% of their time brainstorming, 50% writing a rough draft, and 25% editing. Post-treatment, the share of time spent writing a rough draft falls by more than half and the share of time spent editing more than doubles.
hntf | 2.6 Skill Demand
99fo | If ChatGPT is especially helpful to those with poor writing and communication skills relative to their other skills, it could have major labor market implications by expanding the available occupational choices and raise the earnings of individuals with strong idea-generation skills who struggle to effectively get those ideas onto paper.
y5r7 | We perform several tests of this hypothesis. We construct two measures of a person's relative writing skills. First, at the beginning of the experiment, we ask participants to rank from 1 to 3 their skills at communication (writing and speaking), problem solving, and creativity. Second, in addition to assigning overall grades, evaluators separately assess each piece of output based on writing quality, content quality, and originality; the gap between a person's first-task overall score and their writing score affords another measure.
lrry | Similarly, we construct two measures of the individual-level benefits of ChatGPT. First, at the end of the experiment, we ask treatment-group participants how much they would be willing to pay on a monthly basis to access ChatGPT in their jobs. Second, we measure how much each treatment participant's grade increases from the first to the second task. We find no clear evidence for the aforementioned hypothesis. Figure 3 Panel B show that average willingness to pay for ChatGPT is flat across the terciles of both our measures of writing skill: respondents, regardless of their writing skills, are willing to pay about 0.5% of their monthly salary for a monthly subscription to ChatGPT. Grade gains from ChatGPT are also roughly flat across both measures of relative writing skills: people with comparatively poor writing skills do not experience unusually large grade gains.
hvhm | 2.7 Job Satisfaction and Self-Efficacy
863b | Access to ChatGPT could affect job satisfaction. For example, it could make participants happier by automating tedious or annoying components of the task or allowing them to finish more quickly. Alternatively, it could make the experience less enjoyable by quickly automating the most fun parts of the task. It could similarly either boost self-efficacy by giving participants access to a complex and powerful tool that enhances their capabilities, or it could lower it by making participants feel superfluous. We measure job satisfaction with a question, after each task, about how much participants enjoyed the task, and self-efficacy with a question about how skilled/ effective they felt while completing the task, both on 1-10 Likert scales.
fj24 | 2.8 Beliefs About Automation
uz3c | Many of our treated participants had never heard of (30%) or never used (70%) ChatGPT before participating in the experiment. Hence, most essentially encounter the technology for the first time and receive a crash course on its usefulness for writing tasks. How are their beliefs about future waves of automation affected by this encounter?
d5bi | After respondents complete their second task, we elicit three beliefs, each on a 1-10 scale: how worried they are about workers in their occupation being replaced by AI; how optimistic they are that AI will make workers in their occupation more productive; and, overall, how optimistic or pessimistic they feel about future advances in AI. The effects of treatment on these outcomes are displayed in Figure 4 Panel (c); worry about automation increases by 0.26 standard deviations <LATEX>\left( p = 0 . 0 0 6 \right) ,</LATEX> excitement by 0.39 <LATEX>\left( p = 0 . 0 0 0 \right) ,</LATEX> and net optimism increases by about 0.20
ba4l | <LATEX>\left( p = 0 . 0 3 7 \right) .</LATEX> 9
ffx8 | 2.9 Two-Week Followup Survey
s6su | One indication of the value of ChatGPT to participants is whether they continue to use it after the experiment. To track whether participants are subsequently using ChatGPT in their real jobs, we resurvey them two weeks after their completion of the initial survey. This followup is still in progress, with an 82% response rate among the 423 respondents who have been invited so far, and no evidence of differential response rates by treatment status.
y219 | 33% of former treatment group participants have used ChatGPT in their job in the past week, relative to 18% of control group participants. Restricting to workers who had not previously used ChatGPT when they participated in our main experiment, 26% of treated and 9% of control workers are now using ChatGPT in their jobs (p-value on difference 0.048). Users give it an average usefulness score of 3.65/5.00, somewhat lower than in our main experiment, likely owing to the greater length and complexity of real-world tasks. The range of tasks they report using it for is broad: generating recommendation letters for employees, responding to customer service requests, brainstorming, search-engine requests, rough-drafting emails, and so on.
06ht | Respondents who are not using ChatGPT in their jobs mostly report that this is because the chatbot lacks context-specific knowledge that forms an important part of their writing. For example, they report that their writing is "very specifically tailored to [their] customers and involves real time information" or "unique [and] specific to [their] company products."
v3r2 | These comments point to an important (and inherent) limitation of our experiment: it involves relatively small, self-contained tasks that lack much context-specific knowledge beyond what we stipulate in the task prompts. However, our core result, that ChatGPT can increase productivity on many mid-level professional writing tasks, is supported by the fact that many respondents choose to use it in their real jobs. The fact that the treatment group is substantially more likely to use ChatGPT than the control group also suggests that the dissemination of ChatGPT into real professional activity is still in its very early stages, with many people not using it due to a lack of knowledge about or experience with the technology.
nv42 | There is no difference between the former treatment and control in their overall satisfaction with their job in the followup survey. That said, many of our respondents only started using ChatGPT in their job in the past week or two, and it may take longer for access to ChatGPT to affect overall job satisfaction.
xags | 3 Discussion
jc47 | College-educated professionals performing mid-level professional writing tasks experience substantial increases in productivity when given access to ChatGPT. The generative writing tool increases the output quality of low-ability workers while reducing their time spent, and it
ko3c | allows high-ability workers to maintain their quality standards while becoming significantly faster. At the aggregate level, ChatGPT substantially compresses the productivity distribution, reducing inequality. It is also already being used by many workers in their real jobs. The experimental evidence suggests that ChatGPT largely substitutes for worker effort rather than complementing workers' skills, potentially causing a decrease in demand for workers, with adverse distributional effects as capital owners gain at the expense of workers.
