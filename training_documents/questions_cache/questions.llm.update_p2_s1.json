Vogt, Juanita Brown, and David Isaacs; illustrations by Nancy Margulies\nap6l | THE ART OF POWERFUL QUESTIONS Catalyzing Insight, Innovation, and Action\niest | When was the last time you sat through a meeting and said to yourself, \"This is a complete waste of time!\"? Was it yesterday, or even just a few hours ago? Why did that gathering feel so tedious? Perhaps it's because the leaders posed the wrong questions at the start of the session. Or, worse yet, maybe they didn't ask any engaging questions, and as a result, the meeting consisted of boring reports-outs or other forms of one-way communication that failed to engage people's interest or curiosity.\ncox8 | The usefulness of the knowledge we acquire and the effectiveness of the actions we take depend on the quality of the questions we ask. Questions open the door to dialogue and discovery. They are an invitation to creativity and breakthrough thinking. Questions can lead to movement and action on key issues; by generating creative insights, they can ignite change.\nppqi | Consider the possibility that everything we know today about our world emerged because people were curious. They formulated a question or series of questions about something that sparked their interest or deeply concerned them, which lead them to learn something new. Many Nobel laureates describe the \"Eureka!\" moment of their discovery as when the \"right\" question finally revealed itself-even if it took them considerable time to come up with the final answers. For example, Einstein's theory of relativity resulted from a question that he had wondered about when still a teenager: \"What would the universe look like if I were riding on the end of a light beam at the speed of light?\" Einstein regularly practiced this kind of \"thought experiment,\" which,\noxou | over time, led to significant advances in the field of physics. Many years later, an empirical demonstration showed that light from distant stars actually curved as it passed through the gravitational force of our sun. Einstein's graduate students rushed to him as he was walking through the Princeton campus and exclaimed, \"Dr. Einstein, light really does bend!\" Einstein looked at them quizzically and said, \"Of course!\" He had come to this conclusion through exploring the question in his own thought experiment years before.\n495n | Another Nobel-prize winner, physicist Arno Penzias, when asked what accounted for his success, replied, \"I went for the jugular question.\" Still practicing his questioning discipline today, Penzias recently commented at a Fast Company Conference, \"Change starts with the individual. So the first thing I do each morning is ask myself, 'Why do I strongly believe what I believe?' Constantly examine your own assumptions.\" It's this type of self-questioning that keeps creativity alive.\nawri | In other key examples of the importance of powerful questions, a query by James Watson and Francis Crick, \"What might DNA look like in a three-D form?\" led to the discovery of the double helix and forever altered the scientific landscape. During the Tylenol crisis in the early nineteen eighties, considering the question, \"What is the most ethical action we might take?\" enabled Johnson and Johnson to restore consumer trust and become a leader in corporate responsibility. And asking, \"Where can I get a good hamburger on the road?\" motivated Ray Kroc to create McDonald's, the fast-food chain that became an international icon. Even for ordinary folks, asking a question as simple as, \"What does all this mean?\" or \"What can we do that could help shift this situation?\" or \"What haven't we thought of that could make a difference?\" can have a startling impact on creating new knowledge and insight.\nbl28 | Why Don't We Ask Better Questions?\nd5bz | If asking good questions is so critical, why don't most of us spend more of our time and energy on discovering and framing them? One reason may be that much of Western culture, and North American society in particular, focuses on having the \"right answer\" rather than discovering the \"right question.\" Our educational system focuses more on memorization and rote answers than on the art of seeking new possibilities. We are rarely asked to discover compelling questions, nor are we taught why we should ask such questions in the first place. Quizzes, examinations, and aptitude tests all reinforce the value of correct answers. Is it any wonder that most of us are uncomfortable with not knowing?\nap5o | The aversion in our culture to asking creative questions is linked to an emphasis on finding quick fixes and an attachment to black or white, either or thinking. In addition, the rapid pace of our lives and work doesn't often provide us with opportunities to participate in reflective conversations in which we can explore catalytic questions and innovative possibilities before reaching key decisions. These factors, coupled with a prevailing belief that \"real work\" consists primarily of detailed analysis, immediate decisions, and decisive action, contradict the perspective that effective \"knowledge work\" consists of asking profound questions and hosting wide-ranging strategic conversations on issues of substance.\n7zvf | The reward systems in our organizations further reinforce this dilemma. Leaders believe that they are being paid for fixing problems rather than for fostering breakthrough thinking. Between our deep attachment to the answer-any answer-and our anxiety about not knowing, we have inadvertently thwarted our collective capacity for deep creativity and fresh perspectives. Unfortunately, given the unprecedented challenges we face both in our own organizations and\nmov9 | as a global community, we need these skills now more than ever.\nks7m | Are there organizations that do place a high value on questions? Consider this: In Germany, the job title Direktor Grundsatzfragen translates as \"Director of Fundamental Questions.\" As a German colleague said: \"Yes, there's a job title of Direktor Grundsatzfragen. Some of the larger German companies have an entire department of Grundsatzfragen. These are the people who are always thinking about what the next questions will be. Of course, these people are only in the German companies headquartered in Germany, such as Daimler, Bayer, Siemens, or SAP. If the German company is acquired by a U.S. company, they usually eliminate the Grundsatzfragen positions.\"\nw1w1 | The German understanding and appreciation of Grundsatzfragen may stem from a culture that highly values philosophy and the ongoing questioning of priorities and the meaning of life. Even today, this focus is reflected in some unique aspects of high-school education. In the German Gymnasium, from the ages of fourteen to seventeen, students are typically assigned to study groups with thirty of their peers. In the words of one graduate, \"We work intensely together in every subject, and then in the second year, we meet Goethe (the famous nineteenth-century German philosopher), and we question our entire world for two years. We emerge with a greater appreciation for the power of questions and the power of conversation.\"\nh8gv | As we enter an era in which systemic issues often lie at the root of critical challenges, in which diverse perspectives are required for sustainable solutions, and in which cause-and-effect relationships are not immediately apparent, the capacity to raise penetrating questions that challenge current operating\nkwkp | assumptions will be key to creating positive futures. As Einstein said, \"The problems we have cannot be solved at the same level of thinking that created them.\" And in her book The Art of the Question, Marilee Goldberg adds, \"A paradigm shift occurs when a question is asked inside the current paradigm that can only be answered from outside it.\" It's this kind of paradigm shift, based on powerful questions, that may be necessary to create truly innovative solutions to our most pressing concerns.\nyj0m | What Makes a Question Powerful?
