You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

5zyf | In Liu & Roosta (2022b), it was shown that when MINRES algorithm the returns an NPC step, the line search for <LATEX>\alpha</LATEX> could run in a forward tracking mode (cf. Algorithm 6). In numerical experiments, it was demonstrated that the forward tracking line search was beneficial because it allowed for very large steps to be taken, particularly in flat regions where progress would otherwise be slow. Our theoretical analysis in Appendix B demonstrates that a forward tracking line search can also be used in Algorithm 1 for NPC type steps.
9own | To analyse the global complexity of Algorithm 1, we only require typical assumptions on Lipschitz continuity of the gradient and lower-boundedness of the objective.
bqfb | Assumption 3.1. There exists <LATEX>0 \leq L _ { g } < \infty</LATEX> such that for all <LATEX>x ,</LATEX> <LATEX>\mathrm { y } \in \mathbb{R} _ { + } ^ { d } ,</LATEX> <LATEX>\| \mathrm { g } \left( \mathrm { x } \right) - \mathrm { g } \left( \mathrm { y } \right) \| \leq L _ { g } \| \mathrm { x } - \mathrm { y } \| .</LATEX> Assumption 3.2. We have
wwdt | <LATEX>- \infty < f _ { * } \leq f \left( \mathrm { x } \right) ,</LATEX> <LATEX>\forall \mathrm { x } \in \mathbb{R} _ { + } ^ { d } .</LATEX> With these minimal assumptions we can provide a guarantee of convergence of Algorithm 1 in Theorem 3.3, the proof of which we deferred to Appendix B.
mn1r | Theorem 3.3 (Global Complexity of Algorithm 1). Let <LATEX>\epsilon _ { g } \in \left( 0 , 1 \right)</LATEX> and <LATEX>\varsigma > 0 .</LATEX> Under Assumptions 3.1 and 3.2, if we choose <LATEX>\delta _ { k } = \epsilon _ { k } = \epsilon _ { g } ^ { 1 / 2 }</LATEX> and <LATEX>\bar { \varsigma } = \left( d + 1 \right) \varsigma ,</LATEX> Algorithm 1 produces an <LATEX>\epsilon _ { g } - F O</LATEX> point in at most <LATEX>\mathcal{O} \left( \epsilon _ { g } ^ { - 2 } \right)</LATEX> iterations.
5vqw | Remark 3.4. The "big-O" rate obtained in Theorem 3.3 hides a dependence on the problem constants and algorithm parameters <LATEX>\rho ,</LATEX> <LATEX>\varsigma</LATEX> s, <LATEX>L _ { g } ,</LATEX> <LATEX>\eta ,</LATEX> which are, in particular, independent of d. However, the proof of Theorem 3.3 (and, indeed, The- orem 3.8) implies that the worst case constant hidden by the

75y3 | big-O notation could have an unfortunate dependence on the problem constants (e.g., <LATEX>L _ { g } ^ { 3 } .</LATEX> This could suggest poor prac- tical performance despite the desirable dependence on <LATEX>\epsilon _ { g } .</LATEX> However, as we show numerically in Section 4, such worst case analyses are rarely indicative of typical performance in practice.
s2g2 | 3.3. Global Convergence: Improved Rate
q1q2 | It is possible to modify Algorithm 1 to improve upon the convergence rate of Theorem 3.3, albeit under stronger as- sumptions. This is done in Algorithm 2 where, by appropri- ate use of curvature information, we can obtain an improved complexity rate. Algorithm 2 shares the same inactive/active sets, line search strategies, and projection based feasibility with Algorithm 1.There are, however, some main differ- ences. A key distinction lies in the certification of strictly positive curvature (9) rather than strongly positive curvature, i.e., unlike Algorithm 1 where we set <LATEX>\bar { \varsigma } > 0 ,</LATEX> in Algorithm 2 we set the NPC tolerance to <LATEX>\bar { \varsigma } = 0 .</LATEX> Another notable differ- ence is the introduction of Type II steps. Type II steps set the active portion of the step to zero and occur when the active set optimality conditions (7a) and (7b) are satisfied (other- wise Type I steps, i.e., steps similar to Algorithm 1, are used) but the inactive set tolerance (7c) is unsatisfied. Because the active set termination conditions are satisfied, removing the active portion of the step is not expected to significantly impede the algorithm's progress. By the same token, we can analyse Type II steps using second-order curvature informa- tion, similar to the unconstrained Newton-MR algorithm, without having to account for the curvature related to the pro- jected gradient portion of the step. Additionally, to achieve an improved rate over Algorithm 1, MINRES inexactness tolerance must scale with <LATEX>\epsilon _ { k }</LATEX> in Algorithm 2.
cb7r | For our analysis, we need additional assumptions including the Lipschitz continuity of the Hessian.
68xu | Assumption 3.5. There exists <LATEX>0 \leq L _ { H } < \infty \mathrm { s u c l }</LATEX> that for all x,
hd35 | <LATEX>\mathrm { y } \in \mathbb{R} _ { + } ^ { d } ,</LATEX> <LATEX>\| \mathrm { H } \left( \mathrm { x } \right) - \mathrm { H } \left( \mathrm { y } \right) \| \leq L _ { H } \| \mathrm { x } - \mathrm { y } \| .</LATEX> Additionally, we make some regularity assumptions on the output of the MINRES iterations.
2zpk | Assumption 3.6. There exists a contant <LATEX>\omega > 0 ,</LATEX> independent of x, such that the NPC direction from MINRES, <LATEX>p =</LATEX> <LATEX>\mathrm { r } ^ { \left( t - 1 \right) } ,</LATEX> satifies
epu7 | <LATEX>\| \mathrm { r } ^ { \left( t - 1 \right) } \| \geq \omega \| \mathrm { g } \| .</LATEX> We note that a lower bound for the relative residual is available directly prior to termination. In fact, recall that if an NPC direction is returned, the termination condi- tion (10) must not yet be satisfied. In this case, Assump- tion 3.1 and Lemma A.1 together imply that <LATEX>\| \mathrm { r } ^ { \left( t - 1 \right) } \| \geq</LATEX> <LATEX>\eta \| \mathrm { g } \| / \sqrt { \eta ^ { 2 } + L _ { g } ^ { 2 } } .</LATEX> For Algorithm 1, this lower bound is di- rectly utilised to establish convergence with no requirement for Assumption 3.6. However, for Algorithm 2, n depends on <LATEX>\epsilon _ { k } ,</LATEX> which could lead us to believe that the lower bound
