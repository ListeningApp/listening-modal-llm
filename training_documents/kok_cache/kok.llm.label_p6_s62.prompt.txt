You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

06yq | Microdosing with psychedelics to self-medicate for ADHD symptoms in adults: A naturalistic study

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

lrry | The variable <LATEX>\Phi _ { 2 }</LATEX> as a possible cause for the Kok effect
hvhm | As with previous reports (Yin et al., 2011a, 2014), <LATEX>\Phi</LATEX> decreased with increasing irradiances in all three sets of measurements (Fig. S1). Compared with the <LATEX>A</LATEX> vs <LATEX>I _ { \mathrm { a l } }</LATEX> plots, the <LATEX>A</LATEX> vs <LATEX>I _ { \mathrm { a b s } }</LATEX> P2 plots had a similar shape (thus, they are not shown), but the obtained <LATEX>B _ { 1 } : B _ { 2 }</LATEX> ratios were slightly lower than the <LATEX>b _ { 1 } : b _ { 2 }</LATEX> ratios (Table 2). As expected, the regression of <LATEX>A</LATEX> against <LATEX>I _ { \mathrm { a b s } }</LATEX> P2 yielded consis- tently lower intercepts, and therefore higher estimates, <LATEX>R _ { \mathrm { D 1 } }</LATEX> and <LATEX>R _ { \mathrm { D 2 } } ,</LATEX> compared with <LATEX>r _ { d 1 }</LATEX> and <LATEX>r _ { \mathrm { d 2 } } ,</LATEX> respectively, confirming the results of earlier studies (Yin et al., 2011a). For the same reason, the <LATEX>R _ { \mathrm { D 1 } } : R _ { \mathrm { D 2 } }</LATEX> ratios were smaller than the <LATEX>r _ { \mathrm { d 1 } } : r _ { \mathrm { d 2 } }</LATEX> ratios (Table 3). There were no consistent trends for absolute values of <LATEX>r _ { \mathrm { d 1 } } ,</LATEX> <LATEX>r _ { \mathrm { d 2 } } ,</LATEX> <LATEX>R _ { \mathrm { D 1 } }</LATEX> and <LATEX>R _ { \mathrm { D 2 } }</LATEX> with changing O2 or <LATEX>C O _ { 2 }</LATEX> concentrations; but unsurprisingly they increased consistently with increasing temperature (Table 3).
863b | Association of the Kok effect with the variable
fj24 | <LATEX>\Gamma ^ { * } / \mathrm { C } _ { \mathrm { c } }</LATEX> We estimated parameter values of the aforementioned three <LATEX>g _ { \mathrm { m } }</LATEX> modes. The estimate of the <LATEX>m</LATEX> factor for mode iii was 0, which means that modes ii and iii had identical results. To test whether a nonzero <LATEX>m</LATEX> factor influenced the calculated <LATEX>C _ { c } ,</LATEX> we fixed <LATEX>m</LATEX> to 0.3, our recent estimate of this parameter (Yin et al., 2020). The three <LATEX>g _ { \mathrm { n } }</LATEX> modes yielded the same goodness of fit with <LATEX>R ^ { 2 }</LATEX> of 0.966 (Table S2). The modelled <LATEX>A</LATEX> by the three modes did not differ essentially (Fig. S2a). Using the modelled <LATEX>A ,</LATEX> we calculated the <LATEX>\Gamma ^ { * } / C _ { c } .</LATEX> ratio across irradiance of all the three sets of measurements. The <LATEX>\Gamma ^ { * } / C _ { \mathrm { c } }</LATEX> ratios calculated by mode ii or iii at first very low irra- diances were more variable than those given by mode i (results not shown), but the average <LATEX>\Gamma ^ { * } / C _ { c }</LATEX> ratio along a given <LATEX>A - I _ { \mathrm { i n c } }</LATEX> curve did not differ much between the three modes (Fig. S2b). We also used the variable <LATEX>J</LATEX> method of Harley et al (1992) to inspect any variation of <LATEX>g _ { \mathrm { m } }</LATEX> and found no evidence <LATEX>g _ { m }</LATEX> with either <LATEX>C _ { i }</LATEX> or with <LATEX>I _ { \mathrm { i n c } }</LATEX> or with <LATEX>O _ { 2 } .</LATEX> In the following analysis, we show the results based on the estimate using mode i, as they did not differ much from those using mode ii or iii.
uz3c | The obtained average <LATEX>\Gamma ^ { * } / C _ { c }</LATEX> ratio varied from 0.008 to 0.195 when <LATEX>O _ { 2 }</LATEX> varied from 2% to 50%, from 0.322 to 0.049 when CO2 varied from 100 to 700 umol <LATEX>\mathrm { m o l } ^ { - 1 } ,</LATEX> and from 0.066 to 0.110 when temperature varied from 15 to 35℃. Plotting the <LATEX>b _ { 1 } : b _ { 2 }</LATEX> ratio or the <LATEX>B _ { 1 } : B _ { 2 }</LATEX> ratio against the <LATEX>\Gamma ^ { * } / C _ { \mathrm { c } }</LATEX> ratio showed lin- ear relationships, and because these linear relations did not differ significantly among the three sets of measurements, the common regression line was obtained, and the intercept of the line at the zero <LATEX>\Gamma ^ { * } / C _ { \mathrm { c } }</LATEX> ratio was close to 1 (Fig. 5a).

ba4l | <LATEX>\Gamma ^ { * } / \mathrm { C } _ { \mathrm { c } }</LATEX> The strong correlation of the <LATEX>b _ { 1 } : b _ { 2 }</LATEX> or <LATEX>B _ { 1 } : B _ { 2 }</LATEX> ratio with the <LATEX>\Gamma ^ { * } /</LATEX> <LATEX>C _ { \mathrm { c } }</LATEX> ratio (with <LATEX>R ^ { 2 } > 0 . 8 0</LATEX> Fig. 5a) does not mean that the varying <LATEX>\Gamma ^ { * } / C _ { c }</LATEX> ratio can explain more than 80% of the Kok effect because other factors (such as <LATEX>R _ { \mathrm { d } }</LATEX> and <LATEX>f _ { \mathrm { a c v } }</LATEX> may vary with <LATEX>\Gamma ^ { * } / C _ { c }</LATEX> as well. However, the relative difference in the slope value between the <LATEX>b _ { 1 } : b _ { 2 }</LATEX> vs the <LATEX>\Gamma ^ { * } / C _ { _ { \mathrm { C } } } \mathrm { p l o t }</LATEX> (2.559, Fig. 5a) and the <LATEX>B _ { 1 } : B _ { 2 }</LATEX> vs the

nv42 | Cc plot (2.262; Fig. 5a) should quantify the contribution of the decreasing <LATEX>\Phi _ { 2 }</LATEX> in explaining the Kok effect. This relative differ- ence was <LATEX>\left( 2 . 5 5 9 - 2 . 2 2 6 \right) / 2 . 5 5 9 \times 1 0 0 \% = 1 1 . 6 \% ,</LATEX> suggesting that, overall, the varying P2 explained c. 12% of the Kok effect across varying <LATEX>O _ { 2 }</LATEX> and <LATEX>C O _ { 2 }</LATEX> concentrations and varying tempera- tures.
xags | We plotted the modelled <LATEX>A</LATEX> against <LATEX>I _ { \mathrm { a b s } }</LATEX> to generate slope values of <LATEX>b 1</LATEX> and 62, and thereby the modelled <LATEX>b _ { 1 } : b _ { 2 }</LATEX> ratios. The mod- elled <LATEX>b _ { 1 } : b _ { 2 }</LATEX> ratios did increase with the <LATEX>\Gamma ^ { * } / C _ { c }</LATEX> ratio (Fig. 5b), in line with the statement of Farquhar & Busch (2017) that the changing <LATEX>\Gamma ^ { * } / C _ { c }</LATEX> ratio explains much of the observed Kok effect.
