You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

xagm | Further reaction capabilities have been studied using a series of structurally and functionally diverse azides 8b-i with variedly substituted 1-iodobutadiynes <LATEX>7 a , g - j</LATEX> (Scheme 4).
iwn5 | Benzyl azides with donor <LATEX>8 b , c</LATEX> and acceptor groups 8f, alkyl azides <LATEX>8 d _ { \mathrm { j g j } }</LATEX> including azides with FG 8d,g, p-methoxypheny-
uooz | lazide 8h, and nitrotosylazide 8e were investigated in CuAAC with different iododiacetylenes. In all cases except nitro- tosylazide 8e, the reaction afforded 4-ethynyl-5-iodotriazoles from moderate to high yields. In the case of nitrotosylazide 8e, only starting materials were detected in the reaction mixture after 48 h even though 5 mol % catalyst was used. Synthesis employing either OH-substituted alkylazide 8g or iodobuta- diynes 7g,j required a higher catalyst loading (2-5 mol %). The scope of the reaction was also expanded to arylazide 8h, which required 5 mol % CuI(PPh3)3 for the full conversion giving 1-aryl-substituted triazole 9o.
pxbq | On the next step, we evaluated a synthetic application of 4- ethynyl-5-iodotriazoles. Two types of reactions involving an iodine atom, which lead to 1,4,5-trisubstituted triazoles were explored, the Sonogashira-Hagihara87,88 and the Suzuki- Miyaura® couplings.
jfsr | It is important that both types of products, triazole-fused enediynes and 5-aryl-4-ethynyltriazoles, are of special im- portance because of possible further intramolecular cyclizations known for other types of benzene(heteroarene)-fused enediynes-95 and ortho-ethynylaryl-substituted arenes,96-100 leading to highly conjugated polyaromatic compounds. Among such systems, polycyclic fused 1,2,3-triazoles are of particular interest.101-103
u15r | We started with the synthesis of enediynes. Remarkably, a triple bond has been introduced into position 5 of a triazole ring mostly using the Sonogashira coupling, 101,104-106 yet several examples for the synthesis of 4-aryl-5-ethynyl-1,2,3- triazole using one-pot CuAAC/ethynylation have also been reported.107-113

ex5k | °C104 and Pd(PPh3)4/Cul/Et3N/toluene, 80 ℃1) were initially employed for coupling of iodotriazole 9b with 4-MeO- phenylacetylene 12a and 2-methylbuta-3-yn-2-ol 12b, respec- tively. Surprisingly, the reaction with alkynol 12b proceeded with a partial deiodination of iodotriazole 9b. A mixture of the desired enediyne 13b along with reduced 4-ethynyltriazole and a significant amount of the alkyne homocoupling byproduct was obtained. The reaction with 4-MeO-phenylacetylene 12a reached only ~60% conversion of starting iodide to enediyne.14 Switching to other conditions useful for the Sonogashira coupling in the synthesis of enediynes fused to hererocycles115- 115-117 gave either a poor conversion or mixture of target enediynes with the deiodinated starting triazole.114 Taking into account electron-withdrawing properties of a triple

cjq2 | bond neighbor to iodine, we analyzed examples of the Sonogashira reaction for 5-iodotriazoles bearing an EWG at the C4 position reported earlier. The literature search revealed that low conversion and reductive deiodination are common problems for the Sonogashira coupling of 5-iodo-1,2,3- triazolecarboxylates, - 118 carboxamides, 119,120 nitriles, 121 and even 5-iodo-4-phenyl-triazoles.122 It is particularly remarkable that for 5-iodotriazoles with an EWG at N1 the Sonogashira reaction proceeded smoothly,123 while for triazole with bulky EDG (ferrocenyl) the yields also were low. 24 The best and the simplest solution was found by David Goyard et al., who carried out both the Sonogashira and the Suzuki coupling using K3PO4 as a base and Pd(PPh3)4 as a catalyst in THF.122

byu8 | These conditions also worked perfectly for the cross- coupling of 4-ethynyl-5-iodotriazoles with acetylenes, provid- ing unsymmetrically substituted enediynes <LATEX>1 3 a - g</LATEX> fused to 1,2,3-triazole ring in high yields (Scheme 5). These conditions proved to be FG tolerant, which allowed OH functions and substituted amino groups to be introduced into an enediyne system. Unsymmetrically substituted enediynes <LATEX>\mathrm { c h } \text { as } 1 3 e - g</LATEX> are of crucial importance because they could be used as starting compounds for the synthesis of macrocyclic triazole- fused enediynes by the Nicholas-type macrocyclization.116,125
76b0 | The Suzuki coupling of N-benzyliodotriazoles <LATEX>9 c , d , m</LATEX> proceeded in high yields also using <LATEX>\mathrm { P d } \left( \mathrm { P P h } _ { 3 } \right) _ { 4 }</LATEX> as a catalyst and K3PO4 as a base providing 5-aryl-4-ethynyltriazoles 15a-c in moderate to good yields (Scheme 6). In contrast with <LATEX>N -</LATEX> benzyl-substituted 5-iodotriazoles, the reaction of N-(4- methoxyphenyl) triazole 9o gave the coupling product 15d in a low yield because of a formation of an unidentified byproduct complex mixture. The possible reason for this exception could be a relatively easy 5-iodotriazole ring opening promoted by both N-aryl group and EWG (4-(chlorophenyl)- ethynyl) at <LATEX>C - 4</LATEX> of the triazole ring. Thus, the palladium- catalyzed denitrogenative indolization of N-aroylbenzotriazoles with internal alkynes has been reported previously.126
zxz6 | Additional synthetic utility of enediyne 13d bearing ethynyl and <LATEX>\mathrm { M e } _ { 2 } \mathrm { N }</LATEX> groups at the ortho-position of a benzene ring was illustrated by electrophile-induced cyclization 27 that led to 2- triazolyl-3-iodoindole 16 (Scheme 7).

vafm | <LATEX>1 6 \left( 7 4 \right)</LATEX> In summary an efficient and convenient one-step approach toward 1-substituted 4-ethynyl-5-iodo-1,2,3-triazoles was developed based on CuAAC of 1-iodobutadiynes with organic azides using a <LATEX>C u I \left( P P h _ { 3 } \right) _ { 3 } / 2 , 6</LATEX> catalytic system. The reaction is tolerant to various functional groups and allows alkyl, aryl, hydroxyalkyl, ethoxycarbonyl, and dialkylamino functional groups to be introduced into different positions of target triazoles. 4-Ethynyl-5-iodo-1,2,3-triazoles were demon- strated to be useful building blocks for the synthesis of triazole- fused enediyne systems and 5-aryl-4-ethynyltriazoles, which are of great interest because of their further synthetic utility.

colo | Evaporation of solvents and concentration of reaction mixtures were performed in vacuo at 35 ℃ on a rotary evaporator. Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) was carried out on silica gel plates (Silica gel 60, UV 254) with detection by UV or staining with a basic aqueous solution of KMnO4. Melting points (mp) determined are uncorrected. 1H and 13C{1H} NMR spectra were recorded at 400 and 100 MHz, respectively, at 25 ℃ in CDCl3 without the internal standard. The 1H NMR data are reported as chemical shifts (8), multiplicity (s, singlet; d, doublet; t, triplet; q, quartet; m, multiplet; br, broad), coupling constants (J, given in Hz), and number of protons. The 13C NMR data are reported as the chemical shifts (S) and type of carbon (p, primary; s, secondary; <LATEX>t ,</LATEX> tertiary; q, quaternary) determined from DEPT experiments with coupling constant <LATEX>J _ { \mathrm { C - F } }</LATEX> for F-containing compounds. Chemical shifts for 1H and 13C are reported as <LATEX>\delta</LATEX> values (ppm) and referenced to a residual solvent <LATEX>\left( \delta = 7 . 2 6 \mathrm { p p m } \right.</LATEX> for 1H; <LATEX>\delta =</LATEX> 77.16 ppm for 13C). High-resolution mass spectra (HRMS) were determined using electrospray ionization (ESI) in the mode of positive ion registration with a TOF mass analyzer. High-resolution mass spectra of compound 7e (methanol solution) were recorded on a Bruker maXis Q-TOF instrument equipped with an atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI-MS) ion source in positive ion mode. IR spectra were recorded for tablets with KBr. The single- crystal X-ray diffraction studies were carried out on a diffractometer at 100 K using Cu Ka radiation (1 = 1.54180 Å). Using Olex 2, 37 137 the structure was solved with the Super flip structure solution program138 using Charge Flipping and refined with the ShelXL refinement package using least-squares minimization.
