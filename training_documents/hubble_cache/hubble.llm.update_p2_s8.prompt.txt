You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

cop0 | In this paper, we show that the power-law cosmology essentially depends on the parameters <LATEX>q</LATEX> and <LATEX>H _ { \mathrm { C } } .</LATEX> We intend to find the observational constraints on the power-law cos- mology parameters using the recent observational data from <LATEX>H \left( z \right)</LATEX> and supernova observations. We also intend to test the power-law cosmology with primordial nucleosynthesis. The paper is organized as follows: The basic equations of power- law cosmology are introduced in Section 2. Section 3 deals with the constraints on the parameters <LATEX>q</LATEX> and <LATEX>H _ { 0 }</LATEX> from the latest <LATEX>H \left( z \right)</LATEX> data while Section 4 is devoted to find the con- straints using Union2 compilation of 557 SNe Ia data points. In Section 5, we perform the joint test using <LATEX>H \left( z \right)</LATEX> and SNe Ia data. Section 6 deals with the constraints on power-law cosmology from primordial nucleosynthesis while Section 7 is devoted to study the statefinders in power-law cosmology. In the last Section, we summarize the main results of the paper.
lhkq | 2 BASIC EQUATIONS IN POWER-LAW COSMOLOGY
82ju | We study a general class of power-law cosmology described by the dimensionless scale factor
y2qo | <LATEX>a \left( t \right) = a _ { 0 } \left( \frac { t } { t _ { 0 } } \right) ^ { \alpha } ,</LATEX> (1)
1piq | where to is present age of the universe, <LATEX>a _ { 0 }</LATEX> is the value of a today and <LATEX>\alpha</LATEX> is a dimensionless positive parameter. Here- after, the subscript 0 denotes the present-day value of the parameter under consideration.
7fqw | The deceleration parameter q, which characterizes ac- celerating <LATEX>\left( q < 0 \right)</LATEX> or decelerating <LATEX>\left( q > 0 \right)</LATEX> nature of the Universe, reads as
rhaz | <LATEX>q = - \frac { a \ddot { a } } { \dot { a } ^ { 2 } } = \frac { 1 } { \alpha } - 1</LATEX> (2)
wak1 | <LATEX>q > - 1 .</LATEX> The cosmic scale factor in terms of the deceleration pa- rameter may be written as
wtfz | Constraints on power-law cosmology
qy1i | <LATEX>a \left( t \right) = a _ { 0 } \left( \frac { t } { t _ { 0 } } \right) ^ { 1 / \left( 1 + q \right) } .</LATEX> (3)
1k9e | We observe that <LATEX>q > - 1</LATEX> is the condition for expanding Universe in the power-law cosmological model.
5bjs | the Hubble parameter, <LATEX>H \left( t \right) = \frac { \dot { a } } { a } = \left( \frac { 1 } { 1 + q } \right) \frac { 1 } { t } ,</LATEX> while the present expansion rate of the Universe is given by The scale factor <LATEX>a</LATEX> and the redshift <LATEX>z</LATEX> are connected through the relation <LATEX>a = a _ { 0 } \left( 1 + z \right) ^ { - 1 } .</LATEX> Therefore, the Hubble parameter in terms of the redshift may be expressed as (5)
uodj | The expansion history of the Universe is described by
k16v | (4)
b2lm | <LATEX>H _ { 0 } = \frac { 1 } { \left( 1 + q \right) t _ { 0 } }</LATEX> 1
ti7f | This shows that the expansion history of the Universe in power-law cosmology depends on the parameters <LATEX>H _ { 0 }</LATEX> and
oksu | It may be noted that the above model is well motivated in the literature as mentioned in the previous section. How- ever the focus has been on one parameter namely <LATEX>\alpha</LATEX> (or <LATEX>\left. q \right) .</LATEX> But here we find the observational constraints on both pa- rameters <LATEX>H _ { 0 }</LATEX> and q by subjecting the power-law cosmological model to the latest data from <LATEX>H \left( z \right)</LATEX> and SNe Ia observations. We also constrain <LATEX>H _ { 0 }</LATEX> and <LATEX>q</LATEX> using primordial nucleosynthesis scenario.
wtow | 3 CONSTRAINTS FROM OBSERVATIONAL <LATEX>H \left( Z \right)</LATEX> DATA
o22k | Simon, Verde & Jimenez (2005) determined nine <LATEX>H \left( z \right)</LATEX> data points in the range <LATEX>0 \leqslant z \leqslant 1 . 8</LATEX> by using the differential ages of passively evolving galaxies determined from the Gemini Deep Deep Survey and archival data. Recently, <LATEX>H \left( z \right)</LATEX> data at 11 different redshifts based on the differential ages of red- envelope galaxies were reported by Stern et al. (2010) while 3 more <LATEX>H \left( z \right)</LATEX> data points were obtained by Gaztanaga, Cabre & Hui (2009). The newly <LATEX>H \left( z \right)</LATEX> data points have been used to constrain parameters of various cosmological models (Yang & Zhang 2010; Cao, Zhu & Liang 2011; Chen & Ratra 2011; Paul, Thakur & Ghose 2010, 2011). Here, we use 13 obser- vational <LATEX>H \left( z \right)</LATEX> data points given in Table 1 of the paper by Chen & Ratra (2011) and <LATEX>t h e \quad o n e \quad a t \quad z = 0</LATEX> estimated in the work by Riess et al. (2011). For this sake, we define the <LATEX>\chi ^ { 2 }</LATEX> as
