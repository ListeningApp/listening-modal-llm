        "content": "8hul | The map of the \"United States\" by Samuel Lewis from Carey's General Atlas illustrates the way in which the image of the nation graphically subsumed images of the states. Lewis's national map was the twenty-fourth of forty-eight maps and served as the preface to the subsequent set of seventeen maps of the states and Maine. Located as the atlas's middle and turning point, this map separated international maps from those delineating the new nation-state. Designed for pedagogic uses (it was intended to supplement William Guthrie's schoolbook, A New System of Modern Geography), the Lewis map creates the nation as a self-contained entity. Lewis limits his workmanship to meticulously inscribing the graphic space of the United States; he leaves virtually uninscribed the surrounding spaces (thus making it difficult for the inexperienced map reader to tell land from water). With the name of the United States being visibly absent from the actual map image (it appears in the map margin inside an unembellished cartouche), Lewis downplays the alphabetic element used for hailing national identities in cartographic writing. Instead, he emphasizes the map's geographical aspect. Using the border line and topographic symbols, Lewis limns the nation in almost corporeal\n87vz | terms. Similar to images describing the human anatomy in contemporary magazines and handbooks, the thickly shaded lines tracing the coastal and national boundaries in the east, north, and south resemble the epidermal layer visually protecting the land against the encroachment of oceans and neighboring territories. At the same time, the double-lined course of the Mississippi River invokes not only the nation's western border but also the anatomical imagery of a skeleton's spine or a body's vascular system. The constitutive parts of the national body, the states, recede inside the image of the nation-state. Their thinly drafted boundary lines collapse inside the map's corporealized gestalt of the nation's territory.\nym66 | When considering the political conflict between the Federalist ideology and sectionalist interest groups that raged during the first two decades of independent nationhood, the rhetorical effect of the atlases' national maps by and large supported the Federalist cause. Each atlas promoted a cartographic system of checks and balances. While the national map was often afforded additional space in the form of foldouts, none of the state maps published in the early atlases were allowed to dominate optically. Each state map was cut to a uniform size, projecting the idea of equal\nl0a3 | representation under one nation. When viewed in the context of the atlas maps' overt emphasis on boundary lines and visual unity, the national map functioned as the archival container and frame of reference for the smaller state maps. By virtue of its cartographic design the national map adumbrated the Federalist notion that there is \"unity in diversity,\" a unity that is predicated on a national cartographic network that assumes authority over its local constitutive parts.\nu8nw | What is significant, however, is that, at the same time as the first United States atlas maps seemed to provide a material palimpsest upon which readers could trace out nationalistic fantasies of interstate unity, it was precisely the unique material context of the atlas that deanatomized the nation's cartographic image. Early American atlas maps conceptualized the individual states not as dismembered parts of a larger corporate body but as miniature copies imitating the symbolic form of a larger nation-state. For example, in Carey's American Pocket Atlas the map of South Carolina, also drawn by Samuel Lewis, appeared not only as a self-contained unit but was drawn to look like a geographically separate nation-state unrelated to either the United States or the North American continent. Its graphic presentation creates the geographical illusion that the state hinged between two oceans rather than between the states of North Carolina and Georgia. The impression that each state could be a separate nation was further enhanced by the use of map scale. States were depicted, not in relative proportion to their geographical size, but in maximal proportion to the textual space they were to fill on the\nl2v9 | page. The maps of Delaware and Rhode Island covered as much paper space as did the maps of Maine and Pennsylvania. Optically, then, the state maps repeated the same cartographic designs that initially had been reserved for the national map. Like the national map, the state map turned on a binary structure of territorial representation, privileging the state's visual outline over its verbal identification, its geographical over its political anatomy, its interior over its exterior relations.\nafbe | United States atlas maps here seem to confirm the Federalist and Anti-federalist fear that even those writing systems that ceased to subordinate the reading experience to an exclusively alphabetical order were still incapable of representing the idea of a new nation-state in immediate and unambiguous terms. While the image of the national map seemed to uphold the constitutional principle of checks and balances (maps represented states optically in equal terms), the state map appeared to undercut the Federalist ideal of national unity by projecting the thirteen (or more) states as separate nations and unrelated to the larger union. The pictorial rhetoric of the national map failed to offer a design that established a hierarchical relationship between the union and state. Unable to give precedence to either unit, the medium of the map potentially undercuts its symbolic power by signifying opposite values: even as its visual rhetoric could serve as a tool of national integration, it also could promote the union's disintegration.",
