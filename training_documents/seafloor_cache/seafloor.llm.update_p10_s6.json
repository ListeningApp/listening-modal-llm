        "content": "wp2c | Five samples consisting of hydrothermally altered and sulfate-cemented volcaniclastic material were selected from drill hole TKAD zero zero one for fluid inclusion studies. Doubly polished thick sections (approximately one hundred thirty micrometers) were prepared at Dettmar Dissection Technology using a water-free technique. Fluid inclusion petrography in barite, anhydrite, and sphalerite is described in detail in Anders two thousand sixteen. Microthermometric measurements were made on a Linkam™M THMS six hundred heating and freezing stage at GEOMAR. Salinities were calculated from freezing-point depression values following Bodnar and Vityk nineteen ninety-four. Homogenization temperatures were corrected for pressure at the sample depth (one thousand one hundred seven point six one meters below sea level; one hundred eight point six five bar) following Zhang and Frantz nineteen eighty-seven. Accuracy was determined by measuring phase transitions in synthetic fluid inclusions (Syn Flinc®); replicate measurements of homogenization and freezing-point depression temperatures were performed every five to ten analyses, resulting in estimated errors of less than ±zero point two degrees Celsius for salinity measurements and ±four degrees Celsius for homogenization temperature measurements. The critical points, bulk molar volumes, densities, and isochores were calculated using the program FLINCOR (Brown, nineteen eighty-nine).\n\nus5v | Oxygen and hydrogen isotope analyses were performed on fourteen samples of monomineralic clays (less than two micrometers), free from iron and manganese oxides as determined by XRD. The analyses were carried out by the Queen's Facility for Isotope Research (Queen's University, Ontario, Canada). Oxygen was extracted from\n\nrs2m | five-milligram samples at five hundred fifty to six hundred degrees Celsius using the BrFfive technique of Clayton and Mayeda nineteen sixty-three. Samples were analyzed via dual inlet on a Thermo-Finnigan DeltaPlus XP isotope ratio mass spectrometer. For hydrogen isotope measurements, samples were weighed into silver capsules, degassed for one hour at one hundred degrees Celsius, and then crushed and loaded into a zero blank autosampler. Hydrogen isotope compositions were measured using a Finnigan thermos-combustion elemental analyzer coupled to a Thermo-Finnigan DeltaPlus XP continuous-flow IRMS. All values are expressed in the conventional delta notation as per mil deviation from V-S-M-O-W (Vienna-Standard Mean Ocean Water), with analytical precision and accuracy for delta eighteen O values of ±zero point one per mil and for delta D of ±three per mil and ±one point five per mil, respectively.",
