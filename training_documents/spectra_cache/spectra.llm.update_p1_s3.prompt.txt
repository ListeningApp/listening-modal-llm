You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

tb74 | Spectra of Water Sonoluminescence
8l69 | The sonoluminescence spectra of water saturated with helium, argon, krypton, and xenon gases were studied in a 220-500 nm interval. Total light power of sonoluminescence and the yield of hydrogen peroxide increased in the order He < Ar < Kr < Xe. The peak position of the OH* radical at 310 nm did not depend on the dissolved gas, but in the region 2 < 310 nm the light emission had maxima at 262, 268, 250, and 242 nm for He, Ar, Kr, and Xe, respectively. The intensity of this part of the spectra increased in the same order. The results show that sonoluminescence is a kind of luminescence, and the source of sonoluminescence is not blackbody radiation or electrical discharge.
1jyv | Introduction
olce | Acoustic cavitation in liquids is accompanied by a number of effects, one of which is the light emission-sonoluminescence (SL). This peculiar phenomenon has been the subject of many experimental and theoretical investigations over the past few decades (see reviews in refs 1-4), but it still remains to be poorly understood.
erx1 | A few hypotheses have been proposed on the mechanism of sonoluminesce and sonochemical reactions. All of the them are based on the formation, growth, and implosive collapse of cavitation bubbles as the source of the phenomenon. Noltingk and Neppiras5 proposed that SL arises from blackbody emission of the adiabatic collapsed cavity. Recently, Hiller et al.,6 studying the spectra of water SL from a single nonlinearly pulsating cavitation bubble, suggested sonoluminescence to be blackbody radiation with temperature of heated bubble content of 25 000 K. Atchley et al.7 found that the temperature inside a collapsed cavity can exceed 16 200 K.
b3bt | An electrical discharge inside or outside the bubble has been proposed several times for the explanation of SL8 (see also reviews1-4).
0w8m | Some researchers believed that the generation of a shock wave inside the collapsing bubble is the source of sonoluminescence,9 and recently it was found experimentally that SL arises when the speed of a bubble compression exceeds the speed of sound in the gas.10 However, the results of Atchley et al.7a,11 show that it is not necessary, and a speed of 130 m/s is enough to produce SL from a single nonlinearly pulsating cavitation bubble.
vcu3 | A hot-spot chemiluminescence model12 is based on the opinion that the emission arises from active species that are formed by high temperature inside the cavitation bubble. Taylor and Jarman proposed13 that sonoluminescence is partly chemi- luminescent in its nature and partly due to emission of heated gas.
hjzj | Thus, many hypotheses have been proposed, and there is no generally accepted one.
j79f | Spectral investigations of sonoluminescence were carried out in several papers (see reviews1-4). It has been shown that dissolving in liquid gases essentially changes the SL intensity and spectra. 13-16 The spectra of SL of water saturated with oxygen, nitrogen, or their mixture are difficult to interpret because of the large number of emitting light particles, which
6tbv | can be formed by the chemical reactions inside the cavitation bubble.3,15 On the other hand, the SL spectra of noble gas- saturated water were studied insufficiently, and the interpretation of them is not still realized. This work is devoted to the studies of SL spectra of water saturated with helium, argon, krypton, and xenon gases. A preliminary report of this work has been published.17
xb13 | The objectives of this paper are (i) to reconsider the possible mechanisms of sonoluminescence and (ii) to present the SL spectra of noble gas-saturated water and to interpret them. We conclude that SL is not a blackbody radiation or electrical discharge and is a kind of luminescence. The changes of SL spectra in the order of inert gases from helium to xenon are explained by the difference in noble gas characteristics and the peculiarities of the conditions inside the bubble when SL occurs.

qfmx | The details of experimental arrangement and procedure are presented in the previous paper.16
rut3 | Distilled water was sparged with a suitable noble gas for 1 h before ultrasonic irradiation and in the course of spectra acquisition in a 0.5 L glass vessel placed in a thermostated water bath. The liquid was continuously rotated through the irradiation cell (stainless steel with cooling jacket, volume 50 cm3, inner diameter 2 cm) by using a peristaltic pump. Ultrasonic irradiation of water was carried out at 337 kHz with total absorbed power of ultrasound-15.5 W checked calorimetrically. The temperature inside the cell was controlled by a thermistor and maintained at 21 ± 0.5 ℃. It was necessary from 1 to 2 h for stabilizing the transducer output and for the liquid-gas system to achieve the equilibrium, as we worked at high enough intensity of ultrasound and with the cavitation field.15 After that time the spectra were a little modified because of the instability of cavitation field dynamics. To overcome this problem, spectra were collected and averaged from 4 to 10 separate ones.
m3cp | The ends of irradiation cell were fitted with the piezoceramic transducer and quartz window, respectively. The resulting sonoluminescence passed into a MDR-23 600 mm grate monochromator with the grating 1200 rulings/mm, which was blazed at 250 nm. The detector was a photomultiplier FEU- 100-tube calibrated in 200-800 nm intervals. The relative response function of the detection system was determined by a 30 W deuterium lamp DDS-30 with measured spectral irradi- ance. Total SL light power was obtained without a monochro-
mq4s | mator when the ultrasonic cell was coupled directly with the PMT tube. The resultant output of the photomultiplier was compared with that from a calibrated ß-light source with known spectral irradiance which gave 3.7 x 109 photons s-1 in the 400- 600 nm interval. We did not use D-lamp or ß-light source data for the measurement of the spectral irradiance of sonolumines- cence because of the big value of errors in both these cases. So SL intensity is given in Figure 1 in relative units. The total light power of SL is listed in Table 1.
95el | Spectra were collected with 2 nm increments in the 220- 500 nm interval as it is well-known that there are not any particular lines or bands in the region of the wavelengths higher than 500 nm for the SL spectra of distilled water.13,15 Ten measurements were acquired in each point and averaged. It was necessary around 20 min to get one spectrum. Separate spectra were smoothed by a method of successive iterations and averaged by 4-10 values.
a0a5 | The noise level was measured and subtracted from the spectra. The signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) depended on the SL intensity and was deteriorated with the decrease of the wavelength. The lower value of S/N was in the case of He-saturated water ~20 at a maximum (310 nm) and ~5 at 220 nm. However, a typical value of the signal-to-noise ratio was much higher. For example, for Ar-saturated water S/N was more than 100 at the maximum and ~20 at 220 nm.
gocl | The yield of hydrogen peroxide was measured by the potassium-iodine colorimetric procedure18 after suitable time of irradiation of water in the cell with the inlet and outlet ports locked. These experiments were made simultaneously with total SL light power measurements. The initial rates of hydrogen peroxide formation were determined as the slopes of the yield (time) curves.
