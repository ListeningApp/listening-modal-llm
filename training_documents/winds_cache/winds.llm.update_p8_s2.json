We used a two-staged approach, first modelling the presence/absence of jellyfish strandings with individual environmental variables, and then we applied a backward and forward stepwise regression in SYSTAT to choose the best set of predictive variables. Descriptive measures of goodness of fit provided from the analysis for each variable (log likelihood, receiver operating characteristic analysis, McFadden's rho squared, Cox and Snell R squared and Nagelkerke R squared were used to determine the variables which provided the highest level of prediction). The models with multiple predictors were compared using log likelihood, Aikaike's information criterion and Bayesian information criterion to determine the best model selection. The use of Aikaike's information criterion and Bayesian information criterion is considered more rigorous than likelihood analysis alone in evaluating logistic regression models and their use is described by Neath & Cavanaugh. We have had to ignore the possibility of autocorrelation in the daily observations of stranding events, and we did not account for the circular nature of wind and current direction data (e.g., five degrees is closer to three hundred fifty-five degrees than is three hundred forty degrees). However, we do not think this would have had a large bearing on the analyses, at least for the wind direction as just two values were from the northeast direction (i.e., between zero degrees and ninety degrees). Current directions were more uniformly distributed around the compass.\nsk5m | Results\nqws8 | Location, occurrence and timing of swarms and beach strandings\n877u | Observations and locations of known swarms and beach strandings of C. mastigophora are shown in Fig. one part two and summarised in Electronic Supplementary Material Table one. The earliest swarm recorded in the region was in August nineteen seventy-six when the power plant at Cape Lambert (near Karratha, see Fig. one part two) was forced into an emergency shutdown when the intake pipes became clogged with red jellyfish (see also Electronic Supplementary Material Table one). The largest swarm is likely to have been in April two thousand when high densities of C. mastigophora were observed from the air stretching over one thousand two hundred kilometers from Ningaloo (Fig. one part two) south to Rottnest Island. Photographs of\nrzhj | the recent swarms, at Cable Beach (Fig. two part three) and eighty Mile Beach (Fig. two part four) in two thousand twelve and in the water column at Ningaloo in two thousand thirteen (Fig. three), are shown. With the exception of the nineteen seventy-six swarm, the swarms were recorded from two regions: near Broome on the Dampier Peninsula and elsewhere in the southern Kimberley region in two thousand six (September/October), two thousand ten (April), two thousand eleven (September to November) and two thousand twelve (late August to November) and further south of Exmouth and Ningaloo in nineteen eighty-seven, two thousand, two thousand seven, two thousand ten, and two thousand thirteen (always in April/May for these large swarms). Except for the observation of high densities of C. mastigophora offshore of the Dampier Peninsula in April two thousand ten, all swarms in the northern region have been in the late August/September to November period and those in the more southern region occur in April and May. Some non-serious stings to swimmers on Cable Beach in two thousand eleven and two thousand twelve were treated by one of us; it is difficult to compare the size and significance of swarms between years; however, observations recorded in daily log books by life guards at Cable Beach show two thousand six and two thousand twelve as the largest strandings, with swarms in the intervening years not of comparable size.\nbfax | During two thousand twelve, numbers of C. mastigophora built up from twelve August with the first significant strandings on twenty-seven to twenty-nine August, becoming more dense from twelve to fifteen September (Fig. two part one). The beach was closed to swimmers on twelve September. On subsequent days, when jellyfish were present in large numbers, although the beach was not closed, life guards continued to patrol and advised visitors of the hazard of swimming with the jellyfish. Life guards treated three hundred ninety-six minor stings in September and three hundred thirty-six in October. The last significant stranding was on seventeen October, and C. mastigophora were uncommon by twenty-three October. The jellyfish were present throughout this period, but the very large strandings of many thousands of individuals occurred on twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, twenty-eight, twenty-nine September and one, four, five, eight, nine, ten, twelve, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen October (Fig. four). On days in-between, there were fewer jellyfish washed up but very high densities were being seen offshore. Log book records of the Broome Shire Life Guards and our own observations confirmed very high densities offshore of Cable Beach on three September and at the mouth of Dampier Creek in Roebuck Bay on seventeen September; jellyfish were still very abundant offshore of Gantheaume Point on nineteen September and another large influx was observed offshore of Cable Beach observed on twenty-eight September. In the days following twelve September\nf2y8 | and as late as twenty September, when we used a vehicle to visit beaches along the coastline to about sixty kilometers north of Broome, small numbers of jellyfish could be observed along the Dampier Peninsula but campers and tourists we interviewed reported no large strandings. We found jellyfish stranded in large numbers from Gantheaume Point as far north as Coconut Wells on eight October. They may have occurred further north as this was as far as observations were made at that time.\no7qm | Oceanographic information in relation to jellyfish strandings in two thousand twelve\nd52l | Tide range varied from one point two five meters to nine point eight two meters during the period twenty-four August to twenty October. Of the nineteen days with significant jellyfish strandings, there were nine days (forty-seven point four percent) that occurred when the tidal range was less than five meters although only eighteen days (thirty-one percent) of all days during the same period had tidal ranges less than five meters. This\nqlbb | Hydrobiologia\nnhsg | association was not significant (P equals zero point zero six one, x squared statistic equals three point five two two, one degree of freedom). However, tide range less than five meters that occurred one and two days prior to the stranding days were both significantly associated with stranding events (P equals zero point zero one three, x squared statistic equals six point one five eight, one degree of freedom for both one and two day lags). This result indicates that strandings were significantly more likely to follow days of small tidal range than those of larger tidal ranges. However, as shown in Fig. four, not all stranding events occurred on days which followed smaller than average tide ranges.",
