Because local currency research is still in an early stage, communities cannot ensure the currencies will bring the social and economic gains suggested by theory. To deal with this uncertainty, policies can be piloted on the state and local\n1k6p | LOCAL CURRENCY: POLICY BARRIERS AND SUPPORT\n949v | level, especially in regions where currencies are already operational. For example, municipalities can experiment with accepting community currency for public transportation fares, parking fees, or other services. Strict requirements could be implemented allowing select businesses to pay fees in the local currency. In time, successful pilots can be made permanent. With local and state support, local currencies can enjoy additional success.\ni5a5 | As they flourish, federal policy changes will become more appropriate. At this point, advocacy for federal legislation to allow states to accept local currency as payment and allow local governments to create their own currency may prevail. In the meantime, currency advocates can educate their representatives about local currencies and the communities that support them. They can also monitor potential legislation on virtual currency to ensure it does not contain provisions that would harm local currency.\n0kul | In addition to advocacy, there is a need for increased evaluation and research of local currencies. Public funding and partnerships between communities and universities can facilitate this. As policies are implemented, they need to be empirically studied to understand both the intended and unintended effects of policy change on local communities. With the collective efforts of multiple research, policy, and community partners, local currencies can realize their full potential for empowering communities to achieve their dreams and visions.\nrj31 | LOCAL CURRENCY: POLICY BARRIERS AND SUPPORT\nnnf7 | LOCAL CURRENCY: POLICY BARRIERS AND SUPPORT\ni0m7 | LOCAL CURRENCY: POLICY BARRIERS AND SUPPORT\nrf6v | LOCAL CURRENCY: POLICY BARRIERS AND SUPPORT\ncz3m | LOCAL CURRENCY: POLICY BARRIERS AND SUPPORT\nbqqd | LOCAL CURRENCY: POLICY BARRIERS AND SUPPORT\n2ave | LOCAL CURRENCY: POLICY BARRIERS AND SUPPORT\nlzxh | LOCAL CURRENCY: POLICY BARRIERS AND SUPPORT",
