        "content": "b3bt | Some MI countries have isolated cases of sectoral success where narrower business coalitions pushed the creation of complex, enduring upgrading institutions. Standout cases include wine and software in Argentina, ethanol and airplanes in Brazil, aquaculture in Chile, and rubber-based manufactured goods and electronics in Malaysia. Core factors contributing to the successes across these cases were brisk international competition, perceptions of crisis, and effective state promotion especially in Brazil and Malaysia, all of which fostered strong, concerted business engagement in upgrading sectoral institutions, especially related to training and innovation. MNCs in these sectors were mostly conspicuous by their absence other than Malaysian electronics and Argentine software. Overall, this rare combination of factors helps to explain why these are more the exceptional sectors that prove the general rule of social fragmentation and the absence of upgrading coalitions.\n0w8m | Turning to cross-national heterogeneity, comparisons between Malaysia and Thailand offer another window into the pivotal role of coalitions. Among our nine large MI countries, Malaysia has the highest GDP per capita while Thailand's is below average for the group. In societal terms, Malaysian labor is less fragmented, with roughly eighty percent of\nvcu3 | MIDDLE-INCOME TRAP\nhjzj | the labor force in formal occupations in contrast to only forty-two percent in Thailand; inequality generally trends lower in Malaysia. These differences correspond to contrasting coalitions and associated institutions found in the two countries. Sustained growth in Malaysia occurred under a broad, elite-led coalition, known as the National Front, consisting of ethnic Malays sixty percent of the population, ethnic Chinese thirty percent, and ethnic Indians roughly ten percent. The most powerful component is the cross-class, highly institutionalized United Malays National Organization, though it also comprises key ethnic Chinese and Indian parties, each of which includes both business and labor.\nj79f | Although the United Malays National Organization imposed some discriminatory policies against the economically powerful ethnic Chinese, it largely practiced a \"hegemonic pragmatism.\" The focus was on reducing income differences across ethnic groups through a combination of gradual affirmative action and structural changes via agricultural reform and industrial promotion. After the turmoil of the late nineteen sixties, fears of social unrest \"internal implosion\" further promoted elite cohesion and more effective development policy. This led to a \"dual bureaucratic structure\" in which the United Malays National Organization promoted and monitored institutions, especially rural development bureaucracies implementing long-term reforms at the local level, but also in key sectors such as rubber. By contrast, fragmented interest groups and poorly institutionalized parties in Thailand, in part the result of higher levels of inequality and informality, have contributed to \"a policy environment where needed public goods, reforms and investments were chronically undersupplied.\" In short, upgrading coalitions helped nudge Malaysia close to the high-income threshold but were weaker in Thailand and other large MI countries.\n6tbv | Another potentially illuminating set of comparisons is between current large MI countries and countries that became high-income in the late twentieth century. Most recent, second-wave graduates to high-income status had special circumstances that helped them elude the MI trap by overcoming the\nxb13 | political obstacles discussed in Section three and by facilitating collective action and coalition building. The thirteen countries that escaped MI in the nineteen eighties and nineteen nineties comprised three distinct groupings: East Asian countries with developmental states Japan, Korea, Taiwan, late entrants into the European Union Greece, Ireland, Portugal, and Spain, and very small countries with populations under eight million Equatorial Guinea, Hong Kong, Israel, Mauritius, Puerto Rico, and Singapore. Security threats in the East Asia cases, as well as in Israel combined with contentious politics from below and a dearth of exportable natural resources greatly facilitated elite cohesion and coalition building. European Union accession similarly helped forge consensus, especially among elites, and the economic benefits and direct transfers within the European Union were also substantial. For Southern European entrants, accession in the nineteen eighties was associated with huge jumps in education spending.\ncxqi | In addition, small size can facilitate elite unity, though it does not guarantee it. Collective action is generally easier to achieve in countries with a few million inhabitants with their correspondingly smaller and more geographically concentrated elites than in countries with tens or hundreds of millions. For the small countries of Northern Europe, Peter Katzenstein emphasizes how smallness and a resulting sense of vulnerability fostered an ideology of social partnership, better organized social groups, and closer personal ties as political and economic elites from different spheres all knew one another. In smaller countries, rifts within business are less common, either because foreign business is absent, as in Finland, or because MNCs are dominant and well incorporated into a national coalition that promotes upgrading, as in Ireland and Singapore.\nqfmx | Some of these special circumstances may also help to explain China's rapid growth into and possible early shift out of middle income. True, inequality increased dramatically forty-seven Gini coefficient, raising debates about possible \"Latin Americanization.\" Yet on other dimensions, China shows that it is already advancing out of MI status with lower informality a shadow economy of twelve percent, extremely high investment forty-nine percent, low FDI ten percent, high research and development spending\nrut3 | two percent, not far below the OECD average, and educational institutions producing large numbers of engineers and technicians, including twenty-one percent of secondary students enrolled in technical education. This potential for moving quickly through MI status reflects China's resemblance to earlier Asian developmental states by virtue of a clear connection for political elites between development and the capacity to address geopolitical challenges, a connection missing in other MI countries, and by virtue of the stability of its authoritarian regime.",
