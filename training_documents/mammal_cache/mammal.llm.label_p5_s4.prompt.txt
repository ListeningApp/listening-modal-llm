You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

jfsr | DNAm networks relate to individual and species traits
u15r | We used signed WGCNA, an unsupervised analysis (33), to cluster CpGs with similar methylation dynamics across samples into co- methylation modules. We then summarized their methylation profiles as "module eigen- genes." The respective eigengenes of these modules were used to identify their potential correlations with various traits within and across mammalian species.
lq35 | Our data analysis proceeded in two sequen- tial phases. First, we developed several comet- hylation networks using data from 11,099 DNA samples from 174 species (discovery dataset finalized March 2021). A eutherian network [network 1 (Net1)] was formed from 14,705 conserved CpGs using this dataset (Fig. 2A). Later, we generated a second dataset of 4357 samples from 30 tissues of 240 mammalian species (174 new species and 66 that are rep- resented in the discovery set), which were not used to define modules and were used as an independent validation set. All eutherian modules were present in the independent validation dataset according to module pres- ervation statistics (corKME) (34), validating the presence of these modules (corKME > 0.43, <LATEX>P < 1 0 ^ { - 2 2 }</LATEX> median <LATEX>\mathrm { c o r K M E } = 0 . 8 4</LATEX> (fig. S5). These modules were designated with colors according to WGCNA convention (Fig. 2A). The smallest module (lavenderblush3) con- sisted of 33 CpGs and the largest (turquoise) had 1864 CpGs.
3g9w | To characterize the 55 modules with respect to species characteristics (e.g., maximum life span and average adult weight), module eigen- genes were calculated in all samples (discovery and validation set combined, 331 eutherian species). Because information on taxonomic order, tissues, maximum life span, age, sex and adult weight of each species was available,

ylhz | we were able to assess whether any of the mod- ule eigengenes correlated with these traits. Of the 55 modules, 30 were found to be correlated with at least one trait (Fig. 2B, fig. S7, and table S3). Specifically, 15 modules were related to taxonomic orders such as primates, rodents, or carnivores (Fig. 2B and fig. S11). Ten mod- ules related to tissue type (fig. S11), two to sex (fig. S11), one to age, seven to maximum life span, and four to average adult species weight. Some modules were related to multiple char- acteristics. In the following sections, we mainly focus on the modules that relate to mamma- lian maximum life span, adult weight, and age. Other modules related to taxonomic order, tis- sue type, and sex are described in the supple- mentary materials (fig. S11). We performed two analyses to ascertain whether these eutherian modules are also applicable to marsupials and monotremes. Using the discovery dataset, we first trained a network (Net2) in both eutherians and marsupials based on only 7956 probes that are mappable to both. The color bands under the hierarchical tree reveal that all the Net1 modules were also preserved in Net2 (Fig. 2A). Second, we selected CpGs in Net1 modules that were also mapped to marsupials or monotremes and confirmed that their eigengene relation- ships to primary traits were retained in these mammalian clades (table S3). For example, the magenta module, which is related to blood in eutherians, was also found to be so in mono- tremes (table S3), which confirms that the Net1 modules can indeed be applied to other mam- malian clades by selecting probes that are also mapped to those clades.
a3td | A functional enrichment study, accounting for the mammalian array background, revealed that the genes neighboring to module CpGs are implicated in many biological processes in- cluding development, immune function, me- tabolism, reproduction, stem cell biology, stress responses, aging, and various signaling path- ways (Fig. 2C and fig. S9).
ex5k | Relationship with protein-protein interactions
9d4o | We investigated whether the proteins encoded by cognate genes (closest to respective CpGs) within modules are known to mutually inter- act or predicted to do so by STRING protein- protein interaction networks, which integrate known and predicted protein associations from >14,000 organisms (35). A permutation test analysis evaluating the global cluster coeffi- cient (36) of each module showed that 14 mod- ules are significantly enriched <LATEX>\left( P < 0 . 0 0 1 \right)</LATEX> for genes encoding mutually interacting proteins (Fig. 2D). Overall, these results suggest that comethylation relationships can be reflected at the protein level for a subset of modules.
cjq2 | Modules related to maximum life span
5esx | To adjust for potential confounders, we used four regression modeling approaches to iden-
m5ka | tify modules that are associated with the log- transformed maximum life span (dependent variable): (i) a univariate regression model with a covariate that was the module eigen- gene (averaged per species); (ii) a phylogenetic regression model with a covariate that was again the module eigengene (averaged per spe- cies); (iii) a multivariate linear regression model that included the module eigengene, sex, tissue, and relative age as covariates; and (iv) model approach (i) applied to specific tissue types.
byu8 | The marginal analysis identified four mod- ules: magenta, black, midnightblue, and tan, that related significantly to maximum life span (the absolute value of the Pearson correlation exceeded <LATEX>r = 0 . 6 ,</LATEX> Student's t test <LATEX>P < 1 \times 1 0 ^ { - 3 3 } .</LATEX> The CpGs underlying the implicated modules exhibit the sample patterns, as can be seen from corresponding heatmaps (fig. S14C). Phylogenetic regression also identified asso- ciations of the same modules (table S3). Our fourth modeling approach, i.e., the tissue- stratified marginal analysis, indicates that the relationship of modules to maximum life span is often tissue specific. For example, the magenta and midnightblue modules relate to maximum life span in lung and liver (fig. S14A). By contrast, the black module relates to maximum life span only in skin, and the tan module exhibited a weak relationship to life span in the tissue-specific analysis.

zxz6 | For ease of comprehension, modules were labeled with the trait and direction of relation- ship by superscript plus and minus signs; for example, magenta is the Lifespan+Weight <LATEX>B l o c d ^ { + }</LATEX> module). The two modules (magenta with 480 CpGs, and midnightblue with 249 CpGs) that correlated with life span in lung and liver also correlated significantly with average adult weight across all eutherian species <LATEX>\left( r = 0 . 4 7 \right.</LATEX> to 0.55, <LATEX>P < 1 \times 1 0 ^ { - 1 8 }</LATEX> Fig. 3). The magenta module (Lifespan+Weight+Blood+) is enriched with developmental genes such as HOXA5, VEGFA, SOX2, and WNT11 (table S4). The midnightblue (Lifespan+Weight+) module implicates genes involved in transfer RNA me- tabolism <LATEX>\left( P = 2 \times 1 0 ^ { - 6 } \right. ,</LATEX> e.g., URMI), lipopoly- saccharides <LATEX>\left( P = 5 \times 1 0 ^ { - 6 } \right. ,</LATEX> e.g., CERCAM), development <LATEX>\left( P = 1 0 ^ { - 4 } \right. ,</LATEX> e.g., the <LATEX>H O X L</LATEX> gene family), and fatty acids <LATEX>\left( P = 2 \times 1 0 ^ { - 3 } \right. ,</LATEX> e.g., ACADVL). The magenta module also relates to life span and average weight of dog breeds <LATEX>\left( r = - \quad 0 . 3 0 , \right.</LATEX> <LATEX>P = 0 . 0 0 3 ;</LATEX> Fig. 3C). Furthermore, it is related to the hazard of human death [hazard ratio <LATEX>\left( H R \right) = 0 . 9 1 ,</LATEX> MetaP = 0.0016; Fig. 3D) in epidemiological cohort studies.

d6r4 | sake of visualization, the analysis was limited to the top 50 CpGs with the highest module membership value per module. Colors indicate mammalian Net1. The lollipop plot shows the global cluster coefficient (36) of the proteins within a module (up to 500 top CpGs) in a PPI network. Our permutation analysis matched the distribution of the original module sizes. We evaluated 1100 random permutations, i.e., 20 for each of the 55 modules. The boxplot reports the global clustering coefficient per module (y axis) versus permutation status: module resulting from a random selection of proteins (left) versus original module resulting from WGCNA (right). The modules with cluster coefficients larger than the maximum permutation cluster coefficient were considered as significant at P = 0.001. The dashed vertical line corresponds to the maximum global clustering coefficient observed in the 1100 random permutations.
