RHOA inactivation promotes YAP phosphorylation in the cytoplasm to maintain an atheroprotective endothelial cell phenotype. These interactions between integrins and RHO GTPases further activate RAC, leading to the assembly of the junctional mechanosensory complexes. Additionally, the RHO GTPase CDC42 is polarized and activated in an integrin-dependent manner and subsequently regulates the polarity of the microtubule-organizing centre. Under disturbed flow conditions, the cooperation between RGD-binding integrins and fibronectin has been shown to drive pro-inflammatory signal transduction involving the nuclear translocation of NF-KB, YAP and serine/threonine-protein kinase PAK.\nccpt | Flow-sensitive transcription factors\n0fpw | Thus far, we have discussed mechanosignal transduction pathways occurring in an early-to-intermediate timescale, mediated by specific mechanosensors in response to flow in endothelial cells. These relatively acute responses lead to the regulation of downstream, long-term responses, including activation of transcription factors and\ndqn8 | transcriptional co-activators, such as KLF two and KLF four, NF-KB, hypoxia-inducible factor one alpha, YAP, TAZ and SOX thirteen, which regulate gene expression profiles and cell function. KLF two and KLF four are two of the most flow-sensitive master transcription factors regulating the expression of genes that control anti-atherogenic pathways induced by stable flow, including vasodilatation and antithrombotic and anti-inflammatory pathways. KLF two reduces the expression of pro-atherogenic genes by competing with NF-KB for transcriptional cofactor CBP-p three hundred and by promoting the translocation of nuclear factor erythroid two-related factor two. Stable flow increases KLF two transcription by sequentially activating the members of the MAP kinase family MEKK three, MEK five and ERK five, which in turn activates the transcription factors MEF two A and MEF two C. By contrast, disturbed flow inactivates the ERK five pathway, leading to the inhibition of KLF two expression. In addition, KLF two expression is suppressed by the flow-regulated microRNA, miR ninety-two a.\ncop0 | NF-KB is a well-recognized transcription factor that is activated by flow. Nuclear translocation and activation of NF-KB in endothelial cells is increased transiently by stable flow and persistently by disturbed flow. NF-KB target genes include those encoding VCAM one, ICAM one, E-selectin, hypoxia-inducible factor one alpha and numerous cytokines, all of which have a crucial role in atherosclerosis. Hypoxia-inducible factor one alpha is a pro-atherogenic transcription factor that is activated by disturbed flow. Hypoxia-inducible factor one alpha induces the expression of glycolytic enzymes such as HK two, PFKFB three and PDK one. YAP and TAZ - which are transcriptional co-activators induced by the Hippo signaling pathway and are involved in organ growth and development as well as various diseases such as cancer and atherosclerosis - are also regulated by both stable and disturbed flow. Disturbed flow induces YAP and TAZ nuclear translocation and activation, leading to endothelial cell inflammation and cytoskeletal remodeling and atherosclerosis. A study published in twenty twenty-two identified SOX thirteen as a novel flow-sensitive transcription factor. Disturbed flow represses the expression of SOX thirteen, which in turn leads to a strong induction of pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine production, including CCL five and CXCL ten, resulting in endothelial inflammation.\nlhkq | Omics approaches to study endothelial cells\n82ju | Omics-based analyses have become standard approaches to determine changes in endothelial cells in response to various flow and disease conditions. Unlike traditional reductionist approaches studying one or a few candidate genes or proteins at a time, the astonishing advances in omics technologies and computational bioinformatics have made it possible to determine changes in genes, proteins and metabolites at a genome-wide, epigenome-wide, proteome-wide and metabolome-wide scale, often at a single-cell resolution, and using a small amount of sample. The application of these approaches using in vitro and in vivo models has generated a plethora of datasets of flow-dependent transcriptomic, epigenomic, proteomic and metabolomic profiles in endothelial cells and blood vessels under healthy and disease conditions.\ny2qo | Early transcriptomic studies used bulk RNA and miRNA samples from pooled cultured endothelial cells and animal tissues to conduct microarray and RNA sequencing analyses. These studies identified numerous unexpected flow-sensitive genes, miRNAs and long non-coding RNAs, generating wide-ranging novel hypotheses regarding their various roles in endothelial cell function and atherosclerosis. Numerous flow-sensitive genes (including BMP four, DNMT one, KDM four B, KLF two, KLK ten, PLPP three, SEMA seven A, THBS one, TMX one and ZBTB forty-six), miRNAs (including miR ninety-five a and miR seven twelve) and long non-coding RNAs (including\n1piq | MALAT one and MANTIS) were identified from these bulk-RNA studies and subsequently validated, as reviewed elsewhere. The roles of flow-sensitive miRNAs and long non-coding RNAs in endothelial function have been reviewed previously. KLK ten (which encodes kallikrein-related peptidase ten) has been identified as one of the most flow-sensitive genes from a gene-array study using the mouse PCL model. KLK ten expression is increased by stable flow, but nearly lost in response to disturbed flow in endothelial cells in vitro, mouse arteries in vivo and human coronary arteries with advanced atherosclerotic plaques. After the KLK ten protein is produced, it is secreted into the circulating blood (or the conditioned medium in in vitro assays) and functions as an anti-inflammatory and permeability-barrier-protective protein. Interestingly, KLK ten, which is a member of the KLK serine/threonine protein kinase family, lacks inherent protease activity, and its anti-inflammatory and permeability-barrier-protective functions are mediated by protease-activated receptor one (PAR one)-dependent and PAR two-dependent pathways. Administration of recombinant KLK ten via tail vein injection or ultrasound-guided delivery of a KLK ten expression vector to the carotid endothelium prevented endothelial inflammation and atherosclerosis development in mice, demonstrating the proof of principle that flow-sensitive proteins such as KLK ten could be used as novel anti-atherogenic therapeutics.\n7fqw | Flow induces epigenome-wide changes in endothelial cells, as revealed by a DNA methylome study that used reduced representation bisulfite sequencing of mouse genomic bulk DNA samples combined with microarray analysis of bulk RNA samples of mouse carotid arteries after PCL surgery. This DNA methylome study, together with other studies, showed that disturbed flow regulates DNA methylation patterns in endothelial cells via the DNA methyltransferases DNMT one and DNMT three. Further studies showed that genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition of DNMT one prevented endothelial inflammation and atherosclerosis development in Apoe-minus mice, demonstrating that flow-sensitive epigenomic modifications could be anti-atherogenic therapeutic targets.\n```",
