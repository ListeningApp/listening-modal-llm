        "content": "7hgg | The efforts to monitoring China, primarily its preparations for a massive intervention in the war, went somewhat better, and the source of the failure here lay within the sphere of analysis. Although the CIA had\nxwsv | lost all its assets in mainland China following the Communist victory there, it succeeded in receiving some relevant information through other sources. On October nineteenth, the same day the People's Liberation Army started crossing the Yalu, a Hong Kong-based Chinese businessman warned that four hundred thousand People's Liberation Army troops had started or were about to start crossing into North Korea. CIA officers in Tokyo warned twice of a three hundred thousand-strong People's Liberation Army force deployed near the Yalu. These warnings had no impact on intelligence estimates. MacArthur himself rejected them, and threatened to arrest a CIA officer stationed in Tokyo for warning about a coming Chinese intervention.\n756b | Aerial reconnaissance occasionally yielded some useful information. In early September, one warning indicator concerning possible Chinese intervention involved aerial photographs that showed three air-force bases, capable of handling a total of three hundred aircraft, had been built in close proximity to the Yalu. On October eighteenth, aerial photographs showed that close to a hundred Soviet-made aircraft had been deployed in those fields. The obvious conclusion should have been that the Chinese were building air support for a potential large-scale confrontation with the United Nations forces.\n6bx7 | Signals intelligence coverage of the Chinese preparations for war suffered from a number of problems. The Chinese military hardly used radio equipment. On average, a Chinese People's Volunteer division had about five percent of the communication devices of a United States division. The People's Republic of China was also ranked relatively low in Armed Forces Security Agency's order of priorities, although it climbed to the top when United Nations forces crossed the thirty-eighth parallel and advanced northward. Signals intelligence collection efforts also suffered from a lack of Chinese linguists, primarily in the Mandarin dialect that was used by the People's Liberation Army. The Allies' contribution was also limited. The British Government Communications Headquarters operated a listening post in Hong Kong, but it covered southern China, not Manchuria. The Taiwanese signals intelligence, which provided relevant information, was rejected for being \"biased or self-serving.\"\nspl6 | Although one of the best experts on the subject regarded the signals intelligence contribution as \"extremely poor,\" the National Security Agency account claimed that the lack of warning about the intervention \"was a failure to utilize already available intelligence.\" Indeed, Armed Forces Security Agency's monitoring, mainly of personal and administrative traffic, provided reasonable indications of the preparations to intervene. In May and June, it reported that seventy thousand People's Liberation Army troops, from two army groups, had moved down the Yangtze River. On July seventeenth, it provided information that the Fourth Field Army, considered the People's Liberation Army's best combat force, had deployed units in Manchuria and in east China. Based on this information, the Army G-2 assessed that the People's Republic of China intended to attack Taiwan, whereas G-2 in Tokyo concluded that the Fourth Army had \"returned to its normal operating area in North China.\" The Watch Committee did a far better job on July seventeenth, when estimating that \"concentration of Chinese Communist troops in Manchuria might be intended for use in Korea.\" In early September, Armed Forces Security Agency located the deployment of six People's Liberation Army armies in Manchuria, and in the weeks that followed, it reported their move closer to the border, as well as the transfer by railroad of artillery units and of Chinese aircraft to newly established air bases in Manchuria. On the basis of this information, the Watch Committee concluded on September twenty-second that the People's Liberation Army could cross the Yalu \"with little advance notice.\"\n7wzm | Other indications that were collected by Armed Forces Security Agency included the reservation of ferries for military use in the Yalu, the ordering of thirty thousand maps of Korea, shipments of medical supplies to the border area, and North Korean traffic mentioning a \"regiment that came from China.\" Nevertheless, neither signals intelligence monitoring nor other means of collection provided indications for the actual crossing of the Yalu, which started on October eighteenth and took place at night under strict radio silence.\ne9xj | MacArthur's G-2 reports usually correctly reflected the available information. On July third, Willoughby estimated that China \"stationed two cavalry divisions and four armies in Manchuria.\" Since a Chinese Army amounted to about thirty thousand soldiers, their total number reached at least one hundred fifty thousand. In late August, he estimated that two hundred forty-six thousand soldiers had been deployed there, and after the Inchon landing he \"speculated that four hundred fifty thousand Chinese troops were massed in Manchuria.\" On October fifth, two weeks before the actual crossing had started, MacArthur's G-2 who relied on Taiwanese sources raised the possibility that nine Chinese divisions\n9vl6 | had already deployed in Korea.\" At the same time, and in contrast to the CIA, Willoughby did not report on the buildup of air fields near the border, although this indicated preparations for a confrontation with United Nations forces. When United States reconnaissance flights revealed on October eighteenth that close to a hundred Soviet-made aircraft had been deployed in these airfields, MacArthur's air commander, General Stratemeyer, estimated it to be a means to back up the Chinese intervention threats but, like Willoughby, regarded it as a bluff.\nc2fd | Chinese public and diplomatic intervention threats constituted a major source of concern, primarily in Washington, which was otherwise completely dependent on intelligence from the Far East Command. On September twenty-sixth, a day after China's foreign minister Zhou Enlai warned that China would respond if the United Nations forces crossed the thirty-eighth parallel, the Chinese Foreign Office issued another public statement: \"The American warmongers are mistaken in thinking that their accusations and threats would intimidate the people of\njzvp | Neither the warning indications about the People's Liberation Army buildup in Manchuria nor the Chinese public and diplomatic warnings changed the American estimate that an intervention was unlikely. In an October twelfth memorandum to President Truman, the CIA did not rule out \"full-scale Chinese Communist intervention\" but estimated that \"barring a Soviet decision for global war, such action is not probable in nineteen fifty.\" The Kremlin, according to the CIA, had no interest in such a confrontation. President Truman and Secretary Acheson saw no reason to change their previous assessment. Acheson assessed that the military and political risks involved in intervention were too high and the strategic gains too low.\nf71y | Basing his estimate on military factors, Willoughby said, in late September, \"If the Chinese were going to intervene they would have done so when we made the Inchon landing.\" On the eve of MacArthur's conference with President Truman on Wake Island, Willoughby estimated that the Chinese intervention warnings were \"probably in a category of diplomatic blackmail.\" MacArthur echoed this estimate, telling President Truman during their October fifteenth meeting that the likelihood of Chinese intervention was \"very little. Had they intervened in the first or second months it would have been decisive.\"\n31e1 | Point two. The decision-making process: Washington, Tokyo, Korea\n40ry | Most studies of the surprise Chinese attack in late November have focused on the failure, primarily in Washington, to realistically judge Beijing's public and diplomatic intervention threats. This mistaken estimate contributed to the American surprise, but its main source was the adherence of MacArthur and his G-2 to the belief that China would avoid massive intervention, despite undisputable evidence to the contrary. This misconception was the foundation of MacArthur's decision to advance to the Yalu, of Washington's political and military approval of this move, and of the operational risks taken by the United Nations forces in order to complete their mission as early as possible, which furthermore exposed them to the Chinese People's Volunteer Force counteroffensive.\nd1j2 | The clearest evidence for the People's Republic of China's intentions and capabilities was the People's Volunteer Force's First Campaign, which lasted two weeks. On October twenty-fifth, the Chinese People's Volunteer Force, which by this stage amounted to more than two hundred sixty thousand soldiers, initiated",
