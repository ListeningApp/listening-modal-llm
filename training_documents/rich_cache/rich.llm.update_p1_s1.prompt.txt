You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

3fxr | OF
1rwa | GETTING RICH Wallace D. Wattles
40h8 | Introduction
9w49 | ABOUT EIGHTEEN MONTHS AGO, a man I'd never met sent me a book I'd never heard of by a man who'd been dead nearly 90 years.
kgl8 | That little book changed my entire life. As I put into practice the principles you'll learn about in this book, the results were astonishing - and they began almost instantly and continue to this day.
kq4g | When The Science of Getting Rich arrived in the mail that afternoon I immediately ripped open the package, sat down, and read it with an open mind - mostly because the title was just so intriguing. And even though I must admit I found some of the old-fashioned language and some of the ideas in the first part a bit confusing, there was something about it that compelled me to reread those little confus- ing bits two or three times until I got it!
qjp8 | Once I did that, I couldn't stop reading until I'd read the whole thing!
pc64 | Right away I began to put into practice what the book outlines ... and everything began to change. "Coincidences" happened - happy ones that led to connections with people ... that led to more con- nections ... that led to money beginning to flow toward me in increasingly larger amounts and from several sources, including new and unexpected ones.
mbrx | And even though changing your habitual thinking is difficult and I'm still not as good at it as I intend to be, my businesses began to "click," my income doubled , then tripled, and continues to rise ... my cramped city apartment has given way to a spacious waterfront house ... I've established reward- ing new relationships with many generous, successful, wealthy people ... and opportunities to be, do, have, and give more continue to show up at my doorstep almost daily.
pcd0 | It's amazing - and wonderful.
txkp | Until this book arrived, nothing I had ever read or heard before had explained to me so clearly that there are universal laws at work regarding wealth and success and that if we'll just work with those laws - go with the tide instead of trying to swim against it (usually unknowingly) - the results we want will begin to come to us. That if we will scientifically reproduce the causes of wealth, we will invariably reproduce the results.
mxqe | Now, right off the bat author Wallace D. Wattles says that instead of questioning how these prin- ciples work, you'll need simply to accept them and begin to practice them. So I did that, even though as I read I did find myself resisting from time to time and thinking, "Well, I don't know if I can agree with that." But I'd already decided just to accept (at least temporarily) each premise as if I did thoroughly believ it.
y9ob | By the time I finished the book I understood why he had included that warning. You see, some of what you'll read or hear will most likely challenge some of your previous thinking. That seems to be the case for most people. But keep on, and you'll soon see how Mr. Wattles beautifully builds each chapter on what he presents in the preceding ones. I think you'll find yourself saying - as I and many others have - "Oh, now I see why he said that. Now I see how it all fits together."
twm6 | I believe, also, that you'll find it absolutely refreshing to know that to get rich by the method outlined here, it is essential that you embrace and practice what we all know as the Golden Rule ... that the daily practice of gratitude is one of the conduits by which your wealth will come to you ... and that

q0fv | I've lightly edited the 90-year-old manuscript to accomodate modern readers. Unfortu- nately, though, there is as yet no graceful way in English to avoid completely the use of the masculine gender to represent all people, especially in working with such an old book.
v9vo | Luckily for us women, we have vast experience in reading ourselves back in - just as we have learned to dance backward! Where it does not interfere with the gracefulness of the writing, I have changed man to person, men to people, and mankind to humankind.
rwty | To Mr. Wattles' credit, although writing just after the turn of the 20th century, he makes it clear that The Science of Getting Rich applies equally to men and women alike.
ki97 | Preface
099j | THIS BOOK IS PRAGMATICAL, NOT PHILOSOPHICAL - a practical manual, not a treatise upon theories. It is intended for the men and women whose most pressing need is for money, who wish to get rich first, and philosophize afterward. It is for those who want results and who are willing to take the conclusions of science as a basis for action, without going into all the processes by which those conclusions were reached.
m7zf | It is expected that the reader will take the fundamental statements upon faith, just as he would take statements concerning a law of electrical action if they were promulgated by a Marconi or an Edison, and, taking the statements upon faith, that he will prove their truth by acting upon them without fear or hesitation. Every man or woman who does this will certainly get rich, for the science herein applied is an exact science and failure is impossible.
2ghw | In writing this book I have sacrificed all other considerations to plainness and simplicity of style, so that all might understand. The plan of action laid down herein was deduced from the conclusions of philosophy. It has been thoroughly tested, and bears the supreme test of practical experiment: It works.
hnfy | CHAPTER |
w6d9 | The Right To Be Rich
lbm8 | WHATEVER MAY BE SAID IN PRAISE OF POVERTY, the fact remains that it is not possible to live a really complete or successful life unless one is rich. No one can rise to his greatest possible height in talent or soul development unless he has plenty of money, for to unfold the soul and to de-velop talent he must have many things to use, and he cannot have these things unless he has money to buy them with.
krjy | A person develops in mind, soul, and body by making use of things, and society is so organized that man must have money in order to become the possessor of things. Therefore, the basis of all advancement must be the science of getting rich.
n7dw | The object of all life is development, and everything that lives has an inalienable right to all the development it is capable of attaining.
9nt1 | A person's right to life means his right to have the free and unrestricted use of all the things which may be necessary to his fullest mental, spiritual, and physical unfoldment; or, in other words, his right to be rich.
fr45 | In this book, I shall not speak of riches in a figurative way. To be really rich does not mean to be satisfied or contented with a little. No one ought to be satisfied with a little if he is capable of using and enjoying more. The purpose of nature is the advancement and unfoldment of life, and everyone should have all that can contribute to the power, elegance, beauty, and richness of life. To be content with less is sinful.
