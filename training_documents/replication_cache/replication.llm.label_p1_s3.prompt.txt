You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before.

2taz | Abstract
o3ya | Positive-strand RNA viruses, the largest genetic class of eukaryotic viruses, include coronaviruses and many other established and emerging pathogens. A major target for understanding and controlling these viruses is their genome replication, which occurs in virus-induced membrane vesicles that organize replication steps and protect double-stranded RNA intermediates from innate immune recognition. The structure of these complexes has been greatly illuminated by recent cryo-electron microscope tomography studies with several viruses. One key finding in diverse systems is the organization of crucial viral RNA replication factors in multimeric rings or crowns that among other functions serve as exit channels gating release of progeny genomes to the cytosol for translation and encapsidation. Emerging results suggest that these crowns serve additional important purposes in replication complex assembly, function, and interaction with downstream processes such as encapsidation. The findings provide insights into viral function and evolution and new bases for understanding, controlling, and engineering positive-strand RNA viruses.

t8vv | 1. INTRODUCTION
qvnu | Positive-strand RNA viruses [(+)RNA viruses] are one of the most numerous and devastating viral classes. Their members include severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), cause of the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the tumor-inducing hep- atitis C virus (HCV), paralytic poliovirus, lethal encephalitis and hemorrhagic fever viruses, and many other human, animal, and plant pathogens (1, 2). In parallel, these viruses have demon- strated considerable potential for beneficial uses in medicine, biotechnology, and nanotechnology through their abilities to deliver, dramatically amplify, express, and evolve selected genes and RNA elements (e.g., 3). The practical potential of such RNA pathways has become even more apparent with the recent successes of messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines (4) and increasingly numerous and powerful RNA-based tools for gene editing and regulation (5-7).
kggw | Better understanding of replication and pathogenesis is crucial to (+)RNA virus control, to predicting the emergence of future dangerous viral species and variants, and to improving engi- neered uses of viral derivatives and pathways. One essential target for understanding, controlling, and employing (+)RNA viruses is their genome replication. Such RNA replication invariably uses most of the viral genome coding capacity-e.g., greater than 70% of the SARS-CoV-2 genome-and thus is arguably the main job of the virus. This (+)RNA virus genome replication proceeds solely through RNA intermediates, without any natural DNA forms (Figure 1a). In eukaryotes, these processes occur in virus-induced, membrane-bounded mini-organelles that organize RNA replication steps and protect double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) replication interme- diates from innate immune recognition. Two classes of such RNA replication complexes (RCs) are known. The first, designated spherules, are ~50- to 150-nm invaginations of an intracellular membrane, whose interior remains connected to the cytosol by a necked channel (Figure 1b). The second class consists of ~200- to 300-nm double-membrane vesicles or DMVs, which lack any membranous opening to the cytosol (Figure 1c).
xrd1 | Prior ultrastructural knowledge of (+)RNA virus RCs had been limited to their membrane architecture. Recent application of cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and complementary approaches to a few pioneer systems has greatly advanced understanding of these complexes and their functions by revealing the location, organization, and interactions of viral RNA templates, RNA replication proteins, and other relevant viral and cellular factors. In this review we sum- marize these and other recent breakthroughs in (+)RNA virus genome replication and their implications for viral function and control. Major findings include that, in addition to enzymatic roles in viral RNA synthesis, (+)RNA virus replication proteins have key structural roles in RCs. For both spherule and DMV RCs, these viral proteins form ringed complexes or crowns that among other functions serve as cytosolic exit channels for progeny (+)RNA products. As outlined below, such crowns appear to represent a crucial nexus for many infection steps, from initial recruitment of RNA replication factors and templates through successive RNA replication func- tions, post-translational maturation steps, encapsidation, and host innate immune interactions. Ongoing analysis of these crowns promises to provide further valuable insights regarding RC structure, operation, assembly, and evolution.

x972 | Figure 1 (+)RNA virus genome replication and associated membrane compartments. (a) Schematic of (+)RNA virus genome replication showing the progression through key replication intermediates. An infecting virion releases a messenger-sense RNA genome into the cytoplasm. Viral nonstructural RNA replication proteins synthesize a complementary (-)RNA. Resulting dsRNA replication intermediates function as templates for progeny (+)RNA genomes. The asymmetry of RNA synthesis typically produces a (+)RNA:(-)RNA ratio of approximately 50-100. Depending on the virus, progeny virions may be released from infected cells in lytic and/or nonlytic fashions. (b) Schematic representation of (+)RNA virus spherule RNA replication compartments. Such spherules are invaginations of various intracellular organellar membranes and are typically 50-100 nm in diameter. (c) Schematic representation of (+)RNA virus DMV RNA replication compartments, which are typically 200-300 nm in diameter.

cwrw | 2.1. Nodaviruses
4i0e | Nodaviridae infect vertebrates or invertebrates including insects and nematodes. Their genomes and spherule RCs bear similarities to the plant-infecting Tombusviridae (8, 9). The associated nodavirus-tombusvirus clade was recently substantially expanded by viruses discovered through large-scale sequencing (1, 10). Nodaviruses encode a single, highly multifunctional RNA repli- cation factor, protein A (~1,000 aa), that contains RNA methyltransferase (M'Tase)/capping, membrane association, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), and multiple self-interaction domains (Figure 2). Advanced sequence comparisons show that protein A embodies three of the four domains conserved across the RNA replication proteins of the large alphavirus superfamily (11) (Figure 2). In keeping with such expanding parallels, findings on nodavirus RNA replication and RCs often have provided precedents relevant to many (+)RNA viruses.

FHV thus provides a simple, well-characterized system for RNA-dependent RNA amplification in diverse cells, which as noted above could have many practical applications.

This nodavirus Iceberg region has parallels to alphavirus RNA replication proteins in predicted structure and in primary sequence position relative to flanking protein domains (Figure 2), and is defined as a relatively large conserved struc- tural extension to the capping enzyme core, reminiscent of the submerged part of an iceberg (11). Protein A also recruits FHV genomic RNA templates to the outer mitochondrial membrane by interaction of its RdRp domain with cis signals that in FHV genomic RNA1 reside in nucleotides 68-205 (22, 23). In a process closely linked to RNA synthesis from such templates, protein A then induces invagination of the characteristic ~60- to 70-nm spherule vesicles of its RCs (24).

Among other results, spherules are densely packed with coiled fila- ments, matching extensive biochemical evidence that they contain FHV dsRNA replication inter- mediates (17, 25). As with alphaviruses (27), spherule size correlates with the length of the RNA replicated, with RNA density calculations indicating that most FHV spherules contain one dsRNA (26).

One stun- ning cryo-EM revelation was a 12-fold symmetric, ringed, proteinaceous complex, designated the crown, above the cytosolic side of the spherule neck (26) (Figure 4a). Antibody labeling, vol- ume calculations, and other results show that this crown consists largely if not solely of viral RNA replication protein A (21, 26). Multiple advances resolved the nodavirus crown structure to ~8.5 Ă, revealing stacked rings of apical and basal lobes comprising a central turret with an interior floor and exterior legs (21) (Figure 4a,d). The crown interacts with the outer mitochondrial mem- brane both at the base of the central turret and at each leg, closely controlling the shape of the RC vesicle neck. Through these 12-fold repeated interactions, the crown stabilizes the high-energy
