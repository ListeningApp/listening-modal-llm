You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

wtse | 4. The theory of island biogeography and species richness depend on

2fb0 | Lecture 7 - Foraging Theory
s9fn | What is Optimal Foraging Theory, OPT?
k5r6 | . It is a behavioral ecology model that helps predict how an animal behaves when searching for food
z9v9 | Aim of the Optimal Foraging Theory
gpu9 | · To predict the foraging strategy of a forager/predator to be expected under specified condition
u5ws | O Important terminologies
onkh | . Ideal Free Distribution theory - theory which makes a case of uniform distribution of food for predators such that there is no need for foragers to switch foraging patches.
8t55 | · Functional response - deals with a predator's intake rate in response to variation in prey distribution and densities
7imw | · Aggregate response - explains how predators are distributed in response to prey availability
lf1t | · Total response = Functional response + Aggregate response
tze7 | Assumptions inherent in Optimal Foraging Theory
ryvv | 1. The foraging behaviour that is exhibited by present-day animals is the one that has been favoured by natural selection in the past but almost enhances an animal's fitness at present
zdrh | 2. High fitness is achieved by a high net rate of energy intake (i.e. gross energy intake minus the energetic costs of obtaining that energy)
osmo | 3. Experimental animals are observed in an environment to which their foraging behaviour is suited
0b8v | Scenarios which unjustify the OFT
fucs | 1. Other aspects of the organism's behaviour may influence fitness more than optimal foraging does. E.g. premium on avoidance of predators coercing animals to forage at places and at times associated with lower predation risk trading off efficiency in food gathering.
yply | 2. Variation in the efficiencies of energy gathering process exploiting different dietary constituents (e.g. nitrogen) by many consumers (herbivores and omnivores) creating the need for consumers to forage on a mixed and balanced diet.
75n5 | Theoreticians & Mathematicians
ec91 | . OFT makes predictions about foraging behaviour based on mathematical models
wul6 | · Important Question
4rhy | · Is it necessary for a real forager to be equally omniscient and mathematical, if it is to adopt the appropriate , optimal strategy?
092d | Theoreticians are omniscient mathematicians - the foragers need not be
94ul | · The answer is NO, because
0vdu | . Theory says that if a forager that in some way manages to do the right thing in the right circumstances, then this forager
a230 | 1. Will be favoured by natural selection
dvoe | 2. Possible inheritance of newly acquired abilities by future generations
677t | 3. Abilities spread, in evolutionary time, throughout the population
5hk6 | Parameterizing the OFT 1
viei | · Foraging entails predators expending time and energy in obtaining food (MacArthur & Pianka, 1966)
rk0j | · Intake rates of a predator is dependent on the searching (encounter rate) and handling (i.e. pursuing, subduing and consuming it) times of prey
c6x9 | · Generalists pursue (and may then subdue and consume) a large proportion of the prey types they encounter
g5at | · Specialists continue searching except when they encounter prey of their specifically preferred type
re3j | Parameterizing the OFT 2
6z45 | · Specialists will only pursue profitable prey items, but may expend a great deal of time and energy searching for them
20af | · Generalists will spend relatively little time searching but they will pursue both more or less profitable types of prey
huae | · An optimal forager should therefore balance the pros and cons so as to maximise its overall rate of energy intake
rblh | Parameterizing the OFT 3
gl5i | · Given that a predator already includes a certain number of profitable items in its diet, should it expand its diet (and thereby decrease its search time) by including the next most profitable item as well?
x0yg | · The next most profitable prey item for an optimal forager
mjt8 | Ei hi
htcn | Profitability =
86d4 | where E; is the energy content of the next most profitable ith prey item and h; its handling time
z7qp | · In addition, E / h is the average profitability of the 'present' diet (i.e. one that includes all prey types that are more profitable that i, but does not include prey type i itself), and
6t1g | · s is the average search time for the present diet
cpls | Parameterizing the OFT 4
m50n | · If a predator does pursue a prey item of type i, then its expected rate of energy intake is E;/h;
eztf | · If it ignores this prey item, whilst pursuing all those that are more profitable, then it can expect to search further. The total expected rate of energy intake
bwsu | E (5 +h)
oqod | where E is the average energy content, s is the average search time and h is the average handling time for the present diet
tey0 | Parameterizing the OFT 4
ghiv | . The most profitable, optimal strategy for a predator will be to pursue the ith item if, and only if
o5ts | Ei / hi > Ē / (5 + h)
hd7d | . The optimal diet model leads to a number of predictions
ehux | 1. Predators with shorter handling times than search times should be generalists, because the short times taken to handle prey items already found would allow them to commence searching for another prey.
poxj | 2. Predators with longer handling times than search times should be specialists because once a prey has been seen and began to be handled (include pursuit), the predator cannot go in for another food. Therefore, such predators should go in for the most profitable prey. 12
2xvb | Parameterizing the OFT 5
m1hx | 3. Predators should have broader diets in unproductive environments (where prey items are relatively rare and s is relatively large) than in a productive environment (where s is smaller)
9psh | 4. Predators should ignore insufficiently profitable food types irrespective of their abundance
aiqv | 5. Provides a context for understanding the narrow specialization of predators that live in intimate association with their prey. Since their whole lifestyle and life cycle are finely tuned to those of their prey, handling time is low.
4klz | · Two studies of optimal diet choice that show a clear but limited
xz5d | correspondence with the predictions of the optimal diet model. Diets are more specialised at high prey densities; but more low profitability items are included than predicted by the theory
