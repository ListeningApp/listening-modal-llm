You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

2e62 | The survey relies on 38 kHz as the primary acoustic frequency to estimate Pacific hake biomass, although additional frequencies as available on the U.S. and Canadian survey vessels are also used to help distinguish hake from other acoustic targets. Acoustic backscatter attributed to Pacific hake is scaled to biomass or abundance using a length-based model of target strength (TS), the log-transformed acoustic backscatter expected from a single fish or unit biomass. In 1995, this model was changed from a weight-based TS of -35 dB/kg to a TS-length relation of <LATEX>T S = 2 0 \log L - 6 8</LATEX> (Traynor, 1996), where <LATEX>L</LATEX> is fork length in centimetres. Variability in Pacific hake TS has continued to be an active area of research (e.g. Henderson and Horne, 2007); data from the most recent field measurements (Fleischer et al., unpub- lished data) were generally consistent with mean and variation indicated in Traynor (1996).
75y3 | Sources of uncertainty in the acoustic surveys of Pacific hake abundance involve climate-ocean effects on distribution and availability of fish to the sur- vey, the ability to acoustically differentiate Pacific hake from other acoustic targets and the uncertainty in Pacific hake TS. For example, the current stock assessment models use the acoustic-based survey biomass indices from 1995 to present only, excluding the earlier surveys that had reduced spatial cover- age and used a different TS model. A second example of the uncertainty in acoustic surveys occurred during the 2009 acoustic survey with the northward expansion of Humboldt squid into the CCLME. Several factors make it diffi- cult to acoustically distinguish Humboldt squid and Pacific hake: the TS and frequency response of Humboldt squid are similar to those of Pacific hake. There was overlap in the depth and geographic ranges of both species in 2009, and squid predation may cause an avoidance response leading to altered aggre- gation behaviour in hake (Holmes et al., 2008). Because the proportions of backscatter attributable to hake and Humboldt squid were based on limited information, the estimated uncertainty (CV) of the acoustic survey biomass estimate was higher in 2009 than in other survey years (Stewart and Hamel, 2010). Further irruptions of Humboldt squid have not been observed during hake acoustic surveys since 2009.

cb7r | 9.6 Assessment and management strategy evaluation
68xu | Age-structured models have been used to model the population dynamics of the coastal stock of Pacific hake since the early 1980s. Cohort analyses were replaced by statistical catch-at-age models by the early 1990s. These latter mod- els provide a time series of estimates of total biomass, biomass-at-age, spawn- ing biomass and age-0 recruits. The current assessment model relies on catch, survey indices, weight-at-age and age composition data. The 2013 assessment estimated a mean unfished female spawning biomass of a little more than 2 million tonnes, with a female spawning biomass at the beginning of 2013 of 1.5 million tonnes, or 72% of unfished equilibrium female spawning biomass. Assessments have consistently found that the population dynamics of Pacific hake are characterised by infrequent large year classes, including from the years 1980, 1984 and 1999, and potentially 2008 and 2010. These large year classes have sustained the population, through long periods with moderate to low recruitments.
hd35 | Prior to 1997, separate Canadian and U.S. assessments for Pacific hake were submitted to each nation's assessment review process, which resulted in differ- ing yield options being forwarded to each country's managers for this shared trans-boundary fish stock. Multiple interpretations of Pacific hake status made it difficult to coordinate an overall management policy. From 1997 through 2010, the Stock Assessment and Review process for the PFMC in the United States evaluated assessment models and the PFMC council process, includ- ing NOAA Fisheries, has generated management advice that has been largely utilised by both nations. In 2003, the United States and Canada signed the Treaty, which specifies science and management processes. The terms of the treaty were not fully implemented until 2012, but stock assessments and man- agement activities have conformed to the treaty for many years (Helser et al., 2006; Hamel and Stewart, 2009; JTC 2012, 2013). Under the Treaty, Pacific hake stock assessments are prepared by the JTC composed of both U.S. and Canadian scientists and reviewed by the SRG, with members of both groups appointed by both Parties to the agreement. In 2012, after formal appoint- ments were made to Treaty-specific committees, the stock was assessed and managed under the full auspices of the treaty for the first time. Between 2003 and 2011, the Parties honoured the intent of the Treaty during its implementa- tion, which included joint stock assessment reviews and allocations to the each country based on the Treaty allocation structure.
2zpk | The 2013 assessment (JTC, 2013) was a fully Bayesian assessment conducted using the Stock Synthesis modelling platform (Methot and Wetzel, 2013), with the base-case model incorporating prior information on two key parameters (natural mortality, M, and steepness of the stock-recruit relationship, h) and integrating over estimation and parameter uncertainty to provide results that could be probabilistically interpreted. The base case model showed large vari- ations in Pacific hake biomass over the past four decades (Figure 9.7), largely related to variation in recruitment (Figure 9.5), with an apparent strong year

b780 | The 2013 assessment (JTC, 2013) estimated that the stock was, in fact, not overfished in the early 2000s (reaching a low of 32.3% of unfished biomass in 2000), but in contrast did meet the overfished definition in 2009 (at 20.4% of unfished biomass). As the official declaration of overfished status in the United States applies only to a current estimate, and as Pacific hake are now managed under an international treaty that does not include an 'overfished' definition, the retrospective 2009 estimate in the 2012 assessment does not impact current management.

The years from 2004 to 2007 fixed the acoustic survey catchability (q) at 0.6 or 1.0 and are shown as solid thin line with dots indicating q= 0.6. The recent assessments are shown as thick gray lines with 2008-2011 being a period of separate U.S. and Canadian models with quotas determined by the Pacific Fishery Management Council, and 2012-2013 representing recent management of hake using a single cooperative model managed under an agreement between the United States and Canada.
y7ea | stock biomass and status (Figure 9.8). Among-model variability (particularly in the early portion of the time series) is greater than the uncertainty esti- mated in any individual assessment (Figure 9.7), and a substantial trend of diminishing variability is not apparent. The treatment of one parameter in particular, the catchability (q; e.g. Hilborn and Walters, 1992) of the acoustic survey, has changed over time. Prior to 2004, this value was assumed to be 1, meaning that the fully selected portions of the stock (based on age or length) were fully available to the survey and that the survey covered the entire latitudinal and longitudinal distribution of Pacific hake (and, as mentioned previously, the TS relationship was correct). During 2004-2007, two values for the catchability coefficient (q) were used to parameterise what were considered equally plausible alternative models. Since this time, q for the acoustic survey has been freely estimated within the assessment models, which has the effect of increasing the apparent uncertainty in the assessment results, as the uncertainty in q is now accounted for (rather than ignored) in the model. In reality, the assessment is more certain than before given the addition of much more and higher quality data.
nav4 | A Management Strategy Evaluation (MSE) (Butterworth and Punt, 1999; Cox and Kronlund, 2008) was developed in 2012. The initial goal was to explore the performance of the current default harvest control rule and the performance of stock assessment and management with annual versus biennial

k78w | acoustic surveys. Using results from the 2012 assessment (JTC, 2012), the MSE model simulated a known population forward in time under four scenarios: no fishing, catches determined from perfect knowledge of the spawning biomass, and catches predicted using simulated data with either annual or biennial surveys supplied to an assessment model with a similar setup to the 2012 assessment. Preliminary results show good progress in developing an MSE with the need for additional input from industry and managers. Although the assumptions were simplistic and the results are not recommended to be used for management advice, they do suggest that the default harvest rate (F40%) would result in an average female spawning biomass slightly below B40%, but with high variability (with median biomass near B30%). Decreasing the default harvest rate towards F50%would result in larger average and median biomass (median biomass near B40%) with little change to average long-term catch, and while reducing the inter-annual variability in catch and biomass.
g9du | 9.7 Products and markets
f682 | In product form, Pacific hake is a white-fleshed, mild-tasting fish. The early stages of the Pacific hake fishery produced mainly fillets, headed and gutted products, and fish meal, mostly for foreign markets. Initially, there was very little market in either the United States or Canada for the catch, due to prob- lems with rapid softening of the flesh related to the presence of the parasites in the genus Kudoa (Kabata and Whitaker, 1985). By the early 1990s, quality problems were overcome by rapid cooling techniques and enzyme inhibitors, and the development of processed Pacific hake products, such as surimi, has made the fishery more profitable (Methot and Dorn, 1995).
li1k | Development of large-scale domestic fisheries was thought infeasible throughout the 1980s due to product quality concerns, cost of production and impediments to markets (Anderson 1985). Nonetheless, domestic capacity increased rapidly in the fishery. A unique problem with Pacific hake from the coastal stock is an endogenous protease produced in reaction to a muscle parasite (Kudoa thrysites). This parasite can cause proteolytic muscle disinte- gration, which can reduce the gel-forming ability of myofibrillar proteins in Pacific hake surimi. However, protease inhibitors can be added to the minced Pacific hake muscle to maintain gel-forming ability. The most effective pro- tease inhibitors include bovine blood plasma proteins, egg white, potato-based inhibitors, or whey. In 2003, concerns about the use of bovine blood plasma, because of its potential relationship with 'mad cow' disease, affected certain markets for Pacific hake surimi (Hui, 2006).
pbea | Developments in food science and improved handling of Pacific hake onboard vessels and in processing plants have eliminated various impediments to production and marketability of Pacific hake. For example, use of cold temperature-based processes now allows for surimi production without the use of protease inhibitors.
ccpt | 256
0fpw | Throughout the contemporary history of the fishery, most of the catch were processed into surimi, which is used to make shellfish analogues. In about 2003, the hake industries in both the United States and Canada began developing highly mechanised processing facilities to handle fish as efficiently as possi- ble and to expand the diversity of product forms. Currently, higher economic return comes from the production of non-surimi forms, such as headed and gutted products, fillets and blocks. These forms now dominate production. While Pacific hake has never been a high-value fish, the total revenue to the industry is in the tens of millions of U.S. dollars per year - over 50 million dol- lars per year in recent years - and the market for Pacific hake remains strong.
