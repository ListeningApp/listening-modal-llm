Unsuccessful attainment of 'stable periodontitis' P equals point one two two one and 'endpoints of therapy' P equals point zero eight eight six failed to reach statistical significance for association with tooth loss. PPVs and NPVs of the five subject-level endpoints ranged between five point one percent 'controlled periodontitis' and P P D less than six millimeters and twenty point six percent 'stable periodontitis' and between ninety-seven point eight percent 'controlled periodontitis' and ninety-nine point nine percent 'stable periodontitis', respectively. Studies following conventional APT showed statistically significant associations for not achieving 'controlled periodontitis' R R equals two point seven eight, P equals point zero zero six eight and PPD less than five millimeters R R equals one point seven zero, P equals point zero one seven nine over an average SPC period of twelve point seven five years. Supplemental Material S six reports results relative to studies reporting periodontitis-related tooth loss. Heterogeneity in subject-level studies and analyses varied from unimportant to substantial but did not seem to affect the direction of effects but affected only the precision with which the summary effect was calculated. Contour-enhanced funnel plots showed small sample bias among all meta-analyses. Studies showing statistically significant results were most frequently found in analyses of 'controlled periodontitis' and â€˜PPD less than six millimeters'.\nfucs | Tooth-level data\nyply | Of twenty-nine thousand eight hundred nine teeth in subjects who were in SPC during an average period of nine point eight eight years, three point one four percent, nine hundred thirty-six, were extracted for all reasons. Non-achievement of all endpoints at the tooth level was statistically significant and associated with an increased risk of tooth loss 'stable periodontitis' R R equals ten point three three; P less than point zero zero zero one; 'endpoints of therapy' R R equals sixteen point three four; P equals point zero zero one; P P D less than five millimeters R R equals nine point six six; P less than point zero zero zero one; PPD less than six millimeters R R equals ten point eight seven; P less than point zero zero zero one. The results remained largely unchanged in sub-analyses of studies following conventional APT and those reporting periodontitis-related tooth loss.\n75n5 | PPVs and NPVs of the four tooth-level endpoints ranged between twelve point eight percent, PPD less than six millimeters, and fifteen point one percent 'stable periodontitis' and",
