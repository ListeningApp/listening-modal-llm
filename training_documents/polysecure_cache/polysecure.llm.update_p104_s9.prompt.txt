You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

11zj | Through working with individuals, couples and polycules, I have seen people try many different courses of action when there is attachment insecurity in a polyamorous context. These options range from completely closing up a rela- tionship, to taking a temporary dating pause or having certain relationship limits, to staying completely open. Each of these has its pros and cons, with certain re- strictions and certain freedoms. While it is extremely difficult to experience polyin- security, is also difficult to be asked to change your behavior to support your
dza1 | insecure partner. When deciding which of these potential options would be best for you and your relationships, it is good to remember that attachment work is more about the marathon than the sprint. Two important factors to consider are:
5gil | 1. How severe is the attachment insecurity? Is it mild, moderate or severe to the point of interfering with functionality, well-being or mental health?
n91l | 2. How much damage could be caused for the partners who are not experi- encing attachment insecurity, based on how open or closed an individual or pairing of partners decides they are going to be? There is an important dis- tinction here between damage and discomfort. Some of the below options might not be comfortable for everyone involved, but they should not be damaging. Even if some of these options are uncomfortable and not what you would necessarily choose in your ideal situation, they should still be considered as temporary choices or compromises that you are willing to make because they feel worth it for the health of your relationship or poly- cule, versus options that are damaging to you, your partners or your meta- mours.
iknb | Closing Up:
3ohm | When attachment insecurity is at play, one option is to temporarily close up. Clos- ing up typically looks like both you and your partner getting off the dating apps and taking a complete break from seeing any people you have been talking to or even dating. Basically, you're going back to monogamy for a moment. Temporarily clos- ing up to focus on healing your attachment can be helpful, especially when there is more severe attachment insecurity. The caveats here are that attachment healing does not happen overnight and there will probably never be a point where you are 100 percent healed and feel absolutely ready to open up again, so at some point you will have to face the discomfort of moving forward into nonmonogamy. Ideally you will only do this when you and/or your partner have enough inner foundation and interpersonal strength to weather the storm. I've seen closing up work best in the following situations:
enn6 | . You are currently single and you decide to refrain from dating or entering into a relationship until you feel more capable and ready to relate from a secure place.
voir | . You are in a relationship that is new to opening up where one or both part- ners are experiencing attachment insecurity and neither of you has any other relationships that you would be deserting or harming by closing up.
bxm5 | . You are not new to nonmonogamy and you and your one partner are in a phase where you don't have other relationships.
6cnd | . You are not new to nonmonogamy and you have multiple partners and meta- mours, but they are genuinely alright with taking a break while you do the at- tachment work needed in your primary relationship. Typically, these other relationships are not as attachment-based.
z41z | Taking a Pause:
k1hn | A few steps further along from completely closing up is taking a pause. Unlike when an individual or a couple completely closes up and stops pursuing any other relationships, a person or a couple taking a pause may maintain some of their cur- rent connections, but press the pause button on progressing in those relationships for a certain amount of time. In this scenario, a person might still talk and message with partners as friends or spend time together in person, but they are temporarily stepping back from the more romantic or sexual dimensions of those relation- ships. For some people this can be a very supportive option since you don't have to completely let go of certain connections that may be of importance to you, but you can also temporarily have a rest from the added attachment stress of multiple partners. One person I worked with called her version of a pause her attachment sabbatical. She informed all of her partners that she had no intention of ending or changing their relationships, but she was choosing to be out of contact for six weeks to do her own inner attachment work. After six weeks, she planned to return to the relationships as if she had just been away on a retreat during that time. In her case, all of her partners were able to accommodate her sabbatical and they
853d | agreed to only make contact in case of an emergency. I've seen a pause work when:
px3f | · The person initiating the pause is doing so with partners who they are less entwined with or committed to.
28wa | . The person initiating the pause does have partners who they are more en- twined with or committed to, but these partners are able to fully consent to the pause, usually because they have other partners to turn to for romance or sex, they are in a very secure place themselves and/or the pause is temporary enough that they are willing to wait.
1jce | . People are more oriented to relationship anarchy or relationship fluidity and everyone involved is able to smoothly shift back and forth from being more or less romantically/sexually involved.
jfbn | Creating a Vessel:
cn1a | When there is attachment insecurity within a polycule, I've seen people adopt a form of temporary polyfidelity where all current relationships stay as they are, but no new partners are added to the mix. This may mean either that all partners are polyfidelitous for a certain amount of time or that just some are. A married polyamorous couple that I work with coined their version of this "the vessel." In their case, the husband was experiencing a more severe form of attachment inse- curity that was rooted in his childhood, but was getting repeatedly triggered by his wife having two other partners and several potential suitors in the wings. When he and I first started our sessions together he wasn't sure if he could do any version of polyamory, but as we identified the root of his struggles, the idea of a temporary vessel became a more preferable option than scrapping polyamory all together. In their own words:
0j5u | The husband:
u6dp | Coming to polyamory from swinging, I was accustomed to the safety of sharing ex- periences with my wife. The first year of polyamory left me floundering. Instead of bonding with my wife, I felt abandoned by the ease with which she could navigate polyamory and the difficulty I had in finding the sensual and sexual experiences that
hnb4 | I also craved.
a0sw | My anxious attachment style was fostered during my traumatic childhood, but definitely tickled by the multi-weekly dates that my wife was going on, as I stayed home with the children and tried to put a good and supportive face on. One image that kept occurring to me was two birds in flight, with the difference in their altitude representing the difference in their polyamorous experiences. My wife constantly soared higher than me, and at times I felt as though she'd lose sight of me, aban- doning me for others and other experiences.
aak4 | The concept of a vessel came about during one of my therapy sessions with Jess. I realized that it was the expansion of the number of partners that my wife had that was more anxiety-producing than the depth and closeness that she had with her cur- rent partners, which for me was beautiful and non-threatening. It was the antici- pation of the breadth of partners that was triggering me, not depth.
7l7y | The vessel that my wife and I negotiated was four months long, where she con- tinued to be with her two other partners in addition to me, but she would not add any new partners to our polycule. The idea was she could experience as much depth in those months with the two partners as she wanted, but she wouldn't look to ex- pand her breadth with new partners during this time.
