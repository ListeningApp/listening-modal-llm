        "content": "gvwz | Some aspects were deliberately simplified or omitted in the modelling. First, we did not model HIV because pediatric HIV rates in Ethiopia and Indonesia are relatively low at zero point zero nine percent and zero point zero three percent, respectively. This may underestimate the benefit from the intervention due to underestimated TB mortality, especially if stool-based\nsk5m | methods are more effective at diagnosing TB in children with HIV compared with sputum. Second, we did not model drug-resistant TB because of low rates of multidrug-resistant TB among new TB cases (all ages) in Ethiopia (one point zero two percent) and Indonesia (two point four percent). This may underestimate the intervention costs since the higher fractions of cases bacteriologically confirmed via Xpert MTB/Rif mean that more MDR TB will be diagnosed and require more costly second-line treatment. Third, we did not consider the private sector,\n877u | which in Indonesia is substantial, and less likely to closely follow guidelines. Our intervention is conceived as being implemented in the public sector, but patients seeking care across both sectors may mean we overestimate the savings to the public health system from reduced referrals. Fourth, for pragmatic reasons, country-specific primary cost analyses were not performed and additional one-off programmatic costs for widely introducing Xpert stool testing, such as costs for training and supervision, were not included in our analyses. Both countries are moving to fully replacing SSM by Xpert testing as the primary diagnostic for TB in all patient groups. This may increase logistical issues in both countries which need to be dealt with, such as cartridge shelf life (which is shorter for the Ultra than the G four cartridge) and module maintenance. Lastly, we modeled the impact of making a stool Xpert-based diagnosis available at the PHC level. The analysis also assumes that all PHC facilities have access to a GeneXpert machine, either on-site or through an effective sample transportation system. Thus, until full access to Xpert testing is available, the coverage of the intervention will be limited.\nrzhj | Furthermore, due to the lack of data from randomized controlled trials and operational studies, we were reliant on early experience to determine acceptability and feasibility of stool-based sampling and diagnostics. Hence, difficulties in implementation that dilute effects or increase costs may be overlooked. However, the recent recommendation to use stool as a primary sample for diagnosing childhood TB has generated interest in Xpert stool testing at national TB programs. Although we used an illustrative high acceptability rate for stool, this is supported by early experience from the two countries and recently published evidence. Apart from the SOS stool method, two other centrifuge-free stool processing methods are being developed, which are included in a head-to-head comparison study to compare their performance in diagnosing childhood TB against sputum or gastric aspirate culture. This project has a health economic component, estimating cost-effectiveness of the best performing method. Results of this project are expected at the end of twenty twenty-one. The TB Speed decentralization operational research study will report results from use of Xpert on nasopharyngeal aspirate and stool samples at PHC level in early twenty twenty-two. A small study comparing the SOS stool method to the stool processing kit involved in the head-to-head comparison study concluded that taking into account the sample processing time, consumable requirements and error rates, the SOS stool method would be the method that would be best scalable in low-income and middle-income countries.\nbfax | Additional evidence from studies and implementation is needed to inform the optimal use of new sample and diagnostic approaches for pediatric TB within real health systems. Studies to quantify referral patterns, the pathways and outcomes of individual patients, and the costs of real-world implementation would be particularly valuable. Further analyses could include context-specific\nf2y8 | operational research to help design referral systems that best use Xpert machines and minimize cartridge expiry, as well as budget impact analyses to help national programs plan roll-out and seek funding. Clinical diagnosis remains an important tool for children with TB; helping clinicians diagnose TB in children without bacteriological results or with negative results should be part of intervention design and the role of clinical diagnosis in current and novel diagnostic pathways a topic for further research. The importance of clinical TB diagnosis for children limits the potential impact of bacteriological diagnostics.\no7qm | Conclusion\nd52l | In this modeling analysis, we projected that introduction of routine stool-based Xpert diagnostics at primary healthcare and hospital level would increase the proportion of bacteriologically confirmed TB in children, while reducing child mortality and life-years lost in both Ethiopia and Indonesia. Our analysis suggests that this intervention would be cost-effective in both countries.\nqlbb | Funding This work was funded by the TB Modelling and Analysis Consortium.
