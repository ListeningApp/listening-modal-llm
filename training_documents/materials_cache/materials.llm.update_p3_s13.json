Therefore, we periodically update the values of D minimum and D maximum depending on the network of CBs that are also renewed periodically. The network is determined from the maximization problem of the number of CBs given by\n7um8 | plus S Ein plus dot dot dot plus S M E M n M plus (CB)\nuow2 | maximize\niat7 | CB is less than or equal to N CB\nywwr | subject to\n0i6j | N I\n87cq | CBA is less than or equal to N CBA\n0qs3 | N I J T CB\nz8f7 | Seventeen\n7w7j | S I J T T I J T less than or equal to two D CB, max\n51vd | plus CB S I S I I R J I J T less than or equal to min\nbaj1 | C I J A T q\nn1wo | where zero is less than E is the fixed bonding affinity, N I J T CBA is the number of common bridging atoms between the pair of atoms I and J T, N CBA is the default maximum number of common bridging atoms defined in Equation eighteen, and Q is an index for selecting N I indices of anions J T randomly. The third constraints define the formation ranges of CBs. The fourth constraints force cations to create CBs with the nearest N I anions. The optimization problem can be solved as follows: First, all the cations create as many CBs as possible with neighboring anions, and seconds, we erase CBs with maximizing the object function of Equation seventeen until all the number of common bridging atoms satisfy the second constraints. Note that two polyhedra are linked by sharing a common vertex, a common edge, or a common face that corresponds to sharing one, two, or more than two common bridging atoms, respectively.\n5bq3 | To find the optimal solutions, we solve the problems of Equations two and seventeen alternately. The optimization scheme is shown in Figure two. A random initial structure can be infeasible solution, in fact, not all cations may not be surrounded by oxygen ions and may not have desirable coordination numbers. Besides, even if all the atoms have the desirable coordination numbers, the structure does not necessarily satisfy all the geometrical constraints such as the maximum number of common bridging atoms. Therefore, the global geometrical optimization is aimed at transforming the structure largely enough to create a different network of CBs by large Ax max. After the small number of global geometrical optimization steps,\nezla | CB, max equals R I plus R J\nrsbu | I\nmagd | D I T\ntb74 | equals one point two R T plus R one\n8l69 | I plus R I\n1jyv | D I T\nolce | C\nerx1 | C\nb3bt | I plus R\n0w8m | D A I T\nvcu3 | PC, max\nhjzj | as discussed in main text\nj79f | we solve the problem of Equation seventeen once again to update the network of CBs. The mutable network and the other geometrical constraints assist cations making coordination polyhedra, and accordingly, the structure is transformed into a feasible solution. If the structure satisfies the condition of Equation fifteen, the structure is locally optimized by small Ax max to identify whether the structure can be the optimal solution of the geometrical optimization problem given by Equation two. If so, the structure is the optimal solution of the paired optimization problems. If not, the structure is globally optimized again after annealing. The parameters of global and local optimization are detailed in Supplementary Information.\n6tbv | To estimate the number of optimal solutions and coarsely classify the optimal solutions, we define a structural fingerprint as the bundle of the fingerprints by the lists of geometrical constraints LGCs in dictionary order. LGCs are defined as what kinds of geometrical constraints are formed with the adjacent atoms. The fingerprint of LGC enumerates the element symbols of the adjacent atoms linked by CBs, PCs, and ACs in dictionary order, respectively. Note that there is a possibility that the same structure fingerprint is assigned to different structures. For example, the fingerprint for the rutile structure and A P b O two is the case. See also Supplementary Information.\nxb13 | The paired mathematical programming approach is aimed at showcasting capabilities of simple rules to search structural prototypes of crystals. In this study, we introduce eleven kinds of cations shown in Table two to reproduce a wide variety of coordination polyhedra. The eleven cations are selected by considering closed packed polyhedra consisting of the centered cation and surrounding oxygen ions, and defined by R I, R J, N CB, and N CBA, where N CBA is the default maximum number of common bridging atoms. We determine N CBA in the second constraint of Equation seventeen as\ncxqi | N CBA equals min N CBA N CBA.\nqfmx | Eighteen\nrut3 | Cationic radius C N N in Nat corresponds to the minimum radius so that the cation can connect N oxygen ions, while C O corresponds to the ionic radius of oxygen ion. They are given in Supplementary Information. If the minimum and maximum cationic radii are the same, the cation is a hard sphere; if not, the cation is a soft sphere,\nm3cp | because the bonding lengths can vary within the two radii.\nmq4s | We apply our mathematical programming model to several compositions of cations, and find that a wide variety of real crystals are discovered in the optimal solutions by the paired mathematical programming. Table three shows the number of discovered optimal solutions for each composition, which seems to be much smaller than the number of local minima in the total energy by ab initio simulations, and corresponding real crystals found in them. We discuss here results by focusing on aspects of the generated coordination polyhedra.\n95el | The optimal solutions of H T y T M O N form a wide variety of linked-polyhedra composed of tetrahedra and octahedra as shown in Figure three. The cations T and H T are placed in the tetrahedral and octahedral sites, respectively, in the Barrow-packings consisting of oxygen ions. Many structures are rejected from the optimal solutions by the constraints of the maximum number of common bridging atoms of T. The spinel structure has the lowest number of LGCs and highest symmetry, found as one of the optimal solutions for both the H T four T two zero eight and H T eight T four zero one six, while the G A two O three structure, which is composed of five LGCs with the C two M symmetry, has more LGCs and lower symmetry than the structure shown in Figure three D. Real crystal structures are not necessarily the optimal solution composed of the lowest number of LGCs and highest symmetry, however, they are generally good indicators to assess expectations of the structures to be realized by real crystals. The optimal solution shown in Figure three C is similar to the crystal structure of L I two W O four; the difference comes from the sizes of the unit cells. The crystal structure of L I two W O four is composed of large tetrahedra and octahedra around lithiums, but this structure may be reproduced by using cations H T and T, which are placed\na0a5 | in the octahedral and tetrahedral sites in the Barrow-packings consisting of oxygens, as the optimal solution of H T sixteen T eight O thirty-two. Figure three F shows the layered structure terminated by tetrahedra and octahedra. This optimal solution is composed of the lowest number of LGCs in H T five T three O twelve.\n```",
