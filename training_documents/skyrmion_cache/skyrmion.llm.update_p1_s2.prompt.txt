You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

jt0y | Quantum skyrmion lattices in Heisenberg ferromagnets
qb7o | Skyrmions are topological magnetic textures that can arise in noncentrosymmetric ferromagnetic materials. In most systems experimentally investigated to date, skyrmions emerge as classical objects. However, the discovery of skyrmions with nanometer length scales has sparked interest in their quantum properties. Here, we simulate the ground states of two-dimensional spin-1/2 Heisenberg lattices with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions and discover a broad region in the zero-temperature phase diagram which hosts quantum skyrmion lattices. We argue that the quantum skyrmion lattice phase can be detected experimentally in the magnetization profile via local magnetic polarization measurements as well as in the spin structure factor measurable via neutron scattering experiments. Finally, we explore the resulting quantum skyrmion state, analyze its real-space polarization profile and show that it is a nonclassical state featuring entanglement between quasiparticle and environment mainly localized near the boundary spins of the skyrmion.
oae5 | I. INTRODUCTION
s0fl | Magnetic skyrmions are vortexlike quasiparticles charac- terized by a nontrivial topological invariant in real space [1-4]. These states are typically found in noncentrosymmetric ferromagnets in a certain range of external magnetic field and temperature, and are stabilized by an antisymmetric spin exchange energy, termed Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) [1]. After their first detection in a magnetic system by a neutron diffraction experiment in 2009 [5], and a full tomography by electron microscopy in 2010 [6], intense follow-up studies revealed intriguing dynamical properties, rendering skyrmions potentially useful for memory and com- puting devices [7-11]. Usually, the skyrmions encountered in these systems arise from thermal fluctuations and extend over length scales that are much larger than the interatomic distance and thus behave like classical objects. Other possi- bilities to create skyrmions are through suitable de current devices, such as those proposed in Refs. [12,13]. However, smaller skyrmions do exist [14] and have already created interest in possible quantum properties of skyrmions. Several works have predicted the quantum behavior of skyrmions by using classical magnetic textures as a starting point and study- ing quantum corrections in the semiclassical ferromagnetic regime [15-19].
43ia | Beyond this semiclassical limit, some works have indicated that quantum analogs of classical skyrmions might exist in spin systems. The authors of Ref. [20] used a multiscale
3g2y | approach to demonstrate that mesoscopic magnetization vor- tices are stabilized by quantum fluctuations [18,21], which suggests the possibility of inherently quantum-mechanical counterparts of these states at zero temperature. So far, at- tempts to classify skyrmion excitations with sizes comparable to the interatomic spacing have been made in frustrated quan- tum lattice systems [22] and ferromagnetic lattices with DMI [23,24]. Several geometries have been studied to understand the quantum analogs of classical skyrmions, and quantitative results have been obtained by numerical diagonalization of the Hamiltonian [22-24]. Since the dimension of the quantum Hamiltonian scales exponentially with the number of lattice sites, such exact diagonalization (ED) strategies are limited to small system sizes containing at most ~30 spin-1/2 sites (without exploiting symmetries). Although DMI interactions are among the most popular to investigate the formation of classical skyrmion phases, their quantum analogs are analyt- ically hard to handle and quantitative results beyond system sizes amenable for ED are still lacking. As an alternative route to quantum skyrmions that avoids DMI, frustrated spin lattice systems were studied in Ref. [22]. Using ED for small systems and analytical spin-wave theory, the authors identified skyrmions with magnon bound states and developed a phe- nomenological theory based on a trial wave function.
gc7v | Here, we use the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm to explore ferromagnetic phases of quantum spin-1/2 Heisenberg models with DMI and uni- axial anisotropy. As our main result, we discover a zero- temperature quantum phase with a nontrivial magnetic spin texture that signals an emergent quantum skyrmion lattice. This phase was previously overlooked because it appears only beyond a critical system size which for realistic parameters is larger than the system sizes amenable to ED. We iden- tify three ferromagnetic phases that can be directly observed and distinguished in the space-resolved magnetization pro- file. Furthermore, we argue that the polarization gives access to the zero-temperature phase diagram of the model under
wqfv | investigation. Contrary to similar quasiparticles found in frus- trated lattices [22] or quantum skyrmions embedded in a classical magnet [24], we show that the skyrmion lattice phase reported here emerges from entangled <LATEX>s p i n - 1 / 2</LATEX> pairs, which bear witness to a genuine quantum mechanical origin without classical analog, a feature that may pave the way toward a microscopic description of skyrmion qubits used for realizing quantum logic elements based on nanoscale devices [25].
