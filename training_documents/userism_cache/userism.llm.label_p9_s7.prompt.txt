You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

w95z | HCI is exemplary in identifying limitations of existing systems, both in their practical usage and in the design work behind their development. However, relatively little work connects limitations arising from our conceptualization of the user with design work that addresses those limitations.
0i1k | This situation stems in part from HCI's pragmatic tendency to focus on specific domains. For example, while doctors acting on behalf of their patients when managing medical records is certainly a form of indirection, design interventions based on such an observation will likely be limited to medical informatics as a domain. However, there are certainly connections between this case and others, such as intermediary users observed in an ICTD context [75]. This similarity offers but one example. More generally, relationships within ecologies of subject positions have commonalities, but those commonalities are difficult to connect across different domains within HCI. It is for this reason that we intentionally drew on examples from multiple domains to demonstrate how the structure of the user causes problems across many different application areas.
dqlg | Scholarship that makes use of the practical strategies we have enumerated would benefit the community by explicitly sharing:
p6pq | · How did we, as researchers or as designers, realize we were facing a post-user scenario?
zse6 | · What were the relevant subject positions in our scenario?
p2n3 | · What were the relationships among them?
ohh7 | · How did we represent that ecology of subject positions and their relationships across different levels in our design?
vbni | · What were the repercussions of the representations we used?
dgcw | While much of the work in HCI implicitly does the above, it does so while presuming the centrality of the user. Rather

sk5m | than suggest that we start ignoring the user, post-userism encourages HCI researchers and practitioners to look beyond the user for the additional subjects and relationships to which the primacy of the user can blind us. Explicitly addressing the above questions will help scholars and practitioners make use of a post-userist lens beyond the ideological level and engage levels of representation more directly pertinent to design, problem setting [28,77,78], and technical implementation.
qws8 | In Absence of the User
877u | The second path forward asks that we explore what HCI might look like in the absence of the traditional user. User as a construct runs into trouble because it both feeds into and is a product of the idea that we are designing with the human at the center. Post-userism serves to question what our field places at the center of its practices. What are the types of actors, entities, and concepts around which we can center?
rzhj | We have seen efforts to broaden HCI's scope. Terms like "human-centered computing" and "human centered design," however, are often clever slights of hand. They acknowledge the limitations of the user (particularly as conceptualized in first wave), and adopt a more holistic alternative: "human." Yet in practice, we very quickly revert to making the human a user. This is particularly true in how we represent people at the systems and interface levels, where the human must be represented as a computational entity [19].
bfax | An alternative can be reached when we start to acknowledge HCI's user as a modernist and structuralist project. The user gives HCI a common foundation-a "person" to design for-but one that limits us as well. As others have suggested [84], we might instead think of design-and especially "interaction"-as a set of relational practices. The "user" captures a set of relationships and provides a framework through which practices are constructed. However, this framework, we have argued, by no means captures all relationships.
f2y8 | CONCLUSION
o7qm | In this paper we introduced post-userism, a critique of HCI's focus on the "user." We have argued that HCI conceptualizes humans as users in how it designs and researches interactions. "User-ifying" people presents two challenges: first, it reduces the person into a construct that is not able to handle the complexity of human experience, and second, places a burden on this construct to account for the entirety of what is "human" in human-computer interaction.
d52l | A post-userist approach, then, accomplishes two things: First, by highlighting the limitations of "user," post-userism provides a means to identify and address types of interactions for which the construct of user cannot account and, as a result, ways the user limits us in our design and research practices. Second, by challenging the construct of

hy0l | the user itself, post-userism encourages us to explore what HCI might look like in the absence of a traditional user. Put differently, does the field needs better ways to engage and design for the "human" in HCI, or do the blurred lines between human and computer [47] suggest that other actors [63] might be legitimate sites on which to focus our research and design practices? Ultimately, this paper aims to support such conversations about the center around which our discipline is organized.
