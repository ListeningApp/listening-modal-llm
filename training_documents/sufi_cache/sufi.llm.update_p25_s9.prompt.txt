You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

qe3d | Attaining Knowledge
od26 | Q: How can I attain knowledge of myself? I look at organisa- tions and institutions, such as schools or universities, or business enterprises or professions, and I can see that they have estab- lished reputations. They also have enrolment and recruitment, and they have objectives. For instance, if I become a politician I am aiming for cabinet rank; if I want to study medicine it is in order to become a practising doctor or a research worker or a teacher. When I approach Sufi ideas, whether through books or individuals, I find that a similar kind of coherence is not there: or if it is, I cannot find it. I often become confused, and I have met many other people who are also confused, who are trying the same thing. Because of this I also feel that an answer to this question would be of great value to many other people who believe that there must be truth and value in Sufi thought and activity, because it has continually produced great people, but that the 'way in* and the curricula are baffling.
l4k6 | A: It is interesting, not as a lesson in what Sufis are like, or what the Sufi enterprise is about, to look at these words, for they display, very clearly, what people are like, and we will see in a moment, how easily one can answer them by using materials, analogies and ways of thought which they would have been able to use for themselves if they had really been as analytical and co- herent as they imagine they are.
y4a0 | First it must be said that it is precisely because someone thinks like this that he is baffled. He has arbitrarily selected parallels and assumptions, and seeks to apply them to us. Interestingly, he had misapplied them, with the result that he arrives at what he could even have subconsciously sought, confusion.
bnif | One traditional way of answering this question would be to quote the proverb: However fast you run, or however skilfully, you can't run away from your own feet.'
q018 | We will go through the analogies, and show how they apply to
jbak | us just as much as to anyone or anything else cited.
e9cp | First of all, it is not for us to satisfy each and every would-be student about Sufi applicability to himself and Sufic probity or otherwise. It is for him to satisfy himself; and he will probably use the same methods he uses when he applies to learn anything else. But he should remember that if he goes, for instance, to a school of medicine and asks: "How do I know that you can teach me?' he will be shown the door. He is not eligible. Such an approach is neither correct behaviour nor indicative of a stage of intelligence in which one can be taught. There are plenty of people who do not adopt the attitude of an idiot, and it is the duty of the medical school to give its limited time to such people. It is someone else's task to do the more preliminary work with you. One function of the books already published is to provide this briefing.
94lh | Secondly, the reputation of the Sufis is already well enough established, and continues in that role from a base of repute which they established even long before numerous contemporary institutions existed. Sufic continued flexibility, viability and effec- tiveness (if you must measure in this way) are themselves evidences of their value in terms of the levels on which such things are assessed in the familiar world.
jxk1 | The coexistence of genuine Sufic enterprises and imitation ones only parallels similar imitations of almost every other kind of institution in the world. It is no new thing, and it has virtually the same characteristics and origins.
wgvf | Thirdly, the idea of 'enrolment and recruitment' naturally varies with the kind of institution. The enrolment and recruitment of, say, bank clerks differs from that of, say, soldiers. People may become bank clerks and find that they are not suited for banking life. They may become politicians and discover that they are suited to this life. They may enrol as deep-sea divers and discover that deep-sea diving is not what they thought it was, in spite of plenty of divers around, sufficient schools, and an abundance of literature on the subject. What are you seeking from Sufi studies or activity which differs from these things?
3jlo | Fourthly, of course, there is the question which comes under the heading of objectives. Suppose you want to be a politician: no-
ldqe | body would say that you could become a Cabinet Minister before you were perhaps a leg-man for a minor parliamentary candidate, or an envelope-licker in Party HQ, or even a canvasser for an obscure Rural District Council Member. The objective, again, may be to be a Cabinet Minister or a Prime Minister. How many people who at the beginning of their political careers: (a) know what it is like to be a Prime Minister, even if they are aiming for it; (b) really will become a Prime Minister? In any case, the people who do attain such rank are the ones who obey the Chinese proverb 'The journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step'.
qt5x | Fifthly, as to confusion: people frequently become confused either because they cannot understand the elementary steps they have to take, or because they invariably enjoy confusion, or for some other reason which they do not know. The origins of a state of confusion can often be discovered merely by transposing the problem into terms whose structure is more familiar, as I have just done.
cc6l | Among the Sufis, as among those of other paths, it has always been required that the intending participant practise certain re- quirements to fit him or her for higher learning. In modern societies, equivalent and often exactly similar prerequisites are found. Because so many familiar institutions with clearly laid out requirements already exist in contemporary cultures, it should be easier, not more difficult, for people to understand, given real desire, the requirements. These include: humility, dedication, abstinence, restraint, obedience. Unless you exercise these 'virtues', you will get nowhere in banking, the Army, medicine, politics, human service or anywhere else in many forms of mundane endeavour. If, on the other hand, you want to escape these tire- some preliminaries and flee into Sufism, then we know what you are like, and we cannot talk to you at all. 'To say "yes" to the Sufi way is to say "no" to imagined escapes.'
w8g7 | It is no accident that Sufis find that they can connect most constructively with people who are well integrated into the world, as well as having higher aims, and that those who adopt a sensible attitude towards society and life as generally known can usually absorb Sufi teachings very well indeed.
0lyq | You started your question with the matter of the visibility of study institutions. But the world itself, as well as special attitudes, properly understood, constitute the Sufi school. Remember the words of Maghribi, who said to a monkish individual: 'What you are seeking in your retreat/I see clearly in every road and alley- way'.
mk88 | It is no use adding external things, say observances - to the life of someone who is carrying on too many unproductive observances. It is hopeless to add ideas to minds already too full of ideas. Study institutions may become visible when the head is more emptied of imaginings.
