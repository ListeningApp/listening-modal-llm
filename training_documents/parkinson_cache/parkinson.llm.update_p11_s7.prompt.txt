You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

yogo | Macromolecules and organelles in the presynaptic terminal travel a long distance from the soma, making them old and vulnerable. Rapid turnover of proteins, membranes, receptors, and vesicles in the pre-synapse assigns autophagy a major role in maintaining synaptic homeostasis. This tasks synaptic autophagy with quality control responsibilities. Though there is compelling evidence that compromised autophagy contributes to PD, these studies primarily looked at the soma from a proteinopathy or mitophagy perspective (Lynch-Day et al. 2012). Selective inactivation of autophagy by conditional knockout of autophagy protein atg7 in dopaminergic neurons leads to enhanced dopamine release and rapid presynaptic recovery with abnormal axonal profiles (Hernandez et al. 2012). Conversely, autophagy enhancement through mTOR inhibition slows dopamine release, reduces the number of synaptic vesicles, and increases autophagosome density in the axons (Hernandez et al. 2012). These results emphasize the importance of synaptic autophagy in normal dopamine transmission and further evaluation is warranted to understand if additional synaptic autophagy defects exist, which may lead to PD pathogenesis.
2285 | Another unique and stressful situation for neurons is that autophagosomes loaded with unwanted materials from an active presynaptic terminal, need to be transported a long distance to the soma for lysosomal degradation (Figure 1B). Microtubule and scaffolding proteins aid in this retrograde axonal transport of autophagosomes and are crucial for the normal functioning of E-L system (Birdsall & Waites 2019). During their transport, autophagosomes mature into autolysosomes by fusing with late-endosomes/lysosomes towards the proximal end of axon (Nikoletopoulou & Tavernarakis 2018). There are recent studies suggesting lysosomal degradation at the distal end, especially of mitophagosome mediated by Parkin-PINK1. This is predicted to provide rapid neuroprotection against oxidative stress by damaged mitochondria, without requirement for retrograde transport (Ashrafi et al. 2014; Ashrafi & Schwarz 2015). Axonal transport aids this function through anterograde transport of E-L system components required for degradation from soma towards distal end. Any defect in this to-and-fro transport machinery can completely clog the E-L system and other processes. Considering its functional significance in neuronal survival, axonal transport might hold clues for understanding pathological mechanisms. Abnormal axonal swelling with lysosomal accumulation has been noted in Alzheimer's disease, blocking the retrograde transport of autophagosomes (Gowrishankar et al. 2015; Nixon et al. 2005). Similar understanding on the health of axonal transport machinery and

ww6u | The multi-compartmentalised nature of neurons puts tremendous pressure on the endosomal sorting and trafficking machinery, which is also true in case of nigrostriatal neurons. The vacuolar protein sorting (VPS) group of proteins that form retromer complex comprising of VPS35, VPS26, and VPS29 are crucial in retrograde trafficking and sorting of protein cargos from endosomes to the TGN, facilitating their recycle and reuse (Figure 1A) (Haft et al. 2000; Seaman et al. 1998). The retromer complex also functions in sorting proteins/cargo to regulate endosomal and lysosomal maturation (Vagnozzi & Pratico 2018). Pedigrees with single allelic mutation in VPS35 revealed autosomal dominant, late-onset, L-dopa- responsive PD, with striking similarities to idiopathic PD (Vilarino-Guell et al. 2011; Wider et al. 2008). Broadly, it is proposed that the mutant VPS35 fails to associate with other components of the retromer complex, resulting in impaired retrograde trafficking (Williams et al. 2017). Induced loss-of-function mutations of VPS35 in vitro resulted in enlargement of late-endosomes and aggregation of a-synuclein oligomers (Follett et al. 2016). Another study on flies revealed ceramide accumulation due to VPS35 deficiency, suggesting lysosomal dysfunction (Lin et al. 2018). a-synuclein accumulation in nigral dopaminergic neurons, loss of dopaminergic neurons, reduced dopamine transporter levels in the striatum, and locomotory deficits were noted in VPS35-deficient mice (Ishizu et al. 2016; Tang et al. 2015a). Further in vitro studies of VPS35 (D620N) mutant cells revealed dysfunction in endosome-to-Golgi retrieval of lysosomal membrane proteins (LAMP2a) and accelerated lysosomal degradation of LAMP2a (Tang et al. 2015a). LAMP2a is considered important in directing misfolded a-synuclein to lysosomes, suggesting a mechanism for a-synuclein accumulation in VPS35 deficiency (Tang et al. 2015a). VPS35 mutations also affect autophagy and dendritic AMPA (a-Amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid) receptor trafficking (Munsie et al. 2015; Zavodszky et al. 2014). VPS35 mutations bring severe abnormality in mitochondrial dynamics, as noted in cultured dopaminergic neurons, mice SNpc neurons, and in PD patient derived fibroblasts. (Tang et al. 2015b). Oxidative stress implicated in sporadic PD might mediate pathogenesis through VPS35-driven mitochondrial defects (Wang et al. 2016). VPS35 also has a role in biogenesis of mitochondria-derived vesicles, further suggesting that its dysfunction causees mitochondrial pathology and neurodegeneration (Sugiura et al. 2014). VPS35 is functionally linked to LRRK2, boosting its kinase activity (Mir et al. 2018). In fact, decreased VPS35 levels were noted in the SNpc of PD patients with LRRK2 mutations (Zhao et al. 2018). Interestingly, overexpression of VPS35 ameliorated locomotor deficits and enhanced lifespan in LRRK2 mutant models (Linhart et al. 2014; MacLeod et al. 2013), which was also seen in Parkin mutant models (Malik et al. 2015). Neuroprotection was also noted against MPP+ induced toxicity in dopaminergic neurons (Bi et al. 2013). Along with its E-L sorting functions, these links between VPS35 and a-synuclein, LRRK2, Parkin, lysosomal dysfunction, autophagy, mitochondrial perturbations, and oxidative stress strongly suggest VPS35 as a good therapeutic target.
