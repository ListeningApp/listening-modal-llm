The hydrated pet with weight loss will have often lost both fat and muscle mass. These more chronic concerns have usually developed over a period of at least one to two weeks. Changes in body weight should trigger a number of questions directed at determining duration, changes in environment, diet, appetite, presence of intestinal signs, travel history, water intake and urine output, etc.\ncaos | Nine. Vaccinations and medications. The owner of every pet should be asked about current, recent and previous medications given. Knowing what vaccinations have been given, when, and where may become valuable. Responses by the pet, positive or negative, to any medications should be noted. This information is not only important to help diagnose the disease, but might also help with its subsequent treatment management. A young dog may have been successfully treated at another hospital with glucocorticoids and parenteral fluids. Later, the dog relapses with the same symptoms after the effects of the treatment dissipated. This treatment history would be classic for adrenocortical insufficiency.\nqrvy | Ten. The animal's present condition. After all of the above information has been obtained, it is helpful to know if the previous treatment has helped. The basic question is whether the animal is doing better, remaining the same, or getting worse.\npn9j | All of the above information will help the clinician accomplish the clinical mandate of \"knowing thy patient.\"\n1pmc | Questions for the vague clinical complaint\n5z6q | There are occasions when the clinician is presented with a patient where there is virtually no accompanying medical history. Herein lies the formidable challenge of trying to solve the unknown. The circumstances surrounding this particular situation might involve a stray animal, a pet that is mostly kept out of doors, the person knows little about the pet, or a pet owner is unable to communicate. The recommended approach is to attempt identification of the chief complaint and then to obtain as much as possible of the information described above. If the person accompanying the animal cannot provide this important information, ask to speak with someone who might be able to provide more information. If not possible, diagnosis will depend on the results of a physical examination, any imaging and or laboratory test results, and the experience of the clinician.\n```",
