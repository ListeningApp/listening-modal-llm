They were either full-time Executive Officers or part-time Community Organizers working outside office hours. The Home Affairs Department built up a regularly updated contact list of about ten thousand people. The list was claimed to 'cover a wide cross-section of occupation groups, stratified in respect of age and educational background'. About three hundred to four hundred people were selected from the list for each MOOD issue. Apart from interviewing people on the contact list, the Home Affairs Department staff spoke to people in the community. The number of these incidental samples varied in different districts. It ranged from two thousand to three thousand in total. In normal circumstances, no respondent was interviewed more than once in less than four months. As the Chief Secretary and the Secretary for Administration imposed the duties of assessing and predicting public reactions towards proposed and existing policies, on request, the Home Affairs Department was obliged to report opinion trends on specific topics to relevant departments directly.\nf2y8 | MOOD was a qualitative research project, which adopted an informal interviewing system modelled on the Osaka Feedback Scheme and the Japanese Monitor System for National Policy. Each report had tailor-made topics and targeted groups. Tests and pilot surveys were carried out in advance, such as checking the sample coverage and anticipating non-response rate. This was done to determine the method used in soliciting views, for example, whether through observations, sending out questionnaires, or interviews. If it was in the format of interviews, 'informal' techniques were employed. Questions were not standardized. Staff could tailor the wording and alter the order of the questions which they believed were appropriate for the contacts. Such unstructured approach, it was judged, succeeded 'better than set questions in getting to the heart of the respondent's opinion'.\no7qm | To further improve the methodology of MOOD, it was recommended that a departmental representative should attend discussions if that report was requested by a particular department. As MOOD only covered Kowloon and Hong Kong island, the presence of the staff of the New Territories Administration, such as the District Officer of Tsuen Wan, was useful. Not only could they learn the techniques for contacting interview subjects, but information from the New Territories could also be gathered and used for comparison. On important topics, such as Green Papers on constitutional development, the department used 'more scientific methods' to gather and ascertain public views regularly. To enhance the report's credibility, three-quarters of the contacts in each issue of MOOD were incidental casual respondents. The established contact lists in different districts were renewed and the categorical breakdown, such as age and occupation of\nd52l | \nqlbb | China Information thirty-three one\nnhsg | respondents, was sent to the Census and Statistics Department. These new arrangements were made possibly because City District Officers and monitors approached some better-informed and responsive respondents repeatedly, affecting the representativeness of MOOD. These changes also lowered the risks that officials carried out fewer interviews than required.\nhy0l | By nineteen seventy-nine, the Home Affairs Department was still reluctant to change the sampling method extensively due to 'the extra work involved' and the fact that 'it was impractical with the then limited resources'. Nonetheless, the frequency was changed and MOOD was issued on a monthly basis, allowing more time for fieldwork. It was not until April nineteen eighty that the Home Affairs Department switched to a quota sampling method. The selection of contacts according to gender, age and occupation was now in proportion to the number and distribution of the overall population in the area. This new method was adopted probably because of the changing geographical distribution of Hong Kong's population. According to the government census in nineteen seventy-one, twenty-five percent of the total population lived on Hong Kong island, eighteen percent in Kowloon, thirty-seven percent in New Kowloon, and seventeen percent in the New Territories. By nineteen eighty-one, the distribution had changed, with a large increase in the New Territories: twenty-four percent of the total population lived on Hong Kong island, sixteen percent in Kowloon, thirty-three percent in New Kowloon and twenty-six percent in the New Territories. This per district approach represented a better division of labour as it reduced the cost and time for travelling to other districts. City District Officers also had better understanding of the areas and neighbourhoods in their own districts. The new methodology reduced the sampling size from two thousand five hundred to nine hundred ninety-three. These nine hundred ninety-three respondents now included people in Tsuen Wan and Kwai Chung.\n4jmz | This section has demonstrated how the bureaucracy invested considerable resources polling a representative sample of people, a mass made structurally invisible by the colonial state. The colonial government regularly collected and analysed public opinion, and closely monitored the movement of opinion direction. The circulation of sensitive public opinion was restricted to senior policymakers, including the Governor and his policy advisers, and was referenced in policy formulation.\nb7cq | Political attitudes and identities of Hong Kong Chinese\n0b39 | The improved methodologies allowed MOOD to deconstruct changing popular sentiments by class and age, and hence assess public reactions to administrative reforms and identify potential threats to the colonial state. MOOD investigated topics which were either 'of current interest or political importance chosen by the Home Affairs Department', or which had been requested by a Secretary or Head of Department. During the period from March nineteen seventy-five to June nineteen seventy-six, MOOD covered a number of ad hoc affairs, including public reactions to the Labour Relations Bill, the proposed increase in public transport charges, school fees, and electricity prices. The colonial government also displayed a clear interest in political attitudes and identities, and what influenced them. Changing political attitudes of Hong Kong Chinese towards the colonial government, the United Kingdom, and China were the stateâ€™s main concerns in this period. For an alien state to retain legitimacy without introducing an electoral system, 'not only must legitimate demands be satisfied, but the population must be convinced that such satisfaction is\nqecd | genuinely the objective of the government'. The colonial regime was desperate to develop a sense of 'civic pride' as a substitute for 'national loyalty' among the Chinese population. It was believed that this not only enhanced the state's legitimacy, but also provided Britain with powerful bargaining chips in their negotiations with China. Along with the Hong Kong Festival and the 'Keep Hong Kong Clean' campaign, the state introduced legislative changes, such as legalizing Chinese to become the official language in nineteen seventy-four.\n1o7p | Nonetheless, there were increased tensions between Hong Kong and Britain. The devaluation of the pound in nineteen sixty-seven had drastically affected public confidence in the British government. To add fuel to the fire, Britain's entry into the European Economic Community curtailed Hong Kong's textile exports to the British Isles under more restrictive quotas. London also increased Hong Kong's contribution to the maintenance of the British garrison from twenty-nine percent in nineteen seventy to seventy-five percent in nineteen seventy-eight. On the other hand, the nineteen sixty-seven riots had already demonstrated the significance of the 'China factor': a surge in Chinese nationalism could lead to violence and chaos, shattering political stability. Nationalism did not diminish but flourished in the early nineteen seventies, which could be observed from the emergence of patriotic social movements, such as the Chinese Language Campaign and the Senkaku Islands Movement. Given the uncertainty imposed by the end of the Cultural Revolution, the death of Mao and the fall of the Gang of Four after nineteen seventy-six, the state had to observe changing perceptions towards China. In this context, it was vital for the state to be fully informed of changing political attitudes and identities so that it could measure the success of its community-building project, continue fostering a sense of belonging among the community, and avoid any anti-colonial or British sentiments being exploited and turned into disturbances.\ncp13 | Attitudes towards colonial rule\n```",
