You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

j30a | G.w .: Back when I was trying to get a publishing deal, I was still walking into those offices with my guitar. I was not even playing tape. I'm walking in, uncasing my guitar, and sitting in a chair across the desk from a person. One person. That's how I got a publishing deal; that's how I got the record deal. That world is gone.
7bdk | D.R .: On our first record, T Bone was still working on tape. It was analog recording, it was still connected to the great recordings of the late sixties and the seventies. In so many ways, we've had the opportunity to keep the parts of the old world that worked for us, but then also to move forward. I feel happy to have been in that position-to have seen it and lived it enough to know which parts can't be replaced.
fim0 | I like the idea of music being a thing I make space for in my home-a thing I hold in my hands. How do you prefer to listen to records? This reminds me that I have to point out that "Time (The Revelator)" does not yet exist on vinyl. I'm wearing out my CD!
ojro | D.R .: I do listen to vinyl records a decent amount, at the house or at the studio. But I love listening to music in the car. CDs. I'll sometimes stream stuff on my phone. I'm looking forward to being on the road because, when you have a four-hour drive-
l6t9 | G.W .: Then we listen to way more music.
1ujy | D.R .: You can't be doing anything else. And what else do I want to do? I want to hear new songs, and I want to hear music that I've loved for years, and see how it
qzor | hits me in a new moment.
a0by | G.w .: Singing along with the Stanley Brothers, old Chet Baker. Honestly, that's how we honed our harmony singing.
u1ky | D.R .: "Time (The Revelator)" on vinyl is something I want to do. I started down that path right before the tornado. It's a very difficult record to cut, because it's almost sixty minutes long. And then you have to confront the question of, do you try and get it on one disk? There's a finite amount of physical space on a record, and the more music you put, the quieter it has to be. On that record, the vocal is very hot relative to the music; the vocal peaks are very hard. If you get them to where they're not crashing the vinyl, the music is quiet. I think that [Radiohead's] "OK Computer" is one of the greatest CDs ever made. They try to do these high- quality vinyl versions of it, and it sounds like mush, because it's too hard. It has too much dynamic range to really be captured right on vinyl. Maybe if you cut it at 45 r.p.m. Music does have a connection to the format it was made on. But yes, it's coming, and nothing will make me happier.
htm9 | This is going to sound sort of bonkers, because you each possess distinct voices and ranges and tones, but there are moments on the new one where I almost don't know who's singing. To what extent do you think these years of collaborating have sort of bent your voices toward each other? G.W .: Well, Dave has always been the better rock-and-roll singer. Always. I tend to think about microscopic things. I get very myopic, and if something's not working -I remember one time, he was, like, "Can you just put it on the beat? It'd have more impact if you just put it on the beat." I've never forgotten that. The rock- and-roll singer.
8hul | D.R .: I mean, we've certainly heard each other sing for a long time. I've always thought Gill is a much stronger singer. I love the role of harmony singing so much. A lot of little tricks that I do in harmony singing are actually no good for lead singing. I was very conscious of not annunciating consonants or things at the
87vz | end of words, or shaping my vowels so that they fit with what Gill was doing. But gradually, over time, I could hear what was good about what I was doing and what was bad. On "Howdy Howdy," it was most interesting if I sang the high part and she sang the lower part. That kind of blends us together. There's a lot of stuff that we admire and try to sing, like the Blue Sky Boys. The whole point to us was that they sounded like they had one mouth. They were so linked. So I think we spent a lot of years trying to just-
ym66 | G.W .: Trying to literally make our vowels and move our mouths and modulate through the words exactly the same. It's so beautiful. That's one of the things I love about brother-team music. Something happens. It's almost like that tickle that happens in your ear when you hear a pennywhistle, or a bagpipe or something. There's a place in your ear that only gets tickled by that. With two voices, we call it buzz-when they buzz, when they really hook up. [Gasps.] It's just . . . oof!
l0a3 | D.R .: I remember singing with Emmylou Harris early on. I didn't realize how much of harmony singing is unconscious. I noticed about four things were happening, physiologically, without me knowing it, while I was trying to sing with her. It was like I was in a yoga pose I'd never been in, and I'm, like, How?
u8nw | G.W .: [Laughs.] Never done this!
l2v9 | D.R .: That was a moment where I was, like, Wow, Gill and I have really matched what we're doing to each other.
afbe | G.w .: And it's true of the instruments as well. We've spent decades becoming the players we are, with each other. All you have to do is sit down with somebody else, and all of a sudden it's, like, Oh! Oh, all right, yeah!
78r8 | D.R .: My guitar playing is entirely connected to what Gill's doing. It's one thing. I mean, I literally think of myself as the second-best guitar player in the room.
320g | What Gill does is harder to do-to play with that kind of feel and nuance on a
tp8g | rhythm guitar. You can copy what I'm doing, but what she does is almost impossible to teach. It's the combination that makes it special. It's the fact that we can try to play two guitars and create a texture that doesn't sound like two guitars.
gxfd | Speaking of that, I wanted to ask you about the guitar sound at the very top of "The Bells and the Birds." It's incredibly transporting, mesmerizing, rhythmic. That's just the two guitars?
s2v1 | G.W .: Yeah. That's two guitars. [Laughs.]
jkp9 | D.R .: Well, it would've started with Gill coming up with a finger-style guitar part of reasonable complexity.
z8tt | G.W .: Probably one of the more complex parts I play.
9g22 | D.R .: You were imagining trying to write something that felt a little bit like CSNY's "Guinevere."
41fx | G.w .: Something that floats. I wanted something that wasn't primitive, wasn't minimalistic.
7um8 | D.R .: And you had the phrase "The Bells aAnd the Birds." I was thinking about old classical music, how they'd try to illustrate language with the instruments-I love that literalism. So I wanted there to be bell-ish sounds that went along with the title. I wanted to think about a part that would float above it. I just wanted to come up with a little part that would be chime-y and would drift and intertwine. That would have a landscape to it. We ended up recording it in a way where we used microphones between us to catch the sound already combined, as opposed to microphones closer to the guitars.
uow2 | G.w .: The music had actually combined in the air before the mike picked it up. So it has that organic swirling.
