You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

nuxs | MINERALIZATION AND ALTERATION OF THE TINAKULA SMS DEPOSIT
umx0 | The alteration assemblages vary with location and depth, generally progressing downward from the seafloor in the order montmorillonite/nontronite to nontronite + corrensite, to illite/ <LATEX>s m e c t i t e + p y r i t e ,</LATEX> to illite/smectite + chamosite, to chamosite + corrensite. Footwall breccias from site A are dominated by chamosite + corrensite alteration, with localized illite/smectite + chamosite alteration that varies in abundance over short dis- tances and is interpreted to reflect proximity to inferred synvol- canic faults (Fig. 11A). Alteration at site <LATEX>B</LATEX> is semiconformable, varying downhole from illite/smectite <LATEX>+</LATEX> pyrite, to illite/smectite + chamosite, to chamosite + corrensite (Fig. 11B). Site <LATEX>C</LATEX> is characterized by nontronite near the surface, followed by non- tronite + corrensite and chamosite + corrensite at depth (Fig.
o306 | 12A). Alteration at site D varies from illite/smectite + pyrite near the surface, to illite/smectite + chamosite at depth (Fig. 12B). End-member illite and rectorite is present in all samples from site D, reflecting high temperatures (>220℃) and a pro- gression from argillic to phyllic alteration at depth (e.g., Inoue et al., 1990). The variations in alteration assemblages identified at different sites along the NS-trending fissure appear to reflect variable thermal gradients and permeability structure.

Chlorite may form directly from smectite or through an intermediate corrensite step (e.g., Shau et al., 1990). At Tinakula, chamosite appears before corrensite in the downhole progression of alteration assemblages, suggesting that corrensite is not an intermedi- ate phase. Corrensite appears after illite/smectite, following a transition from illite/smectite + chamosite to chamosite + corrensite. This suggests that corrensite forms as an alteration product of the mixed-layer illite/smectite clays.

In addition, small absorption features are present at 2,350 and 2,450 nm for the white micas. Montmorillonite is distinguished by a narrow and symmetri- cal 2,200-nm feature with a small shoulder on the H2O + OH absorption feature at 1,450 to 1,460 nm. Chlorite is identified by the strong absorption feature at 2,340 nm, the wavelength of which increases from 2,324 nm for Mg-rich compositions to >2,350 nm for Fe-rich compositions. Gypsum is identi- fied by the OH + H2O feature at 1,400 nm, together with the OH feature at 1,800 nm. The alteration mineral assemblages observed in the SWIR analysis progress downhole from smec- tite (montmorillonite/nontronite), to white mica (paragonite

How- ever, SWIR analyses with both montmorillonite and white mica reflect the presence of mixed-layer illite/smectite clays rather than discrete end members, with progressive increases downhole in aluminum content that shift the Al-OH absorp- tion feature to lower wavelengths (e.g., Velde, 1980).
