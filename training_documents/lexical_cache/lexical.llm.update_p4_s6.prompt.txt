You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

l6t9 | How could a notion like articulatory effort be tested? Lindblom (1963) con- sidered that his measurements of Swedish vowel formant frequencies, which suggested invariant vowel targets attained to a greater or lesser extent as a function only of vowel duration, implied that vowel reduction should not be explained in terms of lesser articulatory effort: only timing patterns determined whether or not a vowel would be reduced. Van Katwijk's (1974) measurements of subglottal pressure found little evidence of stress-related pressure increase.
1ujy | Harder still to assess was the proposal that listener judgments of stress depended on perceived effort. However a relevant contribution was made in the work of Isačenko and Schädlich (1966; followed up by Bleakley, 1973); in German utter- ances, stressed syllables could be signaled by any F0 obtrusion from the overall contour, so that a stressed syllable could be either higher or lower in pitch than its neighbors. Listeners rated both types of obtrusion as stress, which argued
qzor | against commitment to greater perceived articulatory effort, and instead con- firmed sensitivity to location of intonational prominence. Morton and Jassem (1965) found a similar result with English listeners judging synthesized nonsense bisyllables.
a0by | 11.1.4 Reducing the complexity?
u1ky | As the technology for manipulating speech signals improved, the complexity underlying stress perception was further confirmed. Nakatani and Aston (1978) used linear predictive coding techniques to manipulate orthogonally the natural duration, amplitude, and F0 attributes of bisyllables with initial or final stress, and found, as had others before them, that all exercised effects on stress judgments, although the effect of amplitude variation was weakest. In general, the effects were additive, except that durational variation lost its effect in sentence-final position, and F0 lost its effect when the word in question was deaccented in the intonation contour because it followed a contrastive accent (for comparable findings see Huss, 1975, 1978). Nakatani and Aston also reported speaker differ- ences in the realization of stress contrasts (see also Howell, 1993). Other studies showed that differences between stressed and unstressed syllables in the three standard acoustic parameters were maintained across speech rates (Gay, 1978; McClean & Tiffany, 1973), while experiments in languages with fixed-position stress, or in languages with other phonological effects interacting with the stress system, further complicated the picture (see Section 11.2 below).
htm9 | Attempts were made to develop perceptual measures that might facilitate greater comparability across studies. Gussenhoven and Blom (1978) proposed a "language- neutral test" based on paired judgments of perceived contrast between isolated vowels. Taylor and Wales (1987) proposed a contrast ratio:
8hul | (stressed - unstressed) /(stressed + unstressed)
87vz | which, they reported, for the three standard acoustic dimensions predicted judgments of perceived stress far more effectively than other ratios (such as the most commonly used subtraction ratio, i.e., the simple difference in any of the parameters between stressed and unstressed syllables, or the ratio stressed/ unstressed, i.e., the division of one set of values by the other).
ym66 | More recent research has tried to disentangle the complexity and multiple deter- mination of stress perception by considering potential confounds. For instance, might stress judgments be complicated by the possibility that word stress place- ment can shift (so that English thirteen is stressed on the second syllable in the number thirteen, but on the first in thirteen numbers)? However, the undoubted shift in perceptual prominence in many such contrasting phrases does not result from a simple reversal of relative placement of a word's syllables on acoustic dimensions (see, e.g., Cooper & Eady, 1986; Shattuck-Hufnagel, Ostendorf, & Ross, 1994; Van Heuven, 1987). Likewise, measurements revealed little support for the notion of durational compensation within stress groups in English, such that segments of syllables might be longer in, say, a two-syllable foot (save it) than in a four-syllable foot (savoring it); segment durations are longer in syllables
l0a3 | with primary stress than in syllables with secondary stress, and longer in turn in the latter than in unstressed syllables, such that syllable duration can be fully predicted given knowledge of the segments and stress pattern of the word (Crystal & House, 1988, 1990).
u8nw | 11.1.5 Summary
l2v9 | Research on stress perception continues both within and outside the speech per- ception literature. For example, it has long been of interest to speech engineers whether the use of stress-related information in the signal could improve the performance of automatic speech recognizers (see, e.g., Lea, 1977; Marshall & Nye, 1983; Waibel, 1988, for English; van Kuijk & Boves, 1999, for Dutch), and some successful implementations have been reported (e.g., Kiriakos & O'Shaughnessy, 1989; Sholicar & Fallside, 1988).
afbe | Over nearly 50 years, however, perceptual studies have elaborated but not fundamentally altered the early claims concerning the suprasegmental dimen- sions involved. Syllables are perceived to be stressed if they exhibit F0 excursion (Fry, 1958), whereby the timing of the F0 movement within the syllable can be crucial for determining stress perception (Thorsen, 1982, for Danish), and some types of F0 movement may require more excursion than others (Hermes & Rump, 1994, for Dutch F0 rise versus rise-fall). Greater syllable duration is likewise associated with perceived stress (Fry, 1955). These two factors are the most strongly related and the least controversial.
78r8 | More controversial is the common finding that amplitude manipulations only weakly affect stress perception (despite psychoacoustic research showing that quite small changes in this dimension are indeed perceptible; Sorin, 1981). Turk and Sawusch (1996) found listeners' perception of duration and amplitude variation to be non-orthogonal; importantly, they observed effects of irrelevant durational variation on judgments of loudness to be greater than effects of ampli- tude variation on judgments of relative length. This, they argued, provided a rationale for why prominence judgments should be based on duration, or on duration and amplitude together, but not on the latter alone.
