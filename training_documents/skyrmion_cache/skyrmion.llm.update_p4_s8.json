        "content": "bfax | It is related to the entanglement of formation: for separable states C vanishes, and it increases monotonically toward the limit C equals one for two maximally entangled spin-one-half's. Using the concurrence, we obtain the space-resolved entanglement distribution between spin pairs in the different phases and present its qualitative distribution by green links in Fig. five. For a more quantitative analysis, we differentiate between\nf2y8 | B equals negative three D divided by four. concurrences of different ranges up to third-nearest neighbor in Table I.\no7qm | For HS states, we find the largest concurrences up to C sub HS equals zero point one six. Therefore, we use C sub HS as a measure of reference to quantify the entanglement of the remaining ordered states. For the FP states (large magnetic field), we find almost vanishing entanglement in the bulk, indicating that the bulk spins are separable. Small nonzero values of C approximately zero point three five C sub HS occur at the boundary due to the finite system size and strong DMI. Finally, for the quantum SK states (intermediate magnetic field), we find that the spins inside the skyrmion quasiparticle are only weakly entangled, but we find concurrences C approximately zero point eight C sub HS at the outer rim spins of the skyrmion, signaling significant entanglement of the quantum skyrmion with the field-polarized environment. Interestingly, both the helical state and quantum skyrmion show long-range concurrences between distant spin pairs beyond next-to-nearest neighbors.\nd52l | V.

In Fig. seven we display d sigma divided by d Omega for the helical, skyrmion, and field-polarized states (see Fig. six for all components S sub alpha beta of the structure factor). The geometry and local polarization of those states is displayed in Figs. two(d)-two(f). Generally speaking, long-range magnetic ordering is signaled by the presence of Bragg peaks in d sigma divided by d Omega at momentum transfers q corresponding to the wave vectors of the ordering. We expect additional diffuse magnetic scattering components in d sigma divided by d Omega rooted in spatial variations of the spin orientation.",
