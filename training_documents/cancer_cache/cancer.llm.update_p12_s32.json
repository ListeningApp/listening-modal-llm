Boron Clusters as a Novel Therapy against Glioblastoma\n877u | Metallacarboranes are three-dimensional aromatic complexes composed of a central metal ion, usually cobalt or iron, that is the common vertex of two joined icosahedrons, with interesting advantages in terms of their high stability, water solubility, and redox potential. Similar to carboranes, these compounds are tunable, but the metal core adds additional features regarding the redox potential and the charge of the molecule.\nrzhj | In a glioblastoma cell model, studies have been performed using metallacarboranes with both iron and cobalt as a central core, to assess their therapeutic potential. The cytotoxicity of cobaltabis dicarbollides and ferrabis dicarbollides was first assessed in monolayer cultures of glioblastoma cell lines, and then in spheroids derived from the same cell lines using the APH assay. The cytotoxicity of another ferrabis dicarbollide, with the potential to treat glioblastoma using the Mössbauer effect, was also evaluated in U87 spheroids using the CellTiter-Glo three-dimensional Viability Assay. In general, the results revealed that\nbfax | glioblastoma cells were more sensitive when cultured as a two-dimensional model than when cultured as spheroids, reiterating the relevance of three-dimensional models in cancer research. A physical assessment (area and circularity) of the spheroids was also performed after incubation with the metallacarboranes. The results obtained revealed that all the metallacarboranes tested significantly affected the spheroid growth, resulting in a considerable decrease in the spheroid area, with the exception of sodium ferrabis dicarbollide. On the other hand, neither compound significantly affected the spheroid circularity.\nf2y8 | Interestingly, the potential radiosensitizing effects of the metallacarboranes mentioned above were also explored, although most of these studies were performed in monolayer cultures. The cobaltabis dicarbollides compounds were studied as potential radiosensitizers for boron neutron capture therapy, due to their high boron content and high tumor uptake. The concept of boron neutron capture therapy is based on the deposition of high doses of radiation in tumor cells containing ten boron-based compounds through a thermal neutron capture reaction that yields high linear energy transfer of alpha particles able to induce damage in the tumor.\no7qm | The radiosensitizing effects of the ferrabis dicarbollides were further assessed using low dose gamma rays and X-rays, considering that the interaction of iron with low radiation doses could lead to the emission of photoelectrons, Auger electrons and other secondary electrons, and Compton scattering, increasing the total radiation dose to the tumor cells, consequently causing deleterious effects. Furthermore, the radiosensitizing effect of these compounds was also assessed with proton irradiation considering that the interaction of boron with protons in the cells would, theoretically, increase the number of alpha particles emitted due to a nuclear fusion reaction (proton boron fusion reaction). Finally, as referred, ferrabis dicarbollide was used to study the radiosensitizing effects of Mössbauer absorption in glioblastoma monolayer cultured cells and spheroids, bearing in mind that the secondary radiation that accompanies the resonance absorption of the Mössbauer radiation, in the iron nuclei, is able to produce a powerful local effect on the tumor cells.\nd52l | Five point two point three. A New Generation of Anticancer Palladium Agents That Restrain the Growth of Ovarian Cancer Tumoroids\nqlbb | N-heterocyclic carbenes are found in some of the most active palladium compounds, stabilizing the complex and avoiding its rapid degradation in a biological environment. The anticancer activity and cytotoxicity of palladium two-eta-three-allyl organometallic complex have been evaluated in two ovarian cancer cell lines, A2780 and SKOV-three, and both the antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic activity appeared to be very promising. Scattolin et al. then studied the effects of these palladium compounds on liver organoids, to evaluate the hepatotoxicity, and ovarian cancer tumoroids, to assess their anticancer activity on more complex models. Regarding the hepatoxicity, the organoids were first characterized by immunohistochemistry using premature and mature hepatocyte markers. Then, it was possible to determine the IC fifty of zero point zero three ± zero point zero one micromolar for cisplatin and three ± two micromolar for the selected palladium compound. This shows that this palladium complex is one hundred times less toxic than cisplatin, corroborating with the data from assays on two-dimensional models and supporting the use of the compound in future clinical applications.\nnhsg | To evaluate the anticancer activity of the selected palladium complex, tumoroids of three patients with high-grade serous ovarian cancer subtypes were developed. Tumor samples of both primary and metastatic sites were used. The morphologic and cytologic similarities between tumoroids and parental tumors were assessed and confirmed using hematoxylin and eosin staining. On all of the tumoroids, the palladium compound was active at low concentrations, contrary to what was observed with carboplatin. The results of these hepatoxicity and anticancer activity assays suggest that this new palladium complex could be interesting for therapeutic applications.\nhy0l | Five point two point four. Oral Mucosal Organoids as a Potential Platform for Personalized Cancer Therapy\n4jmz | Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma lines have been cultured in three-dimensional models to overcome the limitations of their two-dimensional counterparts. In this study, Driehuis et al. aimed to study the potential of tumoroids, derived from head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients, for personalized therapy.\nb7cq | Tumoroids were grown from patient-derived head and neck squamous cell carcinoma samples obtained through surgical resections or biopsies and cultured in an appropriate organoid culture medium, and their morphology and histopathology were confirmed using brightfield microscopy, hematoxylin and eosin, and immunohistochemistry staining. Following that, thirteen tumoroid lines were exposed to cisplatin and carboplatin, two drugs used in the treatment of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients. As depicted in Table three, tumoroids of different origins presented different levels of sensitivity to the compounds. In all of the samples, cisplatin was shown to be more effective at lower doses than carboplatin. Moreover, differential gene expression analysis of RNA sequencing data was performed to verify if expression profiles could predict how these therapies would work. However, gene enrichment analysis on these gene sets yielded no clear indications of resistance mechanisms.\n```\n",
