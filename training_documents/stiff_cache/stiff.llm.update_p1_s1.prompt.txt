You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

uodj | STIFFNESS NONLINEARITY OF THREE SANDS
k16v | ABSTRACT: This paper presents the results of 254 drained triaxial compression tests. The results are analyzed with the aim of obtaining a phenomenological description of secant Young's modulus variation according to different test conditions. Using empirical fitting equations, the influences of different factors such as axial strain, vertical consolidation stress, consolidation stress ratio, and stress history on the secant Young's modulus under axisymmetric (triaxial) loading conditions at small and intermediate axial strains are singled out and presented. The main purpose of this paper is to identify the factors affecting the nonlinear secant stiffness of sand and to quantify their relevance at different levels of strain.
b2lm | INTRODUCTION
ti7f | Stiffness reduction with increasing strain and shear stress levels has been widely recognized in geotechnical engineering for the last half century. Moreover, more recently [e.g., Tat- suoka (1988)] the improvement achieved in the reliable mea- surement of soil behavior at small <LATEX>\left( \varepsilon \cong 1 0 ^ { - 5 } \right)</LATEX> and intermediate strains <LATEX>\left( 1 0 ^ { - 5 } < 8 \leq 5 \times 1 0 ^ { - 3 } \right)</LATEX> in the laboratory has highlighted the degree of nonlinearity exhibited by soil stiffness, empha- sizing the paramount importance of this phenomenon for pre- dicting the displacement of geotechnical constructions.
oksu | Based on the above, this paper is aimed at the purely phe- nomenological description of the secant Young's modulus <LATEX>\left( E _ { \mathrm { s e c } } \right)</LATEX> nonlinearity at small and intermediate strains, as inferred from a large number of drained triaxial compression tests per- formed on three sands.
wtow | All the triaxial tests were performed on specimens prepared by means of an air pluvial deposition subjected thereafter to both isotropic and anisotropic consolidation. Both the local axial strain and the local radial strain were measured in many tests. The results obtained have been analyzed with the aim of quantifying the relevance of the different factors that influence the <LATEX>E _ { \sec }</LATEX> nonlinearity at small and intermediate strains of the three test sands.
o22k | EXPERIMENTAL DATA
nwfz | Test Sands
nvfy | The soils used were Toyoura, Quiou, and Ticino sands. Toy- oura sand has been widely used for laboratory stress-strain tests in Japan. Ticino sand has been used for Calibration Chamber and laboratory stress-strain tests in Italy since 1976. More recently, Quiou sand (a French sand) has also been used in Italian Calibration Chamber and stress-strain laboratory tests. Toyoura sand is a subangular, uniform, fine quartz sand that does not contain fines. Quiou sand is a subangular, well- graded, coarse to medium carbonate sand containing about 2% of fines. Quiou sand is a crushable material containing 73% in weight of shell fragments (Fioravante et al. 1994b). Ticino sand is a medium to coarse, uniform, predominantly silica sand that does not contain fines (Bellotti et al. 1996). The main physical properties of these sands are shown in Table 1.
mror | Sample Preparation
zlxc | Specimens with 70 mm in diameter and 140 mm in height were reconstituted by dry pluvial deposition method. Only for some tests on Ticino sand were smaller samples tested (i.e., 40 and 60 mm in diameter). The ratio of height to diameter <LATEX>H / D</LATEX> of all specimens is two.
k0bw | Toyoura sand specimens were reconstituted to a void ratio after consolidation <LATEX>e ,</LATEX> ranging from 0.65 to 0.89 (i.e., <LATEX>D _ { r } = 2 5</LATEX> to 90%). For Quiou sand specimens, the <LATEX>e _ { c }</LATEX> ranged between 0.79 and 1.04 (i.e., <LATEX>D _ { r } = 5 5</LATEX> to 105%), while for Ticino sand specimens the <LATEX>e _ { e }</LATEX> ranged between 0.58 and 0.88 (i.e., <LATEX>D _ { r } = 1 5</LATEX> to 100%).

sc5y | Triaxial Tests
0yab | Apparatus
w95z | The triaxial testing systems used for the tests, developed at ISMES (Istituto Sperimentale Modelli e Strutture, Italy) and the Technical University of Turin, are computer-controlled tri- axial cells with internal tie rods. A load cell to measure the axial load without any piston friction is located inside the pres- sure chamber. In the triaxial apparatus developed at the Tech- nical University of Turin, the loading ram is virtually friction- less. The axial strain was measured locally using high resolution submergible LVDTs, and externally. The details of the test apparatuses were described by Fioravante et al. (1994b), Jamiolkowski et al. (1994b), and Lo Presti et al. (1994).
0i1k | Twenty-six tests on Toyoura sand and eight tests on Quiou sand were performed at the Technical University of Turin, while all the tests on the Ticino sand (184) and other tests on the Quiou sand (36) were performed at ISMES (Table 2). The axial strain was only measured externally for the majority of the Ticino sand tests.
dqlg | Test Procedures
p6pq | Two sets of drained triaxial compression tests were per- formed at constant axial strain rate and lateral pressure with confining stress ranging between 50 and 800 kPa. The first set
zse6 | was performed on isotropic normally consolidated (NC) and overconsolidated (OC) specimens. The second set was per- formed on K0 (the condition of zero radial strain) NC and OC specimens. The K0 condition was obtained by adjusting the cell pressure as the axial stress increased in order to prevent radial displacement. The radial deformation was measured lo- cally using two proximity transducers placed horizontally on the specimen. The adopted overconsolidation ratio (OCR = vmax/o ) ranged between 1.2 and 8. After the consolidation stage, a rest period of 1 to 2 h was adopted before starting the shearing phase.
p2n3 | The shearing stage of triaxial tests was carried out in drained conditions, under a strain-controlled frame, at a constant rate
ohh7 | of axial strain (about 0.01%/min). The radial pressure was kept constant.
vbni | The consolidation stress ratio, OCR, and effective vertical stress at the end of consolidation are also shown in Table 2.

These figures show the secant Young's modulus Esec versus the axial strain, plotted in logarithmic scale, for four compression loading tests with almost the same void ratio (Toyoura sand: 0.77-0.80; Quiou sand: 0.87-0.89) and the effective vertical consolida-
