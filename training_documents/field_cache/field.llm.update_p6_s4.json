        "content": "y7ea | The Promise of Field Experiments in Economics\nnav4 | The empirical gold standard in the social sciences is to estimate a causal effect of some action, but amidst the complexity of the real world, this is easier said than done. Economists have long worked on approaches that seek to separate cause and effect in naturally occurring data. A few decades ago, a standard approach was to use multiple regression analysis in an attempt to hold other factors constant. But economists have now taken to heart the old maxim that \"correlation doesn't imply causation,\" and have in recent decades sought out a variety of other approaches.\ngem8 | For example, the instrumental variables approach seeks out a sometimes unexpected source of exogenous variation to disentangle cause and effect. \"Natural experiments\" seek out an event or a change in the law that arguably creates exogenous variation in the variable of interest. One typically analyzes changes in a population that received the variation compared with changes in another population that didn't, under the assumption that they would have experienced much the same change in the absence of the treatment. A regression discontinuity approach looks for a situation where those immediately above the level of a certain characteristic-perhaps age or income-are treated differently than those just below that level, and then, based on the assumption that those barely above the defining line are not that different than those barely below the line, looks for\ne8nr | whether a discontinuity occurs. Structural modeling can be a powerful approach to guide empirical regressions. It's possible to evaluate treatment programs not by experimental methods, but by making a statistical adjustment for those who are in the program compared with those outside the program, using the method of propensity score matching.\nk78w | All of these approaches of modeling naturally occurring data, along with others not mentioned here, are quite useful. I do not come to bury econometric studies based on nonexperimental data, but rather to praise them. As I have argued for over a decade, my strong belief is that field experiments can usefully complement studies based on naturally occurring data and lab data. In this way, field experiments offer another useful set of arrows for the quiver of empirically minded economists. When combined with theory, field experiments represent an important and undervalued approach to further our understanding of economics.\ng9du | To be sure, we must work carefully when drawing conclusions based on the results of field experiments. Was the selection of participants into the treatment and experimental groups truly random? Do those who are not treated take some action as a result of being in the experiment, albeit in the control group, that they might not otherwise have taken? Is there something about the population being studied-perhaps risk-tolerance or persistence or belief that the treatment works-that warrants caution in generalizing the results to other populations? In the last few years, a lively literature has debated these and other issues that can arise in field experiments.\nf682 | The papers in this symposium offer a wide sampling of field experimental work in economics as it has been evolving. Along the way, these papers show how researchers are seeking practical ways to address many of these potential concerns. In \"Mechanism Experiments and Policy Evaluations,\" Jens Ludwig, Jeffrey R. Kling, and Sendhil Mullainathan discuss how we can learn from doing field experiments in complex policy environments. They emphasize the importance of uncovering the mechanism through which a treatment effect actually occurs-an insight that in many cases can be derived from a relatively simple set of field experimental treatments. In \"The Role of Theory in Field Experiments,\" David Card, Stefano DellaVigna, and Ulrike Malmendier propose a way of classifying experimental studies according to the ways in which they are linked to economic theory, and they provide evidence that as field experiments have become more prominent in top economics journals, so have explicit theoretical foundations for those experiments. In \"Field Experiments with Firms,\" Oriana Bandiera, Iwan Barankay, and Imran Rasul show how field experiments can illuminate a variety of firm decisions about methods of employee compensation and competitive strategy. Reading their paper, I was struck by how much of the modern-day business school curriculum might usefully be explored with the judicious use of field experiments.\nli1k | Along with their many specific lessons, these three papers illustrate the general advantages of field experiments. First, field experiments offer a distinctive and new\npbea | source of empirical evidence, which can then be compared, contrasted, reconciled, and eventually intertwined with evidence from nonexperimental and lab methods. Admittedly, this new experimental evidence will bring its own methodological challenges, but when the field experiments are well-designed and rooted in economic theory, their evidence also has some distinctive strengths. Second, field experiments offer an immediate opportunity to specify and address the economic question of interest, rather than waiting and hoping for a natural event or a cast-iron econometric specification that would allow the researcher to address the issue cleanly. Consequently, conducting successful field experiments demands a different set of skills from traditional economic research, including the ability to recognize opportunities for experimentation hidden amidst everyday phenomena, an understanding of experimental design, and the interpersonal skills to manage what are often a complex set of relationships involving parties to an experiment. Finally, field experiments offer economists the possibility of an improved connection from economic theory and empirical evidence to the real world, built on a deeper contextual understanding of real-world issues and institutions.\nccpt | How Do I Get Started?\n0fpw | The idea of carrying out a field experiment may seem daunting. It means visiting a market or a firm that you may not know well, introducing yourself, and figuring out how to randomize important economic variables within a possibly complex situation. You must brace yourself for possible pitfalls along the way. Here, I offer fourteen tips for improving your chances of executing successful field experiments.\ndqn8 | One. Use economic theory to guide your design and as a lens to interpret your findings.\ncop0 | Economic theory is portable; empirical results in isolation offer only limited information about what is likely to happen in a new setting. Together, however, theory and experimental results provide a powerful guide to situations heretofore unexplored. Experimental results are most generalizable when they are built on tests of economic theory.\nlhkq | Two. Be an expert about the market that you are studying.\n82ju | This is perhaps the most important insight that I have gained over my nearly twenty years of running field experiments. As a sports card dealer running natural field experiments in the early nineteen-nineties, I needed to understand the inner workings of the market-to have detailed knowledge of the underlying motivations of the actors in the market: buyers, sellers, third-party certifiers, and organizers. My past experience with this market was quite beneficial in crafting designs in which the incentives would be understood and interpreted correctly, and also in generating alternative hypotheses and understanding how to interpret the experimental data.\ny2qo | Why Economists Should Conduct Field Experiments and Fourteen Tips Eleven\n1piq | Three. Have a proper control group.\n7fqw | Experimentation is ubiquitous. Wherever I go to set up research-across profit and nonprofit firms, federal and local government agencies, school districts, Chinese manufacturing plants, and trading pits-I see that everyone already experiments. Unfortunately, what is common across all of these venues is that the experimenter rarely has a proper control group to compare results with the treated group. In nearly all cases, the comparison or control group is ill-conceived-past behavioral patterns or current behavioral patterns from a different population are used as a control group. Doing this is like neutering homo experimentalis.\nrhaz | Four. Obtain sufficient sample sizes.",
