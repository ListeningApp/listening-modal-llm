It is widely agreed upon that materiality matters, in the sense that companies should identify, prioritize and disclose information on sustainability issues that are considered material. There is, however, a tension at the heart of this consensus, owing to parallel approaches to materiality being used in practice. This paper aims to shed light on how and why the parallel uses of the materiality concept may cause confusion and how this tension could be resolved.\n41fx | Design/methodology/approach - This paper takes as point of departure the tension between two approaches to materiality: based on the Global Reporting Initiative definition, which emphasizes sustainability issues that are important to stakeholders and that have significant impacts and based on the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board definition, which emphasizes sustainability issues that are financially material, i.e. likely to influence the financial performance of the company. This paper discusses the nature and consequences of the tensions between how the two definitions of materiality in sustainability reporting are used in practice, with a particular emphasis on users of information in financial markets. This paper provides empirical insight on these users' perspectives through a survey of thirty and qualitative interviews of six financial market professionals.\n7um8 | Findings - This study reveals tensions between different approaches to materiality in practice and how this may lead users of sustainability reports to draw unjustified conclusions on the basis of materiality assessments. Specifically, this paper demonstrates the perceived shortcomings in information availability and information quality from the perspectives of different stakeholders in financial markets with different information needs.\nuow2 | Practical implications - The users of sustainability reporting information require clarity in the communication of materiality in non-financial reports. This paper addresses how such clarity can be pursued.\niat7 | Social implications - Clarity about materiality in non-financial reporting is important both for investors that pursue financial return on green investments and for society at large, which relies on information about real sustainability impacts.\nywwr | SAMPJ Originality/value - This paper furthers the understanding of how different materiality concepts may be problematic and how recent and ongoing developments may mitigate the risks of conflating uses of the concept.\n0i6j | Introduction\n87cq | In different ways and to varying degrees, companies increasingly attempt to improve their sustainability footprints and to disclose sustainability performance information. There are a multitude of stakeholder expectations that drive this development. Companies show willingness to respond to such expectations, e.g. to comply with regulatory requirements, act in accordance with social norms and to act in ways that maintain a good reputation. Thus, sustainability reporting is becoming widespread for both legitimacy and accountability purposes. In recent years, also investors and lenders - who are important users of sustainability performance information - have increasingly demanded such information, in particular about companies' sustainability efforts that are correlated with financial performance.\n0qs3 | As reporting on sustainability has become more prevalent across industries globally, new standards have emerged for measurement and reporting with an aim to ensure high-quality sustainability information. A key challenge for companies is how to assess which sustainability issues are more or less material for companies in different industries. The development towards more standardized sustainability reporting responds to calls for relevant and comparable information on so-called environmental, social and governance factors by investors and other users of non-financial information.\nz8f7 | In the field of sustainable business generally and sustainability reporting specifically, there seems to be widespread agreement that materiality matters. That is, scholars and practitioners alike argue that companies should conduct materiality analyses and that such analyses can inform both sustainability strategy and reporting. Companies' sustainability efforts and the reporting thereof are subject to continuous prioritization, for instance, regarding which efforts should be conducted, which indicators should be chosen as measures of performance and which information should be disclosed. Materiality assessments are central tools in such prioritizations, as they allow for an assessment of the relative importance of various sustainability issues. Furthermore, materiality assessments can help in the tradeoffs between potentially vastly different activities along each of the E, S and G dimensions.\n7w7j | At the heart of the apparent consensus about materiality, however, is an important source of confusion. As pointed out by Edgley, the malleable nature of the materiality concept has allowed for realignment and reinvention of the concept over time, to meet changing priorities and challenges. Materiality has been a contested concept for a long time. Already in two thousand and three, Simon Zadek and Mira Merme argued that materiality was in the process of being redefined through pressures from civil society, through regulatory and litigation pressures as well as through practices developed by business organizations themselves. The problem at present is that the concept of materiality as it relates to sustainability is used in two very different ways and that there is a tension between the two. The two approaches to materiality correspond with those used by the Global Reporting Initiative on the one hand and those used by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board on the other hand. They diverge from each other in an\n51vd | important way, as we will explore in depth below. This difference can easily deceive users of sustainability reports when references to \"material sustainability issues\" are made.\nbaj1 | In this paper, we take as point of departure the perspective of users of sustainability performance information in financial markets. The challenge of the two parallel approaches to materiality is important to this stakeholder group owing to their use of such information to inform investment and lending decisions. There is a widespread claim that companies that prioritize material sustainability issues in their strategies and operations are more profitable than those that do not. This is based on recent empirical findings that have received wide coverage in the business press. Furthermore, these findings have informed both consulting advice and investment advice. Importantly, however, while the empirical findings that are the basis for these conclusions are based on a SASB understanding of the concept of financial materiality, much of companies' activities on the measurement and reporting of sustainability performance is based on a wider GRI understanding of materiality. A lack of clarity about what is implied when referring to \"material sustainability issues\" may consequently lead users of this information to draw unjustified conclusions and make potentially wrong decisions (e.g. investment decisions) accordingly. Indeed, as pointed out by SASB CEO Janine Guillot and Chair of the SASB Standards Board Jeffrey Hales, the GRI and SASB \"have historically used fundamentally different definitions of materiality. This has led to a market dialogue in which even informed participants must take pains to avoid talking past each other.\"",
