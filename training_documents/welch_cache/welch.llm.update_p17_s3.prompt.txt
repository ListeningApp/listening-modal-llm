You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

mror | Speaking of that, I wanted to ask you about the guitar sound at the very top of "The Bells and the Birds." It's incredibly transporting, mesmerizing, rhythmic. That's just the two guitars?
zlxc | G.W .: Yeah. That's two guitars. [Laughs.]
k0bw | D.R .: Well, it would've started with Gill coming up with a finger-style guitar part of reasonable complexity.
aq5a | G.W .: Probably one of the more complex parts I play.
sc5y | D.R .: You were imagining trying to write something that felt a little bit like CSNY's "Guinevere."
0yab | G.w .: Something that floats. I wanted something that wasn't primitive, wasn't minimalistic.
w95z | D.R .: And you had the phrase "The Bells aAnd the Birds." I was thinking about old classical music, how they'd try to illustrate language with the instruments-I love that literalism. So I wanted there to be bell-ish sounds that went along with the title. I wanted to think about a part that would float above it. I just wanted to come up with a little part that would be chime-y and would drift and intertwine. That would have a landscape to it. We ended up recording it in a way where we used microphones between us to catch the sound already combined, as opposed to microphones closer to the guitars.
0i1k | G.w .: The music had actually combined in the air before the mike picked it up. So it has that organic swirling.
dqlg | In general, your work tends to be a little mournful, a little melancholic. I'm always curious about the animating impulse for songwriters-what sort of feeling, or what sort of idea, is most likely to get them to pick up a guitar or a pen. Do you find that you both tend to write through moments of contemplation or sadness more than moments of pleasure?
p6pq | G.W .: Yes. Yes, for me.
zse6 | D.R .: Yeah, I would agree. The songs all deal with a certain kind of melancholy something, but-
p2n3 | G.W .: Our narrators are never defeated. As low as they are, it's not the end. I do believe I'm an optimist. I have profound faith in the human spirit, that people can get through the unimaginable. I think that's in the songs, and it's related to us and to me and those moments when I pick up a guitar. And they do tend to be sorrowful moments. But that's just part of the human response. You don't get through something by ignoring it. You get through it by really feeling it. I have yet to find anything in my life that cannot be expressed through folk music.
ohh7 | I was a pretty obsessive music listener as a kid, and in a way, I think I learned what feelings were that way.
vbni | G.W .: I think about that all the time. It was my first glimpse of a world I felt like I wanted to be part of. I didn't want the boring world. I wanted the world with the drunks and the clowns and the suitcases. I had to work my way up to the more raw and primary emotions that are present in a Stanley Brothers song. That was a lot to handle. The drunk husband, the man damned to a life in jail-I had to work my way up to processing that. But now, you know, I'm kinda there. I'm a grown woman now, and-excuse my language-some shit has happened.
dgcw | It seems to me as if your lyrics are a mix of pure fiction and what could maybe be called autofiction. How often are your songs rooted in personal experience?
gvwz | D.R .: Sometimes you're writing a song about something completely different, and then you realize that there's an experience that you can draw upon that creates this beautifully incisive verse, and changes the course of the song. Maybe it wasn't what you were starting out to express, but all of a sudden you have this avenue to express it. I think in our world, we're not trying to . . . the things we're trying to express are always more complicated than just sitting down and saying, "I'm gonna write a song about this last experience that I had."
sk5m | G.W .: That's exactly it. I feel like we're right on the bull's-eye when there's mystery. When there's mystery, we're in the right place. We can't help but put true experiences into the songs. Lately, it has seemed to me that there's no such thing as truly random. You can put eight words on the table and my brain will connect them with something true.
qws8 | D.R .: There are things on this record that are incredibly autobiographical. When I say everything was colored by the experiences of the past five years, that's very true. But it narrows and obscures it to try and talk about it specifically.
877u | Last question: what's the hardest part of doing this job, and what's the best part?
rzhj | G.W .: You know, only with the onset of the pandemic did I fully realize that I had not spent a birthday at home in probably twenty-five years. And I didn't even know that I cared. But it was interesting to live in one place again. It reminded me of when we first moved to Nashville and I was getting to know Tennessee. I got to appreciate those little transitional weeks where you actually feel the seasons start to shift. And I loved that awareness. That was obliterated by life on the road. Also, when you move so much, it's hard to actually change. The world around you is changing so much that you just roll with it. But I felt, with Dave and myself, that we actually kind of changed. And that change is present in this album. It's one of my favorite things about this record. What do I love about this job? It brings me a kinship with the world. I'm a very solitary person, and I have virtually no family.
bfax | The music, and the people that hear our music, that's probably my No. 1 anchor to the world.
f2y8 | D.R .: The hardest part for me is not being able to focus on one thing. That's what being a musician has become. Forty years ago, you could drive into Laurel Canyon and be a decent songwriter, and there was an entire infrastructure in place.
o7qm | G.w .: All you had to do was play guitar and sing.
d52l | D.R .: But at this point, you have to wear a hundred hats, and it's very, very difficult. I don't like shifting gears. The flip side of this is that I've been able to experience all of these separate careers. All of a sudden being like, O.K., I have to stay up to write string parts, and I have to learn how to do that. What a wonderful thing to have the opportunity to do in your life. There's something really amazing about the size and complexity of the world that we've built around ourselves. But then when we go out and play shows, it's just the vehicle that we're driving, it's a couple guitars and a couple notebooks, a garment bag-
qlbb | G.W .: A suit and a dress.
nhsg | D.R .: And you stand up onstage in front of all these people and play. It's such an honor to have all of your energy focussed on this one thing that you care about so much. And to know that all the work you've done in the past-all the thinking about what the next line's going to be, or what the next story you're going to tell is, or what the next note you're gonna play is, or what you played last night that really was fun and you need to remember how to do that again because people enjoyed it so much and you enjoyed it, that you have this North Star. It's unreal.
hy0l | G.w .: It's so heartening that, with everything that's going on in everybody's lives and in the world, people still feel that impulse. They still want to go and sit in a dark room and listen to people sing.
