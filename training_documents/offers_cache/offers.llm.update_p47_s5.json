        "content": "z2dl | If you find a crazy good market, ride it, and ride it hard. And if you pair a Grand Slam Offer with a crazy market, you'll likely never need to work again (seriously). So have this skill set - the ability to accurately assess markets by taking into account pain, money, targeting, and growth - in your back pocket so that when lightning strikes, you can make sure it strikes twice.\nvtxq | Having established how to nail a market, let's get back to pricing. The first step to making crazy money is charging premium prices.\n571b | FREE GIFT NUMBER TWO BONUS TUTORIAL: WINNING MARKETS\nfg6a | If you want to know more about how I pick markets, and find niches that are profitable, go to Acquisition.com/training/offers course then watch \"Winning Markets\" for a short video tutorial. I've also included a Free Checklist to see how your market or niche measures up. It's absolutely free, enjoy.\no873 | PRICING: CHARGE WHAT IT'S WORTH\ntm0v | \"Charge as high a price as you can say out loud without cracking a smile.\"\nyusn | Dollars is greater than dollars\n5cww | A\nvgpr | ll I could see was black. My eyes felt glued shut. I was awake, but the fatigue in my temples felt like a five-pound weight was duct-taped to my skull, dragging my eyelids back down. I had to concentrate forcibly to open them.\nxrda | The details of the dimly lit room beamed in. I rolled over to the edge of the hotel room bed, feeling each and every muscle in my body as my weight shifted. Hunched on my side, I could see my clothes scattered on the floor. I was so beat the night before that I didn't even remember taking them off.\nu0fl | I had just finished a five-day gauntlet of keynote after keynote presentation. Two days of presentations for our highest-level clients immediately followed by spending two days planning with our entire company (one hundred thirty-five plus employees).\n1qe2 | I had missed a FaceTime call from my father the day before. I didn't have anything on my agenda for the morning. So I creakily got up, slid into a hoodie and some sweats, and walked into the hotel hallway to call him back. After the initial pleasantries, he immediately dove into why he was calling - parental concern.\nof19 | \"I saw the picture you posted of all your clients . .. \" he said, but in an unusually concerned tone. \"I thought the event was for all your highest-paying clients? I didn't know it was a big event. It looked like you had a thousand people there!\"\nl0xs | Alone in the hallway and struggling to shake the heavy weight of exhaustion still, I tried to gauge where his concern was coming from and what he was getting at. I had explained this all to him already. \"It was only for our highest-level clients, that wasn't all our clients,\" I said. \"Just the ones who pay forty-two thousand dollars a year ... our Gym Lords, like I told you.\"\nyrtf | \"Every single person in that picture paid you forty-two thousand dollars?\" He sounded almost frightened at the idea.\n9foe | \"Yeah, wild right?\" My voice was hoarse from days of speaking and thousands of twenty-second conversations.\nmind | \"Is it legal what you're doing?\" he asked. Wow. That escalated quickly, I thought to myself. \"Do they know they're paying you that much?\"\nzn89 | \"Yes, it's legal. And of course they know. It's not like magically siphoning money.\" \"That's a lot of money. I hope what you're giving them is worth it.\"\nb264 | I contemplated whether it was worth the effort to dive into this or just ignore it. But knowing this was going to be \"a thing,\" I took a deep breath and began to explain. \"If I made you two hundred thirty-nine thousand dollars extra this year, would you pay me forty-two thousand dollars?\" I asked, using \"two hundred thirty-nine thousand dollars\" because it was the average increase in topline revenue of a gym using our systems for eleven months.\njv66 | \"For sure,\" he said, \"I mean if I knew I was going to make that back. But what would I have to do?\"\n5507 | \"About fifteen hours a week of work\"\n74me | \"And how long would it take me to make the two hundred thirty-nine thousand dollars?\"\nexc2 | \"Eleven months\"\n8y62 | \"And how much of the forty-two thousand dollars would I have to pay you up front?\"\n4fig | \"Nothing. Just pay me as you start making the money using the system\"\nsksb | I watched it click. My dad got it. \"Oh,\" he said, \"well then, yeah, I would do it.\"\nop72 | \"And that's why they do it, too.\"\nim7i | Making shit loads of money breaks people's minds. It literally stretches their minds so far past what they believe is possible they assume you are doing something wrong or illegal. They literally \"can't even.\"\nrmuk | Why? Because they think to themselves . . . they can't be that much smarter than me or work that much harder than me, so how is it possible for them to make one thousand times more than me? Enough money that it would take me literally ten lifetimes to make what they make in a year.\nkadj | In the three years leading up to me writing this book, I took home over one million two hundred thousand dollars per month in profit. Every. Single. Month. That's more than the compensation for the CEOs of Ford, McDonald's, Motorola, and Yahoo . . . combined . . . every year . . . as a kid in his twenties.\n5kvy | It angers those who believe life isn't fair. It confuses others who cannot comprehend and believe there must have been a mistake. And it inspires a select few, who are bound for greatness.\n8wop | I hope that you are in the last category, because that is who I am writing this for.\nvcpg | You can do this.\nij2y | You just need to learn how.\nw7j4 | And I'm gonna show you.\nq8xw | Price to Value Discrepancy\n1m55 | \"I hope what you're giving them is worth it.\"\n2zaa | Those words would probably sting for most, but when my dad said them to me, I just knew he didn't understand the value we were providing. What I want to show you is how to create and communicate value, aka the \"worth-it-ness\" of an offer.\n4iwf | In order to understand how to make a compelling offer, you must understand value. The reason people buy anything is to get a deal. They believe what they are getting (VALUE) is worth more than what they are giving in exchange for it (PRICE). The moment the value they receive dips below what they are paying, they stop buying from you. This price to value discrepancy is what you need to avoid at all costs.\ngrmv | After all, as Warren Buffet said, \"Price is what you pay. Value is what you get.\"\nmrk0 | PRICE TO VALUE DISCREPANCY\nbash | The simplest way to increase the gap between price to value is by lowering the price. It's also, most of the time, the wrong decision for the business.\nxseo | Getting people to buy is NOT the objective of a business. Making money is. And lowering price is a one-way road to destruction for most - you can only go down to zero dollars, but you can go infinitely high in the other direction. So, unless you have a revolutionary way of decreasing your costs to one-tenth compared to your competition, don't compete on price.\n3oxf | As Dan Kennedy said, \"There is no strategic benefit to being the second cheapest in the marketplace, but there is for being the most expensive.\"\ngvhw | So the goal of our Grand Slam Offer will be to get more people to say yes at a higher price by increasing our value to price discrepancy. In other words, we will raise our price only after we have sufficiently increased our value. This way, they still get a great deal (think buying one hundred thousand dollars of value for ten thousand dollars). It's 'money at a discount.'\n4ta1 | FREE GIFT NUMBER THREE: BONUS TUTORIAL AND FREE DOWNLOADS: Charge What It's Worth\njokf | Why You Should Charge So Much It Hurts\nx0bn | Most business owners are not competing on price or value. In fact, they're not actually competing on anything at all. Their pricing process typically goes something like this:\n049a | One. Look at marketplace",
