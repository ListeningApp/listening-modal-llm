        "content": "87vz | Two thousand two). It also inhibits tyrosine hydroxylase activity and therefore DA synthesis. Somatodendritic D2 receptors in the VTA also regulate DA signaling. Upon DA release from the soma and dendrites, DA binds to somatodendritic D2 receptors, which activates hyperpolarizing G protein-gated inwardly rectifying potassium channel currents resulting in reduced firing rate and excitability of VTA DA neurons. While both axonal and somatodendritic D2 receptors reduce DA signaling onto medium spiny neuron in the NAc, it is unclear how regulation of DA signaling via axonal and somatodendritic D2 receptors is intertwined and whether treatments, that change efferent axonal DA release, also cause similar changes in local somatodendritic DA release. Additionally, neuronal DA signaling is modulated by surrounding astrocytes, along with microglia and oligodendrocytes, which are important for the homeostasis of the brain microenvironment.\nym66 | One point three. Operationalization of dopamine-dependent reward behavior\nl0a3 | As a result, DA signaling between VTA and ventral striatum portrays two specific signals, both of which are affected by a plethora of regulatory influences equally important to guide reward-seeking behavior and: one) DA functions as a learning signal by encoding the difference between an expected and received reward guiding future reward-seeking behavior and two) it encodes motivation to approach a possible reward. With both signals combined, DA conveys the decision variable \"available reward for investment of effort\", which is employed for both learning and motivational functions. Studies assessing reward-seeking behavior encoded by the DA midbrain in animals or humans employ many different tasks, each addressing a combination of the different aspects of reward-seeking behavior guided by learned associations. In animals, food, in particular palatable food high in sugar or addictive drugs are often used as rewards, the approach thereof, its retrieval and consumption as well as the effort exerted to obtain the reward are measured to quantify motivation. Place preference conditioned by reward-predicting stimuli and learning of reward magnitude and reward retrieval are widely used to analyze learning behavior. In humans, self-report questionnaires, a variety of motivation and learning tasks in combination with functional magnetic resonance imaging or positron emission tomography have been leveraged to disentangle the underlying mechanisms. While we here focus on DA-encoded reward-responsiveness, it needs to be kept in mind, that apart from the difficulty of deciphering the many aspects of reward-seeking behavior and the varied molecular regulators reward-seeking behavior is also affected by further cell types in the VTA and NAc, such as the VTA glutamate neurons, GABA neurons and local opioid signaling.\nu8nw | Two. Insulin signaling in the brain\nl2v9 | Motivated behavior - particularly food-seeking - critically depends on an organism's metabolic need and energy storage. Therefore, homeostatic information is integrated with external cues in the midbrain DA system through multiple pathways to ensure goal-directed adaptive behavior. One of these pathways comprises metabolic hormones, which bind to their respective receptors in the DA midbrain to convey the current homeostatic state. In particular, insulin receptors are densely expressed in DA circuits.\nafbe | Secreted in the pancreas, insulin reaches the CNS through the bloodstream and crosses the blood-brain barrier through a saturable\n78r8 | transport system. Rodent studies indicate that a small proportion of insulin is also directly synthesized in the brain, predominantly by neurons and neuronal progenitor cells of the olfactory bulb and the hippocampus. In particular, GABA-ergic neurogliaform cells have been identified as potential producers of insulin in the CNS. However, whether this CNS-derived insulin is physiologically relevant is still controversial and, so far, there is no evidence for local insulin production in the human brain.\n320g | In the brain, insulin receptors are ubiquitously expressed on neurons and glial cells, with the highest density in the olfactory bulb and the limbic areas. In contrast to adult peripheral tissues, where the long receptor isoform B predominates, neurons almost exclusively express the short isoform A, lacking twelve amino acids within the C-terminus of the alpha-subunit, but glial cells primarily express IR-B. In contrast to IR-B, IR-A has a two-fold higher sensitivity for insulin and can also bind IGF-one.\ntp8g | Two point one. Intracellular pathways activated by insulin\ngxfd | Insulin unfolds its action by binding to the extracellular alpha-subunit of the insulin receptor, which causes dimerization and auto-phosphorylation of the intracellular beta-subunit.\ns2v1 | This induces two canonical signaling pathways: one) the PI3K/AKT pathway via tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate proteins supported by the adaptor molecule SH2B1 and two) the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways via phosphorylation of Shc.",
