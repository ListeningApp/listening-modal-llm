        "content": "seik | Sodium chloride equivalent and isotopic data on the sulfide, sulfate, and silicate minerals indicate seawater-dominated fluids, possibly with a component of condensed vapor-phase liquid, and abundant fluid mixing between hydrothermal fluids and ambient seawater. The calculated temperatures of clay formation range from one hundred twenty-four to two hundred fifty-six degrees Celsius, lower than the calculated trapping temperatures of primary fluid inclusions in anhydrite and sphalerite, suggesting that the late sulfate-sulfide veins were likely transporting hotter fluids. The highest-temperature fluids likely boiled at a depth just below the deepest drill holes. Several lines of evidence indicate increasing temperature with depth: (one) the transition from barite near the surface to anhydrite at depth, (two) the progressive transition from smectite to mixed-layer illite/smectite (with increasing proportions of illite) to corrensite to chamosite, and (three) decreasing delta eighteen O and increasing delta D values of monomineralic clays. Calculated temperatures of formation increase by approximately one hundred thirty degrees Celsius from nontronite to chamosite to corrensite to rectorite. Downhole temperature gradients are as high as eighty degrees Celsius in just over one meter. However, several drill holes show reverse temperature gradients. In particular, data for TKAD zero twenty-six suggests decreasing temperatures from two hundred fifty-six degrees Celsius at two point nine meters below seafloor to one hundred sixty-one degrees Celsius at five point six meters below seafloor, reflecting the control of variable subseafloor permeability on lateral fluid flow and variable subsurface mixing with entrained seawater.\n\noq7c | The alteration mineralogy at Tinakula is similar to proximal footwall alteration associated with Kuroko-type VMS deposits. In these deposits, the shallow subseafloor strata surrounding the fossil upflow zones is dominated by low-temperature montmorillonite/nontronite, with higher-temperature illite/smectite plus pyrite present in the immediate footwall of the massive sulfide and illite/smectite plus chamosite and chamosite plus corrensite at depth, similar to sites A, C, and D at Tinakula.\n\nz4mi | Sites A and D are interpreted to be at the center of the highest-temperature upflow, where there is active venting, chalcopyrite-rich chimneys, and extensive formation of illite. The alteration mineralogy at sites B, C, E, and F reflects relatively lower temperatures, consistent with the dominant sphalerite- and barite-rich chimneys.\n\nhkft | The alteration assemblages are all associated with silicon loss, which may be partially related to dilution associated with anhydrite precipitation at depth, with net mass changes of as much as forty-nine percent. Similar loss of silicon has been documented in association with phyllosilicate alteration at the PACMANUS hydrothermal system in the Manus back-arc basin. In contrast, at Tinakula silicon gains occur at the tops of drill holes TKAD zero fifteen, TKAD zero thirty-two, and TKAD zero thirty-three, representing local silicification near the seafloor in the form of opaline silica filling void spaces. Large gains in calcium near the bottom of drill holes TKAD zero fifteen, TKAD zero twelve, and TKAD zero eighteen likely record the deposition of anhydrite at the higher subseafloor temperatures at depth, which could reflect incomplete removal of the anhydrite-rich matrix material during clast separations. Large mass gains in potassium oxide and light rare earth elements in the illite/smectite plus pyrite assemblages are similar to the observed mass changes in the feeder zones of VMS deposits hosted by felsic volcaniclastic rocks. Alteration in the immediate upflow zone at Tinakula might also be enhanced by the pyrite precipitation, which generates acid. In the surrounding permeable rocks, drawdown of seawater has added magnesium oxide. Intuitively, this process should be associated with cooling, but the higher temperatures of chlorite formation at depth in the Tinakula drill holes, based on delta eighteen O data, may also have increased the drawdown, resulting in the observed magnesium addition.\n\njai3 | Mineralization and alteration of the Tinakula SMS deposit\n\np57i | In permeable volcaniclastic rocks, an important question is how the permeability becomes sealed enough to allow focusing of the hydrothermal fluids to the seafloor. Here, we propose that the pervasive alteration of the volcaniclastic units close to the seafloor coincided with a progressive downward increase in subseafloor temperatures, from initial low temperatures during precipitation of nontronite, one hundred thirty-six to one hundred thirty-eight degrees Celsius, increasing to chamosite, one hundred twenty-four to two hundred five degrees Celsius, corrensite, two hundred seven to two hundred twenty-seven degrees Celsius, and eventually rectorite, two hundred fifty-six degrees Celsius. At one hundred fifty degrees Celsius, the temperatures were high enough to form anhydrite at depths of only a few meters below the seafloor, sealing off some permeability and focusing the fluids into channelized pathways to the seafloor. Continued hydrothermal circulation resulted in overpressuring and fracturing of this relatively impermeable layer, precipitating late sulfate veins with minor sulfide minerals, including sphalerite, at temperatures up to two hundred ninety-eight degrees Celsius. A similar model has been proposed for the anhydrite-cemented breccias in the Pacmanus deposit in the Manus basin and the Suiyo seamount and Iheya North Knoll field in the Izu-Bonin-Mariana arc. This process has been investigated using numerical modeling; in ancient deposits, anhydrite is rarely preserved because of its retrograde solubility; the only evidence remaining of an anhydrite seal would be the presence of alteration minerals formed at temperatures that would have caused anhydrite deposition. Chlorite-rich alteration pipes in otherwise permeable volcaniclastic sequences may have been shielded from infiltrating seawater by anhydrite that is no longer present in the rocks. Although rarely preserved in ancient VMS deposits, anhydrite and gypsum are locally abundant in the Kuroko ores and may have played an important role in the focusing of hydrothermal upflow in those deposits, as at Tinakula.",
