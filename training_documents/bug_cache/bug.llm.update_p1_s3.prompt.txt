You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

sb1e | Predicting Voice Behavior in Work Groups
w2yn | This field study of 441 full-time employees in 95 work groups examined voice behavior (constructive challenge to the status quo with the intent of improving the situation rather than merely criticizing) as a function of person-centered (satisfaction with the work group, global self-esteem) and situational factors (group size, self-managed vs. traditional style of management). Using a measure of voice with demonstrated construct validity, the study showed that these person and situation factors explained 10% of the variance in peer-rated voice assessed 6 months later. Significant Person X Situation interactions suggested that individuals with low global self-esteem or high satisfaction with their group were more responsive to the situational factors than individuals with high global self-esteem or low satisfaction. The authors discuss the importance of including person- centered characteristics, situational factors, and their interactions as predictors of voice.
ap6l | For over 50 years, scholars have recognized the impor- tance of behavior that goes beyond normal role expecta- tions or job requirements and that benefits or is intended to benefit the organization (Barnard, 1938; George & Brief, 1992; Katz & Kahn, 1978). Over the last decade research interest in these discretionary or extra-role be- haviors has increased; however, the primary focus has been on affiliative behaviors (e.g., helping) associated with "organizational citizenship" (e.g., Organ, 1988) and "contextual performance" (e.g., Motowidlo & Van Scot- ter, 1994). Although this research has led to a great deal of insight, other types of extra-role behavior have received far less attention (Graham, 1991; Van Dyne, Cum- mings, & McLean Parks, 1995). In this study we focused on voice behavior-speaking out and challenging the sta- tus quo with the intent of improving the situation. Al- though scholars have acknowledged the contributions that voice and change-oriented behavior can make to organiza- tional effectiveness (Katz & Kahn, 1978; Nemeth & Staw, 1989; Schein, 1968), voice is particularly important today given the emphasis on flexibility, innovation, and continu- ous improvement (Howard, 1995).
iest | Nowhere is the need for voice more important than in work groups. Work groups, or sets of interdependent
cox8 | individuals who share responsibility for outcomes (Sund- strom, DeMeuse, & Futrell, 1990), are increasingly being used as a means of dealing with competitive environments that demand flexibility (Ilgen, 1994). Instead of structur- ing work around individual-level jobs, work is assigned to groups that are expected to devise effective means for accomplishing the work (Cascio, 1995). In such situa- tions, group members must share ideas, knowledge, and insights so that multiple viewpoints are considered in making decisions (Hollenbeck, LePine, & Ilgen, 1996; Ilgen, LePine, & Hollenbeck, 1997; Nemeth, 1986; Schwenk, 1990).
ppqi | Over the past 30 years, researchers have spent a great deal of effort describing problems that occur when group members fail to speak out and share their ideas with each other (e.g., Janis, 1972; Kelman & Hamilton, 1989; Kiesler & Kiesler, 1969). This research focused on the outcome side of the voice nomological network (i.e., problems when people do not engage in voice). In con- trast, less research has focused on antecedents of voice. Furthermore, research on antecedents of voice is still in an early stage of development and has explained only a small amount of variance (e.g., Rusbult, Farrell, Rog- ers, & Mainous, 1988; Saunders, Sheppard, Knight, & Roth, 1992; Withey & Cooper, 1989). This is a problem because without knowledge of antecedents, researchers cannot make recommendations regarding how to manage voice in work groups. Given that organizations are in- creasingly dependent on their groups' success, it is critical for researchers to begin to fill this void. The purpose of this article and the study it reports, therefore, is to propose and assess a predictive model of voice that considers sev- eral antecedents. Before we can begin, however, we need to explain more precisely what we mean by voice.
oxou | Voice Research
495n | Van Dyne et al. (1995) reviewed the literature on extra- role behavior and proposed a two-dimensional typology and nomological network. On one dimension, their typol- ogy contrasts promotive and prohibitive behavior (encour- aging something to happen vs. encouraging something to cease). On the other dimension, their typology contrasts affiliative and challenging behavior (interpersonal behav- ior that promotes cooperation and strengthens relation- ships vs. change-oriented behavior that focuses on ideas and issues). Using this typology, Van Dyne and her col- leagues distinguished between several forms of extra-role behavior.
awri | Voice, defined as nonrequired behavior that emphasizes expression of constructive challenge with an intent to im- prove rather than merely criticize ( Van Dyne & LePine, 1998, p. 109), falls clearly in the promotive-challenging cell of the Van Dyne et al. (1995) typology. Voice is distinct from affiliative behavior (e.g., helping) normally associated with organizational citizenship (e.g., Smith, Organ, & Near, 1983) or contextual performance (e.g., Motowidlo & Van Scotter, 1994; Van Scotter & Motowi- dlo, 1996) because affiliative behavior (e.g., helping) is meant to preserve or improve relationships, whereas voice is challenging and may upset interpersonal relationships. Voice is also distinct from prohibitive behaviors such as whistle-blowing (Near & Miceli, 1987; Miceli & Near, 1992). Whistle-blowing is critical and meant to stop some activity as opposed to being constructive and meant to change (improve) some activity.
bl28 | From a theoretical and definitional perspective, given the definition of voice above, it is possible to further distinguish voice from other related behaviors. For exam- ple, we do not consider principled organizational dissent (Graham, 1986) to be voice because principled organiza- tional dissent focuses on objections based on conscien- tious or moral principles rather than suggesting more ef- fective ways of doing things. Voice behavior is also dis- tinct from complaining. Complaints reflect expression of dissatisfaction and do not necessarily include suggestions for change (Kowalski, 1996). Because we define voice as a behavior, our use of the term does not refer to the availability of grievance procedures or perceptions of ac- cess to grievance procedures. Finally, voice is distinct from normal role or in-role behavior when the expression of constructive challenge is not specified in formal job requirements or descriptions. That is, constructive sugges- tions made by consultants or other change agents in the context of their job requirements are not voice as defined here. One example of voice as we define it is when a group member makes an innovative suggestion for change to a standard operating procedure in order to improve
d5bz | work flow, even when such a suggestion might upset others.
