You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

For <LATEX>t > 1 . 5</LATEX> or so, the ensemble mean is seen to differ dramatically from the true solution. The specific reason in this case is that trajectories from the ensemble switch from one leaf of the attractor to the other at times that can be very different from <LATEX>t = 2 .</LATEX> Essentially, if the initial data are known only up to random errors that have standard normal distributions, then the true trajectory becomes unpredictable for <LATEX>t > 1 . 5</LATEX> or so. Averaging over many ensemble trajectories does not eliminate this bias. This situation is typical for nonlinear systems of differential equations; for linear systems, the ensemble mean always equals the true trajectory.
qb7o | Figure 20.5 again shows the x-component of the true trajectory, together with the corresponding results of the EnKf, for a ensemble of size 50. The data model is given by Eq. <LATEX>\left( 2 0 . 1 7 \right) ,</LATEX> with <LATEX>H = \left( \begin{array}{} { 1 } & { 1 } & { 0 } \\ { 0 } & { 1 } & { 1 } \end{array} \right)</LATEX> Therefore, only a two-dimensional projection of the true trajectory, corrupted by random noise, is observed at each time. The error terms <LATEX>\zeta _ { i }</LATEX> are standard normal <LATEX>N \left( 0 , 1 \right) .</LATEX> Each assimilated trajectory starts at a filtering state at <LATEX>t = i \left( r e d \quad c i r c l e \right)</LATEX> and ends at a forecasting state at <LATEX>t = i + 1</LATEX> (green circle). Evidently, the assimilation processes is only partially successful in approximating the correct trajectory. For example, on the intervals <LATEX>1 . 5 < t < 2</LATEX> and <LATEX>4 . 5 < t < 5 ,</LATEX> the assimilated trajectories are not even qualitatively correct. Nevertheless, it is remarkable that a significant portion of the true trajectory is recreated correctly over the entire interval of interest.

fim0 | 20.9 - Concluding Remarks
ojro | Data assimilation has been very important for weather prediction, where it has extended both the range and reliability of forecasts. In the best-case scenario, there is a correct dynamical model with sufficiently high resolution and a well-designed observational net- work that can provide accurate data. In the next-best-case scenario, there may be a some- what deficient dynamical model, but the observational network is still good enough to provide adequate data. Then it is still possible to obtain estimates in agreement with na- ture, as long as dynamical model errors are recognized and incorporated adequately.
l6t9 | In climate science, data assimilation has been used since the late 1980s. It is having an increasingly significant impact, since it allows improved and faster estimation of both internal and external parameters. Parameter estimation is particularly promising in the biogeochemistry of the climate system, where it is often difficult to measure rates directly in situ. Realistic dynamical models and feasible measurements of quantities such as con- centration fields of plankton, in combination with advanced data assimilation techniques, can lead to surprisingly realistic estimates of these rates.
1ujy | Data assimilation techniques have been applied to create reliable uniform background data for the past (reanalysis) and to obtain information about unobservable quantities such as ocean upwelling and chemical reaction rates in the ocean. A typical example is described in [11], where an EnKf approach is used to reconstruct the ocean climate for the period 1958-2001.
qzor | Interestingly, there are specific problems with heterogeneous data sources associated with all reanalysis exercises for ocean circulation for the 20th century. Since about 1980, satellites with circumpolar orbits have provided reliable records of planet-wide uniformly distributed ocean measurements. But prior to about 1980, observations came mainly from shipboard observations that were concentrated along major shipping routes. There are also other more subtle trends in the data collection efforts that are known to introduce spurious trends during data assimilation. For example, the typical height at which ship- board anemometers are mounted has increased since the middle of the last century, leading to biased results for wind strengths and patterns. In the past, when data assimilation was used mainly for weather prediction, such slow trends did not matter.
a0by | Ridgwell et al. [88] describe a similar project for biogeochemistry data. Here, an EnKf is employed in an iterative fashion to obtain steady-state information about geochemical parameters such as uptake rates and concentrations of phosphate and calcium carbonate in the ocean at preindustrial times.
u1ky | The EnKf is known to run into problems when the underlying process model is highly nonlinear and has many unstable equilibria. Other methods have been proposed for such situations. For example, Apte, Jones, and Stuart [2] develop a Bayesian approach to ad- dress data assimilation questions coming from drifting buoys, which are known to have trajectories that are very sensitive to changes in the initial data.
