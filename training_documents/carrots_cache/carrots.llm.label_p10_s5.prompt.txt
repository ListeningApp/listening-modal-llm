You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

06yq | Microdosing with psychedelics to self-medicate for ADHD symptoms in adults: A naturalistic study
dpv6 | ARTICLE INFO
8r5j | ABSTRACT
2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

duk7 | Because board approval is necessary for VC exits, VCs negotiate aggressively for board seats when investing in startups.39 While data on board composition in private, VC-backed firms are scarce, two persistent patterns emerge from various small-scale studies of VC contracting documents and VC-backed firms. First, VC board representation tends to increase with new financing rounds, especially outside rounds that bring in new VCs.40 Second, in a plurality of firms, neither common shareholders nor VC-appointed directors ever achieve outright control; the swing vote remains in the hands of an independent director.41 Keeping the swing vote in the hands of an independent director makes it more difficult for either the common shareholders or the preferred shareholders to act opportunistically with respect to the other class of shareholders.42 But as one of us has argued in

ge34 | 111
as1h | 2013]
rjx9 | other work, these studies (and the outwardly neutral appearance of independent directors) may understate the extent of de facto VC control over startup boards.43
2wdq | 2. Shareholder Rights
n3dv | As noted above, for VCs seeking an exit transaction, board approval is not sufficient. Shareholder approval is also necessary.
ruwp | As a matter of corporate law, some shareholder approval is always required. The nature of that approval will depend on the corporate law of the state in which the firm is domiciled as well as the firm's charter and other organizational documents. In some states, such as Delaware, the default arrangement is that a majority of preferred and common shares (voting together) must approve exit transactions.44 But alternative arrangements, including provisions giving particular series of preferred stock veto rights, are common.45 In other states, including California, a majority of each class of shares (including common stock) must approve exit transactions. 46
sy54 | As a matter of business practice, the buyer in a trade sale may also insist on shareholder approvals not required by corporate law or the firm's organizational documents. For example, a buyer might be concerned about appraisal rights. Under corporate law, dissenting shareholders in a merger (those voting against the transaction) can exercise appraisal rights and have a court determine the "fair value" of their shares; the buyer is then forced to pay fair value to these dissenters.47 If the court's determination of fair value is much higher than the amount paid per share in the transaction, the cost of acquiring the target could rise substantially. To minimize potential appraisal claims, an acquirer may insist that a supermajority of shareholders approve the transaction.48 The bottom line is that corporate law may provide only a floor

lls5 | for shareholder-approval requirements.
vfnk | Because common shareholders' approval is sometimes needed as a matter of corporate law (in states where approval by each class of stock is required) or business practice, VCs can (and sometimes do) negotiate for "drag-along" rights that allow them to force common shareholders to vote for any transaction favored by the VCs.49 If the common shareholders have agreed to vote their shares as directed by the VCs, they cannot block an exit transaction via a class vote.50 Instead, they must seek other means to stop the transaction.
zq2s | II POTENTIAL ENTREPRENEURIAL-TEAM RESISTANCE TO TRADE SALES
6cek | This Part explores why the entrepreneurial team may resist a trade sale that the VCs propose. Subpart A explains why founders and other executives may oppose, and may be able to impede, a trade sale. Subpart B explains why common shareholders may oppose, and may be able to impede, a trade sale.
1q52 | A. Resistance by the Founder and Executives
5qnn | The founder and other executives may have both reasons and the means to oppose a trade sale.
tbd2 | 1. Incentive
svcp | Consider a founder who is still the CEO. The founder-CEO may have ambitious (perhaps grandiose) financial and nonfinancial aspirations for the startup. He or she may believe that these aspirations can be realized only if the startup remains independent and he or she remains in control. A trade sale may well snuff out these aspirations. To the extent the founder-CEO wants to keep the startup independent so that it can realize its full "potential," he or she may oppose a trade sale.
1k6p | Whether or not the founder is still part of the management team, the firm's executives might have two very practical reasons to oppose a trade sale. First, the executives may well be replaced or subject to tighter supervision as the firm comes under the control of a single shareholder (the acquirer). The acquirer could thus force the executives to give up the pay, perquisites, and

i5a5 | CARROTS AND STICKS
0kul | 2013]
rj31 | prestige associated with their positions-or to work harder for them.51
nnf7 | Second, executives may own substantial amounts of common stock in the firm, especially if they are part of the founding team. As we discuss below, a trade sale may yield little for common shareholders while eliminating the option value of their stock.52 To the extent executives own common stock that they will be forced to give up for less than its option value, they have another reason to try to block a trade sale.
i0m7 | 2. Ability
rf6v | Executives of VC-backed firms seeking to block a trade sale have three potential means to do so. First, and most importantly, they can refuse to cooperate in the sale of the firm. They can refuse to report acquisition interest to the VCs, they can drag their feet in dealing with a potential acquirer, and they can refuse to provide information or emphasize negative aspects of the business to a potential acquirer. Moreover, if a potential acquirer wants members of the executive team to stay on after the acquisition (for example, to continue developing a startup's technology), executives can block the deal by refusing to work for the acquirer. In short, executives can use their positional power in the firm to undermine and sabotage efforts to sell it.
cz3m | Second, to the extent executives have seats on the board, they can threaten to vote against a sale and try to persuade independent directors to oppose the transaction. Attorneys advising a board may prefer a vote to be unanimous because it reduces litigation risk. The desire for a unanimous vote would increase the ability of even a single director to impede a sale.
bqqd | Third, if common-shareholder approval is necessary for the deal and executives own a large block of common shares, they can threaten to vote their shares against the deal and lobby other common shareholders to oppose the deal. This brings us to common-shareholder opposition to trade sales.
2ave | B. Opposition by Common Shareholders
lzxh | Common shareholders, like executives, may also have an incentive (and some ability) to impede a trade sale.
21dc | VCs exiting via trade sale can always choose to retain their preferred shares rather than convert them into common shares. In this scenario, the
zw7x | Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2221033
8zk4 | 114
8nk0 | CARROTS AND STICKS
89e4 | VCs have liquidation preferences that must be paid in full before common shareholders receive any payout. Thus, common shareholders may not receive much, if anything, in a trade sale. However, even if the VCs' liquidation preferences exceed the sale price, the common stock might have considerable option value at the time of sale: if the firm is not sold now, it might later hit a home run and be sold later for a price that far exceeds the preferred shareholders' liquidation preferences, giving a large payout to common shareholders.53 The less common shareholders receive, and the greater the loss of option value, the more common shareholders will wish to block a trade sale.
9bon | In blocking a sale, the common shareholders' goal may not be to keep the startup independent so that it can later go public. Rather, these shareholders may resist a trade sale today because they believe that, if the startup remains independent, there is a good chance that the future will bring a more attractive trade sale-one that provides significantly more value for common shareholders.
gmw8 | 2. Ability
6bja | Common shareholders can block a trade sale in three ways: by (a) using their shareholder voting rights; (b) litigating or threatening litigation; or (c) using their influence over the board.
su5i | a. Shareholder Voting Rights
15ws | As we explained in Part I.B.2, common-shareholder approval may be necessary to conduct a trade sale. In particular, such approval will be necessary if (1) corporate law or the acquirer requires common-shareholder approval, and (2) the VCs fail to negotiate effective drag-along rights enabling them to force the common shareholders to vote for a VC-favored sale. If neither corporate law nor the acquirer demands common-shareholder approval (or the VCs have effective drag-along rights), then common shareholders cannot threaten to hold up the deal through their voting rights.
ss8f | b. Fiduciary-Duty and Other Litigation
6pdd | To try to block a deal, common shareholders can also threaten to sue the board or the VCs directly for, among other things, breach of fiduciary duties under corporate law. Common shareholders' litigation leverage will depend in part on the corporate laws of the state in which the firm is domiciled. The

2ppr | CARROTS AND STICKS
5ljm | 115
eymg | 2013]
3inv | easier it is to demonstrate a breach of fiduciary duty under that state's corporate law, the more leverage common shareholders will have.
fax0 | But there are two limitations to common shareholders' ability to credibly threaten litigation. First, aggrieved common shareholders will often lack the financial ability to sue VCs.54 Second, there may well be large reputational costs to litigating against VCs.55 All in all, the actual likelihood of litigation will probably be low.
60ky | Board Influence
7ifq | A third mechanism by which common shareholders can impede a trade sale is by asking their representatives on the board (if there are any) and any independent directors (if there are any) to vote against the transaction. Common shareholders will have considerable influence on how the board votes if a majority of the board's seats are held by a combination of common-shareholder representatives and independent directors. Indeed, given directors' preference for unanimous board votes, even a stubborn minority of directors who care about the interests of common shareholders might be able to block a sale that is unfavorable to common shareholders.
rzjb | III VCS' POTENTIAL CARROTS AND STICKS
hm8k | In Part II, we saw that founders, other executives, and common shareholders of VC-backed startups may have the incentive and ability to resist a trade sale. In this Part, we describe the carrots and sticks that VCs can use to induce founders and other executives (subpart A) and common shareholders (subpart B) to go along with trade sales.56 Subpart C explains that, from the VCs' perspective, both carrots and sticks entail costs.
5tlv | Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2221033
ctln | CARROTS AND STICKS
feis | A. Founders and Executives
ignx | To induce founders and other executives to facilitate rather than impede a trade sale, VCs may either offer carrots or deploy various sticks.
4voz | For founders and other executives, the VCs can use direct carrots (management bonuses) or indirect carrots (carve-outs to common shareholders).
ekp7 | a. Management Bonus
vkmi | The direct carrot is a "management bonus" triggered by the sale and generally tied to the sale price. The bonus may be structured in a variety of ways. To begin, executives can be promised ex ante, even before an acquirer is identified, a portion of the sale proceeds. Alternatively, executives can be given a contemporaneously negotiated payment. This ex post payment might be labeled as a "bonus" or, alternatively, characterized as consideration for a noncompete or consulting agreement.57
wwtn | The cost to VCs of using a management-bonus carrot will depend on the sale price relative to the aggregate liquidation preferences at the time of sale. If the sale price exceeds the aggregate liquidation preferences, the original common shareholders will pay for much (or all) of the management-bonus carrot. If the sale price is less than the aggregate liquidation preferences, the VCs will shoulder all of the cost of the carrot.
a86p | b. Carve-Out to Common
n8dg | The indirect carrot is a carve-out to the common shareholders as a class. A carve-out entitles common shareholders to a portion of the proceeds from the trade sale even if the firm is sold for less than the VCs' liquidation preferences. To the extent that the founders and executives own shares of common stock, they will share pro rata in the carve-out. For example, if founders and executives own 50% of the common stock, a carve-out to common of $10 million will yield founders and executives $5 million.
devf | 2. Sticks
z7gp | VCs facing recalcitrant founders and other executives have two potential sticks at their disposal.
g8ms | First, VCs could threaten to fire the founder and other executives if they refuse to cooperate in a trade sale. Termination would cut off future compensation and perhaps cause the forfeiture of unvested equity. Such a
mwd1 | Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2221033
k3qq | CARROTS AND STICKS
he9k | 2013]
vp1d | step would be quite painful for the executives.
r8to | But such a tactic would also be quite costly for the VCs. The startup would lose its management team, which may be crucial to a potential buyer; the VCs would be forced to spend time and energy finding a replacement; and the new team would then need to be brought up to speed and adequately incentivized to assist in selling the firm. As a result, we would expect VCs to wield this stick rarely, if at all.
wajy | b. Blacklisting
ao6z | Second, VCs could threaten to blacklist founders and other executives who refuse to cooperate in a trade sale. VCs are repeat players in both funding entrepreneurs and hiring professional executives for startups. Neither entrepreneurs nor professional managers will want to displease the VCs, all else being equal.
q0m5 | B. Common Shareholders
yhdc | To induce common shareholders to support a trade sale, the VCs have one carrot at their disposal and a number of sticks.
jte4 | 1. Carrot: Carve-Out to Common
61c4 | The carrot VCs can offer common shareholders is a carve-out from their liquidation preferences (or other cash-flow rights) so that common shareholders receive more than they are contractually entitled to receive. Such a carve-out to common can both induce common shareholders to vote for the sale and cause them to refrain from suing.
kesh | 2. Sticks
d8t0 | VCs can wield a number of sticks to compel the class of common shareholders to vote for the trade sale. However, these sticks cannot prevent a lawsuit and may in fact increase the likelihood of one.
6kpu | a. Cross-Voting
eeeo | To eliminate common shareholders' ability to block a trade sale, VCs can either partially convert their shares into common stock or exercise warrants to buy common stock so as to acquire a sufficient amount of common stock to achieve the necessary approval threshold. Consider the transactions in Orban v. Field,58 a Delaware case involving a common-shareholder lawsuit against a VC-controlled board. Office Mart, a Delaware corporation, arranged to be acquired by Staples in a merger that provided no payout to its common shareholders.59 The charter allowed preferred shareholders to vote alongside common shareholders on an as-converted basis (as if their stock had been
qukw | Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2221033
0hrs | CARROTS AND STICKS
r8pf | converted into common shares), and the preferred shareholders had enough votes to ensure shareholder approval of the transaction as required by corporate law.60 However, for accounting reasons, Staples insisted that at least 90% of Office Mart's common shares be voted in favor of the transaction.61 Common shareholders, led by Office Mart's founder and former CEO George Orban, refused to back the deal, demanding $4 million in exchange for their votes.62
