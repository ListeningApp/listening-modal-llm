You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

pxbq | On the north-western periphery of Europe, the major countries had not experienced the trauma of defeat, humiliation and territorial amputation. Here, ethnic divisions (with the partial exception of Belgium, where the divide was, in any case linguistic and cultural rather than strictly ethnic) played no great role in

u15r | politics. Ideological conflicts were largely along class, not ethnic, lines, and the ruling elites, backed by adaptable constitutions, could accommodate and institutionalise conflict. In their colonial territories and settler dominions, of course, such states could exercise and back the use of massive violence towards the indigenous populations.27 Colonialism fostered racist attitudes back in the homeland. But since the ethnic minorities there were small and insignificant, in terms of challenging for political power, or were integrated (as were the Welsh and the Scots, if not the Irish) into the constitutional arrangements of the existing nation-state, ethnically based violence was not to be expected. Nor, from the point of view of the British state, was the violence deployed in Ireland motivated by ethnic considerations.
lq35 | As the outstanding work of Michael Mann has shown, ethnicity, where rival ethnic groups are involved in a real (or imaginary) contest for state power in disputed territories - not just in Europe and not just in the inter-war period - turned into possibly the most potent element in large-scale political violence in the twentieth century as more and more ethnically split countries sought to push through policies based on organic nationalism aimed at ethnically 'cleansed' nation-states.28
3g9w | Let me turn briefly here to the third question I raised. Was there simply more violence in the twentieth century? Or was it qualitatively different from what had gone before, more modern? Most experts on genocide agree in stressing its modernity. Michael Mann, above all, has argued - convincingly to my mind - that the mass killing of civilians (or less murderous brutal persecution and 'cleansings') on ideological grounds 'in the name of the people', whether ethnically driven (as against Armenians, Jews, Bosnian Muslims, Albanian Kosovans or Rwandan Tutsis) or class-driven (as in Stalinist anti-Kulak terror or Pol Pot's 'classicide') forms a crucial component of what makes modern political violence modern.29 Of course, the mass killing of civilians was nothing new. And ideology - of a religious, not secular kind - was also used in earlier times to justify it. Tens of thousands were killed in Albigensian Crusade of the early thirteenth century, the French wars of religion of the latter half of the sixteenth century, and the Thirty Years War of the seventeenth century, for example, most of them in the name of religion. The sacking of Magdeburg by Catholic forces in 1631, when possibly as many as 30,000 men, women and children were slaughtered, and Cromwell's ruthless storming of Drogheda and Wexford ten years later, in which some 4,500 people (though mainly garrison soldiers) were put to the sword in God's name, were particularly brutal massacres on the grand scale. But religious violence - or violence in the name of religion - usually stopped at converts. That is to say, conversion to the other side was usually sufficient to prevent or mitigate violence. And sieges did not normally lead to massacres where the garrison readily accepted

ylhz | force majeure and surrendered promptly according to given rules. Moreover, ethnicity was seldom, if ever, a sole or prime factor.
a3td | How different this became once the idea - in essence, of course, a positive one - of popular sovereignty implanted itself from 1789 onwards. The upturning and abuse of the original ideals of nationalism was a necessary accompanying development, and in the late nineteenth century the ideological forces which would light the conflagration after 1918 were already gathering pace. As noted earlier, traditional or long-standing social resentments, often laden with violence, were now presented with ideological justification. Violence against disliked or supposedly threatening ethnic minorities escalated wildly. Spontaneous outbursts - which on investigation usually turned out to be locally organised 'spontaneity' - could produce huge bloodletting in massacres and pogroms. But for violence to take shape as full-scale genocide a further ingredient was needed: the ideologically driven modern state. Ethnicity or class, depending upon regime, then turned into givens for the sections of the population affected, unchangeable stamps which, irrespective of all other considerations, determined life or death for millions. Being a Jew under Hitler, a Kulak under Stalin, an intellectual under Pol Pot, was tantamount to a death warrant. This was, therefore, a very modern feature of modern political violence.
ex5k | Two other important components, both already touched on, complement this vital feature in the link between modernity and violence. One is bureaucracy and planning; the other comprises science and technology. Both are unmistakable in the Nazi paradigm. One of the most shocking aspects of Nazi violence, to latter-day sensibilities, is that it occurred in such a modern state, with an advanced economy, sophisticated administration, a high level of education and elevated culture. Of course, in a way this comes close to saying that such barbarism might have been expected in a primitive society, but not in a modern, civilised one. Whatever the prejudice in the presumption, it misses the point. Nazi violence could only be so extreme precisely because it was so modern. To accomplish it needed the planners and orchestrators in a multiplicity of state and party offices; it needed the academics - a good number of them historians, some later to achieve great renown - who put their intelligence and abilities to working out how to 'de-judify' (their expression) cities such as Warsaw and Cracow;30 it needed the data-collectors using punch-card machines as a more efficient way of compiling lists of victims;31 it needed doctors at the forefront of their profession prepared to engage in the most vile of medical experiments in the interests of scientific progress;32 it needed the chemists of the Degesch company to produce

cjq2 | the Zyklon-B, first for disinfection, then for human extermination;33 and it needed the engineers of Topf and Sons, Erfurt, who could design to order the Auschwitz gas chambers and crematoria.34
5esx | Of course, without the ideology of racial mastery driving the Nazi regime, and without the corrupting allure of all organisational structures in Hitler's Germany, such scientists, academics, doctors, engineers and civil servants would have been going about the more normal pursuits appropriate to their professions in the modern state. But the ways in which modern bureaucracy and science readily put themselves at the service of such an ideology prompted Zygmunt Bauman to assert that the Holocaust, and modern genocide more widely, 'arose out of a genuinely rational concern, and . .. was generated by bureaucracy true to its form and purpose'.35 It is an overblown claim. It would be a mistake to substitute the instrument for the ideological driving force as the determinant of the Holocaust. And there was little that was bureaucratically rational about some - perhaps most - other instances of twentieth- century genocide. But it is surely correct to claim that without the bureaucracy which is a hallmark of modernity 'the Holocaust would be unthinkable'.36 When Bauman interprets the Holocaust as 'an element of social engineering, meant to bring about a social order conforming to the design of the perfect society',37 he touches on a further important strand of the modernity of political violence: its connection with modern utopias in which it is assumed that perfection can be brought about on this earth and by secular means, the ultimate replacement of God by man as the arbiter of life and death. But, again, it would be as well not to concentrate exclusively on political violence as modernity in the sense of a rational pursuit of the perfect society. Much of the violence and killing - including that by the Nazis - used nothing more modern than a rifle, while the phenomenal killing-rate in the Rwandan genocide depended in good measure on weapons no more sophisticated than machetes.38 The modernity of the killing methods, in other words, was related to the modernity of the state directing them. But what were crucially modern were the ideologies underpinning the methods - the actual cause of the violence and killing. And the most important - and lethal - of these has probably been that of integral nationalism, usually demanding ethnic exclusivity.
m5ka | Why was the second half of the twentieth century less violent? Or is this a mirage - a European optical illusion?
byu8 | The unbelievably benign decades after 1950 in much of Europe certainly marked the sharpest of contrasts - even allowing for Bosnia and Kosovo - with the apocalyptic first half of the century. A major factor was, of course, the absence of all but regional

zxz6 | war (and that not before the 1990s). With Europe bled white and divided between the victorious superpowers of the United States and the USSR, both interested in their different ways in dominating their respective halves of the continent, the massively destabilising forces of the years immediately following the First World War could never replicate themselves. The cold war itself, for all its inherent dangers, served as an integrating and stabilising element. A second factor of the utmost importance, again in contrast to the 1920s and 1930s, was the onset of an era - Hobsbawm's 'golden age' - of unprecedented prosperity. Sometimes we do learn from history, if not always very well. Even in the 1930s, some far-sighted thinkers had seen that tariff barriers hindering the distribution of wealth in Europe, and notably the German claims on a share of that wealth, were asking for trouble. The abolition of tariff barriers, internationalisation of trade within western Europe through the establishment of a common market, and the huge surge in prosperity produced by the post-war consumer boom laid foundations in western Europe on which inter-governmental economic and political co-operation could build - a framework of co-operation likely to prevent political disorder leading to the collapse of state systems and to limit the dangerous growth of extremist movements. A third factor, at least in western Europe, was the absence of the ethnic tensions which had been such a source of violence between the wars. The heated issue of Germany's eastern borders, with the violence the disputed territories had provoked before 1939, was effectively resolved with the massive and brutally executed ethnic cleansings in eastern Europe between 1945 and 1950,39 and the extension of Soviet control and huge repressive power deep into the territory of Germany itself. Some flashpoints of violence remained. No longer integral nationalism with all its evils, but now breakaway nationalism posed a problem in some places. Northern Ireland and the Basque country have stayed regions in which breakaway nationalist tendencies and political intransigence have produced endemic anti-state violence - mercifully, perhaps now at last calming in Ulster. However, these have been - in a broad European context - peripheral rather than central problems. And they have not generated major violence - at least contrasted with the first half of the century - by the states targeted by the forms of terrorist actions and guerrilla warfare. In general, levels of violence by the state itself throughout western Europe have been low because state-control mechanisms have become more effective, and, especially, because the conditions which prompted such extreme violence in the inter-war period have been largely absent.
xnth | In most of eastern Europe the heavy hand of Soviet rule contained for four decades the ethnic tensions and violence which had poisoned this part of the continent before the Second World War. In Yugoslavia, Tito's clever mix of repression and integration had the same effect. Where anti-Soviet insurgency forced its way through, as in East Germany in 1953, Hungary in 1956, and Czechoslovakia in 1968, it was fairly rapidly quelled and repressive calm restored. It was only once drab containment disappeared with the sudden collapse of the Soviet bloc in 1989-90 that ethnic tensions and accompanying violence in some areas of the former USSR, notably the Caucasus,

2zmw | surfaced with vehemence and are far from quietened even now. In ex-Yugoslavia, the destabilisation after Tito's death in 1980 led by the end of that decade to the stirrings of new and violent nationalism, especially among the Serbs, who used nationalist myth to justify modern ethnic cleansing of a most vicious kind in Bosnia, then in Kosovo. Appalling and terrible though this resurgence of ethnic violence within Europe was, it was a spectacular eruption in one region rather than the symptom of a general problem. The proto-genocidal climate and actions of the inter-war period have been generally absent in eastern and central Europe. The remarkable thing is how non-violent the transition since 1990 to new socioeconomic structures in these regions of the continent has proved. The lack of resistance to change by the moribund old order provides part of the explanation for this. The diminished framework for ethnic conflict within the former communist states - even with the two big exceptions of Chechnya and ex-Yugoslavia - coupled with the absence of any clear alternative ideology to that of triumphant, western capitalist liberal democracy, once the organisational and mobilising potential of communism had been removed or emasculated, is a further significant factor.
bf9k | In other parts of the world, the second half of the twentieth century could hardly be described as benign. Violence towards civilian populations, usually in the context of war, whether from bitter civil conflict or invasion by neighbours related to unresolvable territorial disputes, has been endemic and huge in scale. In the 1960s and 1970s alone, 'massive massacres amounting to genocide' - a phrase used in a speech in 1979 to Amnesty International - took place, according to one listing, in eleven countries, including the mega-horror of Cambodia.40 The single example of Rwanda in 1994 is sufficient to remind us that genocide spawned by war is by no means confined to a more distant past. The inescapable dangers of the Kashmir and Palestinian conflicts at the present time are there for all to see. And, though Europe is not a direct participant in these conflicts, today's global politics - and perhaps also a lingering historical sense of some moral responsibility - means that it is both involved and affected.
otkr | Looked at globally, and unmistakably evident in the European context, the major difference between the violence in the two halves of the century has been the impact of the two world wars. The second of those wars led to the containment, even eradication, of the main sources of state-sponsored violence, on any large scale in Europe. Outside Europe, repressive violence by colonial powers in the first half of the century gave way in the second to anti-colonial violence at first, but then, increasingly, major outbursts of internal violence, particularly where ethnic divides coincided with serious contests for power. Interstate border disputes, often with an ethnic tinge linked to religious divisions, continue to be a major source of violence and the resort to armed conflict. To this, no end is in sight.
