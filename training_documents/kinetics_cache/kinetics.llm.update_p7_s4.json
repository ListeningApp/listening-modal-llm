        "content": "gxfd | The hierarchical statistical model developed here can give a mechanistic interpretation for Unique Molecular Identifiers based on single-cell RNA sequencing data. In fact, this model not only captured the characteristics of transcriptional burst kinetics and feedback regulations, but also described the measured noise of Unique Molecular Identifiers data (see 'Materials and Methods'). Then, we used the maximum likelihood method to determine burst kinetics and feedback forms (positive-, negative-, non-feedback) within biologically reasonable ranges of model parameters. Note that the inferences with traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods would need huge and even unaffordable computational costs since the static messenger RNA distribution was expressed in a high-order integral that is difficult to solve. To overcome this difficulty, we developed a fast algorithm for computing this distribution based on generalized Gauss-Laguerre quadrature rules, thus realizing a scalable genome-wide inference (see 'Materials and Methods').\ns2v1 | To evaluate the validity of our inference method, we first explored the sensitivity of distribution shapes to changes in model parameters. We found that the genes with high expression levels were more sensitive to model parameters than the other genes. Then, to test the reliability of the method in inferring kinetic parameters, we generated synthetic single-cell RNA data by stochastic sampling from the distribution for the hierarchical model with known parameter values. Through inference using the synthetic data, we can give robust estimates of burst frequencies, burst sizes, and feedback forms from the corresponding static messenger RNA distributions. Besides, we also assessed the robustness of our inference method to different cell numbers and stochastic losses of messenger RNA molecules (mimicking the incomplete messenger RNA detection in single-cell RNA sequencing protocols). Overall, we provided a mechanistic model and an effective, robust and scalable inference method for learning dynamic burst kinetics and feedback forms from static snapshot data, which can be conveniently used in the analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing data.\njkp9 | Next, we applied our hierarchical model and inference approach to the single-cell RNA sequencing data of primary mouse fibroblasts. From the original Unique Molecular Identifiers data containing ten thousand seven hundred twenty-seven genes and two hundred twenty-four cells, we selected two thousand one hundred sixty-two highly expressed genes using a quality control method and then merged two allelic expression data into a matrix to infer burst kinetics and feedback forms. We observed that these selected genes were transcribed with widely different burst kinetics, and in particular, those genes with the same average expression level exhibited diverse burst kinetics, implying that the expressions of different genes were regulated possibly by different molecular mechanisms. To check the validity of these inferred results, we performed a goodness-of-fit test (see 'Materials and Methods'). We found that the distributions from the dataset were consistent with those obtained using the inferred parameters.\nz8tt | ure S7a), and confirmed that the messenger RNA mean and variability in the mechanistic model matched those in the data. All the good-fit genes can be classified into three categories: six hundred twenty-six positive-feedback genes, six hundred twenty-five negative-feedback genes, and eight hundred forty non-feedback genes. The inferred results for example genes: Mbnl two, Prr thirteen, Ralb, and Plod one were demonstrated in Figure two a one-a four, showing that these genes had different feedback forms and followed different distributions. Interestingly, our hierarchical model can particularly recover bimodal distributions from static data, which however were fitted as unimodal distributions via the telegraph model without feedback (e.g. the distribution of the Mbnl two gene as shown in Figure two a one and more genes as shown in Supplementary Figure S eight). In addition, we compared the inferred results between our hierarchical model and the telegraph model, finding that both models captured almost the same gene-expression variability (Coefficient of Variation squared, Figure two B) while keeping high correlations between burst frequencies and burst sizes (Figure two C, D, P-value less than two point two times ten to the negative sixteen). Notably, we found that the forms of dynamic feedback regulations can lead to different burst kinetics on a genome-wide scale but cannot be inferred by previous methods.\n9g22 | Feedbacks modulate burst frequencies and sizes differently",
