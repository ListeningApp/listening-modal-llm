        "content": "5vqw | Like the earlier AOR, however, classic rock broadcasting has tended to adhere to rigidly controlled selections of songs and an entrenched mythology that has had the unfortunate effect of making the music less and less interesting. Even Led Zeppelin's boosters admit that the band's place in the classic rock system has harmed the group as much as it has helped them: in his liner notes to the nineteen ninety Zeppelin four-CD box set, critic Robert Palmer wrote, \"The preponderance of 'Led Clones' on American FM radio, and continuing frequent airplay for the original recordings, have kept the band's legacy alive. They have also done our memories of the band a great disservice by carrying on as if 'Stairway to Heaven' and a few crunching, blues-based riff tunes .. . represented the entire scope of the Led Zeppelin heritage.\" As the years go on, defenders of Zeppelin have had to distinguish the true richness of classic rock, the genre, from its caricature in classic rock, the sales pitch.\nmeyw | Ironically, the initial attraction of classic rock was that most of its tunes had rarely been heard on the conventional AM stations and might thus be thought of as heavier or cooler than the happy pop hits of the nineteen seventies or nineteen eighties. Likewise, the advent of music video in the nineteen eighties came as a garish contrast to the substance of rock 'n' roll's greatest decades of creativity and artistic freedom, as noted by Brad Tolinski in Guitar World in nineteen ninety-three: \"Thanks to constant exposure on MTV, today's pop heroes somehow seem smaller,\n2e62 | more disposable than their predecessors. But pre-MTV bands like Queen, the original Kiss, and Led Zep have retained a powerful mystique. Unlike today's overexposed supergroups, those Classic bands were rarely captured on film, and when they were, they left distant, grainy images which have themselves taken on an almost mythic power.\" But by twenty ten even the best-loved tracks by Queen, the original Kiss, and Led Zep had been almost exhausted by continuous airplay on classic rock radio, especially under an enforced regimen that has shrunk their catalogues (and those of other classic rock stalwarts like Pink Floyd, Lynyrd Skynyrd, and Steve Miller) to but a fraction of their depth.\n75y3 | Disc jockey Jon Shap of WKOT in Illinois, a Zeppelin lover who asserts that \"Led Zeppelin will always have a place on classic rock radio,\" nonetheless harbors reservations over they way the band are covered on his own and other stations. \"Without a doubt, 'Stairway' and 'Whole Lotta Love' are on their own overplay level. . . . Air Talent (DJs) really have no freedom [as to] what goes on the air. Everything is picked ahead of time by the programming department and then scheduled by a computer. Some programmers base their playlists on research done with target listeners, or test songs on how quickly listeners recognize them. Other programmers are told what to play by consultants, and check with their consultants for everything! It's nuts!\" One on-air personality confesses anonymously that he breaks ranks by playing the Led Zeppelin drum solo \"Moby Dick\" every year on the anniversary of John Bonham's death. Many classic rock outlets now cater to a middle-aged male audience, with DJs telling dirty jokes and cueing up advertisements for power tools and military recruiters between spinning forty-year-old anthems of personal and social liberation. If you want to hear a Led Zeppelin song on the radio, tune to classic rock -- if you want to really hear Led Zeppelin, turn to your own collection.\ns2g2 | Takin' Home My Hard-Earned Pay: Led Zeppelin as Corporate Rock\nq1q2 | Like pornography, corporate rock is something hard to define-but you know it when you hear it. The phrase cropped up orally and in print around the time of the punk rebellion of nineteen seventy-six to seventy-nine, although by the late nineteen sixties some acts, including Led Zeppelin, had their countercultural bona fides questioned by the most politically vociferous segments of the youth movement. The disco craze of the late nineteen seventies, driven by anonymous dancers, DJs, and club hits like Sister Sledge's \"We Are Family\" and the Commodores' \"Brick House,\" likewise made four- or five-man collections of millionaire hippies look much less populist than they thought themselves to be.\ncb7r | But in the Long Run\n68xu | Corporate rock refers to the music made by artists so commercial, so conspicuously rich, or with such confident label promotion, that its spontaneity, humanity, and air of social menace have been all but suppressed. Some critics have written off nearly every pre-punk pop record of the decade as corporate rock, as the New York Times's Howard Hampton did in twenty zero one:\nhd35 | Something happened to rock music in the nineteen seventies that it has never quite recovered from: the sound congealed into a dense, ponderous and soporific mass. . . . Where playfulness, humor, chaotic weirdness and wayward passion had reigned supreme, now even excess and outrage came to seem stage-managed by an invisible bureaucracy of FM station consultants, management firms, technocrat producers, and record company apparatchiks. . .. FM rock's infamous disco-bashing campaign was an understandably panicked, phobic reaction, given how insular rock culture had become by that point.\n2zpk | The first of corporate rock's prime suspects might include the flamboyant Elton John, the gaudy Queen, the faceless Doobie Brothers, the imitative Blue Oyster Cult, or the arena demagogue Ted Nugent. Others might cite the proliferation of extravagant artist-owned record companies (the Beatles' Apple, the Rolling Stones' Rolling Stones, and Zeppelin's Swan Song) or the prominence of oversold live albums like Peter Frampton's Frampton Comes Alive, Kiss's Alive! and Cheap Trick's At Budokan as crucial indicators of corporate rock's arrival.\nepu7 | Along with their manager Peter Grant, the men of Led Zeppelin earned a lot of money for themselves (so much that they could only keep it by going into tax exile); they were treated like royalty by industry personnel; and their records and promo paraphernalia turned a neat profit for their financial backers, so by that definition the band was certainly corporate rock. Of course, no performers would ever identify themselves as such, and the term corporate rock is purely a derogatory one that can be thrown at anybody deemed too popular or successful for the thrower's liking. Such an epithet also disregards the very real struggle and hard work that a group like Led Zeppelin underwent before getting to their vast stadium shows and decadent private jets of later in their career. A more judicious application of the label would be to the ready-made superstars whose airplay and revenue piled up a little too fast and more easily than their music warranted: Toto, R E O Speedwagon, Night Ranger, Foreigner, Meat Loaf. The whiff of corporate rock was also strong off of works heavily produced, cowritten, or otherwise doctored by employees or supervisors of the named artist: Bryan Adams, Bon Jovi, Carly Simon, latter-day Aerosmith, and the antiseptic Starship, whose eighties hit \"We Built This City\" must surely be liable in some\n7od1 | kind of corporate rock class-action suit. Next to these, Led Zeppelin were no more than a mom 'n' pop operation dispensing handcrafted merchandise at honest prices.",
