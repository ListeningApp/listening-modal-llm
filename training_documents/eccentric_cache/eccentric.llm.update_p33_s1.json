        "content": "xb13 | The effects of frame geometry on the seismic behavior and weight of chevron EBFs were investigated in twenty zero eight by Özhendekci and Özhendekci. It was concluded that EBFs with shear links performed better than those with intermediate and moment links. Furthermore, the use of longer shear links and shorter intermediate links was found to be advantageous in terms of seismic performance. However, it was demonstrated that for shear links, the frame weight would also increase along with the link length.\ncxqi | A novel performance-based plastic design methodology for EBFs was proposed by Chao and Goel in twenty zero five. The method, which uses an energy-balance criterion and provides a design base shear for a given hazard level, global yield pattern, and target drift, is a direct method in the sense that it does not require any assessment after the initial design. A procedure for the height-wise distribution of this lateral force was also proposed based on the results of extensive nonlinear dynamic analyses. The results revealed that the EBFs designed using the new approach can satisfy expected performance objectives and perform better than those designed using conventional methods, without any notable increase in material usage. It is worth noting that an application of a performance-based approach for the design of a ninety-seven point six meter tall EBF system located in the United States was reported by Sabol and Nishi in twenty eleven.\nqfmx | In twenty thirteen, Sullivan developed a direct displacement-based design method for EBFs with the aim of overcoming the deficiencies generally attributed to the force-based design approach. The method replaces a multi-degree-of-freedom system with an equivalent single-degree-of-freedom structure. A flow chart of this iterative design process as well as a design example were also provided. Sullivan and O'Reilly and Sullivan demonstrated the effectiveness of the method through time-history analyses of EBFs designed using DDBD. The studied EBFs exhibited lower-than-expected ductilities, and thus it was noted that the codified response modification factors are generally unconservative. Furthermore, using a unique R factor and a single displacement amplification factor factor for all EBFs was found to be inappropriate since the ductility would tend to reduce as the EBF height increases. The use of longer shear links was recommended by Sullivan similar to Özhendekci and Özhendekci.\nrut3 | The effect of height-wise distribution of the demand-to-capacity ratio of links was studied by Rossi and Lombardo in twenty zero seven using IDA. Partial collapse mechanisms, especially in the upper stories, were observed in all of the cases which had scattered height-wise link demand-to-capacity ratios. Furthermore, the R factors for mid- and high-rise EBFs as well as EBFs with long links were found to be considerably lower than those proposed by different building codes. A subsequent study was undertaken by Bosco and Rossi in twenty zero nine. The results of extensive nonlinear incremental dynamic analyses revealed that the traditional method of designing EBFs considering capacity design principles as well as providing uniform demand-to-capacity ratios for links would not necessarily ensure proper distribution of link inelastic action through the height, especially for mid- and high-rise EBFs. To have a better prediction of the seismic performance of EBFs, a new parameter, called the damage distribution capacity factor, was introduced by Bosco and Rossi. It was demonstrated that, considering both of the demand-to-capacity ratio and the damage distribution capacity factor, it is possible to accurately predict the collapse mechanism of an EBF system.\nm3cp | In twenty thirteen, Bosco and Rossi proposed a design procedure for dual EBFs to overcome the deficiencies observed in their previous studies regarding regular EBFs. In this approach, EBF links are the main energy dissipating mechanisms while MRFs provide lateral stiffness during inelastic behavior. Nevertheless, to have a more cost-efficient design, limited yielding was also permitted in MRFs at beam ends, bottom ends of the first story columns, and top ends of upper story columns. In a companion numerical study by Bosco and Rossi it was demonstrated that dual EBF structures designed based on the proposed methodology perform better than those designed according to conventional methods. In addition, an expression for determining the R factor for dual EBFs was proposed which was dependent upon the link rotation capacity, ymax, and gave R factors ranging from four point zero for long links to seven point five for short links. A similar formula for the R factor of EBFs, ranging from three point five for long links to five point zero for short links, was suggested more recently by Bosco et al. Furthermore, the use of modal response spectrum analysis instead of equivalent lateral load methods for the design of mid- and high-rise EBFs was emphasized by Bosco et al. In a very recent study\nmq4s | by Bosco et al. the Eurocode eight EBF design procedure has been thoroughly reviewed and the important drawbacks and discrepancies are highlighted.\n95el | The seismic column demands of EBFs were studied by Richards in twenty zero nine. The demands from nonlinear dynamic analyses were compared to the amplified seismic axial force according to I B C twenty zero six or ASCE seven dash ten considering the amplification factor of two point zero. The numerical results revealed that designing EBF columns solely using the amplified seismic axial force can be quite unconservative for upper tier columns of tall EBFs while overly conservative for columns at the base of these structures. A similar conclusion was reported by Kuşyılmaz and Topkaya in twenty thirteen. An average value of three point two five was reported by these researchers for the structural overstrength factor which is well above the codified value of two point zero. The results reported by both studies may indicate some concern regarding the EBF column design; however, as noted by Kuşyılmaz and Topkaya, recalling that the capacity design principles should also be considered in the EBF column design it is anticipated that the use of two would not yield substantial underestimations in the EBF column design process.\na0a5 | The appropriateness of using the displacement amplification factor, Ca, equal to four point zero per ASCE seven dash ten, which is directly used for estimating the plastic link rotation angle, Yp, was studied by Richards and Thompson in twenty zero nine. Nonlinear dynamic analyses of a large set of EBFs revealed that a factor of four can underestimate Yp for links of low-rise EBFs while overestimating the plastic rotations of links in mid- and high-rise EBFs. Although calibrated Ca factors were proposed, the researchers pointed out that the study was inadequate to recommend factors for general design. To further investigate this design deficiency, a numerical study was undertaken by Kuşyılmaz and Topkaya in twenty fifteen and it was demonstrated that the Ca factor of four point zero may result in significantly unconservative estimates of Yp in low-, mid-, and high-rise EBFs. Results of the inelastic time-history analyses were used to develop a nonlinear relation which provides Ca values ranging from eight point zero in the lower stories to five point zero in the upper stories. In a subsequent study by Kuşyılmaz and Topkaya nonsimulated collapse analyses revealed that EBFs designed in accordance with the U.S. provisions, considering an R factor of eight point zero, have higher collapse probabilities than expected.",
