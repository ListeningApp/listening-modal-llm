You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).

Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021.

jkp9 | It is important to recognize two important assumptions that underlie the logic of this sort of research. First, as noted above, changing the task in small ways can alter the strategy that subjects use, in which case different structures and processes might be used, and hence different areas might be activated. Even a small shift in the location of an activated area could reflect differences in the precise process being used (see, for example, Wilson et al. 1993). Second, note that this logic assumes that the same piece of tissue implements the same structure or process when it is embedded in different combinations of other processes. It is possible that some neural tissue is not dedicated to implementing a single process, and that different neural regions can implement more than one process. If so, the precise locus of activation that reflects the use of a given structure or process can shift, depending on what other structures or processes are used at the same time (for a more detailed discussion of this point, see the epilogue of Kosslyn & Koenig (1995)). We shall return to this general issue shortly.
z8tt | (c) What operation is performed by a specific brain area?
9g22 | One also can attempt to characterize the process or processes implemented in a single area. It is clear that any task at all, even one as simple as staring at a fixation point (Petit et al. 1995), involves a neural circuit that draws on multiple brain areas. Moreover, given our uncertainty about the precise relationship between manipulating a variable in a task and changes in under- lying processing, it is difficult to design true 'minimal difference' pairs of tasks, so that only a single process is taxed more by the experimental task than the control task. Instead, the most sensible course for answering such questions has been plotted by Price & Friston (1997), in their 'conjunction analysis' investigations. In these studies they administer multiple tasks (but as few as two) and examine areas of common activation (i.e. that are activated strongly enough to generalize across tasks in a location). For example, they have used this approach to study the shared processing when one names pictures, letters and colours, and reads words. Although their work so far has revealed not individual areas, but sets of areas,
41fx | the same approach can in principle allow one to charac- terize in detail the function of individual areas.
7um8 | However, one problem with all such research rests on the logic of 'affirming the null hypothesis'. One implicitly is assuming that a large host of untested stimuli would have no effect. That is, if one shows that area X responds when the subject is engaged in process Y, this does not mean that area X would not also respond when the subject was engaged in the as-yet-untested process Z. Thus, one's interpretation of what the area does depends on the questions that one puts to it; given only certain stimuli in certain tasks, one can be misled (e.g. into believing that the area has a more specialized function than in fact it does). As far as I can see, there is no way around this problem other than continuing to refine one's theories and one's tests, eventually eliminating possibili- ties and narrowing down the range of viable interpreta- tions of the function of the area in question. The best of all worlds, it seems to me, is to have a theory that makes a very specific prediction and to consider the alternative theories in advance, ensuring that they do not also make the same prediction.
uow2 | (d) Which are the properties of structures that underlie a particular ability?
iat7 | For present purposes, I restrict the term 'structure' to refer to a buffer. A buffer is a physical medium that can retain representations. A representation, in the simplest terms, is a physical pattern that stands for something else. For a physical pattern to count as a representation, it must occur within a system of processes that operate on the pattern. For example, the 'meaning' of patterns of magnetic flux in a computer's random-access memory (RAM) is determined by the way in which the patterns are 'read' by the central processing unit and the impact that such processing has on the production and modifica- tion of yet other patterns of magnetic flux. In this case, the RAM serves as a buffer, which supports physical patterns that represent data. (Note that a program, in this sense, is just data: it is a specification of a sequence that the central processing unit should perform.)
ywwr | Neuroimaging can be used to ask questions about the nature of structures. For example, Fox et al. (1986) used PET to study the organization of Area 17 (primary visual cortex). In particular, they wanted to collect evidence that human Area 17 is topographically organized. In topographically organized areas, nearby points of space are represented by nearby neurons, and more distant points of space are represented by more distant neurons. (This is true within a given 'cortical magnification' factor; the scaling of input to cortex becomes more coarse towards the periphery, and this must be taken into account when interpreting the physical pattern.) Topogra- phically organized areas are 'picture-like,' but typically are not perfectly isomorphic maps; there are various distortions, such as greater tissue being devoted to the input from the high-resolution foveal parts of the eye. Fox et al. asked subjects to view alternating chessboards that just fell on the fovea, were larger but did not stimulate the fovea (these were doughnut-shaped patterns, with a hole in the middle), or were larger still and did not stimulate an even larger central area. They found that the larger the stimulus, the more anterior was the focus of activation
0i6j | in Area 17 (i.e. along the calcarine sulcus). This pattern of responses was just as expected if this area were retino- topically mapped, as it is in animals. However, unlike some animals (such as the macaque monkey, which has Area 17 on the lateral surface), in humans this area is medial and the cortex is folded in complex ways. Thus, the PET results were interesting because they revealed the expected functional correlates of what was known about the physical structure of the area (and what had been suggested by earlier studies of visual deficits after local damage to this area; reviewed by Kosslyn 1994).
