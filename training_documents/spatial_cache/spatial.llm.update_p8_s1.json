Consider K sub one, K sub two as constants invariant under random permutations. Then using summation shorthand we have\n320g | G of D equals K sub one sigma sum W sub i j X sub i X sub j and\ntp8g | I of D equals K sub two sigma sigma W sub i j left parenthesis X sub i minus X bar right parenthesis left parenthesis X sub j minus X bar right parenthesis. Equals parentheses K sub two divided by K sub one close parentheses G of D minus K sub two X bar sigma left parenthesis W sub i plus W sub i close parenthesis X sub i plus K sub two X bar squared W W sub i equals sum sub j W sub i j text and W dot i equals sum sub j W sub j i.\ngxfd | Since both G of D and I of D can measure the association among the same set of weighted points or areas represented by points, they may be compared. They will differ when the weighted sums sum W sub i X sub i, and sum W sub i X sub i, differ from W X tilde, that is, when the patterns of weights are unequal. The basic hypothesis is of a random pattern in each case. We may compare the performance of the two measures by using their equivalent Z values of the approximate normal distribution.\ns2v1 | EXAMPLE FOUR\njkp9 | Let us use the lattice of Example TWO. As before,\nz8tt | Set A plus B equals two m, therefore\n9g22 | X bar equals m. n equals fifty; A greater than or equal to zero B greater than or equal to zero put\n41fx | A equals m left parenthesis one plus c right parenthesis; B equals m left parenthesis one minus c right parenthesis; zero less than or equal to c less than or equal to one. In addition, put\n7um8 | a equals A minus m; B equals two m minus A equals m minus a; B minus m equals a; m greater than or equal to a j not equal to i. For the rook's case,\nuow2 | W equals sigma sigma W sub i j equals one seventy. I equals left parenthesis n sigma sigma sub i j left parenthesis X sub i minus X bar right parenthesis left parenthesis X sub j minus X bar right parenthesis divided by W sigma left parenthesis X sub i minus X bar right parenthesis squared right parenthesis equals left parenthesis fifty dot two four a squared dot two right parenthesis divided by left parenthesis one seventy dot eighteen a squared right parenthesis equals zero point seven eight four for all choices of a,\niat7 | m. Var left parenthesis I right parenthesis equals zero point zero one zero eight nine seven. Z left parenthesis I right parenthesis equals seven point seven zero eight eight whenever A greater than B. G equals left parenthesis sum sum W sub i j X sub i X sub j divided by sigma sigma X sub i X sub j right parenthesis equals left parenthesis twenty-four A squared plus twenty-four B squared plus twenty-four A m plus twenty-four B m plus seventy-four m squared right parenthesis divided by left parenthesis two five zero zero m squared minus nine A squared minus nine B squared minus thirty-two m squared right parenthesis. Equals left parenthesis one seventy plus forty-eight c squared right parenthesis divided by two four five zero minus eighteen c squared. When c equals zero, A equals B equals m, and G is a minimum.\nywwr | When c equals one, A equals two m, B equals zero, and G is a maximum.\n0i6j | G max equals two eighteen divided by two four three two equals zero point zero eight nine six. Var left parenthesis G max right parenthesis equals zero point zero zero zero zero one one eight five five. Z left parenthesis G max right parenthesis equals five point eight seven for any m.\n87cq | G depends on the relative absolute magnitudes of the sample values. Note that I is positive for any A and B, while G values approach a maximum when the ratio of A to B or B to A becomes large.\n0qs3 | EXAMPLE FIVE\nz8f7 | I equals zero, for any possible A, B, or m.",
