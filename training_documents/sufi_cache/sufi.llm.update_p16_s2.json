        "content": "h8p7 | It has been objected, of course, that the 'popularisation' of Sufi materials might alienate many people from the ancient traditions and values which it is held by some to represent. In actual fact, the reverse has been true. In one publication after another, even traditionalist and formal scholars, as well as many others - in East and West-have eagerly accepted the recent reclaiming of the meaning of the materials: and the number of people interested has enormously increased. To disdain these newcomers because they are not always professional orientalists or cultists (still too many people are both) is to fail to observe that many of them are at least as intelligent, well-informed and potentially useful in human research as the 'specialists'. One of the saddest things, in fact, about the reaction in some quarters against the revelation of fresh insights into the essential Sufism has been the displaying of almost primitive and quite stupefying bigotry and small-mindedness in circles where these characteristics are prejudicial to the honour of the learned calling and dangerous to the likelihood that such people will continue to be taken seriously by those whose respect means so much to them.\ngcbc | In brief, Sufism has 'arrived' in the minds of people in the more flexible and increasingly interesting areas of contemporary thought. It has also become a part of the experience and interest\nd9tz | of some of today's more distinguished people throughout the world. It is operating widely, in cross-disciplinary and general areas, as a factor whose value and contribution can neither be denied nor arrested. What has happened is that more people are prepared to study perennial truth apart from local manifestations and derivative sociological forms of mainly anthropological value.\ndusw | Traditionally, Sufi understanding has relied heavily upon question-and-answer. The following pages, extracted to give a cross-section of materials elicited during hundreds of hours of talks, relate to many of the subjects which interest such a very large number of people today. The hundred conversations also represent answers to questions which have been asked again and again in a postbag of more than forty thousand letters, from all over the world.\npk82 | In spite of the enormous demand for Sufi thought to be pre-\nblll | sented only in terms of familiar attitudes and local cultural expression, it would be unfair, both to the Sufis and those who might learn from them, to attempt putting this quart into a pint pot.\nocgf | Sufi thought and action requires its own formats in which to manifest and operate: it is for this reason that it has always, in the past and in its several areas of expression, established and maintained its own institutions and teaching centres. But the modern Western atmosphere, however much it may have neg-\ntybl | ated to develop such formats for itself, is nowadays much more than formerly prepared to accept the hypothesis that there might be a form of learning which is presented, concentrated and disseminated through characteristic and specialised institutions. It is only where we get people imagining that the outward form of such institutions, suited to one place or age, is both suitable for here and now, and also representative of the thing itself, that the onus is on us to point out the fact that such opinions are limited and limiting. They disable those who hold them from understanding in the same way that the yokel in the Sufi tale could not benefit from his bowl of liquid soup because 'all soup has lumps in it'.\n80zt | There was once a man who opened a restaurant, with a good kitchen, attractive tables and an excellent menu.\naxet | One of his friends came along soon afterwards, and said:\ndrxk | 'Why have you not got a sign, like all the other eating-places? I suggest that you put on it \"RESTAURANT: FINEST FOOD\".'\n08na | When the sign was painted and put up, another enquirer asked:\nvijt | 'You have to be more specific-you might mean any old restaurant. Add the words \"SERVED HERE\" and your sign will be complete.'\nj5ke | The owner thought that this was a good idea, and he had the signboard duly altered.\nxe0y | Not long afterwards someone else came along and said:\ngjl6 | 'Why do you put \"HERE\"? Surely anyone can see where the place is?'\n81i9 | So the restaurateur had the sign changed.\nkgrb | Presently a further curious member of the public wanted to know:\n6g0d | 'Do you not know that the word \"SERVED\" is redundant? All restaurants and shops serve. Why not take it out?'\nk9u1 | So that word was taken out.\nldrv | Now another visitor said:\nli40 | 'If you continue to use the phrase \"FINEST FOOD\", some people will be sure to wonder whether it really is the finest, and some will not agree. To guard against criticism and contention, please do remove the word \"Finest\".'\nirr1 | And so he did. Now, just the word \"FOOD\" was to be seen on the notice, and a sixth inquisitive individual put his head through the doorway. 'Why have you got the word \"FOOD\" on your restaurant: anyone can see that you serve food here.'\nsvwi | So the restaurateur took down the sign. As he did so, he could not help wondering when somebody who was hungry, rather than curious or intellectual, would come along ...\ncym3 | In this tale, of course, the restaurateur is plagued by the literal-mindedness of the 'people of reason'; for whom, as for all of us, intellect plays a valuable part. The food which our man is trying to provide, however, is the 'food of the heart'; where the heart stands in Sufi parlance for the higher perceptive faculties of humankind.\n7y4b | Our contemporary Sufi poet, Professor Khalilullah Khalili, my most illustrious compatriot, puts it like this:\n421l | In every state, the Heart is my support: In this kingdom of existence it is my sovereign. When I tire of the treachery of Reason - God knows I am grateful to my heart ...\nart6 | Nineteen seventy-eight\npsk5 | Persian Quatrains of Ustad Khalilullah Khalili, trilingual, Baghdad: Al-Maarif Press, nineteen seventy-five, twenty-two and twenty-three.\natv6 | Real and Imagined Study\n9ja4 | Sufis and their Imitators\nbl6w | THE SMALL BOY AND THE EXAMINATION\nrxoj | A: That reminds me of a joke. It is said that a small boy was faced with an examination question: 'What is rabies and what can you do about it?' He wrote as his answer: 'Rabies is Jewish priests, and there is nothing you can do about it!'\nb2rk | These Sufis are Sufists, not Sufis, and there is nothing that you can do about it. I am, however, interested in an inherent assumption : the one behind the question - that one should either have to do anything about it, or that one could, indeed, do anything about it ... If we do try to do anything about it, we risk attracting large numbers of disenchanted former Sufists, who would hope at first that we could give them THE REAL THING-but who would become doubly homeless, so to speak, when they found that one branch of the entertainment industry had closed down, and another failed to open up!\npros | Sufi studies in the West and in the contemporary East, it should be remembered, are repeating a pattern. Throughout the ages there have been Sufis and imitators. Perhaps, to clarify things in your own mind, you might like to ask yourself this question: \"Why do I imagine that there is any activity that does not have imitators, charlatans, confusion and \"tourists\" and passengers?' People do not find that they can do anything about tricksters. Not only do humorous tales contain valuable structures for understanding. Their use also helps to weed out people who lack a sense of humour. Sufis hold that people who have not developed or who have suppressed their capacity to enjoy humour are, in this deprived state, also without learning capacity in the Sufi sphere.\ntlrm | cranks who offer a trip to the Moon-except to increase public information on spaceflight.",
