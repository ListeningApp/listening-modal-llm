EQUILIBRIUM\nak21 | As mentioned above and recalled in Appendix A, the LPA flow equation eighty-eight exactly corresponds to the effective potential of the equilibrium Boltzmann distribution\ni7n1 | P of x equals N exp of negative two V of x over Upsilon.

One hundred twenty-eight.\nuwdf | are reproduced to sub-percent accuracy, indicating the accuracy of the numerical solution to the LPA flow equation, at least around the minimum of the effective potential.\njjgp | In addition to the static variance at equilibrium, the curvature of the effective potential around the minimum also determines the time dependence of correlations in equilibrium, quantified by the time dependent covariance or connected two-point function\ndf4g | Cov sub eq of x of t sub one x of t sub two equals Upsilon over two V sub comma v chi e to the power of negative lambda absolute value t sub one minus t sub two. One hundred twenty-nine.\nqc2j | Here, lambda corresponds to V sub comma chi chi within the IPA but the solution to the WFR flow equation ninety-six for zeta sub comma chi also contributes, providing a correction to lambda according to one hundred nineteen.\nx3oh | In Table. I we collect the values of lambda obtained using the fRG under LPA and WFR for different Upsilon values, and compare this directly to high accuracy numerical simulations of the Langevin equation four. We can clearly see from Table. I that the LPA can have good agreement with the simulation value for simple potentials at high temperature but can deviate drastically as temperature is lowered. Inclusion of the WFR factor zeta sub x reduces the deviation error from the value obtained in the simulations substantially to approximately one for the simplest cases and order of magnitude agreement for the most complicated, low temperature systems.\nfqvx | The decay of the equilibrium covariance is shown in Figs. six and seven for the polynomial and x squared plus six bumps/dips We can see - for the polynomial begin array potentials respectively. potential - in Fig. six left parenthesis a right parenthesis, Upsilon equals ten, that the LPA and WFR are both in good agreement with simulations and in Fig. six b, Upsilon equals eleven, that the WFR offers better agreement than the LPA. In Fig. seven a we can see that for Upsilon equals three the WFR prediction closely matches the simulations offering significant improvement over the LPA which closely matches the bare x squared potential. This indicates that even for highly non-trivial systems - where the computation of eigenvalues for these potentials is a non-trivial exercise - that\nviae | the simulated decay is vastly different from the bare x squared potential - see Table. I and compare to the x squared prediction for square root two which is one - the fRG can appropriately capture these effects.\np8u9 | It is also worth pointing out that the simulated decay rate does not follow a pure exponential at all times in all cases. This can be best seen in the top plot of Fig. six b where the decay is initially close to the LPA, then the WFR decay before moving towards the eigen decay rate at late times. This sort of behaviour has been identified\n49ky | in similar systems in the early universe where it was noticed that the smallest non-zero eigenvalue's spectral coefficient was sufficiently small that higher order eigen- values would dominate the decay at earlier times. As LPA matches the decay rate predicted by the Boltzmann distribution and WFR is closer to the decay predicted by E one. We discuss this further below.\np5wo | VII. RELAXATION TOWARDS EQUILIBRIUM\n74rp | In order to solve the equations of motion for the one point function x of t and two point function G of t,t' we must first solve the PDEs for the LPA and WFR to obtain the dynamical effective potential V and the function U. We will use the solutions obtained in Section V in order to compute these parameters and then solve the appropriate Effective Equation of Motion.\noolg | A. The dynamical effective potentials\n3ewf | In section IV we introduced the notion of the dynam- ical effective potential V given by equation one hundred nine which together with one hundred eight describes the evolution of the average position, x. As the fRG guarantees that the fully effective potential V will be convex this implies that the dynamical effective potential V will also be either fully or extremely close to fully convex for LPA and WFR respectively thus greatly simplifying dynamical calculations. In the previous section we emphasised how the fRG LPA effective potential gives us the Boltzmann equilibrium quantities such as equilibrium position and vari-\n5iea | ance. What we would like to emphasise now however is that away from the minimum of the effective potential the fRG gives us information that the near equilibrium Boltzmann assumption does not. To be concrete, an approximate Gaussian Boltzmann distribution would assume that the potential is of the form:\n62l5 | V Boltz of x equals four dot Var eq Upsilon of x minus X eq squared. One hundred thirty.\nshub | where X eq and Var eq are the equilibrium position and variance respectively. We show in Fig. eight how this approximation can break down dramatically as one moves away from the equilibrium position suggesting that the fRG captures the far away from equilibrium dynamics well. In principle one could attempt to include higher order cumulants of the Boltzmann distribution such as skewness and kurtosis into an approximate effective potential, however the relationship between these cumulants and higher derivatives of the effective potential is non- trivial and cumbersome to include. In any case it is not expected including these corrections would lead to significant improvement away from equilibrium.\nzjn5 | B. Accelerated trajectories",
