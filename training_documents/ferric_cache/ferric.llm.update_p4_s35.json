        "content": "b780 | Two (Figure S sixteen). The addition of catalase or superoxide dismutase did not significantly affect the accumulation of product in single-turnover experiments, ruling out that product was formed via a H two O two shunt pathway or from the reaction of released superoxide to the ferrous enzyme (Figure four B). Quantitation of the product revealed a highly efficient process, resulting in zero point six eight plus or minus zero point one two molar equivalents of two per enzyme, while zero point one plus or minus zero point zero two equivalents of H two O per enzyme was also produced (Figure four B), accounting for nearly all approximately ninety percentage of the O two and redox equivalents provided during the experiment. We were unable to observe any product in single-turnover experiments when three was used as the substrate, and H two O two quantitation indicated significantly more H two O two was generated, consistent with the autooxidation behavior shown in stopped-flow experiments (Figure S seventeen).\nccmb | Evidence for HAT by a CYP Ferric Superoxide. To further probe the nature of the Asp B-oxy reaction with the native substrate, we compared the rate of decay of the intermediate under single turnover conditions in stopped-flow experiments in H two O and D two O. As both the DKP and indole N-H protons are exchangeable in solvent, we preincubated the E:S complex in deuterated buffer to achieve deuteration at both sites. We observed a normal solvent kinetic isotope effect K H over K D of two point six plus or minus zero point three (Figure five A, Table S six), in stark contrast to\nma93 | the inverse KSIE observed when using surrogate redox partners. This implies a change in the rate-limiting step under single turnover conditions and strongly implicates the Asp B-oxy species for affecting the N-H(D) cleavage. For comparison, we performed the same experiments with three to determine if a KSIE is observed in autoxidation, since it has been suggested that hydrogen bonding may also play a role in the stability of the oxy complex. However, only minor KSIEs for both phases for autoxidation were observed (K H over K p equals one point three plus or minus zero point two and one point four plus or minus zero point two for the first and second decay phases, respectively) (Table S seven). N-H abstraction by Asp B-oxy would provide a proton and electron to form the ferric hydroperoxo complex. Due to the highly transient nature of this intermediate, which has only been observed in CYPs at cryogenic temperatures using cryoradiolysis and calibrated thermal annealing, we were unsurprisingly unable to observe this species in stopped-flow experiments. However, to examine the\nc6hh | role of the subsequent steps involved in downstream dimerization, we replaced the conserved threonine residue at position two hundred forty-four with an alanine, which has been rigorously examined in CYPs to be crucial for maintaining correct protonation of the distal oxygen for efficient O-O bond scission to form CYP-I (Figure five B). CYPs that use a ferric peroxo-anion remain functional when the analogous mutation is made. Compared to wild-type Asp B, the rate of product formation under multiple turnover conditions is thirty-fold slower in T two hundred forty-four alanine (Figure five C). Consistent with its role in proton-mediated heterolysis, the T two hundred forty-four alanine mutant displays less than three percent coupling of NADPH to the product as compared to sixty-two percent in wild-type (Figure five D). Furthermore, we were unable to observe any appreciable product formation in single-turnover assays with T two hundred forty-four alanine Asp B. This suggests a mechanism by which the conserved threonine in CYP-dimerases retains its canonical role for CYP-I formation and is critical in dimerization steps that occur after initial oxidation.\ny7ea | Generalization of a Superoxide-Mechanism to Other CYP DKP Dimerases. Utilizing the enzyme function initiative suite of tools, we compared the I-helix sequences of forty-eight CDPS-associated CYPs (Figure S eighteen). The alcohol residue is highly conserved in these putative CYP-dimerases (typically a serine), while the acid is replaced with aliphatic residues (typically valine or isoleucine). This suggests that ferric superoxide reactivity may not be limited to just Asp B. To test whether the potential commonality of this mechanism to other types of DKP linkages, we evaluated the metabolic profile of Nze B, which shares approximately ninety-eight percent sequence identity to Asp B. Using the surrogate redox system, Nze B was found to convert CWP to a mixture of C-C and C-N-linked dimers as previously reported (Figure six A). To investigate whether C-C bond formation also\nnav4 | proceeds via a ferric superoxide complex, we repeated single turnover experiments with Nze B. Provision of one reducing equivalent and O two was sufficient to generate the same ensemble of products as those formed under multiple turnover conditions with surrogate redox partners (Figure six B, Figure S nineteen).\ngem8 | DISCUSSION\ne8nr | Steady-state analysis of product formation by Asp B has revealed a significant inverse kinetic solvent isotope effect, implicating the use of an intermediate prior to CYP-I for the initiation of substrate dimerization. The competent formation of aspergilazine A under conditions when a second electron is omitted suggests that only a single reducing equivalent from a\nk78w | redox partner is needed for catalysis to occur. Further support for the reactive nature of a ferric superoxide complex is provided through examination of the single-turnover KSIE of oxy-Asp B decay, which reverts to a normal (i.e., K H over K p greater than one) value due to the suppression of available proton-linked uncoupling pathways.",
