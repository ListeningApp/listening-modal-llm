        "content": "ojro | We identified one thousand two hundred thirty-four different sources that published papers on SES. The top twenty journals each published between zero point six three percent and seven point seven three percent of all publications, accounting for twenty-eight point zero five percent of publications in total. There were significant differences in the median number of publications between the five most prominent journals, with Ecology and Society having significantly more publications compared to Ambio, Ecological Economics, Global Environmental Change, Journal of Environmental Management. There were no significant differences between other journals. Ambio and Global Environmental Change published proportionally more papers in the SES field prior to two thousand, while Ecology and Society has become increasingly dominant as the main journal publishing SES research since two thousand.\nl6t9 | Types and scale of SES research\n1ujy | There was a significant difference in the type of SES papers. Of the five thousand ninety-eight papers in our final database, seventy-one explicitly proposed frameworks without applying these frameworks to real-world\nqzor | comprised other theoretical discussions. A further seven hundred three papers to place-based research, three thousand seven hundred ninety-two focused on place-based research, and five hundred thirty-two were reviews. Our results show that SES research has been more focused on the local scale (forty-five percent of all publications) compared to the regional (twenty-eight percent), national (eleven percent), multinational (eight percent), and global (six percent) scales.\na0by | Hotspots of SES researchers and research\nu1ky | As measured by raw number of publications, European, North American, and Australasian institutions have contributed most significantly to SES research, with the United States,\nhtm9 | Canada, Sweden, Australia, the Netherlands, Germany, the United Kingdom, and South Africa emerging as countries with particularly high number of institutions that study SES. When normalizing institutional paper count by the number of higher education institutions in the country, Kenya, Denmark, and New Zealand were also included as hotspot countries. The lead authors of institutions publishing SES research were most frequently associated with Stockholm University (one hundred ninety-nine studies), Arizona State University (one hundred seventy-nine studies), Wageningen University (ninety-seven studies), James Cook University (seventy-nine studies), and the University of Queensland (seventy-one studies).\n8hul | Whereas institutions conducting SES research were clustered in the Global North, the SES being investigated were distributed more broadly across the globe. Studied SES were most frequently reported to be located in the United States (four hundred twenty-two), China (two hundred twenty-six), Australia (one hundred sixty-nine), India (one hundred sixty-seven), Canada (one hundred forty-two), Brazil (one hundred thirty-four), and Mexico (one hundred). A one-way ANOVA revealed significant differences between regions, but a post-hoc Tukey test revealed that significant differences were mostly between island regions and mainland areas, and that most mainland areas were not significantly different from each other, on average. Even when accounting for size, the Caribbean Islands were understudied compared to most regions. It had a significantly lower normalized frequency than Asia, Middle East, North and Central America, South America, Southern Africa, West Africa, and West and Central Europe. Oceania, which was significantly underrepresented compared to both Asia and North and Central",
