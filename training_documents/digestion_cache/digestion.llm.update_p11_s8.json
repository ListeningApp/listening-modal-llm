        "content": "29a3 | In mammals and birds, prolonged fasting induces a mobilization of fat stores whilst minimizing protein loss. Fish, such as the Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) respond to starvation by mobilizing hepatic lipids first, then muscle and hepatic glycogen and finally muscle protein. Long-term flying insects utilize lipids as their main energy source while other insect species can use carbohydrates or proline. In crustaceans, it is thought that protein contributes significantly to energy reserves a conclusion that is consistent with some reports showing a limited capacity of marine crustaceans to store lipids and carbohydrates.\nsb1e | The hepatopancreas is the main storage organ in crustaceans, mainly accumulating lipids and to a lesser extent, glycogen. It has been proposed that in crustaceans, neutral lipids (mainly triglycerides) are preferentially catabolized during starvation, while polar lipids (phospholipids and cholesterol) are conserved due to their role as structural components of cell membranes. A large reduction in total lipids in response to starvation has been reported in larvae, sub-adult and adult lobsters.\nw2yn | Glycogen is the most widely distributed animal polysaccharide and can be readily converted to glucose which, being soluble, can then be transported via the blood. Crustaceans utilize glycogen as an energy store but the proportion of all energy reserves depends upon the nutritional history of the individual. For example, in the estuarine grapsid crab Chasmagnathus granulata, twenty-one days of starvation reduced glycogen reserves by fifty-one percent in animals previously fed a high protein diet and by sixty-four percent in animals fed a high carbohydrate diet. The difference between the utilization of reserves becomes more significant when one considers the initial glycogen concentrations in the hepatopancreas organs: one point seventy-one percent in high protein-fed individuals and two point eighty-two percent in high carbohydrate-fed individuals. In these experiments, haemolymph glucose was principally\nap6l | maintained by effective gluconeogenesis from protein reserves in animals previously fed a high protein diet and from glycogen reserves in animals previously fed a high carbohydrate diet.\niest | MOLLUSCS\ncox8 | Most bivalve molluscs are microphagous (feed on small particles) and feed on particles that are deposited on the substrate (deposit feeders) or in suspension (suspension feeders). Most of the species that are commercially exploited belong to this latter category and use their gills to filter particulate organic matter, usually phytoplankton, from the water.\nppqi | Suspension feeding requires that organic, digestible, materials are trapped, sorted from indigestible mineral particles and passed to the mouth. Bivalves achieve this by means of capture mechanisms of the gills and sorting mechanisms of the gills, labial palps and stomach. Intertidal animals possess a feeding rhythm linked to tides.\noxou | Dissolved organic substances (monosaccharides, amino acids) or lipid droplets may be absorbed directly by the epithelium of larvae or adults. Many studies have demonstrated the existence of active transfer in the mantle and the gills, while certain carbohydrates present in sea water stimulate the rate of pumping and particle retention. It was found that Mytilus edulis removed dissolved amino acids and glucose, most of which were absorbed onto the gills before transfer to the mantle and digestive gland. Pasteels has suggested that the mucus secreted onto the gills of Mytilus edulis has a digestive as well as a mechanical function. The absorptive mechanism is chemically selective, but small particles are removed non-selectively by pinocytosis.\n495n | Dissolved organic matter plays an important role in nutrition, possibly as a growth factor, particularly in littoral or estuarine zones. Researchers have established a correlation between the production of flesh in cupped oysters in the Marennes Ol√©ron basin and the concentrations of dissolved organic matter, expressed as carbon or nitrogen.\nawri | One. Feeding\nbl28 | One point one The role of the gills in feeding\nd5bz | The lateral cilia of the gills draw a water current into the mantle cavity.\nap5o | A typical bivalve filters thirty to sixty times its own volume of water in an hour. Water must pass between the gill filaments in order to reach the exhalant chamber.\n7zvf | One point one one Food capture\nmov9 | As the water passes between the filaments (propelled by lateral cilia), food particles are held back by straining cirri (fused large cilia) and are carried forward to the ventral particle groove of the gill towards the mouth by other cilia in mucous strings.\nks7m | Suspension feeding bivalves are capable of capturing suspended particles over a wide range of sizes, typically between zero point one and one hundred two micrometers.\nw1w1 | In lamellibranchs, the frontal surface with its cilia is important in the capture of food. For this reason, the frontal surface is large relative to that of other molluscs and, and the filaments are slender. The combined frontal surface of the filaments forms large sheets known as lamellae (this is why bivalves are also known as lamellibranchs). The gill filaments are attached to the central axis, which is itself attached to the mantle.\nh8gv | Each gill filament drops ventrally (the descending limb) from the central axis and then climbs dorsally (the ascending limb). The ascending lamellae attach either to the mantle skirt (lateral filaments) or the visceral mass (medial filaments).\nkwkp | Water (blue arrows) is propelled between the filaments by the beating lateral cilia.\nyj0m | Food particles are shifted to the frontal cilia (red arrows) which transport them to the labial palps.
