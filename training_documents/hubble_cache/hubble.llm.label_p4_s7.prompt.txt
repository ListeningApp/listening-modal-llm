You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

06yq | Microdosing with psychedelics to self-medicate for ADHD symptoms in adults: A naturalistic study

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

(2011) on the basis of 7 year data from WMAP and astrophysical data from other sources.

A similar conclusion on power-law cosmologies was drawn by Kaplinghat et al. (1999).

However, these models encounter degeneracy on the geometric parameters <LATEX>H</LATEX> (involving first time derivative of scale factor) and <LATEX>q</LATEX> (involving second time derivative of scale factor) at the present epoch (Malekjani &
fj24 | Khadom-Mohamaddi 2012). Thus the geometric parameters <LATEX>H</LATEX> and <LATEX>q</LATEX> are not capable of discriminating between different dark energy models and a viable diagnostic tool is required for this purpose. Sahni et al. (2003) proposed a pair of pa- rameters <LATEX>r , s</LATEX> called statefinders as a means of distinguish-

In both panels, the vertical dashed line separates the acceleration and deceleration zones. The arrows show the direction of the evolution of trajectories as <LATEX>q</LATEX> varies from 0.5 to -1.

s6su | The remarkable feature of statefinders is that these pa- rameters depend on scale factor and its time derivatives, and hence are geometric in nature (Sahni 2002). Further, different dark energy models exhibit different evolutionary trajectories in the <LATEX>s \quad - r</LATEX> plane. Moreover, the well known flat ACDM model corresponds to the point <LATEX>s = 0</LATEX> and <LATEX>r = 1</LATEX> <LATEX>i n \quad t h e \quad s \quad - \quad r \quad p l a n e</LATEX> (Alam et al. 2003). These features of statefinders provide an opportunity to distinguish between different dark energy models. The statefinder diagnostic tool has been extensively used in the literature as a means to dis- tinguish between different dark energy models (see Alam et al. 2003; Ali et al. 2010; Malekjani & Khadom-Mohamaddi 2012 and references therein). In what follows, we test the power-law cosmology by statefinder diagnostic tool.
y219 | In power-law cosmology, the statefinders read as <LATEX>r = 2 q ^ { 2 } + q</LATEX> and

The black dot in the left panel (a) at <LATEX>\left( s , r \right) = \left( 0 , 1 \right)</LATEX> represents the location of flat ACDM model while the the black dot in the right panel (b) shows the location of the de Sitter (dS) point <LATEX>\left( q , r \right) = \left( - 1 , 1 \right) .</LATEX> The star symbol in both panels corresponds to the best fit model based on <LATEX>H</LATEX> (z)+SNe Ia. It is interesting to note that the ACDM statefinder pair <LATEX>\left( 0 , 1 \right) o r \quad e q u i v a l e n t l y</LATEX> the dS point <LATEX>\left( - 1 , 1 \right)</LATEX> is an attractor in power-law
