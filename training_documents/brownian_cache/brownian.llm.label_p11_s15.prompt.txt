You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

8l69 | where the final equality comes by assuming that source terms have been set to zero (i.e <LATEX>\left. J \left( t \right) = 0 \right) .</LATEX> The WFR version of (105) reads:
1jyv | <LATEX>\left( \zeta _ { , \chi } \dot { \chi } \right) \cdot - \frac { \partial _ { \chi } V _ { k = 0 } } { \zeta _ { , \chi } ^ { 2 } } \left( \partial _ { \chi \chi } ^ { 2 } V _ { k = 0 } - \frac { \zeta , \chi \chi } { \zeta _ { , \chi } } \partial _ { \chi } V _ { k = 0 } \right) = 0</LATEX> (107)
olce | where <LATEX>\partial _ { x } \zeta</LATEX> and <LATEX>\partial _ { \chi } ^ { 2 } \zeta</LATEX> are also evaluated at <LATEX>k = 0 .</LATEX> Both of these second order differential equations can actually be reduced to a first order differential equation like so:
erx1 | <LATEX>\dot { \chi } = - \widetilde { V } _ { , \chi } \left( \chi \right)</LATEX> (108)
b3bt | 11
0w8m | where we have introduced the effective dynamical poten- tial <LATEX>\widetilde { V }</LATEX> defined by
vcu3 | <LATEX>\widetilde { V } _ { , \chi } \left( \chi \right) \equiv \left\{ \begin{array}{} V _ { , \chi } \left( k = 0 , \chi \right) , & \text { for LPA } \\ \frac { V _ { , \chi } \left( k = 0 , \chi \right) } { \zeta _ { , \chi } ^ { 2 } \left( k = 0 , \chi \right) } , & \text { for WFR } \end{array} \right. ,</LATEX> (109)
hjzj | Here we can clearly see that for LPA the effective and ef- fective dynamical potentials are equivalent whereas WFR provides an additional factor for the latter.
j79f | Equation (108) tells us that the equation of motion for the average position <LATEX>\chi</LATEX> is an extremely simple first order differential equation that appears like a Langevin equation with no noise. This means that once you have obtained the effective dynamical potential you can com- pute the evolution of the average position <LATEX>\chi</LATEX> trivially from any starting position.
6tbv | At equilibrium the average position of the particle should not change, this means that <LATEX>\dot { \chi } = 0 .</LATEX> It naturally follows from this condition and the EEOM <LATEX>f o r \quad x \left( 1 0 8 \right)</LATEX> that equilibrium is defined for both LPA & WFR by the condition
xb13 | <LATEX>\partial _ { \chi } V _ { k = 0 } \left( \chi _ { e q } \right) = 0</LATEX> (110)
cxqi | As the potential <LATEX>V _ { k = 0 } \left( \chi \right)</LATEX> should be convex (by definition <LATEX>\left( \overrightarrow { \mathrm { o f } } \Gamma \right)</LATEX> equation (127) tells us that <LATEX>\chi _ { e q }</LATEX> corresponds to the minimum of <LATEX>V _ { k = 0 } \left( \chi \right) .</LATEX> Or more concretely:
qfmx | <LATEX>\lim _ { t \rightarrow \infty } \langle x \left( t \right) \rangle = x \text { that minimises } V _ { k = 0 } \left( x \right)</LATEX> (111)
rut3 | The equilibrium position is obviously the same for both LPA and WFR as they both lead to the same effective po- tential. As the equilibrium position is straightforwardly computed from the Boltzmann distribution verifying that the minimum of the effective potential matches the pre- dicted equilibrium position is a good first test for the numerical solution of <LATEX>V _ { k = 0 } \left( x \right) ,</LATEX> at least close to its mini- mum.

sb1e | As the equilibrium variance is also easily computed from the Boltzmann distribution, equation (121) gives us a second test to verify that the effective potential has been computed correctly, at least around the minimum.
w2yn | In the LPA approximation the variance and the de- cay rate of the autocorrelation function are both directly given by the curvature of the effective potential at its minimum. The inclusion of WFR however alters the de- cay rate without changing the equilibrium variance. This is as it should be since the latter is fixed by the equi- librium Boltzmann distribution. As we will see, WFR improves the decay rate which is indeed not exactly de- termined by the effective potential's curvature alone.
