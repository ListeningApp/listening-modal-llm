Accumulating evidence also suggests that creatine supplementation produces a variety of beneficial effects in older and patient populations. Furthermore, evidence-based research shows that creatine supplementation is relatively well tolerated, especially at recommended dosages. Although there are over five hundred peer-refereed publications involving creatine supplementation, it is somewhat surprising that questions regarding the efficacy and safety of creatine still remain. These include, but are not limited to: One. Does creatine lead to water retention? Two. Is creatine an anabolic steroid? Three. Does creatine cause kidney damage or renal dysfunction? Four. Does creatine cause hair loss or baldness? Five. Does creatine lead to dehydration and muscle cramping? Six. Is creatine harmful for children and adolescents? Seven. Does creatine increase fat mass? Eight. Is a creatine 'loading-phase' required? Nine. Is creatine beneficial for older adults? Ten. Is creatine only useful for resistance or power type activities? Eleven. Is creatine only effective for males? Twelve. Are other forms of creatine similar or superior to monohydrate, and is creatine stable in solutions or beverages? To answer these questions, an internationally renowned team of research experts was formed to perform an evidence-based scientific evaluation of the literature regarding creatine supplementation.\na0a5 | Introduction\ngocl | Creatine is endogenously formed from reactions involving the amino acids arginine, glycine and methionine in the kidneys and liver. Exogenously, creatine is primarily consumed from meat and or as a dietary supplement. According to PubMed there are over five hundred peer-refereed publications involving various aspects of creatine.\nob1z | supplementation. Based on the enormous popularity of creatine supplementation, the International Society of Sports Nutrition published an updated position stand in twenty seventeen on the safety and efficacy of creatine supplementation in exercise, sport, and medicine. This comprehensive paper provided an evidence-based review of the literature examining the effects of creatine supplementation on performance, recovery, injury prevention, exercise tolerance and rehabilitation, neuroprotection, aging, clinical and disease state populations, and pregnancy. Importantly, the safety profile of creatine was also reviewed. As of September first, twenty twenty, the paper has been viewed one hundred seventy-nine thousand times and cited one hundred times.\nm4cb | that the paper has been mentioned in nineteen news outlets, four blogs, four hundred ninety-two tweets, fifty-four Facebook pages, and been uploaded sixty-nine times in video posts. Instagram stories and posts are not included as Altmetric data.\nm61y | Despite the widespread outreach of the twenty seventeen International Society of Sports Nutrition position stand paper, along with other evidence-based review or meta-analysis papers involving various aspects of creatine supplementation published after the twenty fifteen Creatine in Health, Sport and Medicine Conference in Germany, questions and misconceptions involving creatine supplementation still remain. These include, but are not limited to: One. Does creatine supplementation lead to water retention? Two. Is creatine is an anabolic steroid? Three. Does creatine supplementation cause kidney damage or renal dysfunction? Four. Does creatine supplementation cause hair loss or baldness? Five. Does creatine supplementation lead to dehydration and muscle cramping? Six. Is creatine supplementation harmful for children and adolescents? Seven. Does creatine supplementation increase body fat? Eight. Is a creatine supplementation 'loading-phase' required? Nine. Is creatine supplementation beneficial for older adults? Ten. Is creatine supplementation only useful for resistance or power type activities? Eleven. Is creatine supplementation only effective for males? Twelve. Are other forms of creatine similar or superior to monohydrate? Is creatine stable in solutions or beverages? To address these questions, an internationally renowned team of research experts, who have collectively published over two hundred peer-refereed articles involving creatine supplementation, was formed to perform an evidence-based scientific evaluation of the literature. Each question was answered by one researcher, chosen according to her or his expertise on the topic. Then, the final version of this manuscript was reviewed and approved by all authors, therefore reflecting the group opinion.\nu2ob | Does creatine lead to water retention?\n2gnm | The purported myth of creatine supplementation increasing total body water is likely due to early research which showed that creatine supplementation at twenty grams per day for six days was associated with water retention. It does appear that the most common adverse effect of creatine supplementation is water retention in the early stages, first several days. For example, studies have shown that three days of creatine supplementation increased total body water and extracellular body water and intracellular water. Unfortunately, based on these short-term responses, this notion that creatine increases water retention over the long-term has been widely accepted.\nemgw | Creatine is an osmotically active substance. Thus, an increase in the body's creatine content could theoretically result in increased water retention. Creatine is taken up into muscle from circulation by a sodium-dependent\nxaqt | creatine transporter. Since the transport involves sodium, water will also be taken up into muscle to help maintain intracellular osmolality. However, considering the activity of the sodium-potassium pumps, it is not likely that intracellular sodium concentration is dramatically affected by creatine supplementation.\n```",
