That is, the people who have lost someone do not have less regard for themselves as a result of such a loss, or if they do, it tends to be for only a brief time. And if the survivors of the deceased experience guilt, it is usually guilt associated with some specific aspect of the loss rather than a general overall sense of culpability. Even though grief and depression share similar objective and subjective features, they do seem to be different conditions. Depression overlaps with bereavement but is not the same. Freud believed that in grief, the world looks poor and empty, while in depression, the person feels poor and empty. These differences in cognitive style have been identified by Beck and associates and other cognitive therapists who have suggested that the depressed have negative evaluations of themselves, the world, and the future. Although such negative evaluations can exist in the bereaved, they tend to be more transient.\nm50z | However, there are some bereaved individuals who do develop major depressive episodes following a loss. The recent Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, fifth edition, allows for this distinction. Zisook and colleagues, who were influential in the dropping of the previous two-month bereavement exclusion where depression could not be diagnosed in the bereaved until two months after the death, argue that, \"the preponderance of data suggests that bereavement-related depression is not different from major depressive episodes that present in any other context; it is equally genetically influenced, most likely to occur in individuals with past personal and family histories of major depressive episodes, has similar personality characteristics and patterns of comorbidity, is as likely to be chronic and or recurrent, and responds to antidepressant medications.\" If a major depressive episode develops during bereavement, this should be considered a type of complicated mourning-exaggerated grief.\nme84 | At Yale, Jacobs, Hansen, Berkman, Kasi, and Ostfeld, Jacobs et al., and Jacobs, Nelson, and Zisook have been interested in depression within the context of bereavement. According to them, \"Although the majority of depressions of bereavement are transient and require no professional attention, there is growing appreciation that some depressions, especially those that persist throughout the first year\no56m | of bereavement, are clinically significant.\" They have used antidepressant medication to treat patients whose depression persisted late into the course of bereavement and did not resolve spontaneously or respond to interpersonal interventions. These were usually people who had a history of depression or some other mental health disorder. They found improvement in sleep disorders and appetite disturbance as well as an improvement in mood and cognition. This response suggests a biological dimension to the depression.\n90k5 | A section in the DSM-five advises that:\n9m8s | One of the functions of the counselor who has contact with people during the time of acute grief is to assess which patients might be undergoing a major depression by using current standard diagnostic criteria from the DSM-five. Patients so identified can then be given additional help such as a medical evaluation and possibly the use of antidepressant medications. Once depression begins to lift through medication, then the focus of treatment changes to the underlying conflicts of the attachment. These conflicts cannot be addressed through medications alone.\n893y | If grief is defined as one's experiences after a loss, then mourning is the process one goes through leading to an adaptation to the loss. In the next two chapters, we look at the mourning process in detail.\nfavz | FOR REFLECTION AND DISCUSSION\n7szx | Grief Counseling and Grief Therapy\n```",
