You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

7od1 | There is another factor to consider with regard to the results with probe 1. The discussion of steric effects on the rate constant for ring opening of substrate-derived radical ignored the fact that two enantiomers of this substrate were allowed to react with the chiral enzyme. If sterics-enforced stereoelectronic effects were operative, it is unlikely that both enantiomeric radicals derived from the enantiomers of the probe would suffer similar ring- opening rate retardations. The formation of aryl hydroxylated product in amounts comparable to the amount of alcohol la produced complicates the analysis, however. As indicated above, it is likely that the two different products are derived from the two different enantiomers of the probe substrate. Further studies with enantiomerically pure probes are planned to resolve this question.
0bqy | Aside from steric factors within the active site, other consid- erations to explain the lack of rearranged substrate with M. capsulatus (Bath) must be addressed. For example, one cannot rule out that the hydroxylation reaction may proceed through two different mechanisms from a common intermediate. One pathway, D or E, could involve a substrate radical, thus accounting for the rearranged products observed with MMO from <LATEX>M .</LATEX> trichosporium OB3b. An alternative pathway could involve mechanism A, <LATEX>B ,</LATEX> C, or <LATEX>F .</LATEX> The specific pathway chosen would then depend on the energetics of the substrate. It is possible, however, that the fre- quency with which each pathway is followed may differ between the two organisms. Alternatively, MMO from M. capsulatus (Bath) and M. trichosporium OB3b may exhibit different hy- droxylation mechanisms, which would explain the presence of ring-opened products for the latter.
b780 | We now return to the intramolecular deuterium isotope effect of 5.1 observed for the hydroxylation of deuterated 1. Although an isotope effect of this magnitude is generally associated with processes that involve a relatively linear transition state,75 such as would occur for oxygen rebound, mechanisms containing in- tramolecular cyclic transition states cannot be excluded. In fact, dimethyldioxirane, a reagent believed to oxidize hydrocarbons via an insertion process,76 oxidized cyclododecane-do and <LATEX>- d _ { 2 4 }</LATEX> with an isotope effect of 5.77 Thus our observed value of 5.1 would be consistent with pathways A, <LATEX>B ,</LATEX> <LATEX>\mathrm { C } \left( 1 \right) ,</LATEX> and <LATEX>F ,</LATEX> all of which involve transition states for C-H bond cleavage that resemble the diox- irane oxygen insertion process and avoid the formation of <LATEX>a</LATEX> substrate radical or carbocation in the catalytic cycle.75 The

li1k | In summary, the failure of substrate probes 1 and 2 to form rearranged alcohol products upon hydroxylation with the M. capsulatus (Bath) MMO is best interpreted in terms of a mechanism that does not involve the formation of a radical or carbocation, namely, A, B, C(1), or F. It is unlikely that the enzyme active site induces a stereoelectronic barrier to ring opening. The fact that the same amount (85%) of the probe, both converted and unconverted, can be recovered from the enzymatic reaction mixture under hydroxylation conditions or in control reactions omitting NADH indicates that ring-opened substrate radical has not formed and been lost in the extraction procedure. In addition, these probes do not lead to inactivation of the enzyme over the time course of the reactions, indicating that ring-opened product has not formed and reacted with the enzyme. The kinetic isotope results are consistent with a concerted pathway for C-H bond insertion for the key hydroxylation step.
pbea | Comparisons with Related Work. The MMO mechanism is almost always drawn in analogy to that of cytochrome P-450.8,15,16 In particular, a catalytic cycle involving an iron oxo intermediate (Scheme III) that abstracts H' from the alkane (mechanism D, Scheme IV) has been proposed by several authors. The ability of high concentrations of hydrogen peroxide to effect a shunt pathway for the M. trichosporium OB3b MMO has been cited as evidence for heterolytic cleavage of the O-O bond,16 although it is noteworthy that, unlike the situation for cytochrome P-450, other oxo-transfer reagents could not be substituted for H2O2. Hydrogen peroxide does not operate at comparable levels in the M. capsulatus (Bath) system.59 Various authors have invoked radical intermediates for the hydroxylation reaction. For example, exo,exo,exo,exo-2,3,5,6-d4-norbornane epimerizes upon hy- droxylation by M. trichosporium OB3b MMO,15 a result that has its parallels in cytochrome P-450 chemistry.79 The extent of epimerization with MMO, however, was significantly less, being 2% following hydrogen atom abstraction from the endo position compared to 18% with cytochrome P-450, and 5% after abstraction at the exo position compared to 14% with cytochrome P-450. Similarly, allylic rearrangements occurred in 20% of the MMO hydroxylation products from 3,3,6,6-d4-cyclohexene compared to 33% with cytochrome P-450.15.80 Mechanistic studies of MMO from M. trichosporium OB3b with the free radical probe 1,1- dimethylcyclopropane and with (S)- and (R)-[1-2H,1-3H]ethane were also consistent with radical formation, but cationic inter- mediates could not be ruled out.14,45 It has also been claimed that radical intermediates can be trapped during methane hydroxylation by the MMO of M. capsulatus (Bath).24 In addition, the mechanism for olefin epoxidation by MMO from M. trichospo- rium OB3b differs from that believed to occur with cytochrome P-450.15 With cytochrome P-450, the 1-trans proton of propylene exchanges with solvent protons during turnover,81 leading to the hypothesis that the epoxidation mechanism involves oxametallo- cycles and iron carbene intermediates. In the reaction of propylene with MMO, however, no such exchange occurred.15
ccpt | In view of these and the present results, it would appear that no single unifying mechanism can account for all of the data. Instead, it seems likely to us that more than one mechanism might
