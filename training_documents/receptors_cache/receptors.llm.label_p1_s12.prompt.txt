  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,

82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

06yq | G Protein Coupled Receptors and Heterotrimeric G Proteins as Cancer Drivers Nadia Arang1, and J. Silvio Gutkind1*
dpv6 | Abstract
8r5j | G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and heterotrimeric G proteins play central roles in a diverse array of cellular processes. As such, dysregulation of GPCRs and their coupled heterotrimeric G proteins can dramatically alter the signalling landscape and functional state of a cell. Consistent with their fundamental physiological functions, GPCRs and their effector heterotrimeric G proteins are implicated in some of the most prevalent human diseases, including a complex disease such as cancer that causes significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. GPCR/G protein-mediated signalling impacts oncogenesis at multiple levels by regulating tumour angiogenesis, immune evasion, metastasis, and drug resistance. Here, we summarize the growing body of research on GPCRs and their effector heterotrimeric G proteins as drivers of cancer initiation and progression, and as emerging antitumoral therapeutic targets.

jfsr | Introduction
u15r | G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) represent the largest family of cell-surface receptors, with over 800 GPCRs and 35 heterotrimeric G protein subunits involved in transduction of diverse signalling cascades1-3. GPCRs are characterized by a distinctive 7-transmembrane domain structure with an extracellular amino terminus and an intracellular carboxyl terminus, and by their ability to couple to heterotrimeric G proteins, comprised of a, B, and y subunits, which activate a diverse array of downstream signalling pathways1. GPCRs play key roles in many cellular and physiological functions, including in neurotransmission, cardiac response and blood pressure regulation, vision, olfaction, tissue development and immune regulation2,4.
lq35 | The human GPCR superfamily can be phylogenetically grouped into 5 subfamilies based on distinct structural features- Class A (rhodopsin), Class B1 (secretin), Class B2 (adhesion), Class C (glutamate), and Class F (frizzled/taste2)1. Most GPCRs activate one or multiple Ga proteins, which bind guanine nucleotides-GDP in their inactive form and GTP in their active form. Ga proteins are subdivided into 4 major families: Gai, Ga12, Gas, and Gaq, with each family activating a distinct repertoire of signalling mechanisms4. GPCR activation is initiated by the binding of an agonist ligand to the extracellular domain of the receptor which induces a rapid conformational change in the extracellular and intracellular loops of the receptor5. This transition into the active conformation of the receptor results in coupling to the heterotrimeric G proteins and triggers the exchange of GDP for GTP on the Ga subunit, promoting its dissociation from GBy dimers. Both Ga-GTP bound and GBy subunit complexes then stimulate downstream signalling cascades, including the rapid generation of multiple second messengers by modulating the activity of ion channels, phospholipases, phosphodiesterases, and adenylyl cyclases2. These second messenger generating systems and their downstream regulated kinases cascades are responsible for most of the rapid physiological responses elicited by GPCRs6-12. In tandem to these processes, Regulators of G protein Signalling (RGS) proteins enhance the GTPase activity of the Ga subunit, enabling the reassociation of the Ga and GBy subunits into a bound heterotrimeric G protein, and returning the protein complex to a GDP-bound inactive state5. Moreover, arrestins are recruited to activated GPCRs to promote receptor endocytosis and can participate in downstream signalling as scaffolds for signalling complexes, and as molecular rheostats of G protein-driven signal transduction13. This model of GPCR function has been improved over the recent years to encompass various classes of ligands, including agonists, partial agonists, inverse agonists and allosteric modulators, and the detailed structure features of the corresponding GPCR conformations that can be stabilized upon binding14.

a3td | As GPCRs and their associated heterotrimeric G proteins are involved in a diverse array of signal transduction pathways and cellular processes, dysregulation in either can have significant impacts on cellular behaviour and the initiation of pathogenic processes. This is highlighted by large body of drugs in the market targeting GPCRs. Indeed, 34% of all FDA approved drugs currently on the market target GPCRs directly or indirectly15-17. This review will summarize the growing body of information establishing GPCRs and heterotrimeric G proteins as drivers of cancer and their roles in cancer initiation and progression.
ex5k | Historical Perspective
9d4o | The earliest evidence suggesting a role for GPCRs in tumorigenesis stems from work demonstrating that expression of a GPCR encoded by the mas oncogene (MAS1 gene), had the ability to transform and induce foci formation in NIH3T3 fibroblasts, as well as develop tumors in nude mice18. This pivotal work was novel in contrast to the many known oncogenes at the time, most of which were discovered based on the transforming activity of oncogenic viruses. These findings were reinforced by the observation that ectopic expression of the 5HT1c serotonin receptor (HTR1C) led to transformation of NIH3T3 cells19. However, in both cases the receptors did not harbour any identifiable mutations, contrasting with most viral and human oncogenes, and these observations were not widely appreciated. Subsequent studies examining the transforming potential of GPCRs led to the discovery that coupling specificity and excess ligand availability were key determinants of the oncogenic activity of wild type GPCRs. Specifically, overexpression alone of muscarinic cholinergic receptors (CHRMs), which span across Ga-coupling subtypes, was found to be insufficient to transform NIH3T3 cells. However, in the presence of the agonist carbachol foci were readily induced for Gaq-coupled CHRMs, thereby establishing that wild-type GPCRs can act as agonist-dependent oncogenes based on their G protein coupling capacity20. The a1B-adrenergic receptor (ADRA1B) was found to behave similarly by inducing neoplastic transformation when ectopically expressed in NIH3T3 cells, and triggering formation of foci in an agonist-dependent manner21. However, mutation of this receptor eliminated agonist dependency of receptor activation, rendering it constitutively active, thus raising the possibility that mutations may be a mechanism to enhance the oncogenic potential of GPCRs. As time has progressed, massive advances in the field of cancer genomics have transformed our understanding of oncogenesis and drivers of cancer. Aligned with this, GPCRs and heterotrimeric G proteins have emerged as candidate drivers supported by a diverse body of work underscoring the cancer relevance of mutations in GPCRs and heterotrimeric G proteins.

m5ka | The Hallmarks of Cancer
byu8 | This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved
76b0 | The hallmarks of cancer were originally proposed as a conceptual framework to better describe and understand the fundamental underpinnings of neoplastic disease and have since revolutionized our paradigm of the intricate processes driving cancer22,23. Composed of multiple interrelated processes, 1) sustaining proliferative signalling, 2) evading growth suppressors, 3) resisting cell death, 4) enabling replicative immortality, 5) inducing angiogenesis, 6) activating invasion and metastasis, 7) metabolic reprogramming, 8) evading immune destruction, and the enabling characteristics of 9) genome instability and 10) inflammation, this collection of capabilities cooperatively interact to facilitate the transformation of cells, and drive malignant growth and metastasis.
zxz6 | Aimed towards characterizing the unifying features of all cancers irrespective of tumor type, these guiding principles address the complex and dynamic interactions between and within the tumor and the tumor microenvironment, and have grown to encompass the numerous cell types that participate in these interactions, including normal cells whose functions can be co-opted to help drive tumorigenesis. Moreover, the dynamic and interrelated nature of these hallmarks necessitate the coordination of different signalling programs and their associated molecular mechanisms.
xnth | The remarkable functional repertoire of GPCRs and heterotrimeric G proteins, and their centrality to numerous cellular and physiological processes make them key participants in facilitating each of these hallmarks. In particular, given the complexity of signal transduction networks controlled by GPCRs, coupled with the cell-context specificity of signal integration and output, it is likely that GPCRs and heterotrimeric G proteins participate in multiple hallmarks within cancer cells and their tumor microenvironment. Specifically, there are likely to be numerous and overlapping mechanisms by which mutations and/or aberrant expression of GPCRs and heterotrimeric G proteins drive proliferative signalling, induce evasion of growth suppressors and enable replicative immortality, which will be described in detail below. The role of GPCRs in the remaining hallmarks will be described under each respective heading.

colo | of host survival pathways in order to promote viral pathogenesis24,25. Several viruses have been found to encode GPCRs in their genomes, including Kaposi's Sarcoma associated herpesvirus (KSHV), Human cytomegalovirus <LATEX>\left( H C M V \right) ,</LATEX> Human Herpesvirus 6 and 7, and Epstein-Barr Virus <LATEX>\left( E B V \right) ^ { 2 6 - 3 2 } .</LATEX> These viral GPCRs (vGPCRs) all encode GPCRs that are distantly related to human chemokine receptors24.
d6r4 | In many cases, infections by these viruses can lead to development of viral-associated cancer. For example, KSHV, a y-2-herpesvirus, is the causative agent of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), most frequently found in immunosuppressed individuals, and a significant driver of mortality among AIDS patients25,27,28. The KSHV vGPCR is most closely related to human CXCR1/2 receptors; however, it possesses several substitutions in residues which confer constitutive activity and enhanced coupling to G proteins24,33. Indeed, expression of KSHV vGPCR is alone sufficient to induce angiosarcomas when expressed in endothelial cells25,27,34 (Figure 1). Studies examining the etiology of KS, have found that vGPCR can initiate Kaposi's sarcomagenesis and contribute to progression of KS lesions34. KSHV has also been shown to play key roles in lymphoproliferative disorders, namely primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) and multicentric Castleman's disease (MCD), both of which are B cell lymphomas primarily seen in AIDS patients24. Here, vGPCR has been shown to elicit a broad range of signalling and transcriptional events ultimately driving B cell recruitment and hyper-proliferation35.
9mrz | Viruses can also exploit host GPCRs to promote viral pathogenesis and survival by expressing virally encoded GPCR agonists or antagonists in order to modulate host cell signalling. For example, KHSV encodes multiple viral cytokines, which have significant sequence similarity to host chemokine agonists and antagonists and can bind to host GPCRs to mediate functions such as chemotaxis of immune cells, and resistance to apoptosis25,36,37. Alternatively, these proteins can bind to and inactivate host-produced ligands in order to shut off or abrogate host immune response38.

7wn9 | The Mutation Spectrum of GPCRs in Cancer
wcd0 | The generation of vast cancer sequencing resources including The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) have revealed that GPCRs and heterotrimeric G proteins are collectively mutated in roughly 20% of all cancers, spanning across numerous tumor types39-42. This is aligned with mutation frequencies of some of the most well-studied cancer-related pathways, including the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)/RAS/MAPK and p53 pathways, which are mutated at 46% and 29% of all cancers
