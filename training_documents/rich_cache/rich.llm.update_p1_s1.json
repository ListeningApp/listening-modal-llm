        "content": "1b4f | THE SCIENCE\nfh0y | OF GETTING RICH\n4g6f | R\nfpm1 | THE\nycds | SCIENCE\nduzw | OF\na7jq | GETTING RICH Wallace D. Wattles\ns9lx | Mission Statement: To inspire, encourage, and exemplify abundance thinking and a strong sense of self-worth for people of goodwill everywhere.\n4uik | Introduction\ne0rl | ABOUT EIGHTEEN MONTHS AGO, a man I'd never met sent me a book I'd never heard of by a man who'd been dead nearly ninety years.\n7hew | That little book changed my entire life. As I put into practice the principles you'll learn about in this book, the results were astonishing - and they began almost instantly and continue to this day.\nonvv | When The Science of Getting Rich arrived in the mail that afternoon I immediately ripped open the package, sat down, and read it with an open mind - mostly because the title was just so intriguing. And even though I must admit I found some of the old-fashioned language and some of the ideas in the first part a bit confusing, there was something about it that compelled me to reread those little confusing bits two or three times until I got it!\nadbb | Once I did that, I couldn't stop reading until I'd read the whole thing!\nh6cg | Right away I began to put into practice what the book outlines ... and everything began to change. \"Coincidences\" happened - happy ones that led to connections with people ... that led to more connections ... that led to money beginning to flow toward me in increasingly larger amounts and from several sources, including new and unexpected ones.\nunxh | And even though changing your habitual thinking is difficult and I'm still not as good at it as I intend to be, my businesses began to \"click,\" my income doubled, then tripled, and continues to rise ... my cramped city apartment has given way to a spacious waterfront house ... I've established rewarding new relationships with many generous, successful, wealthy people ... and opportunities to be, do, have, and give more continue to show up at my doorstep almost daily.\nycmp | It's amazing - and wonderful.\nwabe | Until this book arrived, nothing I had ever read or heard before had explained to me so clearly that there are universal laws at work regarding wealth and success and that if we'll just work with those laws - go with the tide instead of trying to swim against it (usually unknowingly) - the results we want will begin to come to us. That if we will scientifically reproduce the causes of wealth, we will invariably reproduce the results.\nvpyq | Now, right off the bat author Wallace D. Wattles says that instead of questioning how these principles work, you'll need simply to accept them and begin to practice them. So I did that, even though as I read I did find myself resisting from time to time and thinking, \"Well, I don't know if I can agree with that.\" But I'd already decided just to accept (at least temporarily) each premise as if I did thoroughly believe it.\nai73 | By the time I finished the book I understood why he had included that warning. You see, some of what you'll read or hear will most likely challenge some of your previous thinking. That seems to be the case for most people. But keep on, and you'll soon see how Mr. Wattles beautifully builds each chapter on what he presents in the preceding ones. I think you'll find yourself saying - as I and many others have - \"Oh, now I see why he said that. Now I see how it all fits together.\"\n1lzj | I believe, also, that you'll find it absolutely refreshing to know that to get rich by the method outlined here, it is essential that you embrace and practice what we all know as the Golden Rule ... that the daily practice of gratitude is one of the conduits by which your wealth will come to you ... and that\nboyi | by accomplishing your financial dreams through this method, everyone with whom you come into contact will also have more.\n9lwd | A far cry from the dog eat dog, claw your way to the top, anything for a buck mentality so many believe to be the only way to wealth.\nd2vd | Pay close attention to the message of this book with an open mind.

You are a person of infinite worth and unique possibility. Even if you don't think of yourself as a creative person, and even if you've failed before, and even if you think you've tried everything, open your mind to this book.\nty34 | You've probably heard the saying, \"When the student is ready, the teacher appears.\" That has certainly held true for me and many, many others, and perhaps you're ready, too - right now. If you're not yet where you want to be in terms of income and your own personal success, the problem may not be what you're doing so much as how you're doing it. And that begins with how you think.\ngzzp | If you want to change your life, you may just need to change your mind!\nkh7y | Preface\n7xl2 | THIS BOOK IS PRAGMATICAL, NOT PHILOSOPHICAL - a practical manual, not a treatise upon theories. It is intended for the men and women whose most pressing need is for money, who wish to get rich first, and philosophize afterward. It is for those who want results and who are willing to take the conclusions of science as a basis for action, without going into all the processes by which those conclusions were reached.\n53tr | It is expected that the reader will take the fundamental statements upon faith, just as he would take statements concerning a law of electrical action if they were promulgated by a Marconi or an Edison, and, taking the statements upon faith, that he will prove their truth by acting upon them without fear or hesitation. Every man or woman who does this will certainly get rich, for the science herein applied is an exact science and failure is impossible.\n3zd1 | In writing this book I have sacrificed all other considerations to plainness and simplicity of style, so that all might understand. The plan of action laid down herein was deduced from the conclusions of philosophy. It has been thoroughly tested, and bears the supreme test of practical experiment: It works.\n3shq | CHAPTER\nr3r5 | The Right To Be Rich\npgo2 | WHATEVER MAY BE SAID IN PRAISE OF POVERTY, the fact remains that it is not possible to live a really complete or successful life unless one is rich. No one can rise to his greatest possible height in talent or soul development unless he has plenty of money, for to unfold the soul and to develop talent he must have many things to use, and he cannot have these things unless he has money to buy them with.\nv6zz | A person develops in mind, soul, and body by making use of things, and society is so organized that man must have money in order to become the possessor of things. Therefore, the basis of all advancement must be the science of getting rich.\n7zt5 | The object of all life is development, and everything that lives has an inalienable right to all the development it is capable of attaining.\n77ir | A person's right to life means his right to have the free and unrestricted use of all the things which may be necessary to his fullest mental, spiritual, and physical unfoldment; or, in other words, his right to be rich.",
