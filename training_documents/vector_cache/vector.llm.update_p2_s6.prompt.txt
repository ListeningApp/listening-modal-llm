You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

99fo | Results from various studies suggest that the neuroprotective and neurorestorative properties of neurotrophic factors have great potential as a new disease modifying therapy for Parkinson's disease [23]. A seminal study showed that long-term overexpression of the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) protein using recombinant AAV-GDNF driven by the MD (a combination of CMV (cytomegalovirus) enhancer and part of human ß-globin) promoter in the rat striatum before a 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesion led to protection of the nigrostriatal system [24]. AAV-GDNF under control of the CMV promoter injected after the 6-OHDA lesion into the rat striatum also showed functional recovery of the nigrostriatal system [25]. Both of these studies showed behavioural recovery on drug-induced rotations and cylinder test assays, two tests often used to measure the severity of a unilateral lesion in rat Parkinson's disease models. AAV-GDNF has been effective in promoting functional recovery not only in rat models but also in primate models of Parkinson's disease [26,27] and is currently in a clinical trial coordinated by the NIH Clinical Center [28,29]. Another AAV-based neurotrophic factor therapy for human Parkinson's disease patients has been neurturin (NRTN), a protein in the same family as GDNF [30]. AAV-NRTN has been shown to be safe as well as efficacious for targeting the substantia nigra in rats and primates, and it was effective in improving the outcomes of a rat 6-OHDA model [31]. However, when AAV2-NRTN was given to the putamen (striatum in rodents) [32] or simultaneously to the putamen and substantia nigra [33] in a double-blind, randomized, controlled trial in parkinsonian patients, it did not show clinically significant benefits over sham surgery. Though interestingly, secondary analysis of a double-blind controlled Phase 2b clinical study of AAV-NRTN identified a more robust response to AAV-NRTN in Parkinson's disease patients diagnosed within five years prior to treatment, relative to those diagnosed ten years prior or more [34]. In addition, a recent study has identified NRTN variants that may be
y5r7 | more effective [35]. Considering gene therapy for Parkinson's disease patients other than neurotrophic factors, AAV carrying glutamic acid decarboxylase (AAV2-GAD) was administered to the subthalamic nucleus and showed a significant benefit over sham surgery [36]. AAV-AADC (aromatic L-amino decarboxylase, the enzyme that converts levodopa to dopamine) has also shown clinical promise on motor symptoms in particular [37] and is currently in clinical trials [38]. There have also been studies in animals with AAV-TH (tyrosine hydroxylase) or AAV-TH combined with AAV-AADC [39] and with AAV-TH combined with GTP cyclohydrolase I [40] that have shown success. These studies also clearly demonstrated the safety of AAV as a vehicle for protein expression.
lrry | The trials described above bring up an important aspect of human gene therapy when targeting dopamine neurons for restoration purposes: whether to target the striatum/putamen or the substantia nigra. This is especially relevant since in Parkinson's disease the axons along the nigrostriatal tract are degenerating before the dopamine neuron bodies in the substantia nigra [41], and it is not clear how axonopathy impacts the efficacy of functional restoration after striatum/putamen administration. Also, it is likely that the optimal location, striatum/putamen or substantia nigra, as anatomical target for AAV injection is different depending on the therapeutic protein [23].
hvhm | 2. Delivering Neurotrophic Factor-Encoding Genes Carried by AAV to the Striatum
863b | Targeting the striatum in gene therapy has been a common approach with neurotrophic factors. Though as with any AAV, there is the issue of specificity and spreading. For example, in a previous clinical trial, the spreading of AAV2-NRTN was limited when injected to the putamen and particularly so when injected to the substantia nigra [42]. However, vectors carrying neurotrophic factor genes that were injected into the striatum can be transported retrogradely to the substantia nigra. For example, in the primate brain, AAV9-carrying green fluorescent protein (GFP) injected to the putamen has been shown to be transported in the anterograde and retrograde directions [43]. This has also been particularly true for AAV2-GDNF [44]. GDNF gene therapy targeting the striatum has restored nigral neurons after 6-OHDA injections in rats, but how AAV retrograde transport to the substantia nigra affects the therapeutic efficacy is unknown [24,45-47]. The results of limited efficacy for the AAV-NRTN trial when injected into putamen, together with findings that four to five years after diagnosis of Parkinson's disease there are few tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) fibres left in the putamen [48], led to clinical trials targeting the substantia nigra [31]. This brings up the question of whether striatally injected AAVs can restore dopamine neurocircuitry only when there are dopamine fibres that can transport neurotrophic factors from the striatum to the substantia nigra. However, in the absence of functional nigrostriatal fibres, GDNF expressed in striatal medium spiny projection neurons can be anterogradely transported to the substantia nigra pars reticulata and may thus signal locally in the substantia nigra on the nearby substantia nigra pars compacta dopamine neurons [49]. Moreover, there is a large body of experimental evidence indicating that striatal AAV delivery may be better than delivery into the substantia nigra. A neuroprotective study in mice with striatal AAV-GDNF injection against MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine)-induced experimental parkinsonism showed preserved synaptic plasticity and protected against the loss of dopamine; however its transport was not measured here [50]. AAV-GDNF in the 6-OHDA model of Parkinson's disease has shown efficacy in both neuroprotective and neurorestorative studies in rats. When AAV-GDNF was injected before the 6-OHDA to striatum, in both cases it was able to protect substantia nigra dopamine neurons [24,51]; perhaps unsurprisingly since the tract likely remained intact. Only the striatal delivery led to the functional recovery of the rats, whereas substantia nigra delivery in the same study resulted in substantia nigra dopamine neurons remaining protected but no recovery of behaviour [24]. More importantly, when AAV-GDNF was infused to the striatum after the 6-OHDA, this also led to behavioural recovery as well as the restoration of dopamine neurons due to retrograde transport to the substantia nigra [25]. AAV-GDNF can also be expressed in monkey substantia nigra via axonal transport when delivered to the putamen [27]. Similar to AAV-GDNF, AAV2-NRTN delivered to rat striatum before 6-OHDA showed neuroprotection in the substantia nigra dopamine neurons [51].
