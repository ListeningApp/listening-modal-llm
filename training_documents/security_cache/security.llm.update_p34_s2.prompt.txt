You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

7hgg | One of the hidden effects of organisational complexity is that it blurs lines of responsibility. In some cases, complexity is introduced specifically to allow people to avoid individual responsibility for decisions and policies that they know to be questionable, flawed or even illegal. Many of the major incidents that hit the national headlines are a direct result of organisational over-complexity that left a vaccuum where clear responsibilty and leadership should have been. This includes the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) response to Hurricane Katrina (2005), the Japanese government's response to the Fukushima disaster (2011), the BP response to Deepwater Horizon Gulf iof Mexico oil spill (2010), the G4S failure to supply security personnel to the London 2012 Olympics (2012) or the BBC's failure to adequately respond to the issue surrounding Jimmy Savile and accusastions of child abuse within the organisation (2012).
xwsv | The problem with complexity is not just a theroretical problem, but is reflected in almost every aspect of operation management. The more complex an operation becomes (especially if the additional complexity seems to be unnecessary), the more liley it is to lead to serious, and perhaps catastrophic, failure. Txample of how the break-up of British Rail into separate companies, each of which had the responsibility for a separate asepct of the over-all operation, is just one example of how additional complexity can lead to management breakdown and eventual disaster.
756b | 7.7 Case Study: Railtrack - Complexity and Disaster
6bx7 | One of the clearest cases of the conenction between complexity and loss of organisational control was Railtrack, the company that was created after the privatisation of the railway system by the Conservative government in 1996. Formerly known as British Rail, the nature of the railway network was already extremely complex, with a high degree of inter-conenctedness and mutual systems-dependency - (10,346 miles of track and signalling, 40,000 bridges and viaducts, 50 tunnels, 2,508 stations, 1500 signal boxes, 9000 level crossings). Altrhough there were organisational problems with BR before the break-up, at least there was one organisation that was responsible for the entire system, and which had clear lines of responsibility for its maintenance and management.
spl6 | After nationalisation, different section of BR were broken up into autonomous organisations, each responsible for a specific area of operations, and often developing a competetive or even adverserial relationship with other areas of operation. The trains and rolling stock were owned by three separate companies, that in turn leased them out to twenty-five different train operating companies. Railtrack owned the track, but its role was purely administrative. Responsibility for the maintenance of the track (a critical factor in the operation) was sub- contracted to other companies, which although they were then tasked with the responsibility for the maintenance of the track, in turn sub-contracted it out to other companies to actually deliver the work. Railtrack did not have its' own engineering department, and did not have the technical knowledge within the company to oversee the maintenance work, or even to gauge whether it was being delivered effectively.
7wzm | Another consequence of the break-up of BR was that rather than acting as a single entity with different divisions, each division acted in order to maximise its own profit and minimise any potential liablility. This meant that the highy critical and immensely complex network of relationships between the new companies were controlled by detailed contracts, each of which tried to micro-mange extremely complex operations. There were 224 separate legal agreements covering freight contracts, and apportioning responsibility for delays was based on 1,900 checkpoints, 204 predefined delay causes, and 1,300 delay-attribution points. Railtrack employed fifty people just to account for delays in the Southern region alone. These contractual relationships led to increasingly bitter legal actions between the various companies, which in turn led to a break down in over-all service delivery. Although the government still held nominal responsibility for overseeing the running of Railtrack, that was equally murky, with a raft of different organisations involved in the oversight, including the Office of Passenger Rail Franchising, the Office of the Rail Regulator, Her Majesty's Railway Inspectorate, the British Railway Board, the Rail Passengers Council, and the Transport Secretary. It will be no surprise that rather than working cooperatively and collaboratively, these government agencies often saw each other as rivals for power and influence, and spent more time trying to out-manoeuvre each other than concentrating on the actual objectives.

9vl6 | The consequences of this organisational complexity became tragically clear on the morning of 17th October 2000, when an Intercity train travelling at 115 miles an hour was derailed near Hatfield, with the death of four passengers and over seventy injured. Subsequent enquiries found that the cause of the derailment was the failure to repair damaged tracks, despite the fact that the damage and potential consequences were known. The official review into the incident laid the blame for the accident squarely on the lack of clear responsibility for the management of the tracks. This accident led to massive disruption of national rail services (with an estimated loss to UK businesses of £6 million per day), and ultimately caused Railtrack to go into administration in 2002.
c2fd | 7.8 Regular Reviews
jzvp | One of the fundamental developments in security management since 9/11 has been the realisation that rather than something that is limited to a security department, security management should be an integral part of every aspect of an organisation's operations and culture. In a similar way, security protocols are no longer seen as static things that are written and then forgotten, but are living documents that develop and evolve in the same way that any other part of the organisation would develop and evolve. Regular reviews of every aspect of the security management system play an important role in ensuring that security management capabilities are maintained at the highest possible level. As well as reviewing existing protocols and documentation, regular reviews also allow the security managers to develop their relationships with managers and personnel in other divisions or departments, which in turn helps facilitate the personal relationships which underpin effective security management at every level of an organisation.
f71y | 7.9 And Finally ....
31e1 | In many ways, security management fulfils a different role from every other activity within an organisation. Whilst mistakes in most other divisions are recoverable, and can often be resolved by way of a simple apology, mistakes made in the security department can often have much more significant consequences, are not recoverable, and may, in the worst circumstances, lead to death, injury or catastrophic impacts. The responsibility of the security manager is to create the correct balance between freedom of movement and activity on the one hand, and safety and security on the other, but also to ensure that lessons are learned, mistakes rectified and the overall system strengthened and improved on an on-going and continuous basis. Security management in its fundamental form is a simple art, but it is the ability to maintain standards, and to manage them effectively over time, that is the ultimate test of the success or otherwise of the security management system.
40ry | 7.10 Summary
d1j2 | It is almost certain that the front page of the newspaper you brought this morning carries an example of where failures in security management have had significant impacts, and quite possibly have led to actual disasters. The likelihood is that these failures did not happen because of some catastrophic outside event, but are the result of a breakdown of what should be basic management controls. The reasons for these failures are usually predictable and well known, but have in some way been ignored or side-stepped. The issues covered in this chapter will give any security manager the ability to audit their own operations, and to identify problems that have a high likelihood of leading to significant operational failures.
