8r5j | ABSTRACT
2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

sc5y | A number of recent studies have focused on the optimization of EBF systems. In 2013, Gong et al. [183] presented a genetic algorithm based structural optimization technique for EBFs. A successful application of this optimization method was demonstrated for a hypothetical three-story EBF building; however, this came with the cost of an excessive computational burden (of the order of days). In a more recent study, Karami Mohammadi and Sharghi [184] developed an optimum design technique for EBFs based on the concept of uniform deformation theory. These researchers applied the method to three-, five-, and ten-story EBFs and demonstrated that the optimized EBFs have lower weights and better seismic performances compared to those of regularly designed EBFs.
0yab | There are also a limited number of studies regarding the effect of concrete slabs on the structural response of EBF systems. In 2013, Danku et al. [185] investigated the issue in three EBFs and three dual EBFs with four, eight, and twelve stories through nonlinear static (pushover) analyses as well as IDA considering seven earthquake records. The models were calibrated using the outcomes of a companion experimental study [37]. The numerical results revealed that composite action can increase the system stiffness and reduce the structural drifts and rotation demands on links and lead to a more
w95z | optimum EBF design. For the case of dual EBFs, inelastic action was reported to be mainly concentrated in the links. Furthermore, the R factor for the steel EBFs and the steel dual EBFs was found to be about 6.0 (similar to Eurocode 8 [137]); however, a lower R factor (between 3.5 to 6.0) was reported when composite action was incorporated in the models. Prinz and de Castro-e-Sousa [186] also investigated the effect of concrete slabs on the EBF behavior in 2014. Two three-story EBFs with and without concrete slabs were modeled via FE method. The results of dynamic analyses under two earthquake accelerations confirmed the findings of Danku et al. [185] regarding the effects of concrete slabs on stiffness, inter-story drifts, and rotation demands of EBFs, especially for the case with long links, where a reduction of 35% was reported in the residual drifts because of composite action. Although the link rotation demands were lower in the composite models, Prinz and de Castro- e-Sousa [186] observed that the link damage accumulation was rather independent of the presence of concrete slabs. This increase of plastic demand in the composite models was attributed to the shift in the neutral axis which in turn produced higher strains in the bottom flanges of the links.
0i1k | 6. Special Topics
dqlg | Beside the topics covered in the previous sections, some special and emerging topics related with EBF systems are also available in the literature, and these are briefly discussed here.
p6pq | 6.1. EBFs with Vertical Links
zse6 | Although one of the earliest experimental studies on EBFs was conducted on frames with vertical links (also known as inverted Y-braced EBFs; Figure 1d) by Tanabashi et al. [2] in 1974, the use of horizontal links in EBFs has become more popular through the years. Compared to their horizontal counterpart, vertical links have an easier post-earthquake repair process. In addition, they can be conveniently used for the seismic rehabilitation of existing structures. Furthermore, their use can be advantageous in cases where the floor girders are required to remain elastic due to the presence of very large gravity loads. On the other hand, proper lateral bracing of vertical links can be difficult in certain cases. Early static, cyclic, and dynamic loading experiments by Seki et al. [187] and Vetr [188] on
p2n3 | single- and multi-story EBFs with vertical shear links revealed that this system can exhibit a very ductile and stable behavior during an intense loading, provided that proper lateral bracing for the link ends is available. The results of a numerical study by Fehling et al. [189] in 1992 further emphasized the importance of lateral bracing for vertical links. A force equal to 1/50 of the link shear force was deemed adequate for the design of these lateral braces. In a subsequent study by Bouwkamp and Vetr [190] a relation for limiting the length ratio of short (or shear) vertical links was proposed which was dependent upon the ratio of the link end moments.
ohh7 | The advantages of hybrid vertical links with low strength web and high strength flanges were demonstrated by Shinabe and Takahashi [191] in 1995. Similarly, the FE analyses of Saedi Daryan et al. [192] revealed that utilizing vertical links constructed from very low-yield-strength steel with Fy of about 100 MPa could increase the energy dissipation of an EBF notably while reducing the probability of local buckling.
vbni | The concept of EBFs with double vertical links, originally mentioned by Fehling et al. [189], was recently investigated numerically as well as experimentally by Shayanfar et al. [193, 194] and promising results were reported. This concept can be advantageous in cases where the dimensional limitations of the floor beam in an existing structure do not allow the use of a single large-size vertical link for seismic rehabilitation.
dgcw | Through extensive nonlinear static and dynamic analyses, Dicleli and Mehta [195, 196] investigated the behavior of EBFs with vertical shear links built from compact HP sections. Results revealed that such systems can combine the advantages of MRFs and CBFs during an earthquake while experiencing less damage and eliminating the negative aspects of each system.
gvwz | In 2012, Shayanfar et al. [197] tested a composite vertical shear link in which a steel link was partially encased in reinforced concrete. Results revealed that the concrete in these links can delay the web buckling and increase the shear strength and energy dissipation of the specimens significantly. Nevertheless, the behavior of the composite link coincided with that of the bare steel link when the concrete portion was fully damaged at later stages of the loading.
sk5m | A novel two-stage seismic load resisting system was developed by Zahrai and Vosooq [198] in 2013 which combined an EBF system with vertical shear links with a knee braced frame. During a
qws8 | moderate earthquake, only the vertical links dissipate energy while in the case of a strong ground motion, the plastic deformations in the vertical links are limited to a certain extent using a mechanical stopper device and further frame drift causes yielding in the knee elements.
877u | Shayanfar et al. [199] developed a performance-based plastic design (PBPD) methodology for EBFs with vertical links similar to the design methodology proposed previously by Chao and Goel [158, 159] for EBFs with horizontal links. Based on the approach developed by Mastrandrea et al. [147-150], a rigid-plastic analysis and design approach for EBFs with vertical links was developed by Montuori et al. [200, 201] in 2014 which included moment-shear interaction and aimed to prevent local and partial mechanisms while ensuring formation of a desired global collapse mechanism.
rzhj | In a recent numerical study by Massah and Dorvar [202], the analysis and design of EBFs with vertical shear links and shape memory alloy (SMA) devices were investigated. The SMA material can recover its original shape even after very large strains through the shape memory effect (which requires heating) and the superelasticity effect (which requires unloading). In this study, SMA devices were mounted on sides of the vertical links to obtain a reversible system with reduced residual deformations.
bfax | In 2016, Wang et al. [203] conducted an experimental study on a three-story one-bay by one-bay EBF system with vertical links in which the links were constructed from conventional steel while other members were made from high strength steel, similar to the concept studied for EBFs with horizontal links by Lian et al. [39]. Although excellent cyclic performance was reported, significant out-of-plane deformation was observed at the conjunction of the vertical link and the braces (which was not laterally supported) leading to failure due to fracture in the link-to-beam connection at the first story.
f2y8 | Although the current AISC Seismic Provisions [3] are intended for designing EBFs with horizontal links, the commentary on the code emphasizes the importance of lateral bracing at the intersection of a vertical link and braces, if inverted Y-braced EBFs are utilized.
o7qm | 6.2. Tied Braced Frames and EBFs with Zipper Struts
d52l | To prevent formation of a soft story mechanism in an EBF [16, 89, 90], Martini et al. [204] proposed a modified EBF configuration in 1990, known as the tied braced frame (TBF), in which the
qlbb | link ends are vertically connected to each other over the entire height of the structure. Although a number of early studies indicated some advantages for using TBFs [143, 204], the nonlinear static and dynamic analyses of Popov et al. [141] in 1992 demonstrated that properly designed EBF systems can have well-distributed inelastic action throughout the building height without the need for ties. In a number of recent studies, however, unsatisfactory seismic behavior was reported, particularly for high- rise EBFs [109, 111]. As a result, design methodologies for TBFs were developed by Ghersi et al. [205] and Rossi [206] on the assumption that these systems are more prone to form a global collapse mechanism. Promising performance was reported by Rossi [206] for TBFs deigned according to the proposed methodology.
nhsg | In a similar approach, Zahrai et al. [207] proposed and numerically investigated the behavior of EBFs with zipper struts, which vertically connect the mid-points of shear links throughout the height. Results of the extensive pushover, cyclic loading, and time-history analyses revealed that the zipper struts not only help in having coincident yielding of the links but also increase the ductility and energy dissipation of the system.
hy0l | 6.3. Replaceable Links
4jmz | Although the concept of replaceable links was previously mentioned in a number of studies (e.g. [24, 104, 187]), the first research specifically on EBFs with horizontal links that can be easily dismounted and replaced after an earthquake was conducted by Stratan and Dubina [27, 208] in the early 2000s. A link-to-beam connection with bolted end-plates, which were flush with the floor beam, was studied. Pinched behavior due to the end-plate bending and bolt thread stripping was observed in some cases and it was concluded that the link length ratio (p) should be limited to 0.8 to have proper cyclic behavior. Further numerical and experimental studies of Dubina et al. [209, 210] confirmed the applicability of the concept and demonstrated that dual EBFs have a notable re-centering capability which significantly facilitates the post-damage replacement. To further investigate this, a comprehensive full-scale test program, known as the DUAREM project [211, 212], was recently conducted at the European Laboratory for Structural Assessment (ELSA) of the Joint Research Centre (JRC) in Ispra, Italy in which a three-story three-bay to one-bay dual EBF system with end-plated
b7cq | replaceable links was tested pseudo-dynamically under three earthquake levels and link replacement was performed after each ground motion simulation. It was concluded that the dual EBF system with replaceable links is a promising lateral load resisting system that provides the desired seismic performance as well as an economic post-earthquake repair procedure.
0b39 | Two other replaceable shear link details were recently studied by Mansour et al. [34, 41] through isolated link tests as well as frame tests. The first detail was again a bolted end-plate link-to-beam connection; however, it had a link segment that was smaller than the floor beam, making it possible to use bolts above the top flange and below the bottom flange of the link. Excellent ductility and stable behavior was reported for this detail proving its ability for practical applications. Further numerical studies of Mago [213] in 2013, which are summarized in the HERA R4-145 report, confirmed the reliability of the connection. In a recent study by Dusicka and Lewis [35] on a similar replaceable link connection, the use of an additional pair of stiffeners was proposed to reduce the probability of flange fracture in the vicinity of the link-to-end-plate welds. These additional stiffeners were placed parallel to the link web and located in the first web panel (similar to the detail shown in Figure 7h). In addition to the numerical analyses, the detail was verified experimentally for the case of replaceable long links by Dusicka and Lewis [35].
qecd | Another detail developed by Mansour et al. [34, 41] for replaceable shear links (originally proposed by Balut and Gioncu [214] for MRFs) was a bolted web connection where two back-to-back channel sections, considered as the link segment, were bolted to the web of the floor beam. Although larger Yp max values were obtained compared to the tested end-plate connections, the bolted web connection experienced a pinched behavior due to the repeated cycles of bolt-slip, bolt bearing against the link web, and bolt hole ovalization. The larger rotation capacities of these links were attributed to the inelastic rotation of the connection itself which, in average, was about 16% of the total inelastic link rotation. Modified and reinforced details were proposed to overcome the pinched behavior observed for the web bolted connection. The replaceability of the damaged links was also studied in the frame tests.
1o7p | There are also a limited number of practical applications of replaceable links in New Zealand which are summarized by Fussel et al. [215], Ramsay et al. [216], and Gardiner et al. [217]. It is worth
cp13 | noting that design guidelines for replaceable links are given in the specifications of New Zealand and Canada [17, 218].
bgre | 6.4. Use of EBFs or links in Reinforced Concrete Structures
57lp | Providing a thorough review of this topic is out of the scope of this study; however, the main applications of EBF configurations in reinforced concrete (RC) structures are mentioned here for the sake of completeness. Steel eccentric braces with or without vertical links can be connected to existing RC frames for seismic rehabilitation. This concept was numerically and experimentally studied by Bouadi and Engelhardt [219], Ghobarah and Abou Elfath [220], Bouwkamp et al. [221], Perera et al. [222], D'Aniello [223], Mazzolani et al. [224], Pina et al. [225], Durucan and Dicleli [226], Özel and Güneyisi [227], Varum et al. [228], and Wang and Yu [229] in the past few decades. Steel links are also utilized as energy dissipating coupling beams between adjacent RC wall piers in hybrid coupled wall (HCW) systems. A comprehensive review of the research on the behavior, analysis, and design of these systems as well as particular topics such as link-to-wall connections can be found in El-Tawil et al. [230].
ukth | 6.5. Progressive Collapse of EBFs
