You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

c25g | There are certain challenges with attunement that can surface in attachment- based relationships. They include how to stay attuned to your partner when they are upset with you and how to stay attuned if you get triggered by them. In non- monogamous relationships it can be additionally challenging to stay attuned to your partner when they are talking about one of their other partners, when jealousy arises or when the things they are sharing about others have implications for your relationship with them. When you are with multiple partners at the same time, you might also feel confusion around how to stay attuned to each of your partners. Just as the wants and needs of each relationship are different, the ways that we attune to each of our partners can also be different.
3i2y | Questions to Consider
qo5h | . How do you experience your partners as attuning to you?
vg7d | . How do you know that your partners "get" you and care about your expe- rience?
768z | . In what ways do you already attune to your partners?
8ant | . How could you better or differently attune to your partners to support them in feeling even more seen and understood?
ub5e | . Are there ways that you would like your partners to better or differently attune to you that would support you in feeling even more seen and understood?
ec6h | Things to Try and to Experiment With
w6yy | . Listen with your heart. When listening to your partner, put your solution- orientated brain aside for a few minutes. Soften your eyes, bring warmth to your face, open up your heart and listen.
3cxo | . Ask questions from genuine curiosity and the desire to truly understand,
zxlu | rather than from preconceived notions about what your partner has already done or what you think they should do. Be careful about asking questions that are really just searching for evidence to either make yourself feel better, to prove them wrong or to expose them as lying in some way. Also, be careful not to interrogate or manipulate through your questions.
165g | . Make an effort to track something that your partner is going through. For example, if you know they went to an event or have an aunt in the hospital, follow up by asking them how the event was or how their aunt is doing.
o7vc | . Genuinely ask your partner about how they are doing, whether in general or about something specific. Use open-ended questions that encourage them to share any feelings or needs they have surrounding the situation, what their experience has been, what it means to them and how they have been im- pacted by it.
ikzp | . Bring your bodies into attunement. Sex can be a great way to do this, espe- cially if you take turns just focusing on what one partner likes and wants. You can also explore techniques and exercises such as sitting or spooning and breathing together, bringing your bodies and breath into harmony in non- sexual ways.
o2co | . Take a pause in your day, think about something that you know one of your partners is grappling with and put yourself in their shoes for a few minutes.
932d | . When listening to your partner talk about another partner (or something else that has the potential to trigger you) put your friend hat on instead of your partner hat. Any concerns or questions that you may have can still be brought up eventually, but do your best to initially separate what they are sharing and what it means to them from how it impacts you.
eab8 | . Slow down your conversation by taking turns paraphrasing what you just heard the other partner say before you respond to what they said.
78uf | . Learn non-violent communication or other empathy-based techniques that encourage you to empathically reflect back to your partner what they are feel- ing and needing.

hi2c | R: RITUALS AND ROUTINES
xhx2 | Our attachment system is comforted by routine and regularity. In our relationships with our attachment figures, we tend to prefer partners who are more reliable and situations where we can experience the ease of generally knowing what to expect and not be surprised to the point of disruption. The mundane rituals of everyday life can put many of our worries to rest and remind us that we are an integral part of our partners' lives, and the profound rituals of commitment ceremonies and rites of passage can significantly deepen and strengthen our bonds. The outer commitment we make to a relationship through ceremonies or officially asking someone to be our partner can offer structure and definition, and the day-to-day ways that we engage with one another-the micro routines and rituals of rela- tionship that we create-can be seen as the inner commitment we make to show up for the relationship wholeheartedly and not just because there might be an outer, more explicit commitment to rely on.
64tz | In monogamy, the daily routines of a relationship can be easier to fall into. There are only two people to consider, and the larger rituals and relationship rites of passage such as marriage, having children or moving in together are more obvi- ous, culturally expected and supported. In nonmonogamy, socially recognized ways of honoring the relationship can be less clear, and it can be more difficult to find our rhythm with a partner, especially when we don't live with our partner and/ or when one of you already lives with other partners. Nonmonogamous relation- ships do have their own relationship rites of passage, like first sleepovers, trips away together or having sex without a barrier for the first time, but the significance of these events can be easily missed by normative standards. However, it is just as important in our nonmonogamous relationships to find the special things, big and small, that we do with our partners. The routines that we can rely on and look for- ward to are an important part of secure functioning in our CNM attachment-based
myvp | relationships.
nr73 | It is also important to create rituals and routines that honor the transitional mo- ments when you and your partners are parting or reuniting. Our attachment sys- tems are very sensitive to comings and goings. Abrupt departures and sudden ar- rivals can all be jarring to the nervous system, and hellos or goodbyes left unac- knowledged can be disconnective. Understanding what we need to reconnect after being apart from our partner and what we might need to feel secure when saying goodbye might seem like subtle things to focus on, but they should not be un- derestimated in their impact. One polyamorous colleague of mine intentionally knows the love languages+ of each of his different partners, and when they reunite after being apart he does his best to immediately give them their primary love lan- guage as a way to reinforce their connection and set the stage for the rest of their time together.
a2o9 | Additionally, how partners say goodbye before one of them goes on a date with someone else or how they reunite after having been with other partners can make a big difference in feeling safe and sound with each other. Some people don't want much pomp and circumstance when saying goodbye, while others need moments of connection with each other before their partner goes off on a date with someone else. If partners live together, they may request that the partner who has been with someone else shower before coming to bed, they may desire emotional or physical contact after being apart or they may prefer to sleep in separate rooms on date nights with others.
e4rj | While having routines is definitely important in our attachment-based relation- ships, having times where we also break out of our routines can be just as signif- icant. We can easily fall into default patterns and ruts in our relationships. Remem- bering the importance of stepping out of our day-to-day cycles, focusing on some novelty, play and adventure can revivify and strengthen our connections with part- ners.
