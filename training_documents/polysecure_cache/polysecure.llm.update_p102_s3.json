Ask what it wants for you and if it is trying to protect you in any way. You can do this verbally, internally or in writing. Keep engaging with it until you get to a positive intention that it is holding for you. Once you have this positive intention, you can then experiment with translating the inner critic any time it arises again.\nsc0s | Seek support through books, programs, training or with a professional to work with your inner critic and to manage your triggers.\npnsc | No matter how triggered, anxious or out of control you feel, it's important to know that you can change your arousal system and calm yourself. Mindful deep belly breathing (even for just sixty seconds) is an effective way to decrease heightened arousal and return your body to a state of homeostasis.\np1qs | Experiment with cognitive reappraisal or cognitive reframing techniques to reinterpret a situation and change your emotional response to it. For example, if you haven't heard from a partner for an unusual amount of time, instead of thinking that they are uninterested in you or pulling away, you might instead wonder if they are busy doing something important or whether their phone battery died. Or if you are struggling with a partner or metamour, you can try to see the situation from their point of view and consider how they may also be struggling in this situation.\nk5kg | Check out Deirdre Fay's workbook Becoming Safely Embodied: A Skills-Based Approach to Working with Trauma and Dissociation.\ne002 | Check out Bonnie Weiss and Jay Earley's book, Freedom from Your Inner Critic: A Self-Therapy Approach.\n9klo | In this chapter we have covered how to create earned secure attachment and how to apply the HEART of being polysecure to yourself. Changing deeply ingrained habits and beliefs is not easy or instantaneous, but it is possible. Doing this kind of work can be life-changing and well worth the effort. However, there is a paradox in this process of working with our attachment. Some people might advise you to first create a secure attachment with yourself before you can have secure relationships with others, or they might say that you need to experience secure attachment\npbpw | with others before you can have it with yourself. When we are talking about adults believe that both can be true. What you've gone through both as a child and as an adult, how pain-free or painful your nonmonogamy journey has been and where you are in your personal growth process will dictate what's best for you. Some of us need to take a pause on dating and turn inward to heal, deconstruct and rebuild ourselves. This can allow us to bring forward a more fortified and healthy self that is able to relate in secure ways with others. Others may need to first have enough positive experiences where we feel seen, loved and met before embarking on inner work. These experiences can build a certain outer relational security that then can enable us to have enough self-worth, courage and capacity to look inward. These processes can alternate back and forth or can also occur simultaneously, where we are both in relationships that are healing and supportive to us and at the same time doing inner attachment work as well. Whichever of the polysecure HEARTS paths is for you, please allow it to unfold in the ways that work best and make the most sense for you and your relationships, knowing that it will probably be more circuitous than linear.\n6tr9 | CHAPTER TEN COMMON QUESTIONS AND FINAL THOUGHTS\n06s5 | BEFORE WE END THIS BOOK, I want to cover a few questions that I am asked frequently enough to make them worth addressing. Then I will offer my final words to you.\nf3g2 | How many nonmonogamous attachment-based relationships can I have?\nzlrt | I get this question a lot, and, probably to your disappointment, I don't have a single quantifiable number to give you. Maybe in the future, there will be research that indicates the ideal number of attachment figures you can have while nonmonogamous, but I'd still be cautious of this because what I've seen is that it really depends on circumstances. There are many factors that will impact how many partners you can fully enter into a secure attachment-based relationship with. How demanding of your time and attention is your work? Do you have kids? If so, how many and how old are they? Do you care for elderly parents or other adults? Are you in school? How stable is your living situation? How's your health? Do you or your partners have any special needs? Where are you in your healing process regarding trauma and attachment insecurity? Are there certain hobbies or passions that are very important for you to pursue or make time for? Are you in a major life transition (e.g., divorce, moving house, a career change, gender transition or leaving an organized religion)? Are you in a certain phase of life that makes it easier or harder to have partners? These are just some of the factors that can impact how much emotional bandwidth a person has for secure relationships. It's not just about how polysaturated you are, but how life-saturated you are.\n8szg | In the nonmonogamous world there is a popular saying that love is infinite, but time and resources are not. This saying highlights the paradox of ultimate versus relative reality-love is not a finite resource, so it is possible for us to love more than one person at a time, but we are all in bodies that are limited to the relative realities of space and time, so having infinite partners is not actually possible. When thinking about attachment-based relationships, this phrase is extremely\nhh47 | relevant and can be adapted to say that love is infinite, but secure attachment is not. Since not all of your relationships have to be attachment-based, you may have several, even many, romantic or sexual partners. But it is important to be honest and realistic about how many people you have the time and resources to invest in the HEART of being polysecure with before you begin to compromise or dilute your other attachment-based relationships. Additionally, if you prioritize secure attachment with yourself, does this change, whether through enhancing or reducing, what you can offer others?\nadpv | Should we close our relationship when there are attachment problems?\nsy8a | Again, it depends. I've seen both ends of the spectrum-closing an open relationship can cause damage both inside and outside of the relationship, but staying open when there are clear attachment problems can also cause irreparable damage to the people or relationships struggling with attachment insecurity. Some people are quick to advise a struggling couple to close up, to just focus on each other and to take the time to heal their attachment issues. If that feels like the right decision for you and your partner, then great! There are times when I have seen this as the best option for an individual or couple, but be cautious of applying monogamous advice to a polyamorous context. Attachment issues do not just show up in the early stages of a monogamous couple opening up, but also with people who are solo poly and with people who have been practicing forms of nonmonogamy for years, so please beware of jumping to closing a relationship as the attachment cure-all.\n```",
