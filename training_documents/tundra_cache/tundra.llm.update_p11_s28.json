Overall, the maps correspond well to previous polygon maps of the area and to the authors' knowledge of the mapped landscapes.\nuz3c | Four. Conclusion\nd5bi | This project combined predictor datasets derived from two airborne sensors in a machine learning approach that permitted the construction of very high-resolution validated vegetation classification maps based on simple ground reference data. The approach highlights the ability of high-quality airborne data to produce very high-resolution geospatial data products over relatively large areas, providing an important link between limited-extent ground- and UAS-based remote sensing products and coarser geospatial data products covering larger extents. The maps should prove to be a valuable resource for Arctic researchers requiring fine-scale reference data for these important research landscapes.\nba4l | Data availability\nffx8 | The vegetation classification maps and ground reference photo collection are available for download at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory Distributed Active Archive Center.\ns6su | ORCID iDs\n```",
