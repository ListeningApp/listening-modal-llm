You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

xagm | The largest amount of silver and bromide were determined on the side of the membrane in contact with Ag substrate, whereas for the other side, mainly bromide and potassium signals were detected.
iwn5 | If the reference membranes were placed directly on GC or Au substrate, unpredictable and unstable potential values were recorded (see Table S-2).
uooz | 4. EIS Spectra for Electrodes with REF-Br Membranes Deposited on Silver or Nonsilver Substrate. The influence of the Ag phase was inspected by electrochemical impedance (EIS).
pxbq | A striking difference in the impedance spectra for electrodes with reference membranes deposited on Ag substrate or nonsilver substrate was observed. Namely, the difference is manifested by a disappearance of a low-frequency branch for the membranes deposited on Ag substrate which is present if the substrate is a nonsilver one. The EIS results indicate a slower electrochemical process rate in the membrane without dispersed Ag. The appearance of Warburg type behavior at lower frequencies can be attributed to a slower ion-transport in the membrane. It can be hypothesized that dispersed silver facilitates the overall electrochemical process.
jfsr | The EIS spectra illustrating this effect, recorded for electrodes with REF-Br-photo membranes deposited on a bare GC substrate and for the GC substrate covered with Ag are presented in Figure S-2.
u15r | 5. Mechanism of the Br-REF Response. Undoubtedly, the fact that the metallic silver, both as the layer on the substrate and in the form of dispersed nanosilver in the membrane, significantly contribute to stabilizing the potential of the REF-Br systems is of general importance to solid contact
lq35 | ion-sensor technology with heterogeneous membranes. The composite-like heterogeneous membrane serves as the reservoir of Ag, AgBr, KBr, and respective silver bromide complexes. The coexistence of these three solid phases coupled through the contact with the respective ions (silver, potassium bromoar- gentate, and bromide ions) saturating pores and slow electrolyte outflow from the membrane is the prerequisite of the stability observed. Interestingly, the mean standard potential of the REF-Br electrodes (-157 mV vs Ag/AgCl/3 M KCI (Eº = +210 mV vs NHE)) indicates that the composite reference electrode works as the analogue of the Ag/AgBr reference electrode immersed in the heterogeneous membrane, which plays the role of a stable electrolyte bridge. The bridge provides a stable electrochemical matrix, in respect to the coexistence of the phases, ion concentrations, single ion diffusion, and activity coefficients. Generalized mathematical interpretation which reduces potential stability of the REF-Br electrodes to the fundamental Gibbs' Phase Rule and Eº set by Ag+/Ag redox pair will be provided by the authors in a separate paper.
3g9w | From the technical perspective, though, the system in focus is sufficiently attractive to be of choice in different analytical applications as shown below.
d09o | 6. Calibration of the REF-Br Electrodes in KBr and MX Solutions. A crucial question regarding the conceptual and analytical validity of the REF-Br is their insensitivity toward bromides. Figure 3 shows the potential changes of the five

ex5k | electrodes with REF-Br-photo membranes as well as Br-ISE recorded during calibration with KBr solution. A striking difference provides direct proof of the invention reported.
9d4o | Negligible potential changes were observed for electrodes with REF-Br-nano, REF-Br-QB, and REF-Br-photo reference membranes during up-down-up as well as down-up-down calibrations in KCI solutions with concentration ranging from 1 M up to 10-5 M. As an example, the potential values measured during up-down-up calibration are presented in Table S-3. Similar results were also obtained during calibration in LiCl, NaCl, KBr, KNO3, and CaCl2 solutions. The influence of lipophilic ions was also checked using the representative perchlorate ion. No statistically significant effect was observed between the calibrations performed in chloride and perchlorate salts, see Figures S-3 and S-4.
cjq2 | 7. Redox Sensitivity of the Electrodes with REF-Br Membranes. The presence of elemental silver can induce undesirable redox sensitivity of the REF-Br membranes. Therefore, all the membranes were studied in the calibration using the mixture of K3[Fe(CN)6]/ K[Fe(CN)6] with total concentration 0.01 M but different molar ratios. Before and after redox calibration, additional measurements in 2 M KBr were performed to check the potential stability. The redox insensitivity was proved for all the REF-Br membranes and different substrates, as shown in Table S-4. The redox effect was not observed as well in the solutions saturated with O2, CO2, and Ar (Figure S-5).
5esx | 8. Potential Stability of the REF-Br Electrodes during Prolonged Contact with Deionized Water. For every reference electrode, the test of its behavior in water is most challenging and analytically relevant. For this reason, all the electrodes equipped with REF-Br-nano, REF-Br-QB, or REF- Br-photo reference membranes were tested in deionized water. After a due period of soaking, the potential of the REF-Br electrodes was measured for 10 min versus the commercial silver chloride reference electrode (Metrohm). A very good potential stability was observed, and the potentials measured were practically invariant at least for several hours of contact with water (or even up to a few days for some of the electrodes). The results are summarized in Table S-5.
m5ka | 9. Multisolution Calibration Experiment. To judge the performance of the reference electrodes in real analysis, a multisolution calibration was carried out following the protocol shown by Mousavi et al.15 The potential of the electrodes with REF-Br-nano, REF-Br-QB, and REF-Br-photo reference membranes was measured in several solutions to check the influence of ion concentration, pH and ion mobility. The potential in each solution was recorded for 10 min. After each test, the electrodes were rinsed with deionized water and immersed in the subsequent solution. The exemplary results obtained for electrodes with REF-Br-photo reference mem- branes deposited on Ag substrates and the potential values measured at the end of each 10 min period are shown in Figures 4 and S-6 and collected in Table S-6.
byu8 | 10. Influence of pH: Potential Stability of the Electrodes with REF-Br Reference Membranes during Acid-Base Titration. To check the pH influence on the potential of the reference electrodes, the REF-Br-photo reference membranes and pH-ISE were employed in the titration of 1 mL of 0.1 M NaOH with 0.1 M HCl, Figure 5. As required, both reference membranes are insensitive to pH changes in the course of the titration performed.
76b0 | Figure 4. Multi Solution Protocol carried out for five identical REF electrodes with Br-photo membranes deposited on Ag substrate in the following solutions sequence: (1) 2 M KBr, (2) 3 M KCI, (3) H2O, (4) 0.01 M NaCl, (5) 0.01 M KCI, (6) 0.1 M KCI, (7) 0.01 M HCI, (8) 0.1 M NaCl, (9) 0.1 M NaHCO3, (10) 0.1 M KBr, and (11) 0.001 M KOH. Potential changes were recorded from the moment the electrodes were contacted with indicated solutions.

xnth | 11. Performance of the Microcell with REF-Br Reference and Potassium-Ion Selective Electrodes. In this measurement, a homemade multielectrode platform with a body made of epoxy resin was used. The platform contained five gold wire electrodes (Au 99.99 obtained from Johnson Matthey Company) with a diameter of 0.8 mm. The external diameter of the epoxy body was 8 mm.27-29 All the gold discs were electrochemically covered with silver, and the REF-Br- photo membranes and potassium-selective membranes were deposited by solution cast on selected discs. Negligible potential changes were recorded for both electrodes with REF-Br-photo membranes used and close to theoretical potential changes were recorded for K-ISE, Figure S-7. These results indicate that employing the reference electrodes described here for designing a complete multielectrode microcell is feasible. Moreover, the junctionless REF-Br reference electrode is used in two roles as the external reference electrode and the internal solid-contact of the ion- selective electrode. Interestingly, a similar dual role has been reported by the authors before.30 However, in that case, the same conducting polymer film was employed either as the solid contact or as the electroactive membrane of an ion-selective electrode.
vafm | CONCLUSIONS
2zmw | A simple procedure for obtaining analytical quality solid-state reference electrodes by a solution cast method is shown. It is made possible by applying a cocktail containing the mixture of KBr, AgBr, and Ag nanoparticles suspended in PVC/DOS/ THE solution and drop casting of the cocktail on Ag substrates. The soaking in 2 M KBr for approximately several hundred

This potential is in the range of -157 ± 2 mV versus silver chloride electrode, which indicates that the operation mechanism is similar to that of the silver bromide reference electrode, but not the same owing to the role played by the composite heterogeneous membrane. Carefully designed tests to check the performance of the reference electrodes proved the insensitivity of the REF-Br electrodes to repeated and challenging changes in the solution composition, pH, concentration, mobility, and lipophilicity of ions, as well as the presence of redox species. Electrodes of this type possess comparable properties to high-quality commer- cially available reference electrodes. Additionally, as all-solid- state electrodes, they can be fabricated in miniaturized form and thus be applied when designing miniaturized multielectrode platforms and probes.
