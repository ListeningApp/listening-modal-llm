You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

rut3 | Norepinephrine, epinephrine, phenylephrine, and dopamine are potent vasopressors and have compa- rable effects in increasing MAP.28,40 However, phen- ylephrine's exclusive a -AR agonist activity renders it unable to improve cardiac output and therefore should be avoided as a first-line agent for hemodynamic support in CS. Unlike phenylephrine, norepinephrine, epinephrine, dobutamine, and dopamine (to a lesser extent) all augment cardiac output through stimulation of the myocyte ß,-AR. However, in contrast with dobu- tamine, dopamine, and epinephrine, norepinephrine has the capacity to improve cardiac output, without significantly increasing heart rate, and therefore may limit increases in myocardial oxygen consumption and potentially attenuate vasoactive medication related myocardial ischemia and injury.31,41,42
m3cp | Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors
mq4s | PDE3 is an abundant enzyme in many tissues, includ- ing in cardiac myocytes and vascular smooth muscle. 43 PDE3's biological actions include the hydrolysis of CAMP.43 Therefore, inhibition of PDE3 through agents such as milrinone leads to increased cytosolic CAMP levels. Within cardiac tissue, elevated cAMP levels lead to increased inotropy, while vasodilation occurs within blood vessels. These effects serve to augment cardiac output, reduce afterload, and reduce systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance.44 The administration of milrinone, however, should be performed with caution in patients with severe renal impairment, as it is subject to renal elimination and runs the risk of toxic accumula- tion in this setting.
95el | Calcium Sensitizers
a0a5 | Calcium sensitizers are a relatively recently developed novel class of inodilators.45,46 Levosimendan, a rou- tinely used calcium sensitizer (not routinely available in the United States), has both peripheral vasodilatory ef- fects and enhances myocardial contractility, mediated through vascular smooth muscle potassium channel binding and cardiac myofilament calcium sensitization by calcium-dependent troponin C binding, respectively. Levosimendan has similar hemodynamic effects to that of the PDE3 inhibitor milrinone and interestingly has been shown to have significant PDE3 inhibiting actions as well.46 Furthermore, levosimendan has an active metabolite with a half-life of >80 hours, allowing the hemodynamic effects to persist following completion of the initial infusion.
gocl | Arginine Vasopressin Antagonists
ob1z | Arginine vasopressin (vasopressin), an endogenous nonapeptide hormone, exerts its cardiovascular effects through the activation of G-protein coupled receptors V1a (in smooth muscle) and V2 (in the renal collecting tu- bules) Activation of the Via receptor on vascular smooth muscle causes increased cytosolic Ca2+ and resulting vasoconstriction, and the V2 receptor activation leads to water retention via the distal convoluted tubule.47
m4cb | The use of vasopressin in the management of CS is principally mediated through a dose-dependent in- crease in systemic vascular resistance. It has a limited impact on other hemodynamic parameters including cardiac output and pulmonary capillary wedge pres- sure.48 Vasopressin may also have pleotropic effects that can ameliorate the underlying causes of the systemic in- flammatory response syndrome mediated vasoplegia by

2gnm | Guanylate Cyclase and Nitric Oxide Synthase Inhibitors
emgw | Methylene blue is a repurposed agent, previously used in the treatment of methemoglobinemia, but has re- cently generated interest for use in refractory vaso- plegic shock.52 In the setting of CS-related systemic inflammatory response syndrome, methylene blue's therapeutic effects are exerted through the inhibition of nitric oxide mediated cGMP production, resulting in increased smooth muscle vasoconstriction. Methylene blue should be used with caution in patients treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors as it may precipitate a serotonin syndrome and also in patients with known glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase de- ficiency due to the risk of developing hemolytic anemia.

xd3m | Mediated through the stimulatory (Gs) component of the ß,-adrenergic receptor, activation of the adenyl cyclase pathway occurs with a resulting increase in cAMP (cyclic adenosine monophosphate) and subsequent increased intracellular calcium cycling. The altered calcium handling results in a positive chronotropic response, increased myocardial contractility, and lusitropy.

Despite limited high-quality data, French, German, Austrian, and the European Society Cardiology guidelines addressing CS management endorse the use of norepinephrine or dobutamine as the first-line vasoactive medications in CS.16,19,57,58 In the United States, current guidelines re- main less definitive. The American Heart Association's
wkbn | Vasoactive Medications in Cardiogenic Shock
ftfg | Heart Failure guidelines do not provide clear recom- mended first-line vasoactive medication, suggesting clinicians use agents that are readily available, easy to administer, and they are familiar.59 Furthermore, the American Heart Association's Scientific Statements on the contemporary management of CS recommends the use of dopamine or norepinephrine as first-line treatments, whereas the recently published guideline for the invasive management of AMI-CS suggests nor- epinephrine be used to support blood pressure in the initial stabilization period, unless further chronotropic support is required.1,60 These recommendations are summarized in Figure 3.
7xi5 | Stimulation of the a,-adrenergic or vasopressin-1 receptors causes activation of the Gq (G-protein) subunit, resulting in downstream stimulation of the phospholipase C signaling pathway. Phospholipase C in turn activates inositol 1, 4, 5-triphosphate (IP3) leading to Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), resulting in vasoconstriction. Conversely, ß2-receptor stimulation activates the inhibitory G-protein (Gi) subunit causing vasodilatation through increased cAMP (cyclic adenosine monophosphase) activation and resulting phospholamban-mediated Ca2+ uptake into the SR. Similarly, activation of the ATP-sensitive potassium channel causes potassium influx that hyperpolarizes voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels, reducing intracellular Ca2+ and vasomotor tone. AMP indicates adenosine monophosphate; DAG, diacylglycerol; PDE3, phosphodiesterase 3; and PLB, phospholamban.
