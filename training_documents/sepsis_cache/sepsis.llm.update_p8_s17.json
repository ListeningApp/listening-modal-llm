        "content": "hd35 | The risk of hypothermia and the survival benefit of fever in patients with sepsis are well described. A meta-analysis of observational studies cited a pooled estimate of a forty-seven percent mortality in hypothermic patients with sepsis versus twenty-two percent mortality in those with fever. While the control group mortality in our trial was high, it tracks closely with the mortality observed in prior cohorts of afebrile critically ill sepsis patients. Perhaps more compelling, participants allocated to therapeutic hyperthermia experienced a mortality that was more closely aligned with expected mortality in febrile sepsis patients. Studies of antipyretic therapy in sepsis have demonstrated little benefit. A single trial of external cooling in febrile sepsis patients showed reduced vasopressor doses and lower early mortality in febrile patients cooled to normothermia, but these findings were not replicated in a subsequent randomized trial. The inflammatory cascade, cytokine expression, and transcription factors in febrile sepsis patients are likely different from afebrile sepsis patients, and having experienced fever may confer benefit to immunocompetent sepsis patients that cannot be undone with cooling.\n2zpk | The mechanism through which therapeutic hyperthermia may have affected clinical outcomes in this study is unclear. Previous data have demonstrated that, compared to afebrile patients with sepsis, febrile patients had a greater increase in monocyte HLA-DR early after sepsis diagnosis, suggesting a lower\nepu7 | prevalence of sepsis-induced immunosuppression in patients with fever. Fever and therapeutic hyperthermia, although, are fundamentally different conditions, and the relationship between fever and HLA-DR expression may be mediated via the inflammatory cascade involved in fever production rather than by heat itself. Notably, the survival curves in our study diverged around day ten, which indicates the effect of warming may be late. Given the breadth of immune changes caused by hyperthermia in animal and in vitro studies, immune-related mechanisms may have played in a role in the clinical outcomes seen in this study, despite our negative immune findings. Alternatively, therapeutic hyperthermia may benefit septic patients through nonimmune mechanisms, such as direct effects on microbial clearance, augmentation of antibiotic activity, or temperature-dependent changes in blood flow. Regardless, this is the first article that has supported the hypothesis that temperature plays a causal role in survival from life-threatening infection.\n7od1 | Another interesting observation in this trial was that forced-air warming alone could effectively warm patients in a short time, even above thirty-seven degrees Celsius. This finding suggests that the absence of fever was not an adaptive process associated with a change in set point. Rather, insufficient cytokine response or mitochondrial dysfunction may have contributed to hypothermia, and when adequate heat was applied, substantive temperature elevations could be realized.\n0bqy | Our observation should be confirmed in a multicenter clinical trial powered for clinical outcomes. That trial should better elucidate the most effective temperature target, duration of treatment, and mechanism of effect to fully understand how temperature management might be used in clinical practice. Better understanding the impact of temperature on sepsis physiology and the heterogeneity of treatment effects will be critical to defining the clinical application of sepsis warming.\nb780 | This trial has several limitations. First, temperature augmentation was modest, with over twenty-five percent of our warmed participants not achieving febrile-range hyperthermia. Second, we used a warming technique that was limited in its ability to achieve very high temperatures. Future trials targeting higher temperatures may need to use technology able to transfer more heat. Third, our control group mortality was very high. Although prior studies of hypothermia in sepsis have\nccmb | observed similarly high mortality, our inclusion criteria intentionally selected a group of participants with high predicted mortality. Fourth, our primary outcome could not be measured in one participant who died or in any patients were immune suppressed. These eligibility criteria may limit generalizability if hyperthermia were ultimately found to be effective. Finally, our small sample size also makes type one error more likely, so future larger multicenter trials should be conducted to ensure balance on important covariates.\nma93 | In conclusion, induced hyperthermia did not improve early markers of immune function, but in our pilot randomized trial warming was associated with lower mortality. The pathway responsible for our findings is unclear. Future work should seek to confirm our clinical findings in an adequately powered multicenter clinical trial and to better understand mechanistic changes in sepsis physiology associated with temperature modulation.",
