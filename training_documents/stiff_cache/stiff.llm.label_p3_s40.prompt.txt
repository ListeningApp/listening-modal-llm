You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

3g9w | It has generally been recognized that the shear modulus of sand can be expressed by means of an empirical equation as a function of the void ratio, the confining pressure, and strain levels (Hardin and Richart 1963; Iwasaki and Tatsuoka 1977; Jamiolkowski et al. 1994a). For example, Iwasaki and Tat- suoka indicated that the shear modulus of clean sands obtained from resonant column and cyclic torsional tests can be ex- pressed by
d09o | <LATEX>G _ { c q } = K \left( \gamma \right) F \left( e \right) p ^ { \prime n \left( \gamma \right) }</LATEX> (1)
ylhz | where <LATEX>G _ { e q } = \mathrm { e q u i v a l e n }</LATEX> shear modulus; <LATEX>K \left( \gamma \right) = \mathrm { m a t e r i a l }</LATEX> con- stant that depends on shear strain level; <LATEX>F \left( e \right) = \mathrm { v o i d }</LATEX> ratio func- tion; <LATEX>p ^ { \prime } = m e a n</LATEX> effective stress; and <LATEX>n \left( \gamma \right) = \mathrm { e m p i r i c a }</LATEX> exponent that depends on shear strain level.
a3td | According to Hardin and Blandford (1989), it is also pos- sible to express the dependence of the small strain shear mod- ulus <LATEX>G _ { 0 }</LATEX> on the current state of a soil by means of the following relationship:
ex5k | <LATEX>G _ { 0 } = S _ { i j } F \left( e \right) \left( O C R \right) ^ { k } p _ { a } ^ { \left( 1 - n _ { i } - n _ { j } \right) } \sigma _ { i } ^ { \prime n _ { i } } \sigma _ { i } ^ { \prime n _ { j } }</LATEX> (2)
9d4o | where Sij = nondimensional material constant of given soil that also reflects its fabric; <LATEX>k = \mathrm { e m p i r }</LATEX> exponent that depends on plasticity index (PI) of soil; <LATEX>\sigma _ { i }</LATEX> and <LATEX>\sigma _ { j } ^ { \prime } = \mathrm { e f f e c t i v e }</LATEX> principal stresses acting on plane in which <LATEX>G _ { 0 }</LATEX> is measured; <LATEX>n ;</LATEX> and <LATEX>n _ { i } =</LATEX> empirical exponents; and <LATEX>p _ { a } =</LATEX> stress.
cjq2 | Moreover, Hardin and Blandford suggested that the Young's modulus for elastic compressive strain increments in a certain direction is a unique function of the normal stress in that di- rection. Lo Presti et al. (1995) and Hoque and Tatsuoka (1998) reported similar results for triaxial tests performed on clay and sand.
5esx | As mentioned before, it was indicated that the secant Young's modulus depends on the stress ratio and the stress history under consolidation. Moreover its effects were differ- ent from sand to sand. Thus, to clarify the effects of the con- fining pressure, the stress ratio at consolidation (i.e., isotropic and <LATEX>K _ { 0 }</LATEX> consolidation) and the overconsolidation history on the secant Young's modulus <LATEX>E _ { \mathrm { s c } }</LATEX> under wide strain levels (0.001 to 1%), an empirical study was performed on triaxial com- pression test results using the following equations:

The strain level dependency of the <LATEX>n</LATEX> n-value of Toyoura sand is similar to that of Ticino sand. The n-values at small strain levels of Toyoura and Ticino sands are almost equal to 0.5, and those increase gradually with the increase in the strain levels. On the other hand, in the case of Quiou sand, the n-value increases at lower strain levels than other sands, and for <LATEX>\varepsilon _ { a } > 0 . 0 5 \%</LATEX> it decreases with an increase in the strain levels. It would seem that this is the effect of the high crushability of Quiou sand. Fig. 8

It has been found that the stress de- pendency of Quiou sand is larger than that of Toyoura and Ticino sands. In particular, the friction angle of Quiou sand decreases rapidly with an increase in the confining pressure. This is because the crushability of Quiou sand is higher than that of other sands.
