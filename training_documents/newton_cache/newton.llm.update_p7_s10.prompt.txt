You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

q0se | An advantage of the original TMP method of Bertsekas (1982) is that we get fast local convergence, a property that is shared by many Newton-type methods. We now show that our algorithm, in a slightly modified form, also exhibits this property. The basis for the local convergence is the fact that, under certain conditions, projected gradient algorithms are capable of identifying the true set of active constraints in a finite number of iterations. This result was first establish for projected gradient with bound constraints in Bertsekas (1976) but has been extended to a variety of constraints (Burke & More, 1988; Burke, 1990; Wright, 1993; Sun et al., 2019). In the case of two-metric projection, once the active set is identified, the combined step reduces to an
tz7u | unconstrained Newton step in the inactive set.
jszk | For the analysis, we consider a "local phase" variant of Algorithm 1. Specifically, we maintain flexibility in defining the outer and inner termination conditions and tolerances, eliminate the strongly positive curvature validation, and only perform backtracking line search from <LATEX>\alpha _ { 0 } = 1</LATEX> to ensure the step length remains bounded. The pseudo-code for this local phase version is given in Algorithm 4 for completeness. To show that the active set is identified in finite number of iterations, we need non-degeneracy and second-order sufficiency assumptions, which are standard in this context.
egkh | Assumption 3.11. A local minima, <LATEX>X _ { * } ,</LATEX> is non-degenerate if
kbpy | <LATEX>\left[ \mathrm { g } \left( \mathrm { x } _ { * } \right) \right] ^ { i } > 0 ,</LATEX> <LATEX>\forall i \in \mathcal{A} \left( \mathrm { x } _ { * } , 0 \right) .</LATEX> Assumption 3.12. A local minima, <LATEX>\mathrm { X } _ { * } ,</LATEX> satisfies the second- order sufficiency condition if <LATEX>0 < \langle \mathrm { z } , \mathrm { H } \left( \mathrm { x } _ { * } \right) \mathrm { z } \rangle</LATEX> for all <LATEX>\mathrm { z } \neq 0</LATEX> such that <LATEX>\mathrm { z } ^ { i } = 0</LATEX> if
afdp | <LATEX>i \in \mathcal{A} \left( \mathrm { x } _ { * } , 0 \right) .</LATEX> Theorem 3.13 (Active Set Identification). Let <LATEX>f</LATEX> satisfy <LATEX>A s -</LATEX> sumption 3.1 and x+ be a local minima satisfying Assump- tions 3.11 and 3.12. Let <LATEX>\left\{ \mathrm { x } _ { k } \right\}</LATEX> be the sequence of iterates generated by Algorithm 4 with <LATEX>\delta</LATEX> chosen according to (44). There exists <LATEX>\Delta _ { a c r v } > 0</LATEX> such that if <LATEX>\mathrm { x } _ { \bar { k } } \in B \left( \mathrm { x } _ { * } , \Delta _ { a c w } \right) ,</LATEX> then <LATEX>\mathcal{A} \left( \mathrm { x } _ { k } , \delta \right) = \mathcal{A} \left( \mathrm { x } _ { k } , 0 \right) = \mathcal{A} \left( \mathrm { x } _ { * } , 0 \right)</LATEX> all
5jom | <LATEX>k \geq \bar { k } + 1 .</LATEX> We defer the proof to Appendix E. Once the active set is identified, our method reduces to unconstrained Newton- MR on the inactive set. Local convergence is therefore a simple corollary of Theorem 3.13.
fdhb | Corollary 3.14 (Local Convergence). For <LATEX>k \geq \bar { k } + 1</LATEX> (cf. Theorem 3.13), the convergence of Algorithm 4 is driven <LATEX>b y</LATEX> the local properties of the Newton-MR portion of the step.
o1k9 | Remark 3.15. The local convergence of Newton-MR is sim- ilar to that of other inexact Newton methods. Suppose that we use a relative residual tolerance, <LATEX>\| \mathrm { r } ^ { \mathcal{I} } \| \leq \eta \| \mathrm { g } ^ { \mathcal{I} } \| ,</LATEX> as the criteria for the MINRES termination. Under Assump- tion 3.12, we know that <LATEX>\mathrm { H } \left( \mathrm { x } _ { * } \right)</LATEX> is positive definite on the inactive indices. Therefore, by applying Nocedal & Wright (2006, Theorem 7.1 and 7.2), we obtain a superlinear conver- gence if we choose <LATEX>\eta = \mathcal{O} \left( 1 \right)</LATEX> and let <LATEX>\mathrm { x } _ { k }</LATEX> be close enough to <LATEX>\mathrm { X } _ { * }</LATEX> *. If we choose <LATEX>\eta = \mathcal{O} \left( \| \mathrm { g } _ { k } \| \right)</LATEX> and the Hessian is Lipschitz then we can improve the rate to quadratic.
s1uu | Remark 3.16. A central ingredient in the projected Newton- CG of Xie & Wright (2023) is the damping of the Hessian in the form of diagonal perturbation (i.e., <LATEX>\mathrm { H } + \epsilon \mathrm { I }</LATEX> for all Newton-CG steps in the inactive set. While this facilitates an optimal global complexity, an unfortunate consequence, at least in theory, is that the algorithm no longer enjoys a guaranteed fast "Newton-type" local convergence rate. In other words, one can at best show linear rates in local regimes.

owaw | We now compare the performance of our method for solving (1) with several alternatives using various convex and non- convex examples. Specifically, we consider Algorithm 2 (denoted by MR), projected Newton-CG (denoted by CG) as in Xie & Wright (2023, Algorithm 1), and projected gradient with line search (denoted by PG) (Beck, 2017). For convex problems, we also include FISTA with line search (Beck & Teboulle, 2009), while for non-convex settings, we compare against the proximal gradient with momentum and fine-tuned constant step size (denoted by PGM) from Lin et al. (2020, Algorithm 4.1). We exclude proximal Newton methods due to the difficulty of solving its subproblems at each iteration. We also do not consider the Newton-CG log barrier method (O'Neill & Wright, 2020) due to poor practical performance observed in Xie & Wright (2023).
