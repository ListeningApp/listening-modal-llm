        "content": "bgre | It became clear that this term has, for most people, the anatomical and aetiological implications that there has been an episode of injury and that this has produced anatomical change. Yet closer examination makes it clear that evidence of anatomical damage is usually absent, that evidence or history of an injuring process is often absent, and that disorder of function is the evidence used for applying the diagnostic label of \"minimal brain damage\".\n57lp | The history of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder\nukth | The Oxford International Study Group of Child Neurology therefore advocated a shift in terminology by replacing the term \"minimal brain damage\" by \"minimal brain dysfunction\". They furthermore recommended that any effort should be undertaken to classify the heterogeneous group of children subsumed under the concept of minimal brain dysfunction into smaller and more homogenous subgroups. Another conference held in nineteen sixty-three by the National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Blindness assigned a national task force to work on terminology and identification of minimal brain dysfunction. The national task force formulated the following official definition:\nkpvt | The term minimal brain dysfunction refers to children of near average, average or above average general intelligence with certain learning or behavioral disabilities ranging from mild to severe, which are associated with deviations of function of the central nervous system. These deviations may manifest themselves by various combinations of impairment in perception, conceptualization, language, memory and control of attention, impulse or motor function.\njie2 | With regard to the etiology of the disorder, the concept of minimal brain dysfunction emphasized neurological factors including prenatal or perinatal \"cerebral hypoxic lesions\" rather than environmental or social factors, such as parents and family, which were proposed by psychoanalysts. Since the definition of minimal brain dysfunction by Clements separates the symptoms \"[impairment in] control of attention, impulse and motor function\" by the conjunction \"and\" from other \"various combinations of impairment\", these three symptoms can be seen as \"the central or defining criterion for minimal brain dysfunction\". The concept of the three main symptoms of inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity characterizing ADHD was therefore established with the definition of minimal brain dysfunction. The assignment of children with minimal brain dysfunction to the normal range of intelligence and therefore the differentiation from \"the brain-damaged mentally subnormal groups\" were important regarding the further conceptualization of ADHD.\nd0ik | Hyperkinetic reaction of childhood (nineteen sixty-eight, second edition of the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders: DSM-Two)\n0x0s | \"The original concept of minimal brain dysfunction was not intended as a final statement on the subject\". Although this concept persisted until the nineteen eighties, its decline already began in the nineteen sixties when severe critiques arose. The presence of neurodevelopmental abnormalities was argued to be non-specific and also common in other psychiatric disorders. It was found that many cases of known brain damage or dysfunction did not show hyperactivity or other symptoms postulated by the concept of minimal brain damage or dysfunction. Minimal brain dysfunction was criticized as too general and heterogeneous and was later to be replaced by multiple more specific and descriptive labels such as \"hyperactivity\", \"learning disability\", \"dyslexia\" or \"language disorders\". The definition of minimal brain dysfunction was \"more speculative than definitive\", had no solid empirical basis, and lacked evidence. Further efforts to define the disorder were therefore based on objective observations of children's deficits, \"rather than on some underlying unobservable etiological mechanism in the brain\". In this context, \"hyperactivity was the most striking item\" as was already stated in nineteen fifty-seven. Their idea of a \"hyperkinetic impulse disorder\" was continued in the nineteen sixties, and the concept of a hyperactivity syndrome was generated. Hyperactivity was recognized to be \"a behavioral syndrome that could arise from organic pathology, but could also occur in its absence. Even so, it would continue to be viewed as the result of some biological difficulty, rather than due solely to environmental causes\". In nineteen sixty-eight, a definition of the concept of hyperactivity was incorporated in the official diagnostic nomenclature, i.e. the second edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. This concept was labeled \"Hyperkinetic Reaction of Childhood\" and defined with two sentences: \"The disorder is characterized by overactivity, restlessness, distractibility, and short attention span, especially in young children; the behavior usually diminishes by adolescence\".\n4exe | Attention deficit disorder: with and without hyperactivity (nineteen eighty, third edition of the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders: DSM-Three)",
