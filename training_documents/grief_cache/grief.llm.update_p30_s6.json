The grieving person may think that the deceased is somehow still in the current area of time and space. This can be especially true during the time shortly after the death. In our study of bereaved children, eighty-one percent of the children felt watched by their dead parent four months after the death, and this experience continued for many of the children, sixty-six percent, two years after the death. Some found this sense of presence comforting, while others did not and were scared by it.\nr8sm | Hallucinations\ncuin | Hallucinations of both the visual type and the auditory type are included in this list of normal behaviors because hallucinations can be a frequent experience of the bereaved. They are usually transient illusory experiences, often occurring within a few weeks following the loss, and generally do not portend a more difficult or complicated mourning experience. Although disconcerting to some, many others find these experiences comforting. With all the interest in mysticism and spirituality, it is interesting to speculate whether these are really hallucinations or possibly some other kind of metaphysical phenomenon.\nn1i7 | One, Attachment, Loss, and the Experience of Grief\n0r5m | There is an obvious interface between thinking and feeling, and the current interest in cognitive psychology and cognitive therapy emphasizes this. Aaron Beck and his colleagues at the University of Pennsylvania found that the experience of depression frequently is triggered by depressive thought patterns. In the bereaved, certain thoughts will pass through the mind such as \"I can't live without her\" or \"I'll never find love again.\" These thoughts can then trigger very intense, but normal, feelings of sadness and or anxiety.\nne2o | Behaviors\nsqxn | There are a number of specific behaviors frequently associated with normal grief reactions. These can range from sleep and appetite disturbances to absentmindedness and social withdrawal. The following behaviors are commonly reported after a loss and usually correct themselves over time.\n6pmo | Sleep Disturbances\n195r | It is not unusual for people who are in the early stages of loss to experience sleep disturbances. These may include difficulty going to sleep or early morning awakening. Sleep disturbances sometimes require medical intervention, but in normal grief they usually correct themselves. In the Harvard Child Bereavement Study, one-fifth of the children showed some sleep disturbance in the first four months after the death of one of their parents. Without any special intervention, this figure dropped to a level not significantly different from that of their nonbereaved matched counterparts one and two years following the death.\nkqmi | After Bill lost his wife suddenly, he would wake up at five o'clock each morning filled with intense sadness and review over and over the circumstances surrounding the death and how it might have been prevented, including what he might have done differently. This happened morning after morning and soon caused problems because he could not function well at work. After about six weeks, the disorder began to correct itself, and eventually it disappeared. This is not an unusual experience. However, if sleep disorder persists, it may indicate a more serious depressive disorder, which should be explored. Sleep disorders can sometimes symbolize various fears, including the fear of dreaming, the fear of being in bed alone, and the fear of not awakening. After her husband died, one woman solved the problem posed by her fear of being alone in bed by taking her dog to bed with\ng8rd | Grief Counseling and Grief Therapy\nnns9 | her. The sound of the dog's breathing comforted her, and she continued to do this for almost a year until she was able to sleep alone.\n9uwy | Eating Disturbances\nsrly | Bereaved animals exhibit eating disturbances, which are also very common in human mourning situations. Although appetite disturbances can manifest themselves in terms of both overeating and undereating, undereating is the more frequently described grief behavior. Significant changes in weight may result from changes in eating patterns.\ndl6i | Distracted and Absentminded Behavior\n89ub | The newly bereaved may find themselves acting in an absentminded way or doing things that may ultimately cause them inconvenience or harm. One client was concerned because on three separate occasions she had driven across the city in her car and, after completing her business, had forgotten that she had driven and returned home via public transportation. This behavior occurred following the death of a close friend and eventually corrected itself.\ndhle | Social Withdrawal\n2nib | It is not unusual for people who have sustained a loss to want to withdraw from other people. Again, this is usually a short-lived phenomenon and corrects itself. I saw one young woman shortly after the death of her mother. This single woman was a very sociable person who loved to go to parties. For several months following her mother's death, she declined all invitations because they seemed dissonant to the way she felt in the early experiences of her grief. This may seem obvious and appropriate to the reader, but this woman saw her withdrawal as abnormal. Some people withdraw from friends perceived as oversolicitous. \"My friends tried so hard that I wanted to avoid them. How many times can you hear, 'I'm sorry?'\" Social withdrawal can also include a loss of interest in the outside world, such as not reading newspapers or watching television. Bereaved children who have lost a parent to death can also experience social withdrawal in the early months after the death.\nnaev | Dreams of the Deceased\n7h0h | It's very common to dream of the dead person, both normal kinds of dreams and distressing dreams or nightmares. Often these dreams serve a number of purposes and may give some diagnostic clues as to where the person is in the whole course of mourning.\na64c | For example, for several years after the death of her mother, Esther suffered from intense guilt over circumstances related to the death. This guilt was manifested in low self-esteem and personal recrimination and was associated with considerable anxiety. During one of her daily visits to her mother in the hospital, Esther had left the bedside for coffee and a bite of food. While she was out, her mother died.\ngi7n | Esther was filled with remorse, and although we used the usual reality-testing techniques in therapy, the guilt still persisted. While in therapy, she had a dream about her mother. In this dream, she saw herself trying to assist her mother to walk down a slippery pathway so she would not fall. But her mother fell, and nothing Esther could do in the dream would save her. It was impossible. This dream was a significant turning point in her therapy because she allowed herself to see that nothing she could have done would have kept her mother from dying. This important insight gave her permission to shed the guilt that she had been carrying for several years. Some ways to utilize dreams in grief counseling and grief therapy are presented in Chapter Six.\n3pn1 | Avoiding Reminders of the Deceased\nwjuz | Some people will avoid places or things that trigger painful feelings of grief. They might avoid the place where the deceased died, the cemetery, or objects that remind them of their lost loved one. One middle-aged woman came for grief counseling when her husband died after a series of coronary attacks, leaving her with two children. For a period of time she put all pictures of her husband away in the closet, along with other things that reminded her of him. This obviously was only a short-term solution, and as she moved toward a better adaptation of her grief, she was able to bring out the items that she wanted to live with and display his picture on the piano.\n```",
