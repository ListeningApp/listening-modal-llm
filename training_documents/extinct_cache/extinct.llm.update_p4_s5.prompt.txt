You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

8p6h | Thirdly, many positions will argue - in different ways - that there is a moral difference between anthropogenic and non- anthropogenic extinctions. In Holmes Rolston's III words, '[n]atural extinction opens doors, anthropogenic extinction closes them' (2012, 139). Independently from whether Rolston's view on the matter is convincing, some people will intuitively find it morally objectionable that a species in the form of all the individ- uals belonging to that species abruptly disappears due to human actions (such as in Sylvan's thought experiment, see section "The history of the concern about extinction in environmental ethics") and thereby also ending an evolutionary process, instead of taking issue with natural evolutionary processes in themselves. This distinction not only assumes that anthropogenic and non- anthropogenic extinctions are conceptually different (Aitken, 1998), but usually also relies on the judgement that human-caused extinctions are morally more problematic than non- anthropogenic extinctions. So, for many authors it is relevant to know whether human causation is at play for the ethical assess- ment of the extinction in question (for epistemic barriers to assessing this causation, see Tanswell, 2022) and that, in turn, is closely related to judgements about moral responsibility (Oksanen, 2007). Contrasting views consider all species extinc- tions to be similarly morally problematic (i.e. similar 'badness') and thereby downplay the moral relevance of anthropogenic causation by adding 'wrongness' (Powell, 2011).
pmgl | The fourth conceptual distinction needs to be made between mass extinctions and non-mass extinctions, with mass extinctions differing from an ordinary extinction event in several ways (see
90no | Bendik-Keymer and Haufe, 2016). Because of these differences, evaluative judgements about the current 'sixth mass extinction' event on earth seem to be often based on the intuition that mass extinctions are morally more problematic than single extinction events. For example, consider how different terms such as 'envir- onmental atrocities' (see Card, 2004) or 'ecocide' (see Baquedano Jer, 2019) can be potentially linked to extinction. While many might think that single extinction events added together are as bad as a mass extinction event involving the same number of species lost, some authors argue that a mass extinction is worse - for example due to additionally involving a 'planetary shift' (Sandler, 2021a).
jt0y | Why (or when) might anthropogenic extinctions be morally problematic?
qb7o | Returning to our question from the introduction, conservation biologists Soulé and Wilcox famously claimed that '[d]eath is one thing; an end to birth is something else' (1980, 8). This implies an evaluative judgement about the badness of species extinctions, but what might that mean? In the more recent environmental ethics literature, we can find a variety of reasons given to explain why anthropogenic extinctions might be (or might not be) morally problematic. We will present the main (but not sole) reasons found in this literature focusing on (1) the value of species, (2) harming nonhuman individuals, (3) the value of biodiversity and (4) duties to future (human and nonhuman) generations. In the last part of this section, we will also turn to (5) instances where extinctions might even be morally desirable.
oae5 | Involving loss of value due to the loss of species
s0fl | Because species extinctions involve the loss of species, the most obvious place to start is to think about whether this loss is in itself problematic (see Passmore, 1974). A common argumentative route in this regard is to argue that species are valuable and, thus, their extinction involves a loss of something that has been important to someone. For example, certain species might be instrumentally valuable because they are useful for human purposes (see section "Leading to the loss of valuable biological variety"). How- ever, species might also be valuable independently from their actual or potential use value. That is, in contrast they might have intrinsic value as entities that we value in themselves.3 Let us briefly intro- duce three (non-exhaustive) versions of this position (for further examples, see Callicott, 1986 [for a critique, see Lo, 2001]; Gorke, 2003; for a more general critical analysis of holistic accounts of species value, see Agar, 2001).
43ia | For one, authors such as Rolston have argued that species - not understood as classes but as 'living historical forms' (Rolston, 1985, 2012) - are objectively intrinsically valuable ('some values are objectively there-discovered, not generated, by the valuer'. 1988,
3g2y | Cambridge Prisms: Extinction
gc7v | 116), which means that with each species that disappears, we lose something of value even if we fail to recognise this loss. In his words,
wqfv | [t]he species defends a particular form of life, pursuing a pathway through the world, resisting death (extinction), by regeneration maintaining a normative identity over time. It is as logical to say that the individual is the species' way of propagating itself as to say that the embryo or egg is the individual's way of propagating itself. The value resides in the dynamic form; the individual inherits this, exemplifies it, and passes it on (1994, 21).
j30a | However, only anthropogenic extinctions are subject to moral evaluation (a duty to avoid extinctions) in Rolston's account. He relies for this purpose on the analogy between 'natural death' (i.e. a natural extinction) and 'murder' (an anthropogenic extinction), which leads him to assess each anthropogenic extinction as a 'superkilling' (Rolston, 1995). That is, on Rolston's account the metaphor of a superkilling illustrates the badness of extinctions by putting an end to an evolutionary 'story' and precluding its future evolutionary possibilities. Other authors such as Lawrence E. Johnson have spelled out similar ideas, but with less emphasis on evolution and rather in terms of the species' interests and their resulting moral standing (see Johnson, 1991).
7bdk | Criticism of accounts such as Rolston's or Johnson's position, in turn, has been aimed at different aspects of their theories. Two primary areas of debate stand out. Firstly, the plausibility of the underlying theory of objective intrinsic value in Rolston's account is a matter of debate (for a critique, see Elliot, 1980; Callicott, 1992). Against the background that intrinsic values were intensely dis- cussed in the field of environmental ethics at the time when Rolston published his account (see O'Neill, 1992), it should be noted that other authors such as Callicott (1984, 1986) defended alternative value accounts relying on subjective values or human sentiments as the basis of a non-anthropocentric environmental ethic. Secondly, Johnson's position relies on the idea that species can be considered to be akin to living beings (i.e. it relies on a specific species concept - as a living entity - that has been widely criticised not only by individualist perspectives but also by other holistic accounts; see Smith, 2016) and, thus, also be morally considerable in the same way. However, whether that analogy is convincing and whether species have morally relevant interests are also a matter of debate (for a critique, see Sandler and Crane, 2006; Sandler, 2012). Con- sequently, in the more recent literature other arguments in favour of the moral value of species that are not based on such an understanding of species are more widespread.
