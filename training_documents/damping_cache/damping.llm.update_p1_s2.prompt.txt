You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).

Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

p2n3 | Research Article On a Nonlocal Damping Model in Ferromagnetism
ohh7 | We consider a mathematical model describing nonlocal damping in magnetization dynamics. The model consists of a modified form of the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation for the evolution of the magnetization vector in a rigid ferromagnet. We give a global existence result and characterize the long time behaviour of the obtained solutions. The sensitivity of the model with respect to large and small nonlocal damping parameters is also discussed.
vbni | 1. Introduction and Preliminary Results
dgcw | In this work, we are dealing with a mathematical model aris- ing in the theory of magnetization dynamics with nonlocal damping. We will consider the model proposed by Nembach et al. [1]. It is given by a modified LLG equation. The modifi- cation lies in the presence of a second-order space derivative of magnetization in the effective field. To describe the model equations, we consider §2 c R3 a bounded and regular open set of R3. The generic point of R3 is denoted by x. We assume that a ferromagnetic material occupies the domain .2.
gvwz | In what follows, S2 represents the unit sphere of R3. The magnetization field of the ferromagnetic material which belongs to S2 almost everywhere is denoted by M(t, x). Its evolution is governed by the following modified LLG equation (see [1, 2]):
sk5m | 1 + x 2 1 (}}M -«M×0,M) =- M×× (M)
qws8 | (1)
877u | in Q=(0,T) × .2,
rzhj | subject to initial conditions
bfax | M (0, x) = Mo (x) in £2 (2)
f2y8 | and boundary conditions
o7qm | M ×(DO,M + {0}}{M) =0 on (0,T) xa£2, (3)
d52l | where the symbol x denotes the vector cross product in R3. The positive constant « represents the damping parameter. The effective magnetic field I depends on M and is given by
qlbb | H (M) = DAM + (A), M + + (M) + H dem (M) . (4)
nhsg | The first term on the right-hand side of (4) is called the exchange magnetic field, where the positive constant D is the exchange coefficient and the term parameterized by the pos- itive constant { describes nonlocal damping in ferromagnets. The {-term was introduced in [2]; see also [1]. The third term is the bulk anisotropy field (which generally is taken as linear with respect to M), and I dem is the demagnetizing field, satisfying in (0, T) x R3 the stray field equation
hy0l | div (I dem + M) = 0, curl I dem = 0,
4jmz | (5)
b7cq | where M is the extension by 0 of M outside the magnetic domain Q2.
0b39 | Notice that, for the sake of simplicity, the bulk uniaxial anisotropy field, generally taken as linear in M, and the magnetostatic field which satisfy the stray field equation are
qecd | not considered since they only induce more computations and have no mathematical influence on the results we obtain.
1o7p | We define the energy
cp13 | <LATEX>\mathscr{C} \left( t \right) = D \int _ { \Omega } | \nabla M | ^ { 2 } d x .</LATEX> (6)
bgre | The following energy estimate holds.
57lp | Lemma 1. If <LATEX>M</LATEX> is a solution of problem (1), then it satisfies, at least formally, the energy estimate
ukth | <LATEX>\frac { d } { d t } 8 \left( t \right) + 2 \zeta \int _ { \Omega } | \nabla \partial _ { t } M | ^ { 2 } d x + \frac { 2 \alpha } { 1 + \alpha ^ { 2 } } \int _ { \Omega } | \partial _ { t } M | ^ { 2 } d x</LATEX> <LATEX>= 0 .</LATEX> (7)
kpvt | Proof. The techniques to obtain (7) are analogous to those used, for example, in [3, 4]. We rewrite LLG equation (1) in the following form:
jie2 | <LATEX>\left( \alpha \partial _ { t } M - \left( 1 + \alpha ^ { 2 } \right) \mathscr{H} \right)</LATEX> <LATEX>= \alpha M \times \left( \alpha \partial _ { t } M - \left( 1 + \alpha ^ { 2 } \right) \mathscr{H} \right) - \left( 1 + \alpha ^ { 2 } \right) \mathscr{H} .</LATEX> (8)
d0ik | Multiplying (8) by <LATEX>\left( \alpha \partial _ { t } M - \left( 1 + \alpha ^ { 2 } \right) \mathscr{H} \right)</LATEX> and using the saturation constraint <LATEX>| M | ^ { 2 } = 1</LATEX> almost everywhere yields to
0x0s | <LATEX>\frac { \alpha } { 1 + \alpha ^ { 2 } } | \partial _ { t } M | ^ { 2 } = \mathscr{X} \cdot \partial _ { t } M .</LATEX> (9)
4exe | Integrating (9) on <LATEX>\Omega ,</LATEX> the right-hand side of (9) becomes
0myz | (10)
xh3i | <LATEX>\int _ { \Omega } \mathscr{H} \cdot \partial _ { t } M d x = - D \int _ { \Omega } \partial _ { t } M \partial _ { t } \partial _ { t } M d x</LATEX> <LATEX>- \zeta \int _ { \Omega } \partial _ { i } \partial _ { t } M \partial _ { i } \partial _ { t } M d x</LATEX> <LATEX>+ \int _ { \partial \Omega } \left( D \partial _ { y } M + \zeta \partial _ { y } \partial _ { t } M \right) \partial _ { t } M d \sigma ,</LATEX> where we have used the summation convention that repeated indices are summed over and <LATEX>\partial _ { i }</LATEX> denotes the derivative with respect to space variable <LATEX>x</LATEX> ;. Converting the two last terms of the right-hand side of (10) allows us to get
