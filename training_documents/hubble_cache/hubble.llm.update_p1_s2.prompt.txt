You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

k78w | Observational constraints on Hubble constant and deceleration parameter in power-law cosmology
g9du | ABSTRACT
f682 | In this paper, we show that the expansion history of the Universe in power-law cos- mology essentially depends on two crucial parameters, namely the Hubble constant H0 and deceleration parameter q. We find the constraints on these parameters from the latest H (z) and SNe Ia data. At lo level the constraints from H (z) data are ob- tained as q = - 0.18+0.12 -0.12 and Ho = 68.43+2.84 -2.80 km s-1 Mpc-1 while the constraints from the SNe Ia data read as q = - 0.38+0.05 3-0.05 and Ho = 69.18+0.55 -0.54 km s-1 Mpc-1. We also perform the joint test using H (z) and SNe Ia data, which yields the constraints q = - 0.34-0.05 and Ho = 68.93+0.531 -0.52 km s-1 Mpc-1. The estimates of Ho are found to be in close agreement with some recent probes carried out in the literature. The anal- ysis reveals that the observational data successfully describe the cosmic acceleration within the framework of power-law cosmology. We find that the power-law cosmology accommodates well the H(z) and SNe Ia data. We also test the power-law cosmol- ogy using the primordial nucleosynthesis, which yields the constraints q > 0.72 and Ho ≤ 41.49 km s-1 Mpc-1. These constraints are found to be inconsistent with the ones derived from the H(z) and SNe Ia data. We carry out the statefinder analysis, and find that the power-law cosmological models approach the standard ACDM model as q -> -1. Finally, we conclude that despite having several good features power-law cosmology is not a complete package for the cosmological purposes.
li1k | 1 INTRODUCTION
pbea | Power-law cosmology finds a reasonable place in the litera- ture to address some common problems (e.g., age problem, flatness problem, horizon problem etc.) associated with the Standard Cold Dark Matter (SCDM) model based on Big Bang theory. In such a cosmology, the cosmological evolu- tion is described by the scale factor a(t) o to, where a is a constant. The viability of the model with a > 1 has been explored in a series of articles in different contexts (Lohiya & Sethi 1999; Batra et al. 1999, 2000; Gehlaut et al. 2002, 2003; Dev et al. 2002, 2008; Sethi et al. 2005a, 2005b; Zhu et al. 2008). Observational constraints on phantom power- law cosmology are discussed by Kaeonikhom, Gumjudpai & Saridakis (2011). The motivation for such an endeavor is followed by a number of considerations. For instance, power- law cosmological models with a > 1 do not encounter the horizon problem at all (Sethi, Dev & Jain 2005). These mod-
ccpt | els do not witness the flatness problem since the matter den- sity is not constrained by the scale factor. In these models, age of the Universe turns out at least fifty percent greater than the age predicted by the SCDM model. This bridges the gap between the age of the Universe and the age esti- mates of globular clusters and high-z redshift galaxies, and thus the age problem is alleviated. Sethi, Dev & Jain (2005) showed that an open linear coasting cosmological model con- strained with type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) gold sample and ages of old quasars accommodates a very old high-redshift quasar, which the SCDM model fails to do. The linear coast- ing cosmology is found to be consistent with the gravita- tional lensing statistics (Dev et al. 2002) and the primordial nucleosynthesis (Batra et al. 1999, 2000). Kaplinghat et al. (1999) found that the power-law cosmological models which succeed in primordial nucleosythesis are in conflict with the constraints from Hubble expansion rates and SNe Ia magni- tude redshift relations.
0fpw | In any cosmological model, the Hubble constant H0 and deceleration parameter q play an important role is describ-

The former one tells us the expansion rate of the Universe today while the latter one characterizes the accelerating <LATEX>\left( q < 0 \right)</LATEX> or decel- erating <LATEX>\left( q > 0 \right)</LATEX> nature of the Universe. In the recent past, there have been numerous attempts to estimate the value of <LATEX>H _ { 0 } .</LATEX> Freedman et al. (2001) used the Hubble Space Tele- scope (HST) observations of Cepheid variable to estimate a value of <LATEX>H _ { 0 } = 7 2 \pm 8</LATEX> km <LATEX>\mathrm { s } ^ { - 1 } \mathrm { M p c } ^ { - 1 } .</LATEX> An observational determination of the Hubble constant obtained by Suyu et al. (2010) based upon measurements of gravitational lens- ing by using the HST yielded a value of <LATEX>H _ { 0 } = 6 9 . 7 _ { - 5 . 0 } ^ { + 4 . 9 }</LATEX> ] <LATEX>\mathrm { s } ^ { - 1 } \mathrm { M p c } ^ { - 1 } .</LATEX> WMAP seven-year results gave an estimate of <LATEX>H _ { 0 } = 7 1 . 0 \pm 2 . 5 \mathrm { k m } \mathrm { s } ^ { - 1 } \mathrm { M p c } ^ { - 1 }</LATEX> based on WMAP data alone, and an estimate of <LATEX>H _ { 0 } = 7 0 . 4 _ { - 1 . 4 } ^ { + 1 . 3 }</LATEX> km <LATEX>\mathrm { s } ^ { - 1 } \mathrm { M p c } ^ { - 1 }</LATEX> based on WMAP data with Gaussian priors corresponding to earlier estimates from other studies (Jarosik et al. 2011). A recent estimate of the Hubble constant, which used a new infrared camera on the HST to measure the distance and redshift for a collection of astronomical objects, gives a value of <LATEX>H _ { 0 } = 7 3 . 8 \pm 2 . 4 \mathrm { k m } \mathrm { s } ^ { - 1 } \mathrm { M p c } ^ { - 1 }</LATEX> (Riess et al. 2011). An alter- native probe using data from galactic clusters gave a value of <LATEX>H _ { 0 } = 6 7 . 0 \pm 3 . 2 \mathrm { k m } \mathrm { s } ^ { - 1 } \mathrm { M p c } ^ { - 1 }</LATEX> (Beutler et al. 2011).
