You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

ywn2 | Another possible cause for the very high overstrengths observed in some tests is the excessive cyclic hardening of steel due to very large plastic strains. This idea was introduced recently by Ji et al. [14] on the basis of an experiment conducted by Kasai et al. [44] on stocky short steel panels in which hardening continued to very large shear angles. Based on this observation, Ji et al. [14] proposed that the very high overstrengths reported for very short links are related to their high rotation capacities. These links experience large plastic rotations (substantially higher than 0.08 rad) and consequently their webs are subjected to excessive shear strains which may lead to excessive cyclic hardening. A refined FE analysis by Ji et al. [14] on very short links revealed that for a link plastic rotation of the order of 0.15 rad the cyclic hardening effect can increase the shear strength by about 70%.
a63r | The combined effect of the above-mentioned factors should be considered for each link in order to have a reasonable estimate of its overstrength. Nonetheless, reasons behind some of the unusually high overstrengths reported in the literature still remain unclear. For instance, Dusicka et al. [36] observed overstrengths of about 5.0 in their experiments on very short links constructed from low-yield-strength steel (Fy = 100 MPa) without web stiffeners. Such cases require further investigation.
dqvj | Based on the numerical and experimental works of Berman and Bruneau [45-49] the use of built- up box (or tubular) links is also permitted by AISC 341-10 [3]. A comparison between the test results reported by Berman and Bruneau [49] with the numerical data presented by Richards [40] revealed that the overstrength factor of built-up box links is typically higher than that of I-shaped links, by about 11%. It is worth noting that the use of hollow structural sections (HSS) as links is prohibited by AISC 341-10 [3] due to their questionable performance in terms of low cycle fatigue life under large
r17u | strains [50]. In addition, as explained in Berman and Bruneau [47], the longest shear link that can be constructed from a common HSS is about 460 mm, which is rather short and will cause congested details as well as very high rotation demands at the code-specified drift level.
3c47 | 2.2. Link Rotation Demand and Capacity
g345 | The expected plastic mechanisms of EBF systems are depicted in Figure 1. The angle between the link and the beam outside of the link is termed as the total link rotation angle (y) and its inelastic part as the inelastic (or plastic) link rotation angle (Yp). In general, the inelastic rotation capacity of a link, ymax, is defined as the maximum inelastic rotation angle (i.e. excluding the elastic portion which is usually less than 0.01 rad) sustained by the link during a cyclic test, for at least one full cycle of loading, before the shear resisted by the link drops below a predefined limit. This limit can be quantified as 80% of the maximum link shear recorded during the cyclic test (0.8 Vmax), the plastic shear capacity (Vp), or the code-specified nominal shear strength of the link (Vn) [14, 30, 41, 51]. Figure 5 shows an example of using the first definition for determining the inelastic rotation capacity (ypax) of a specimen tested by Okazaki et al. [29].
svhz | Experimental studies have shown that the rotation capacity of links depends significantly upon several factors such as the link length ratio, loading history, compactness and web stiffening. A summary of findings from the experimental studies on horizontal I-shaped links [6, 11, 14, 15, 18-39] is given in Figure 6. The figure includes links with Fy > 200 MPa subjected to various cyclic loading histories. It should be mentioned that a few monotonic tests were also conducted on links [15, 18, 27, 28, 37, 52] which demonstrated rotation capacities between 0.19 ~ 0.42 rad. Short links exhibit higher rotation capacities compared to intermediate and long links. As shown in Figure 6, AISC 341-10 [3] limits the inelastic rotation of short links to 0.08 rad and long links to 0.02 rad. For intermediate links, linear interpolation is utilized. The following issues should be borne in mind when examining the data shown in Figure 6. In a number of tests in which connection yielding or failure was reported (grey triangles in the figure), specifically those located in the range of 1 < p < 2, high rotation capacities in excess of 0.10 rad were observed. It should be noted that in most of these tests the connection inelastic
oaen | rotation also contributed to the total link rotation, and thus, the reported high ymax values are not solely because of the inelastic action of the link. The results denoted by hollow circles indicate tests conducted by Galvez [25] and Ryu [28] and reported by Okazaki and Engelhardt [31], in which the observed rotation capacities fall significantly below the code-specified limit due to the use of a severe loading protocol. On the other hand, most of the ymax values reported for very short links (i.e. p < 1) exceed the AISC limit by a wide margin. These results (particularly the ones reported in [14, 36]) revealed that the rotation capacity of very short links can be substantially higher than that of short links. Note that some of the tested very short links (shown by hollow diamonds) failed prematurely due to the brittle fracture of the link web, which was initiated as a result of the insufficient offset between the stiffener-to-web and the web-to-flange welds, as explained by McDaniel et al. [24]. Considering only the proper test data (grey diamonds in Figure 6), it can be deduced that the current AISC requirements provide a reasonable lower-bound for the inelastic rotation capacity of links with various length ratios.
5u67 | It is difficult to predict the rotation capacity of all links by means of pure numerical simulation. For the case of long and some intermediate links, in which strength degradation is due to local buckling, ymax can be estimated reasonably via nonlinear FE analysis. However, it is troublesome to estimate the rotation capacity of shorter links since strength degradation is generally due to low-cycle fatigue induced fractures, which are not commonly considered in FE simulations. Nonetheless, results of the numerical simulations [13, 51, 53-55] concurred with experimental observations that the inelastic rotation capacity of short links is considerably higher than that of intermediate and long links.
dvms | The inelastic link rotation demand must be estimated at the design stage. The most accurate way of determining this quantity is through inelastic dynamic analysis. Alternatively, a rigid plastic mechanism can be used to estimate the inelastic link rotation angle. In this method the inelastic link rotation angle, Yp, is related to the plastic story drift, Ap, via geometrical relationships [3]. Extensive nonlinear time-history analyses conducted by Koboevic et al. [56, 57] on low-, mid-, and high-rise EBFs further confirmed the appropriateness of assuming such a relationship. However, it was noted by Koboevic et al. [56, 57] and other recent studies [58-60] that determining Ap based on the results of an
qrd3 | elastic analysis using the codified displacement amplification factors (Ca) or the equal-displacement rule may provide unconservative estimates of Yp. This item is further discussed in Section 5.2.
