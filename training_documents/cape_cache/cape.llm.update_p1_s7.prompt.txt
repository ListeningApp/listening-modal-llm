You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).

Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021.

qdn7 | vi. The report submitted by the Special Committee to the Board of Convocation has no cover letter and there is no evidence that members of the Special Committee signed the report.

There are differences in the content of the report submitted by the Special Committee to the Board of Convocation and the petition sent to Management of the University by the Board of convocation. For instance, the report has ten recommendations (pages 3 and 4) but the petition has no recommendation.
wyu0 | X. The petition contains matters that are not mentioned in the report. For instance, the report has no case studies on Prof. Samuel Kyei and Prof Emmanuel Kwesi Abu but the petition has about four pages (page 3 to 6) on the promotions of the two Professors.

9zf9 | 6.0 OPINION OF THE AD-HOC COMMITTEE
clwo | The opinion of the Ad-hoc Committee on the constitution of the Special Committee, the report submitted by the Special Committee and the petition sent to Management of the University based on the findings are as follows:
aki1 | i. The constitution of the Special Committee is unconventional because it should have been done by Convocation. Conventionally, members who serve on Committees of Convocation are nominated and seconded by Members of Convocation.
vf5h | ii. The appointment of the Chairman of Convocation to chair the Special Committee constituted by the Board of Convocation is problematic since the Special Committee was expected to submit its report to him.
l51p | iii. The composition of the Special Committee is unconventional because all the members of the Special Committee are members of the Board of Convocation.
s9zz | iv. The report submitted to the Board of Convocation by the Special Committee without explicit terms of reference is unacceptable.
x97k | V. The report submitted by the Special Committee, which was not signed by the members, is an anomaly because it raises questions about the authenticity of the report.
