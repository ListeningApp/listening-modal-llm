        "content": "l6t9 | A versus I subscript a b s Phi subscript two plot divided by B subscript one\n1ujy | Farquhar and Busch did not estimate quantitatively the extent of the explanation.\nqzor | The modelled B subscript one to B subscript two ratios were lower than the observed B subscript one to B subscript two ratios shown in Table two. Our prediction used measured C subscript I and Phi subscript two as input and took the effect of G subscript M and Gamma superscript star into account, and therefore the effects of varying Phi subscript two and Gamma superscript star divided by C subscript C were already considered in the modelling. This suggests that the plot of the modelled B subscript one to B subscript two ratios versus the Gamma superscript star divided by C subscript C ratios should reflect the combined effect of both varying Phi subscript two and varying Gamma superscript star divided by C subscript C. The intercept of the plot for the modelled B subscript one to B subscript two ratios versus the Gamma superscript star divided by C subscript C ratios was again close to one; but its slope was zero point nine four four (Figure five b), much lower\na0by | than two point five five nine - the slope of the observed B subscript one to B subscript two ratios versus the Gamma superscript star divided by C subscript C ratios (Figure five a). As the intercept remained unaltered, this indicates that the combined contribution of varying Phi subscript two and Gamma superscript star divided by C subscript C to the observed Kok effect can be estimated from slope values, that is, circa thirty-six point nine percent. Therefore, the effect of varying Gamma superscript star divided by C subscript C alone explained circa twenty-five point three percent (thirty-six point nine minus eleven point six percent) of the observed Kok effect across various O subscript two and C O subscript two concentrations and various temperatures.\nu1ky | Quantifying the maximum extent of inhibition of day respiration by light\nhtm9 | Our modelling procedure aimed to quantify the contribution of Phi subscript two and varying Gamma superscript star divided by C subscript C, and therefore, as is the usual case, assumed that R subscript D and F subscript A C T did not vary with irradiance or with measurement O subscript two and C O subscript two conditions. The remaining unexplained contributions (circa sixty-three percent) must be a result of light inhibition of R subscript D and\n8hul | possibly variable F subscript A E T and/or rho subscript two. We are not able to separate the contribution of light inhibition of R subscript four from the effect of variable F subscript A C T and/or rho subscript two if the variation of F subscript A C T and/or rho subscript two with irradiance cannot be ruled out. If we assume that the variation of either F subscript A C T and/or rho subscript two with irradiance is negligible with the limiting light range, as is often assumed in measuring Phi subscript C O two, we can quantify the real inhibition of R subscript D by light by removing the effect of changing Phi subscript two and Gamma superscript star divided by C subscript C, as described in the following. As such, this estimate should be considered as the maximum real inhibition of R subscript one by light.\n87vz | The apparent relative inhibition in case of the Yin method is:\nym66 | Inhibition subscript apparent left parenthesis percent right parenthesis equals R subscript D one measured minus R subscript D two measured divided by R subscript D one measured times one hundred, Equation four. The similar apparent relative inhibition can be proposed for the Kok method. The apparent inhibition was higher according to the Kok method than according to the Yin method (Figure six a), owing to the fact that the Kok method ignores the decrease of Phi subscript two with irradiance. Overall, the Kok method overestimated the apparent inhibition of R by circa eighteen percent, as compared with the Yin method.",
