You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

o2kr | Secure care: more harm than good

1wj6 | M any who overdose on drugs in British Columbia are youth under the age of 19 years,1 and calls for "secure care" legislation have intensified. Secure care legisla- tion would legitimize the detention and forced care of youth who are deemed to be at immediate risk of serious physical or psychological harm and is intended as a last-resort mechanism to protect youth who are engaged in high-risk substance use. In Canada, secure care legislation has been enacted in Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia.2 However, restricting the liberties of youth to pro- tect them from overdose and other drug-associated harms is a flawed approach and may have unintended consequences.
936l | Secure care models vary by province. In some jurisdictions, parents and guardians are permitted to request court-mandated treatment for the youth under their care, whereas other jurisdic- tions restrict mandatory treatment to youth in the criminal jus- tice system. Treatment type and duration also vary by province, but stabilization and "detoxification" are the primary goals of all secure care programs in Canada. In BC, Bill M 202 - 2018: Safe Care Act dictates the process by which youth are apprehended, detained and discharged from safe care facilities, but offers no details on the types of treatment to be provided.
06yq | To advocates of secure care, the proposed legislation is viewed as a tool to help youth in crisis who are resisting engage- ment with health and social services. Youth who are addicted to drugs are believed to lack control over their actions, and parents and guardians often feel responsible to intervene but often do not have the tools to do this. The difficulties of navigating a largely nonexistent system of addiction care for youth mean that parents and caregivers are often unable to connect youth with evidence-based treatments.3 Therefore, it is understandable that many families and caregivers are demanding additional tools to intervene and protect youth from potentially deadly high-risk substance use.
dpv6 | Although secure care may prove effective for select youth with strong supports, the evidence for mandatory treatment is weak. A meta-analysis of research on juvenile drug courts in North America suggested that youth mandated into treatment showed no significant improvements in substance use during or after treatment.4 Evidence from adult populations provides further grounds to oppose secure care. In a systematic review of studies on court-mandated treatment, authors found that forced

r5il | . In response to the ongoing overdose crisis and its effect on young people, British Columbia has been considering following the lead of other provinces and implementing secure care legislation, which would permit the apprehension, detention and forced treatment of youth who are engaged in high-risk substance use.
5gui | Â· Existing evidence suggests that mandatory addiction treatment does not lead to significant improvements in substance use outcomes and can be destabilizing, increasing the risk of subsequent overdose.
82qc | Â· Coercive approaches to substance use risks undermining trust and our ability to connect youth who live with intergenerational, childhood or institutional trauma with the health and social services they need most.
ls7d | Â· Investing in accessible, evidence-driven interventions and building meaningful connections with youth will serve to better protect their health and safety than the belief that legislation can be used to "fix" them.
tzt3 | treatment did not improve outcomes for substance use. Instead, findings showed higher levels of mental duress, homelessness, relapse and overdose among adults after discharge from man- dated treatment.5
t8vv | Although addiction treatment programs are effective for some, it is important to recognize that they can also be destabil- izing and cause harm. For example, it is well documented that rapid withdrawal and abstinence-oriented treatments lower opioid tolerance and, given the high likelihood of posttreatment relapse, increase the risk of nonfatal overdose after treatment.6 Although extrapolating research from adult to youth popula- tions must be done with caution, these findings suggest that forcing youth into abstinence-oriented treatments through secure care approaches may be expected to have unintended, even deadly, consequences.
qvnu | Another concern with secure care is that it fails to acknow- ledge that the youth who use drugs may live with intergenera- tional, childhood or institutional trauma. In a Vancouver cohort of street-involved youth who use drugs, nearly 50% had encountered the child welfare system and over 35% had been involved with the criminal justice system.7,8 For these youth, trust in health and social services has often been severely

5746 | compromised, and coercive approaches risk further undermining our ability to connect youth to the services they need most. This hampers efforts to promote health-seeking behaviours and pre- vent drug-related harms including fatal overdoses. Given the his- torical and ongoing effects of colonization, the use of a secure care approach with Indigenous youth raises further concern. The legacy of colonization has resulted in an overrepresentation of Indigenous youth within the child welfare and criminal justice systems,9 suggesting that Indigenous youth may be particularly vulnerable to secure care measures. The forced care of young Indigenous people who engage in substance use may represent a continuation of colonial policies and state repression of Indigen- ous Peoples.
7toz | Instead of resorting to coercive measures, providing coordin- ated addiction treatment services across a continuum of care would better combat the current overdose crisis and drug- related harms. Other necessary measures include ensuring access to evidence-based interventions that address early deter- minants of health and span from prevention and education to harm reduction services, and from substitution treatment to resi- dential programs. Furthermore, despite success among adults, there is often hesitation to offer certain harm reduction and addiction treatment modalities to youth. For example, substitution treatments, such as methadone and buprenorphine-naloxone, have been shown to reduce the consumption of street-sourced opioids, improve uptake of other treatment interventions and reduce rates of overdose among youth but are often withheld from youth for fear that they encourage substance use and dependence.6,10 Needle exchange and supervised drug consump- tion programs are other evidence-based interventions that are less frequently offered to youth despite known benefits in redu- cing serious drug-related harms.10 Measures to improve utiliza- tion of these types of evidence-based interventions by youth will provide more opportunities to protect the health and well-being of youth who use drugs.
j346 | Although the allure of secure care is understandable, we must acknowledge the gaps within the existing care system for youth addiction and the potential for severe unintended consequences that may result from coercing youth into addiction treatment and care. Until we restructure our institutions and make the necessary investments in early interventions so that all families and youth have the emotional, social and material supports needed to flourish, secure care should not proceed. In the short term, investing in
