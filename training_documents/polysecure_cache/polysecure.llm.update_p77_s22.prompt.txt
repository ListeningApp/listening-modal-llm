You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).

Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

w9xo | THE BROAD STROKES OF BEING POLYSECURE
utyz | Once you are clear that being an attachment figure is what each of you wants, whether in a two-person or multiperson relationship, figuring out how to do this securely is the next step. Partners being a safe haven and a secure base for each other is key for being polysecure.
tquj | Being a Safe Haven For Each Other
oepx | John Bowlby and his contemporaries believed that for a partner to become an at- tachment figure, the relationship would serve as both a safe haven and a secure base.68 The bedrock of being polysecure in our relationships is feeling that we have a safe haven to turn to. This happens when our partners care about our safety, seek to respond to our distress, help us to co-regulate and soothe and are a source of emotional and physical support and comfort. Similarly, when our partners are struggling or in need, we can be a safe haven by being there for them in warm, car- ing and receptive ways. When we can't physically be there for our partners, we do as best we can to support them from a distance until we can be in physical prox- imity.
qt5u | In search of relationship safety, our attachment system is primed to seek the answers to certain questions regarding our partners. Both consciously and uncon- sciously we are looking to know:
a2kn | . If I turn towards you, will you be there for me?
84li | . Will you receive and accept me instead of attack, criticize, dismiss or judge
oh1c | me?
apax | . Will you comfort me?
zc7j | . Will you respond in a way that calms my nervous system?
96pn | . Do I matter to you?
txea | . Do I make a difference in your life?
8oh3 | Can we lean into and rely on each other?
m27u | Interestingly, research consistently shows that people who have safe haven rela- tionships in their life, whether through romantic partnership or through their fam- ily, are more resilient in the face of life stressors and trauma. Attachment research has looked at many different populations including orphans, people who have ex- perienced natural disasters, assault victims, veterans who were in combat, refugees, people who were in New York City during 9/11, people in concentration camps in World War II, as well as people who have had heart attacks or are recov- ering from surgery in the hospital. The research has found that when people in all of these difficult situations have their safe haven attachment figures around them, either during or quickly after the event, they recover faster, experience less physical and emotional pain, and are less likely to have escalating symptoms of PTSD.69
s0b6 | Examples of things that you and your partners can do to be safe havens for each other are:
ihlu | Give emotional support and comfort.
r3zr | . Listen to each other with full attention.
j6ku | . Inquire and share about feelings and needs.
zt0d | . Track what is going on in each other's lives and make sure to follow up and inquire about those things.
ej0q | . Help in practical ways when a partner is tired or sick.
dg44 | . Discuss or debrief events of the day or things that are important to each of you.
lhtj | . Let your partners know how and why they matter to you.
ns07 | Safe Haven Reflection Questions
q8bx | In each of your relationships that are attachment-based or for the relationships that you would like to become more attachment-based, ask yourself:
lftq | . How does this partner already act as a safe haven for me?
hyaf | . In what ways do they show up for me that feel supportive and comforting?
9etn | . How can this partner help me feel even more safe with them?
2bic | . How can this partner help me feel even more supported or comforted by them, in general or in specific situations?
jras | . In what ways can I show up more as a safe haven for this partner?
dwvf | Being a Secure Base for Each Other
ic87 | When safety is established with our attachment figures and we have an internalized felt sense that we can turn towards them and lean on them when needed, we are freed up to securely turn away from them and engage in the world, whether with them by our side or on our own. A secure base provides the platform from which we can move out in the larger world, explore and take risks. This exploration facil- itates our sense of personal competence and healthy autonomy. Similar to how children want to show their parents their latest drawings, tricks, accomplishments or discoveries, as adults we need to share the new things we've learned, the things we've achieved and the things we're excited about. Being and having a secure base in our partnerships means supporting each other's personal growth and explo- ration, independent activities and other relationships, even when these actions re- quire time apart from each other. Secure base partners will not only support our explorations, but will also offer guidance when solicited and lovingly call us on our shit. They function as a compassionate mirror for our blind spots and all the ways we may be fooling ourselves, whether through self-aggrandizement or self- limitation.
bxpw | While being a secure base may appear to be easier or more fun than being a safe haven, do not underestimate how intimately personal and deeply vulnerable it can be for a person to share their visions, hopes, curiosities and dreams. It also re- quires faith to be able to turn away from a partner and then trust that you can safely
4g09 | turn back. In simple terms, I see being a safe haven as serving the role of accepting and being with me as I am, and a secure base as supporting me to grow beyond who I am.
txr8 | Examples of things that you and your partners can do to be secure bases for each other:
rsup | . Encourage each other's personal growth and development.
hk1c | . Support each other's work and/or interests.
na8b | . Listen to each other's hopes, dreams and visions.
a4wk | . Listen when your partners share about their experiences in other relation- ships (assuming that the information shared is appropriate and consensual).
bi02 | . Have conversations about things that are intellectually or emotionally stimu- lating to each other.
yc23 | · Acknowledge each other's capabilities and possibilities for growth.
ki0m | . Compassionately bring light to your partner's limitations and blind spots.
6wrx | . Offer words of encouragement when your partners take on new responsi- bilities, go on dates with others, take a risk or learn something new.
u4q7 | Secure Base Reflection Questions
jd7m | In each of your relationships that are attachment-based, or for the relationships that you would like to become more attachment-based, ask yourself:
sknv | . How is this partner already acting as a secure base for me?
usuw | . What does growth look like for me? Is it usually a shared or a personal expe- rience, or both?
d4hr | . Are there other ways that I want encouragement or support in my individual growth or with my visions and dreams?
ph8j | . How could my partners support me in regard to my other relationships?
bemf | . How could | better support or encourage my partners' dreams or aspirations to grow and develop?
s9l9 | . How could | better show genuine interest or curiosity in things that are important to my partners?
bs07 | . How could I better support my partners in their other relationships?
y6eq | A benefit of nonmonogamy is that you don't have to provide or expect to receive all of this from one partner. Different partners can be more of a safe haven, a secure base or both, offering different facets of each. We all have different strengths and it can be wonderfully satisfying to have some partners that support you in safe haven ways, while others offer more of a secure base.
