You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

l0a3 | Plotting the modelled A against <LATEX>I _ { \mathrm { a b s } }</LATEX> resulted in lower estimates of <LATEX>r _ { \mathrm { d 2 } }</LATEX> than <LATEX>r _ { d 1 }</LATEX> and plotting the modelled A against <LATEX>I _ { \mathrm { a b } }</LATEX> <LATEX>\Phi _ { 2 }</LATEX> also resulted in lower estimates of <LATEX>R _ { \mathrm { D 2 } }</LATEX> than <LATEX>R _ { \mathrm { D 1 } }</LATEX> than their respective estimates using the observed <LATEX>A</LATEX> (results not shown), although a single value of <LATEX>R _ { d }</LATEX> was used for each curve in modelling. This con- firmed the analysis of Farquhar & Busch (2017) that the appar- ent inhibition of <LATEX>R _ { 4 }</LATEX> by light was partly a result of the artefact of changing <LATEX>\Gamma ^ { * } / C _ { c }</LATEX> with irradiance. The real relative inhibition of <LATEX>R _ { \mathrm { d } }</LATEX> by light can be calculated as:
u8nw | <LATEX>\mathrm { I n h i b i t i o n } _ { \mathrm { r e a l } } \left( \% \right)</LATEX> <LATEX>= \frac { \left( R _ { \mathrm { D 1 m e a s u r e d } } - R _ { \mathrm { D 2 m e a u r e d } } \right) - \left( R _ { \mathrm { D 1 m o d e l l e d } } - R _ { \mathrm { D 2 m o d e l l e d } } \right) } { R _ { \mathrm { D 1 m e a s u r e d } } } \times 1 0 0</LATEX> Eqn 5
l2v9 | Compared with the relative apparent inhibition from the Yin method, the relative real inhibition was much lower (Fig. 6b). The results also suggested that after correcting for varying <LATEX>\Gamma ^ { * } / C _ { \mathrm { c } }</LATEX> light inhibition of <LATEX>R _ { \mathrm { d } }</LATEX> only became lower but did not disappear: the real inhibition increased generally with relative amounts of photorespiration (Fig. 7).
afbe | Discussion
78r8 | The 'linear decrease' of <LATEX>R _ { d }</LATEX> with light cannot generate the Kok effect
320g | The Kok effect was initially, and is still often, hypothesized to arise from the suppression of respiration by light (Fig. 1; Sharp et al., 1984; Heskel et al., 2013; Tcherkez et al., 2017a; Way et al., 2019). This hypothesis has received support from studies that have identified several mechanisms for the metabolic down- regulation of respiratory reactions by light, as reviewed by
tp8g | <LATEX>y = x .</LATEX> Tcherkez et al. (2012, 2017b). Gas exchange measurements have shown that <LATEX>R _ { \mathrm { d } } ,</LATEX> relative to <LATEX>R _ { \mathrm { d k } }</LATEX> progressively decreased with increasing <LATEX>I _ { a b s } ,</LATEX> either in a continuously linear manner (Villar et al., 1994) or in a decelerating manner (Brooks & Farquhar, 1985; Villar et al., 1995; Atkin et al., 2000). <LATEX>U s i n g \quad E q n s \quad 1 - 3 , w e</LATEX> assessed the effect of all possible scenarios for the often-said 'pro- gressive' inhibition of respiration by light on the shape of <LATEX>A - I _ { a b s }</LATEX> curves (Fig. 3). Of the six scenarios considered, only the three sce- narios for 'decelerating decrease' of <LATEX>R _ { \mathrm { d } }</LATEX> with irradiance (Fig. 3b-d) can generate the Kok effect, thereby excluding the other three sce- narios that are often considered relevant to the Kok effect. In par- ticular, the scenario of a 'continuously linear decrease' <LATEX>R _ { d }</LATEX> light (Fig. 3a) did not result in a break in the linear <LATEX>A - I _ { a b s }</LATEX> rela- tionship. This is in contrast to the statement of Tcherkez et al. (2017a) in their report for the <LATEX>1 8 ^ { \text { th } }</LATEX> New Phytologist Workshop that 'the widely-accepted (historical) origin of the Kok effect is the inhibition of respiratory metabolism by light (linear decrease of <LATEX>R _ { \mathrm { d } }</LATEX> with light)'.
