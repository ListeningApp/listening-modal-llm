Panel B of Table one provides information on the amount invested, financing rounds, years of operation, and sale price.\nih66 | C. VCs' Ex Ante Cash and Control Rights\nb2e0 | We now turn to describe, for each of the firms in our sample, (one) the VCs' cash-flow rights; (two) the entrepreneurial team's board seats and shareholder-voting rights; and (three) the identity of the CEO at the time of sale.\nko94 | One. VCs' Cash-Flow Rights\nt0qt | Across all fifty firms, VCs' aggregate liquidation preferences at the time of sale are, on average, forty-seven million dollars. In the first round of financing, the liquidation preference usually equals the amount invested (a \"one-x preference\"), while the liquidation preference in subsequent rounds is more likely to be a higher multiple (i.e., two-x or three-x) of the amount invested (Panel C). At sale, aggregate liquidation preferences are on average somewhat greater than the amount invested (Panel B).\nu6xv | When VCs retain their preferred stock rather than converting to common stock, the allocation of the sale proceeds depends on the relationship between liquidation preferences and the sale price. If liquidation preferences exceed the sale price and contractual priority is fully respected, common shareholders get nothing. Liquidation preferences exceed the sale price in thirty-one of the forty-two firms in which VCs exit as preferred shareholders (Panel D). Absent a carrot, common shareholders as a class have little incentive to approve a merger when their equity is underwater. In eight firms, it was in the VCs' interest to convert to common stock rather than maintain their liquidation preferences, meaning that the sale proceeds were allocated pro rata among all common shareholders (the original common shareholders and the converting VCs).\ngdqj | Two. Power of the Entrepreneurial Team\nhy55 | This section describes the extent of the entrepreneurial teams' blocking power-their board seats and corporate-law rights-in our sample firms. The data are summarized in Table two.\ns25x | a. Board Seats\nff1e | Recall that board approval is required for a trade sale. Thus, the entrepreneurial team may be able to impede a sale through its influence on the\n98a3 | CARROTS AND STICKS\n4l1d | board. We divide directors into three categories: (one) VC appointed, (two) common-shareholder appointed, and (three) independent (outside). If a particular outside director had been selected exclusively by either the VCs or the common shareholders, we designate this person as a VC or common-shareholder director, regardless of how contracting documents label the board seat.\nhqyq | Panel A reports the allocation of board seats. At the time of sale, fifty-six point five percent of all directors were appointed by the VCs, and twenty-two point eight percent were appointed by the common shareholders. Panel B shows that the VCs controlled the board in twenty-nine of the fifty firms (fifty-eight percent). In our sample, common shareholders rarely controlled the board at the time of the sale (three of the fifty firms). However, in twenty-one of the fifty firms, the combination of independent directors and common shareholders could have blocked a sale.\nscp1 | b. Shareholder Rights\ntts6 | All our companies were incorporated in either California or Delaware at the time of their sales, consistent with findings that most VC-backed firms incorporate either in their home state or in Delaware. Panel C shows that thirty-five out of fifty firms were incorporated in Delaware at the time of the sale. As we explain below, California law may give the entrepreneurial team somewhat more power vis-Ã -vis VCs through both voting rights and the threat of fiduciary litigation.\nfo5l | (one) Voting rights. California and Delaware provide different voting rights for shareholders. In Delaware, mergers typically need to be approved by only the holders of a majority of all of the firm's outstanding stock, both preferred and common. We find that at the time of sale, VCs almost always have sufficient voting power to dictate the outcome of a shareholder-wide vote. California, on the other hand, requires a separate vote for each class of shareholders. Thus, when the VCs remain preferred shareholders, common shareholders of firms domiciled in California can more easily impede a sale they oppose.\n5fbx | CARROTS AND STICKS\necjk | But it is not that simple. California purports to subject \"quasi-California\" corporations (corporations doing business in California but incorporated elsewhere) to the requirement of separate class votes. While California's legal ability to impose this requirement on firms incorporated elsewhere is contested, many (but not all) Delaware-incorporated companies located in California are advised by lawyers to hold separate class votes. In our sample, all but one Delaware-incorporated firm held a separate class vote for the common shareholders.\n75rv | Thus, as a practical matter, incorporation in California rather than in Delaware may not give common shareholders much more power through voting rights. Nevertheless, common shareholders' ability to impede a transaction is still likely to be somewhat greater in a California-incorporated firm, where a separate class vote is indisputably mandatory.\nlyws | (two) Fiduciary litigation. During the years in which our sample firms were sold, Delaware law appeared to permit a VC-controlled board to make decisions that favor preferred shareholders at the expense of the common shareholders unless the common shareholders could show that the decision was not in the \"best interests of the corporation.\" In contrast, California law generally affords stronger protection to minority shareholders, including common shareholders in firms with VC-controlled boards. Thus, directors of California-domiciled firms may have believed they faced greater risk of liability for harming common shareholders.\nis02 | CARROTS AND STICKS\nn2au | Three. Founders' Position in the Firm\nrn1i | The entrepreneurial team is likely to have a greater incentive to block a trade sale if the founder is still the CEO. First, a founder-CEO is likely to own more common stock than a replacement CEO; everything else equal, he or she will thus face a greater loss of option value if the firm is sold. Second, a founder-CEO may derive greater nonfinancial benefits from the business and thus may have additional incentive to keep the firm independent.\nas9u | The entrepreneurial team may also have greater ability to impede a sale if the founder is still the CEO. A founder-CEO is likely to have substantially more common stock than a hired CEO, giving him more shareholder-blocking power. Compared to a hired CEO, the founder-CEO is also likely to have longer and deeper relationships with other directors and common shareholders. As a result, the founder-CEO is likely to have influence over directors and other common shareholders, increasing the likelihood that directors will resist the trade sale and further increasing the likelihood that common shareholders will vote against the transaction.\nbnmr | To reduce resistance to a trade sale, a firm's VC investors may use their control over the board of directors to replace the CEO before the planned exit. In our fifty-firm sample, twenty-nine of the founders (fifty-eight percent) were replaced as CEOs before the firm was sold. However, as we will discuss shortly, none of these replacements appeared to be made to overcome resistance to a trade sale.\n15p3 | ACTUAL CARROTS AND STICKS IN THE SALE OF VC-BACKED STARTUPS\n```",
