        "content": "0yab | To address face and content validity of the instrument, five occupational therapists who had emerging practice expertise reviewed a draft of the survey and provided feedback on the format and content of individual survey questions. The written survey requested information about the respondents' current occupational therapy practice setting, job title, and employment status. Respondents were asked to identify whether they were providing occupational therapy or occupational therapy-related services in an emerging role or setting. If respondents answered yes, a series of questions followed requesting information about the emerging practice role or setting, services provided, population(s) served, the respondents' educational background, years of professional experience, and factors contributing to the development of the knowledge and skills for practice in the emerging roles or settings. Last, all respondents completing the survey were asked to answer two open-ended questions about the nature of emerging practice and its challenges and rewards. Intentionally, a definition of emerging practice was not provided within the recruitment letter or on the survey instrument to facilitate broad consideration of the research questions.\nw95z | Data Analysis\n0i1k | The survey yielded both qualitative and quantitative data. Quantitative data were analyzed using S P S S version eleven point five software for numerical data, and version six of NUD I S T software was used to analyze qualitative or text data. Narrative responses to the open-ended questions from the survey were coded and analyzed for content and specific themes. Descriptive statistics were computed for the numerical responses obtained from the closed-ended questions included in the survey.\ndqlg | RESULTS\np6pq | All Survey Respondents\nzse6 | One hundred and seventy-four occupational therapists, twenty-four point nine percent of the seven hundred therapists in the sample, returned the survey. The response rate, while low for survey research, was considered adequate for analysis and reporting given the lack of a comparable survey published in the literature. At the time of the survey, one hundred sixty-six, ninety-five point four percent of the respondents reported themselves to be currently employed. Of those currently employed, one hundred thirty-two, seventy-nine point five percent reported their job duties to include the provision of occupational therapy services, one hundred thirty-two, seventy-nine point five percent were employed thirty hours or greater weekly, and thirty-four, twenty point five percent were employed on a part-time basis of less than thirty hours weekly. Table one presents information about the respondents' years of experience, current employment settings, and educational backgrounds. Notably, one hundred one, fifty-eight point four percent of the respondents reported twenty or more years of occupational therapy experience.\np2n3 | The Nature of Emerging Practice\nohh7 | All one hundred seventy-four participants were asked to describe emerging practice in occupational therapy; one hundred sixty-seven, ninety-six point zero percent valid responses were received. Responses were organized into two themes according to the frequency of the responses: (a) the settings and services associated with emerging practice and, (b) the rationale for emerging practice. Frequently, a participant's description of emerging practice fits more than one theme. Consequently, the number of responses tallied for each theme does not correlate directly to the number of valid responses. Table two summarizes the results for the two themes.\nvbni | Theme one: settings and services associated with emerging practice. The greatest number of responses identified nontraditional occupational\ndgcw | therapy services provided in settings other than health care systems, school systems, clinics, and long-term care facilities as emerging practice. Specific examples of nontraditional services included health and wellness promotion, low vision services, or injury prevention programs. Although labeled nontraditional services, participants correlated the services provided with the promotion of occupational performance, the philosophy of occupational therapy, and the Occupational Therapy Practice Framework: Domain and Process.\ngvwz | Respondents also identified those practice settings believed to be more conducive to occupational performance and to achieving independence, such as the home environment, as emerging practice settings. The next most frequent response included community-based services, such as occupational therapy services to the homeless population, programs for persons with mental illness or addictions, day programs for adults with developmental delays, and transitional housing and employment programs, as emerging practice. Sixteen responses explicitly labeled emerging practice as reemerging practice. These respondents related the nature of emerging\nsk5m | practice to services provided at an earlier time in the profession by the profession's founders and by practitioners in the nineteen sixties and nineteen seventies, thereby classifying emerging practice as a new name for a familiar concept. One respondent commented, \"We return to our roots in the settlement house system. Settlement houses were change-making institutions. We are returning to being change makers rather than servants of a consumer society.\" Additional descriptions of emerging practice included the delivery of novel or innovative occupational therapy services in traditional practice settings. Examples offered included a mini-putting green for orthopedic patients and educational programs for home health aides. The theme of research support for emerging practice included the recognition that research evidence is needed to justify emerging practice services and to demonstrate meaningful outcomes that will be reimbursed. Additionally, respondents noted that as academic communities develop emerging practice opportunities, there is a delay in time before the profession as a whole accepts and incorporates the practice strategies.\nqws8 | Theme two: rationale for emerging practice. One rationale for emerging practice was the successful promotion of participation in occupations among individuals, groups, or communities through the development of\n877u | occupational therapy services to underserved or unserved clients. In this process, respondents described the importance of practitioners conducting a needs assessment as a first step in developing a service delivery model for a new population. A practitioner described this concept, \"Therapists do not enter with preconceived notions about what needs to be done, rather they identify needs that emerge as an outgrowth of interactions among what people need and what the environment has to offer.\"\nrzhj | A second rationale for emerging practice related to its perceived significance to the profession. Respondents indicated that emerging practice areas are critical for development despite the inherent challenges to the process of developing and delivering services. However, an alternative view of emerging practice was that of being problematic for the profession. A respondent pointed out:\nbfax | It is difficult, for me, to look out at \"emerging practice\" when \"current practice\" remains nebulous. As an educator, I see students of all ages who are unfamiliar with occupational therapy and its role. If occupational therapy practice in \"emerging practice\" helps identify the role of occupational therapy for all involved parties, let the research begin!\nf2y8 | Equally important was the deliberation about the greater risk to the profession from the development of emerging practice. One participant questioned, \"Are we making a big mistake professionally as we decide to move away from the medical model towards a more social work/social justice model-what will we gain or lose? Immediately and for the long term.\"\no7qm | Rewards and Challenges of Emerging Practice\nd52l | All one hundred seventy-four participants were asked to identify the rewards and challenges of emerging practice; one hundred sixty-three, ninety-three point seven percent valid responses were received. Responses to the question were organized into themes that were inclusive of all comments provided by the participants. Participants identified multiple rewards and benefits to emerging practice. The narrative analysis resulted in the following themes: (a) rewards for the profession, (b) rewards for clients, and (c) rewards for individual practitioners as shown in Table three.\nqlbb | The rewards of emerging practice for the profession and its clients were many; however, the theme of individual rewards for the occupational therapy practitioner yielded the greatest number of responses. Engagement in emerging practice offered distinct benefits to the therapist,",
