        "content": "5bjs | Characterizing the Norwegian reform trajectory since two thousand, Breit et al. identify three phases. The first phase, two thousand to two thousand seven, involves the establishment of the new NAV organization, and experimentation with integrated work forms. The NAV reform included a merger between the two state administrations for National Insurance and Labour Market and municipal welfare services in one-stop local agencies, and the PES moved from a buyer-supplier model to integration and some decentralisation. With its weight on horizontal coordination and autonomy at the local level, the NAV reform displayed traces of a New Public Governance paradigm that frontline managers during the reform process operationalised in a more integrated office.\nuodj | In two thousand eight to two thousand fourteen, a broader reform followed to increase efficiency, for example by re-centralization of the national insurance administration, digital standardized work tools for client services and performance indicators and requirements regarding documentation. This second phase involved a rollback and a return to New Public Management ideas, an effort to turn the frontline offices into single-purpose organizations for employment services only (preferable\nk16v | to the most job-ready clients) by reducing the number of municipal services and the withdrawal of national insurance benefit case processing to regional administrative units. Additionally, the ministry and the NAV directorate governed the frontline offices through performance measures and efforts to standardize the organizational design and the work of the frontline offices. Unlike the Netherlands, rising unemployment did not lead to cutbacks but to higher budgets for labour market measures.\nb2lm | From two thousand fifteen, a third policy change breathed new life into the importance of professionalism in service provision. In many ways, the NAV returned to the original reform ideas of the early two thousands, underlining integrated services and local self-government in developing new forms of professionalism and experimentation at the street level. This phase included a return to New Public Governance ideas of horizontal coordination within and outside the NAV offices, and a greater focus on professionalism and clients with more complex issues, in need\nti7f | digitization of communication with clients, but depending on the local NAV manager. In recent years, the trend from two thousand fifteen has strengthened, but we also notice the merger of municipalities and NAV offices into much larger first-line organizations, which points to New Public Management ideas for efficiency at a decentralized level.\noksu | In sum, in Norway we see a move from a Traditional Public Administration or New Public Management based system in the nineteen nineties to New Public Governance in the early two thousands, followed by more emphasis on New Public Management at the end of two thousands and a revival of New Public Governance since two thousand fifteen. The current trend is reinforcing the New Public Governance reform but also a move towards more efficiency with municipal mergers and larger regional NAV agencies, argued to strengthen professionalization and specialization. The next section will show that the Dutch reform of the welfare administration ultimately has many parallels with the Norwegian one, but along a completely divergent route.\nwtow | Netherlands\no22k | Traditionally, and similar to Norway, there was a strong division between the welfare administration of social benefits, Public Employment Service, and social assistance. Social benefits in the Netherlands were executed by sectoral organizations governed by social partners; Public Employment Service was a central government department and social assistance the traditional domain of municipalities. The welfare system was increasingly criticized in the nineteen eighties for high unemployment and disability, and a low degree of activation. The Public Employment Service hierarchy increasingly came under fire for its inability to reverse this trend. After ten years of negotiations between government and social partners, this resulted in a radical reform for a new governance structure with central and regional three-party boards with equal seats for government, employers' associations, and unions. So we see here the idea of collaborative networks on a horizontal basis, in contrast with a principal-agent model for Public Employment Service in Norway in the nineteen nineties.\nnwfz | In two thousand two, the Dutch government implemented a much wider reform with the SUWI Act, encompassing a completely new organizational structure for both social benefits and the Public Employment Service. The SUWI reform came after endless negotiations since nineteen ninety-four for 'marketization' in the benefit administration that resulted in an impasse. Different from the NAV reform in Norway, SUWI was a typical combination of Traditional Public Administration and New Public Management, with a minor role for New Public Governance. A large national organization, UWV, was created from a merger of five sector organizations for the implementation of benefits, formerly led by social partners and now centrally managed by the Ministry of Social Affairs and Employment (a switch to Traditional Public Administration). At the same time, Public Employment Service job matching tasks were outsourced to private agencies, in a principal-agent model where UWV, municipalities and employers had to act as principals. New Centers for Work and Income were set up for the first registration for benefits and assistance.\nnvfy | The UWV, Centers for Work and Income, and municipalities were expected to offer 'integrated services', but the how was left open.\nmror | In two thousand eight we saw a merger of UWV and Centers for Work and Income which can be regarded as a re-establishment of the Public Employment Service, but with limited tasks and significant cutbacks. New Public Management-type reform became even stronger in the aftermath of the financial and economic crisis and growing unemployment. The already minor role of New Public Governance in the original SUWI reform of two thousand two received even less political support these years: UWV and municipalities were no longer expected to provide integrated one-stop-shop services justifying the closure of two-thirds of the ninety-eight shared job centers which had been laboriously built up over the past decade. The national government made further major cutbacks at the UWV, as a result of which fifty percent of the work coaches lost their jobs and personal contact with clients was replaced by full digitization for most clients. In the general trend towards maximum efficiency, also sheltered workshops were no longer allowed to take on new clients that are supposed to find a 'regular job' at the labour market.\nzlxc | In two thousand fifteen, as in Norway, but in the Netherlands boosted by a social agreement with the social partners in two thousand thirteen, we see some revival of New Public Governance in horizontal cooperation of government authorities, municipalities and UWV, and social partners in thirty five 'labor market regions'. Regional Boards, Work Chambers, should coordinate the implementation of the Jobs Agreement Act of two thousand fifteen as part of the social agreement with social partners, aiming for one hundred twenty-five thousand jobs in two thousand twenty-six for people with physical and or mental handicaps. With the Participation Act of two thousand fifteen, local governments should conduct and integrate diverse social services, next to income support, and the largest municipality in each region has to coordinate regional collaboration with public and private parties for implementing the Jobs Agreement.\nk0bw | Although policy rhetoric was much about \"decentralisation\" in the Netherlands since two thousand fifteen, national regulations and conditions, for example for one service point to employers in each region and subsidized labour market projects, showed a gradual tendency toward recentralisation and\naq5a | standardization. In two thousand twenty, the Dutch government together with social partners, UWV and municipalities initiated Regional Mobility Teams to deal with an expected high job loss due to the Covid-nineteen pandemic. Here New Public Governance ideas of holistic services and collaboration between public and private partners returned to the reform agenda. In the latest revision of the SUWI Act, two thousand twenty-one, the Regional Mobility Teams were legally grounded, and a wider reform for Regional Work Centres is initiated by the national government. So there is reinforcement of the New Public Governance trend from two thousand fifteen; but with a larger role of central government and social partners despite 'decentralization'.",
