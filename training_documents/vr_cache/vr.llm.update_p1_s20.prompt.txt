You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

5vqw | Virtual reality as a clinical tool in mental health research and practice
meyw | Virtual reality (VR) is a potentially powerful technology for enhancing assessment in mental health. At any time or place, individuals can be transported into immersive and interactive virtual worlds that are fully controlled by the researcher or clinician. This capability is central to recent interest in how VR might be harnessed in both treatment and assessment of mental health conditions. The current review provides a summary of the advantages of using VR for assessment in mental health, focusing on increasing ecological validity of highly controlled environments, enhancing personalization and engagement, and capturing real-time, automated data in real-world contexts. Considerations for the implementation of VR in research and clinical settings are discussed, including current issues with cost and access, developing evidence base, technical challenges, and ethical implications. The opportunities and challenges of VR are important to understand as researchers and clinicians look to harness this technology to improve mental health outcomes. 2019, AICH - Servier Group Dialogues Clin Neurosci. 2020;22(2):169-177. doi:10.31887/DCNS.2020.22.2/lvalmaggia
2e62 | Introduction
75y3 | Developments in virtual reality (VR) have the potential to radically transform the landscape of assessment in mental health. Immersive VR involves wearing an enclosed head- mounted device (HMD) that displays three dimensional images on a screen so that the person is fully immersed in a virtual environment (eg, Figure 1).1 Images are continu- ously rendered relative to the position of the head and can capture movements of the body, allowing users to explore and interact with objects and avatars (digital agents) in the virtual space. These virtual environments are either programmed using specialist software to create comput- er-generated, photorealistic images, or filmed with special- ized cameras to create 360-degree videos of real-world
s2g2 | scenes that can be replayed within VR. Together, these capabilities make it possible for researchers and clinicians to observe and record individuals in highly controlled and near-natural environments, in real time.
q1q2 | VR has been applied for the delivery of exposure-based treatments, whereby individuals can experience feared situations or contexts in a safe and controlled manner, without leaving the clinical setting. Indeed, VR exposure treatments have proven effective across a range of mental health conditions. A number of reviews have been written on the topic of VR-based treatments for psychiatric condi- tions more broadly.2-7 Freeman et al4 conducted a system- atic review in 2017, finding 154 studies on VR treatments for a range of mental health disorders. Further reviews
cb7r | have been published on VR treatments for schizophrenia,5 anxiety disorders,2,8 and mental disorders more gener- ally.3,6 Evidence for the efficacy of VR treatments is noted within these reviews; however, the methodological quality of studies is generally low and the implementation of VR treatments beyond research settings is yet to be examined. Exposure therapy is notably dominant within this literature, highlighting how the ability of VR to recreate real-world environments has been leveraged to target the mechanism underpinning exposure. However, in general, innovation has not moved far from this approach, with more novel clinical applications of VR yet to be explored. One such applica- tion of VR within treatment is its use as a clinical assess- ment tool, a topic of relatively limited discussion within the literature. Clinical assessment is an integral element of mental health treatment, from diagnosis to treatment plan- ning and monitoring. As such, the aim of this review is to orient the reader to the clinical application of VR as an assessment tool within mental health research and practice. The specific capabilities that underlie the utility of VR for clinical assessment is provided, as well as examples from

hd35 | Benefits of virtual reality for assessment
2zpk | From symptoms and cognition to functioning and capacity, the measurement of psychological phenomena is central to research and practice in mental health.9 Although we can have confidence in current assessment instruments to a certain degree, there are many threats to reliability and validity.10 Differences between the assessment context (eg, a lab or clinic) and the real world generate multiple sources of potential bias, threatening the accuracy of results. Real-world assessments are possible, but can be costly and time consuming, and access can be limited by location and mobility. VR may overcome many of these limitations through the ability to generate highly controlled, real-world experiences.11
epu7 | Enhancing ecological validity
7od1 | With technological advances over the past decade in partic- ular, VR has become increasingly immersive. By immersing individuals in real-world situations through VR, it is possible to conduct assessments that more closely emulate what happens in daily life. This capability overcomes the issue of ecological validity, that is, the degree to which the find- ings of research studies generalize to real-world settings.11 Research has consistently shown that individuals respond to virtual environments as if they were experiencing them in real life. 12-15 Virtual environments are known to produce physiological changes consistent with emotional responses to real-world scenarios13,16,17 and have the ability to elicit symptoms such as paranoia, 18,19 cravings, 20,21 anxiety, 14,15,22 and fear.23 A meta-analysis of nine randomized controlled trials comparing VR exposure with in vivo exposure for phobias found equivalent effects for both interventions, suggesting similar processes occur.24 Experiences in VR have also been found to elicit predictable behaviors, with one study finding that people with higher levels of paranoia kept a greater interpersonal distance from avatars within a virtual environment, which was considered a reflection of perceived trust and social threat.25 These findings highlight one of the main advantages of VR within mental health: the ability to simulate experiences in everyday life.
0bqy | Whereas validation studies are still lacking, research has demonstrated that VR-based assessments can perform
b780 | comparatively to assessments conducted in the real world. 12,26-28 Gorini et al12 examined emotional reactions to food in a virtual kitchen, a real kitchen, and in photographs, among individuals with eating disorders. They found that both real and virtual exposure to food cues elicited the same emotional reactions, which were greater than those elicited by the photographs. VR also enables access to situations and experiences previously difficult to attain in research, such as hard to reach or dangerous environments. For example, VR has been used in neuroimaging research to study brain activation in naturalistic scenarios, a method previously impossible from inside the scanner.29 Furthermore, since recent developments have resulted in VR becoming completely mobile, assess- ments do not need to occur within the clinic or lab, allowing people to access them remotely.30 The possibility to deliver automated assessments in people's homes, independent from a clinician, is an exciting opportunity to increase effi- ciency, improve accessibility, and reduce cost.
