You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

jt0y | The variable <LATEX>\Phi _ { 2 }</LATEX> as a possible cause for the Kok effect
qb7o | As with previous reports (Yin et al., 2011a, 2014), <LATEX>\Phi</LATEX> decreased with increasing irradiances in all three sets of measurements (Fig. S1). Compared with the <LATEX>A</LATEX> vs <LATEX>I _ { \mathrm { a l } }</LATEX> plots, the <LATEX>A</LATEX> vs <LATEX>I _ { \mathrm { a b s } }</LATEX> P2 plots had a similar shape (thus, they are not shown), but the obtained <LATEX>B _ { 1 } : B _ { 2 }</LATEX> ratios were slightly lower than the <LATEX>b _ { 1 } : b _ { 2 }</LATEX> ratios (Table 2). As expected, the regression of <LATEX>A</LATEX> against <LATEX>I _ { \mathrm { a b s } }</LATEX> P2 yielded consis- tently lower intercepts, and therefore higher estimates, <LATEX>R _ { \mathrm { D 1 } }</LATEX> and <LATEX>R _ { \mathrm { D 2 } } ,</LATEX> compared with <LATEX>r _ { d 1 }</LATEX> and <LATEX>r _ { \mathrm { d 2 } } ,</LATEX> respectively, confirming the results of earlier studies (Yin et al., 2011a). For the same reason, the <LATEX>R _ { \mathrm { D 1 } } : R _ { \mathrm { D 2 } }</LATEX> ratios were smaller than the <LATEX>r _ { \mathrm { d 1 } } : r _ { \mathrm { d 2 } }</LATEX> ratios (Table 3). There were no consistent trends for absolute values of <LATEX>r _ { \mathrm { d 1 } } ,</LATEX> <LATEX>r _ { \mathrm { d 2 } } ,</LATEX> <LATEX>R _ { \mathrm { D 1 } }</LATEX> and <LATEX>R _ { \mathrm { D 2 } }</LATEX> with changing O2 or <LATEX>C O _ { 2 }</LATEX> concentrations; but unsurprisingly they increased consistently with increasing temperature (Table 3).
oae5 | Association of the Kok effect with the variable
s0fl | <LATEX>\Gamma ^ { * } / \mathrm { C } _ { \mathrm { c } }</LATEX> We estimated parameter values of the aforementioned three <LATEX>g _ { \mathrm { m } }</LATEX> modes. The estimate of the <LATEX>m</LATEX> factor for mode iii was 0, which means that modes ii and iii had identical results. To test whether a nonzero <LATEX>m</LATEX> factor influenced the calculated <LATEX>C _ { c } ,</LATEX> we fixed <LATEX>m</LATEX> to 0.3, our recent estimate of this parameter (Yin et al., 2020). The three <LATEX>g _ { \mathrm { n } }</LATEX> modes yielded the same goodness of fit with <LATEX>R ^ { 2 }</LATEX> of 0.966 (Table S2). The modelled <LATEX>A</LATEX> by the three modes did not differ essentially (Fig. S2a). Using the modelled <LATEX>A ,</LATEX> we calculated the <LATEX>\Gamma ^ { * } / C _ { c } .</LATEX> ratio across irradiance of all the three sets of measurements. The <LATEX>\Gamma ^ { * } / C _ { \mathrm { c } }</LATEX> ratios calculated by mode ii or iii at first very low irra- diances were more variable than those given by mode i (results not shown), but the average <LATEX>\Gamma ^ { * } / C _ { c }</LATEX> ratio along a given <LATEX>A - I _ { \mathrm { i n c } }</LATEX> curve did not differ much between the three modes (Fig. S2b). We also used the variable <LATEX>J</LATEX> method of Harley et al (1992) to inspect any variation of <LATEX>g _ { \mathrm { m } }</LATEX> and found no evidence <LATEX>g _ { m }</LATEX> with either <LATEX>C _ { i }</LATEX> or with <LATEX>I _ { \mathrm { i n c } }</LATEX> or with <LATEX>O _ { 2 } .</LATEX> In the following analysis, we show the results based on the estimate using mode i, as they did not differ much from those using mode ii or iii.
43ia | The obtained average <LATEX>\Gamma ^ { * } / C _ { c }</LATEX> ratio varied from 0.008 to 0.195 when <LATEX>O _ { 2 }</LATEX> varied from 2% to 50%, from 0.322 to 0.049 when CO2 varied from 100 to 700 umol <LATEX>\mathrm { m o l } ^ { - 1 } ,</LATEX> and from 0.066 to 0.110 when temperature varied from 15 to 35℃. Plotting the <LATEX>b _ { 1 } : b _ { 2 }</LATEX> ratio or the <LATEX>B _ { 1 } : B _ { 2 }</LATEX> ratio against the <LATEX>\Gamma ^ { * } / C _ { \mathrm { c } }</LATEX> ratio showed lin- ear relationships, and because these linear relations did not differ significantly among the three sets of measurements, the common regression line was obtained, and the intercept of the line at the zero <LATEX>\Gamma ^ { * } / C _ { \mathrm { c } }</LATEX> ratio was close to 1 (Fig. 5a).
