        "content": "awri | Underscoring the non-literality of actions by appealing to motives\nbl28 | One of the ways in which speakers manage potentially troublesome inferences worked up during social interaction is to underscore the non-literality of their actions by characterizing those actions as not implying what they may appear to be implying. One way to do this is to make an appeal to an inner realm of intentionality, dispositions or motives as a way to trump other interpretations. In the exchange below, Don, in his final turn, seems to play on motives in order to construct the moderator as misunderstanding them, which allows them to claim to be more mature than it would appear to the casual or naïve onlooker.\nd5bz | Excerpt one Participants: M: Moderator, D: Don, H: Hal\nap5o | One M: So is part of growing up not falling for good looks (.) is that (.)\n7zvf | Two what do you guys think of that\nmov9 | Three D: If you don't know em' (.) like if you are in the mall (.) then it's the four very first thing ya' gonna notice (one point zero) you never gonna automatically five tell that they have a good personality\nks7m | Six H: y a h, you gott:a go with the looks first\nw1w1 | Seven D: ya' gonna ALWAYS go to looks first\nh8gv | Eight M: yeah yeah (.) okay\nkwkp | \nyj0m | Positioning a 'mature' self four hundred seventy-nine\newfp | Ten to:tally pretty but not tha :: t ugly (.) but if they have a good eleven personality (.) then you go out with em'=\noczy | \n2ttg | M: yeah\nhis3 | Thirteen D: to see if it works out (.) ya know (.) you go out to see what happens\nm50z | Fourteen M: Would you also say that that is part of :: maturing (.) and possibly=\nme84 | Fifteen D: see (.) even though we just joke around with the girls and pretend to be all\no56m | Sixteen like ((acts like he is eyeing someone up and down)) yah: umm: that's nice :: \nslz6 | Seventeen you know (.) acting like we're not mature (.) but see (.) we just act like that\n90k5 | Eighteen cause we wanna have fun (.) just for fun (.) that's just the way we are\n9m8s | The moderator's opening characterization of 'not falling for good looks' (line one) as a straightforward index of 'maturing' is problematized by the boys. Don's initial position is that 'falling for good looks' can be seen as natural or inevitable. This position is normalized with the inclusive 'you' and through emphatic stress on certain extreme case formulations, such as 'very first', 'never', and 'automatically' (line four), and through the script fragment 'in the mall'. The full dispreferred response is heard in lines six-seven, where both Hal and Don emphatically point out that ya' gonna ALWAYS go to looks first. As such, the boys initially claim that 'going to looks first' does not necessarily have anything to do with maturity, but rather is a normal and inevitable phenomenon.\n893y | Having built in the reasonableness of 'falling' in the context of first impressions, Hal and Don can then particularize another set of circumstances where looks don't matter as much, that is, when a girl has a good personality (lines nine-thirteen). In line fourteen, the moderator uses the vague indexical of 'that' to casually focus on their position of 'dating based on personality', and asks them to account for 'that' as a possible index of maturity. Interestingly, Don (line fifteen) orients to the question less as a transparent request for information, and somewhat more as a hedged challenge. Don opens with a delay token 'see' (line fifteen) that works to preface a bit of clarification ('even though we just joke around ... ') about a type of activity in which they engage. His final turn is organized in three relevant parts. It begins with an initial preface, followed by a mitigated rejection, and then is completed with an account.\nfavz | Preface see (.) even though we just joke around with the girls and pretend to be all like ((acts like he is eyeing someone up and down)) yah: umm: that's nice :: you know (.) acting like we're not mature (.) Mitigated rejection but see (.) we just act like that Account cause we wanna have fun (.) just for fun (.) that's just the way we are\n7szx | The initial preface implicates them in flirting activity that is hearable as potentially immature. But it does more than this. It simultaneously downplays the seriousness or 'literality' of their 'joking' behaviour by characterizing it as an 'act'. Don uses the case softener 'just' in the idiomatic 'just joking around' formulation, followed by 'pretend to be all like' to initially draw up a less than serious portrayal of their flirtation. He goes so far as to exaggerate the pretend behaviour of eyeing a girl up and down, and follows the exaggerated re-enactment with the intersubjective casual-looking token of 'you know' in a way that underscores that it is obviously not meant to be taken seriously, and that\nhx9e | four hundred eighty\nywn2 | they are not literally to be seen as immature. This is an obvious 'act' of immaturity (lines sixteen-seventeen), as reinforced with the mitigated rejection of 'but see we just act like that'.\na63r | Don then goes on to give an account for the non-immature 'act'. The account is a scripted formulation that plays on motives. The initial 'just act like that' (line seventeen) and the 'we wanna have fun' (line eighteen) are constructed in the iterative present tense, suggesting a regular action and motive pattern. The repeated use of 'just' works to downplay the seriousness of the scripted action and motives, and the 'that's just the way we are' (line eighteen) is a dispositional account for their motives and actions. The claim is that they have been misunderstood by the moderator and that they are not really complicit with immaturity here, although it may look that way from an outsider's perspective. By privileging an interior realm of motives and playing it against an exterior world of particulars, Don is able to claim misinterpretation, which allows him to counter the dispositional inference that they are immature by scripting the event as 'just having fun' and their disposition as 'just the way we are', thus inoculating themselves from appearing literally or seriously preoccupied with girls' physical appearances. He is also able to position the moderator as a member of the 'naïve adult category', uninformed about what is really going on. Maturity is accomplished in the subtle and shifting discursive space where empirical particulars, motives, and dispositions are played off one another.",
