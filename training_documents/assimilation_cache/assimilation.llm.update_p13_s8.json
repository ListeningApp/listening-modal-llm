        "content": "jai3 | Script M maps set of real numbers cubed to set of real numbers cubed defined by script M of X sub zero equals X of one in set of real numbers cubed, X sub zero in set of real numbers cubed.\np57i | There is no closed formula for script M, so script M must be computed numerically by solving the system of differential equations for each\nu5ug | X sub zero Figure twenty point four shows the x-component of a trajectory for zero less than or equal to T less than or equal to six for initial data x sub zero equals negative seven point three, y sub zero equals negative eleven point five, z sub zero equals seventeen point eight. This trajectory switches from one \"sheet\" of the attractor to the other near T equals two. Also shown in Figure twenty point four are the x-components of ten trajectories from a solution ensemble with initial data X sub zero prime equals X sub zero plus Xi sub one, Xi sub two, Xi sub three, where the Xi sub i are normal random variables, as well as the ensemble mean computed by averaging one thousand trajectories of this ensemble. For T greater than one point five or so, the ensemble mean is seen to differ dramatically from the true solution. The specific reason in this case is that trajectories from the ensemble switch from one leaf of the attractor to the other at times that can be very different from T equals two. Essentially, if the initial data are known only up to random errors that have standard normal distributions, then the true trajectory becomes unpredictable for T greater than one point five or so. Averaging over many ensemble trajectories does not eliminate this bias. This situation is typical for nonlinear systems of differential equations; for linear systems, the ensemble mean always equals the true trajectory.\ni9k5 | Figure twenty point five again shows the x-component of the true trajectory, together with the corresponding results of the EnKf, for an ensemble of size fifty. The data model is given by Equation twenty point seventeen, with H equals matrix with rows one and one and zero, zero and one and one. Therefore, only a two-dimensional projection of the true trajectory, corrupted by random noise, is observed at each time. The error terms zeta sub i are standard normal. Each assimilated trajectory starts at a filtering state at T equals i, red circle, and ends at a forecasting state at T equals i plus one, green circle. Evidently, the assimilation process is only partially successful in approximating the correct trajectory. For example, on the intervals one point five less than T less than two and four point five less than T less than five, the assimilated trajectories are not even qualitatively correct. Nevertheless, it is remarkable that a significant portion of the true trajectory is recreated correctly over the entire interval of interest.\n20z2 | Chapter twenty. Data Assimilation\n4cgs | Twenty point nine. Concluding Remarks\nhtre | Twenty point nine. Concluding Remarks\nda3c | Data assimilation has been very important for weather prediction, where it has extended both the range and reliability of forecasts. In the best-case scenario, there is a correct dynamical model with sufficiently high resolution and a well-designed observational network that can provide accurate data. In the next-best-case scenario, there may be a somewhat deficient dynamical model, but the observational network is still good enough to provide adequate data. Then it is still possible to obtain estimates in agreement with nature, as long as dynamical model errors are recognized and incorporated adequately.\n890q | In climate science, data assimilation has been used since the late nineteen eighties. It is having an increasingly significant impact, since it allows improved and faster estimation of both internal and external parameters. Parameter estimation is particularly promising in the biogeochemistry of the climate system, where it is often difficult to measure rates directly in situ. Realistic dynamical models and feasible measurements of quantities such as concentration fields of plankton, in combination with advanced data assimilation techniques, can lead to surprisingly realistic estimates of these rates.\njomo | Data assimilation techniques have been applied to create reliable uniform background data for the past, reanalysis, and to obtain information about unobservable quantities such as ocean upwelling and chemical reaction rates in the ocean. A typical example is described, where an EnKf approach is used to reconstruct the ocean climate for the period nineteen fifty-eight to two thousand one.\n06fi | Interestingly, there are specific problems with heterogeneous data sources associated with all reanalysis exercises for ocean circulation for the twentieth century. Since about nineteen eighty, satellites with circumpolar orbits have provided reliable records of planet-wide uniformly distributed ocean measurements. But prior to about nineteen eighty, observations came mainly from shipboard observations that were concentrated along major shipping routes. There are also other more subtle trends in the data collection efforts that are known to introduce spurious trends during data assimilation. For example, the typical height at which shipboard anemometers are mounted has increased since the middle of the last century, leading to biased results for wind strengths and patterns. In the past, when data assimilation was used mainly for weather prediction, such slow trends did not matter.\nhb4s | Ridgwell et al. describe a similar project for biogeochemistry data. Here, an EnKf is employed in an iterative fashion to obtain steady-state information about geochemical parameters such as uptake rates and concentrations of phosphate and calcium carbonate in the ocean at preindustrial times.\ncqq2 | The EnKf is known to run into problems when the underlying process model is highly nonlinear and has many unstable equilibria. Other methods have been proposed for such situations. For example, Apte, Jones, and Stuart develop a Bayesian approach to address data assimilation questions coming from drifting buoys, which are known to have trajectories that are very sensitive to changes in the initial data.\n1ews | Twenty point ten.
