You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

n1wo | In summary, there is growing body of evidence showing that creatine supplementation, particularly when combined with exercise, provides musculoskel- etal and performance benefits in older adults.
5bq3 | Is creatine only useful for resistance / power type activities?
ezla | Although creatine supplementation has been theorized to primarily benefit athletes involved in high-intensity intermittent resistance/power type activities, there is a growing body of evidence suggesting that creatine sup- plementation may also provide beneficial effects for other activities. For example, creatine supplementation with carbohydrate [123] or carbohydrate and protein [124] has been reported to promote greater muscle glycogen storage than carbohydrate supplementation alone. Since glycogen replenishment is important for promoting recovery and preventing overtraining during intensified training periods [2, 125], creatine supplemen- tation may help athletes who deplete large amounts of glycogen during training and/or performance (i.e., sport- ing events) to maintain optimal glycogen levels. Second, there is evidence that creatine supplementation may re- duce muscle damage and/or enhance recovery from in- tense exercise. For example, Cooke and colleagues [126]
rsbu | reported that creatine supplementation during recovery from exercise-induced muscle damage promoted less muscle enzyme efflux and better maintenance of isokin- etic muscle performance. Moreover, there is evidence that individuals supplementing their diet with creatine experienced less muscle damage, inflammation, and muscle soreness in response to running 30-km [127] as well as during 4-weeks of intensified training [70]. Con- sequently, creatine supplementation may help athletes recover from intense exercise and/or tolerate intensified periods of training to a greater degree. Third, there is evidence that athletes who supplement with creatine during training experience fewer musculoskeletal injur- ies, accelerated recovery time from injury [78, 128] and less muscle atrophy after immobilization [129, 130]. Whether this is due to a greater resistance to injury and/ or ability to recover from injury remains unclear. Fourth, creatine supplementation (with or without glycerol) has been reported to help athletes hyper-hydrate and thereby enhance tolerance to exercise in the heat [28, 37, 131- 145]. Therefore, creatine supplementation may reduce the risk of heat related-illness when athletes train and/or compete in hot and humid environments [72, 146]. Fi- nally, there is evidence from animal models that creatine supplementation is neuroprotective [147-149] and can reduce the severity of spinal cord injury [150, 151], cere- bral ischemia [152-155], and concussion/traumatic brain injury [2, 7, 12, 22, 32, 33, 156]. This evidence was so compelling that the International Society of Sports Nu- trition recommended that athletes engaged in sports that have a potential for concussion and/or spinal cord injury take creatine for its neuroprotective effects [2]. Thus, there are a number of reasons beyond the ergogenic benefit that all types of athletes may benefit.
magd | In summary, there is a variety of athletic events, not just resistance/power activities, which may benefit from creatine supplementation.
tb74 | Is creatine only effective for males?
8l69 | Creatine kinetics may vary between healthy males and fe- males [157]. Females may have higher intramuscular cre- atine concentrations [158] possibly due to lower skeletal muscle mass [159]. Potentially, the higher resting intra- muscular creatine concentration in females (based on the upper limit of intramuscular creatine storage) may help explain some research showing diminished responsiveness and/or performance effects on females [160, 161].
1jyv | As a result of hormone-driven changes in endogenous creatine synthesis, creatine transport, and creatine kinase (CK) kinetics, creatine bioavailability throughout various stages of female reproduction is altered, highlighting the potential positive implications for creatine supplementa- tion in females [29]. The implications of hormone-related
olce | changes in creatine kinetics has been largely overlooked in performance-based studies [29]. Specifically, creatine sup- plementation may be of particular importance during menses, pregnancy, post-partum, perimenopause and postmenopause. Creatine kinase, as well as enzymes asso- ciated with creatine synthesis, are influenced by estrogen and progesterone [1]. Creatine kinase levels are signifi- cantly elevated during menstruation [162], with CK levels decreasing throughout the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, and with age. The lowest range of CK values have been reported during early pregnancy (20 weeks or less), equating to about half the concentration found at peak levels (teenage girls) [162, 163].
erx1 | Maternal creatine supplementation during pregnancy in pre-clinical animal studies have demonstrated a pro- tective effect against fetal death and organ damage asso- ciated with intrapartum hypoxia [164, 165]. Reduced creatine levels in late pregnancy have also been associ- ated with low fetal growth [165]. There is additional data that metabolic demand from the placenta during gesta- tion further lowers the creatine pool of the mother [166], which may be associated with low birth weight and pre-term birth. Creatine supplementation during pregnancy has been shown to enhance neuronal cell up- take of creatine and support mitochondrial integrity in animal offspring, thereby reducing brain injury induced by intrapartum asphyxia [167, 168]. Although there are no human studies evaluating the effects of creatine sup- plementation during pregnancy, creatine could provide a safe, low-cost nutritional interventional for reducing intra- and post-partum complications associated with cellular energy depletion [169]. This may be more im- portant if the female is vegetarian, or unable to consume meat due to nausea or taste preferences (i.e. meat con- tains about 0.7 g of creatine/6 oz serving [54];).
b3bt | Females have been reported to have lower levels of creatine in the brain (frontal lobe) [170]. Increasing cre- atine concentrations in the brain as a result of supple- mentation, particularly in females, may support the reported benefits of reducing symptoms of depression [171, 172] and ameliorating the effects of traumatic brain injury [12, 22]. Depression is about 2 times higher among females throughout the reproductive years [173] and accelerates around pubertal hormonal changes [174]. Altered brain bioenergetics and mitochondrial dysfunction have been linked with depression, particu- larly as it relates to CK, ATP, and inorganic phosphate (Pi). Creatine supplementation has been shown to sig- nificantly augment cerebral PCr and Pi [175], particularly in females. The increase in cerebral PCr from 10 g of creatine supplementation was reported to be inversely related to symptoms of depression in adolescent females resistant to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [171] It appears that creatine supplementation may be
