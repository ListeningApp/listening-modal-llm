That is, the Crown's radical title entailed, of itself without more, the universal and beneficial ownership and use of the land to the exclusion of any native title. Simply stated, the High Court in Mabo took the view that the acquisition of Australia in the name of the British Crown did not necessarily extinguish native title. Hence, the Crown's radical title did not necessarily confer full beneficial ownership of the land.\ndvms | Upon this view, when sovereignty was asserted over the Australian territories, the only land which the Crown could have absolute beneficial title to was land to which no native title extended or land to which the native title, although extending, had been extinguished. Nevertheless, an incident to the Crown's radical title was a power to appropriate land to itself or to alienate land to others to the exclusion of native title. If, however, the Crown did not so act to appropriate or alienate the land, the title of the indigenous people to the land remained, until the Crown so acted.\nqrd3 | This approach necessarily exploded the common myth of terra nullius. For, if the Australian territories were properly terra nullius, there could be no legitimate claim to any pre-existing native title.\nrxrg | According to the commentaries of Blackstone, English municipal law became the law of a newly discovered land if upon the first settlement by English colonists, the discovered land was a desert uninhabited country. Alternatively, where the subject land had been conquered or ceded, English municipal law applied by exercise of the Sovereign's legislative power. Importantly, after conquest or cession the law continued to recognise the legal rights of the conquered or ceded inhabitants. However, where the land was terra nullius, the law did not recognise the continued legal rights of the inhabitants in a settled land. As a matter of decided case law, the inhabited territory of New South Wales came to be treated as desert uninhabited country upon the logic that the condition of the indigenous people before British settlement was barbarous or the territory was practically unoccupied, without settled inhabitants or settled law.\ntf43 | In the Mabo case itself, it was held that there was sufficient evidence of the Meriam people's continuous occupation and settlement of the islands. They had cultivated gardens, established a system of customary law and provided for the passage of property from one generation to the next. Such a substratum of complementary native title was clearly consistent with the law of real property which was inherited by the Australian territories upon their settlement by British and later immigrants.\nfcco | When the Crown asserted its sovereignty over Australia, the law governing real property which immediately applied was that of tenure. Tenure, upon its true analysis, was a relationship which existed between the Crown and the land occupier, not as between the land and the land occupier. The doctrine of tenure is said to derive in England from the actions of King William One when he acquired all land, either by conquest, forfeiture or surrender, and then granted that land to his tenants-in-chief. Similarly, land in Australia, which had been granted by the Crown, was held on some kind of tenure and such titles, under the accepted Australian land law of tenure, cannot be disturbed. However, in Australia this fundamental premise of the doctrine of tenure - that is, the granting of interests in all land by the Crown - was not true for all land. Some Crown land remained unalienated. Hence, in Australia, the doctrine of tenure, and its subsequent recognition of land title, could only correctly be said to apply to land which has been granted or alienated by the Crown. Of necessity, then, it could not be said to apply to deny the existence of interests concerning land - native title being one example - which owed\n8uji | their existence to something other than a Crown grant or Crown alienation.\ndf3e | As such, the radical title to the beneficial use of land was subject to a number of interests where the territory was not the subject of a Crown grant or alienation and where the land was not terra nullius. Among those interests was indigenous native title. The Crown, therefore, took the land subject to native title (which could be extinguished by the Crown by legally recognised actions or extinguished by the indigenous people themselves). The occupiers of land took the land subject to the Crown although, in the vast majority of cases, the Crown's conduct in giving beneficial title to land occupiers was sufficient, in law, to extinguish native title. This was because that was tantamount to an alienation of land by the Crown inconsistent with the continued enjoyment of native title.\n53eu | The decision in Mabo affects the notion of terra nullius in a number of ways. The most important is that, for the Meriam people to be successful, it was essential that they should dispel the notion of terra nullius. Clearly, there was evidence suggesting a society beyond that which could be considered the proper subject of the terra nullius doctrine, at least in respect of the Murray Islands. However, inherent in the reason which sustained the decision of the court in Mabo, appears to be a logic that the whole of mainland Australia is similarly not the proper subject of the terra nullius doctrine. While the actual decision concerned only the land annexed by Queensland in the Murray Islands, the consideration of the legal status of that land parallels the status of other land in mainland Australia. This is so even if the case be that no similar claims will be successful within the mainland. The rejection of the terra nullius doctrine was made more easy by its inherently discriminatory nature and the fact that international law had also earlier rejected the doctrine.\na5u1 | WHAT IS NATIVE TITLE?\nry7u | Native title (or traditional, customary or indigenous title) has its origin in and is given its content by the traditional laws acknowledged by and the traditional customs observed by the indigenous inhabitants of a territory. Its existence is primarily a question of fact by reference to those laws and customs. It may possess characteristics unknown to,\n5mda | and unenforceable by, the common law. Native title is not an institution of the common law. Instead, it is distinct from the common law.\ni4li | To prove native title, an entitlement to occupy or use particular land needs to be established. The entitlement must be of sufficient significance to demonstrate a locally recognised special relationship between the indigenous users and the land.\nr8sm | The central concepts to native title are presence upon the land and connexion with the land. Traditional connexion with the land will be evidenced by the indigenous people's substantial continued acknowledgment of traditional laws and customs with respect to the land. Native title requires presence on the land which amounts to occupancy. However, this need not necessarily amount to possession as it is understood by the common law. Such presence must be established at least from the time the Crown asserted its general sovereignty.\ncuin | What will amount to presence or connexion is governed by the demands of the land and the indigenous society in question. Brennan J said:\nn1i7 | The nature and incidents of native title must be ascertained as a matter of fact by reference to those laws and customs. The ascertainment may present a problem of considerable difficulty.\n```",
