If it were permissible in past centuries to keep the common in step with international law, it is imperative in today's world that the common law should neither be nor seen to be frozen in an age of racial discrimination. The fiction by which the rights and interests of indigenous inhabitants in land were treated as non-existent was justified by a policy which has no place in the contemporary law of this country.\nmagd | Adopting a slightly different approach, one could argue alternatively that all the Mabo decision did was to reject the notion that the Murray Islands were properly categorised as terra nullius and made clear what the applicable common law actually was in that circumstance. If that be the case, the common law was not really overturned at all. It was not even changed (except in as far as the earlier cases held that Australia had been terra nullius at the time of settlement). Instead, a fundamental error of fact about Australia at the time of settlement was corrected.\ntb74 | If one accepts the foregoing, Mabo was essentially nothing more that a clarification of law and a re-finding of fact. In such a case, the spectre of\n8l69 | Mabo, as an illegitimate decision of law, is properly answered. The essential question for legal advisers of today is relatively simple. It is: in a particular situation, do the factual circumstances give rise to a prima facie claim for indigenous native title and if so, what, if any, actions by indigenous people themselves, the Crown or a legislature with power may be said to have extinguished that prima facie claim? The only substantive question of law which then remains, if a claim exists or has been non- consensually terminated, is the disputable question of compensation.\n1jyv | THE IMPACT OF INTERNATIONAL LAW\nolce | The Mabo decision also provides guidance as to the appropriate influence which international law and instruments may have on the development of Australia's common law in the years ahead.\nerx1 | Before Mabo, there was no doubt that international law was a source of our law. However, the impact of international law was, for the most part, one of influence only. It remains probable that international law is not, as such, part of the domestic law of Australia - as indeed of most countries. International law does not generally become part of domestic law until either Parliament so enacts or the judiciary incorporates the principles into the domestic law. In adopting and adapting the principles of international law in domestic decisions, the influence of international law is increased. Nevertheless, the incorporation of international law into domestic law by the judiciary remains the exception, and not the rule.\nb3bt | It is usually only where the issue for determination before a court is uncertain that a judge will seek the guidance of international legal material. Such uncertainty may arise where an established doctrine of the common law, by the passage of time, becomes inappropriate to the responsibilities and demands of modern society. Such was the case in Mabo. It may also arise where a statute is ambiguous and a principle of international law is relevant to assist in resolving the ambiguity.\n0w8m | Early recognition within the High Court of Australia of the potential role of international instruments to influence Australian law may be found in the judgments of Murphy. However, in recent years, the acceptance of international law and international instruments in performing the judicial function has steadily grown. The culmination in Australia of this\nvcu3 | In Defence of Mabo\nhjzj | new-found legitimacy for international law - as an influence upon domestic law - was the Mabo decision.\nj79f | For the purposes of determining what the common law of Australia truly was in Mabo, Brennan had regard to the influence of international law. He said:\n6tbv | Whatever the justification advanced in earlier days for refusing to recognize the rights and interests in land of the indigenous inhabitants of settled colonies, an unjust and discriminatory doctrine of that kind can no longer be accepted. The expectations of the international community accord in this respect with the contemporary values of the Australian people. The opening up of international remedies to individuals pursuant to Australia's accession to the Option Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights brings to bear on the common law the powerful influence of the Covenant and the international standards it imports. The common law does not necessarily conform with international law, but international law is a legitimate and important influence on the development of the common law, especially when international law declares the existence of universal human rights. A common law doctrine founded on unjust discrimination in the enjoyment of civil and political rights demands reconsideration. It is contrary both to international standards and to the fundamental values of our common law to entrench a discriminatory rule which, because of the supposed position on the scale of social organization of the indigenous inhabitants of a settled colony, denies them a right to occupy their traditional lands.\nxb13 | Brennan's statement is significant for a number of reasons. It is the most explicit recognition of the stated principle yet found in the decisions of Australia's highest court. It provides for the future development of the common law of Australia in general harmony with the developing principles of international law. It provides to those who advocate the beneficial influence of international law a cause for renewed vigour.\ncxqi | The impact of Mabo, in this respect, has already been felt to some extent. For example, the High Court in Australian Capital Television Proprietary Limited versus The Commonwealth implied into the Australian Constitution a guarantee of freedom of communication as to public and political discussion. Brennan, in particular, had regard to Canadian and United States decisions on basic rights as well as decisions in the European Commission of Human Rights. In Dietrich versus The Queen, the High Court also considered the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Of the Covenant, Brennan in that case said:\nqfmx | Although this provision of the Covenant is not part of our municipal law, it is a legitimate influence on the development of the common law. Indeed, it is incongruous that Australia should adhere to the Covenant containing the provision unless Australian Courts recognize the entitlement and Australian governments provide the resources required to carry that entitlement into effect. But the Courts cannot, independently of the legislature and the executive, legitimately declare an entitlement to legal aid.\nrut3 | Similarly, in Chu Keng Lim versus The Minister for Immigration, Local Government & Ethnic Affairs, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights was considered once again. While it was not determinative of the decision in that case, Brennan, Deane and Dawson made their position clear. Their Honours said:\nm3cp | We accept the proposition that the courts should, in a case of ambiguity, favour a construction of a Commonwealth statute which accords with the obligations of Australia under an international treaty. The provisions of [the relevant statute] ... are, however, quite unambiguous.\n```",
