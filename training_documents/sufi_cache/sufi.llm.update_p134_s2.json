        "content": "47x4 | Q: I find that people tend to depend upon me, and that when I give them attention, or under other circumstances, they 'transfer' onto me; they regard me as a Guru when I try to teach them. I do not want to have people dependent upon me, so I do not want to teach them.\nqkpc | A: When people start to depend upon you in this unwelcome manner, it is up to you to dismiss them, retaining only those who actually can learn, and who do not use you as a source of dependency. I have no idea who told you that there are only two alternatives - to teach and have people dependent, or to 'shut up shop'. I tell you that this is an over-simplification. Shun the people who show these signs, and you will be able to teach usefully.\ngpbk | If, of course, you have nothing to teach, it is your job to convince such people of that.\nx5yj | THE DERVISH'S DISCIPLES\no0f9 | A dervish once went to a Sufi and said: 'People adopt me as their teacher, and I want to dissuade them'. The Sufi said: 'All you have to do is to behave as if you were mad, and they will soon desert you.'\nj69t | 'But my reputation would be gone!' cried the distraught dervish.\n1gtq | 'Ah, I see,' said the Sufi, 'the question was about teaching, but what lay behind it was self-esteem!'\n1w1l | Well, do you want people dependent upon you or not?\nolzi | I wonder whether you realise that Sufis do not call themselves Sufis, because that is arrogance? I was present when a Sufi was asked: 'Why do you not say that you are a Sufi?' He answered: 'That would be self-assertion, and would invite attack.' 'Then,'\n911e | the questioner said, 'why do you not deny it?' He said: 'That could be untrue, and, moreover could deprive worthwhile people of a means of learning.'\nvslx | One hundred thirty-nine\n4ye4 | Systems\n7331 | Q: I am convinced that the Sufi materials which I have read and heard about are based upon a knowledge of real truth, far more than anything else which I have come across. Why, however, should the Sufis expect you to follow their methods? Is there no other way? What about other systems? I want to exercise humility.\n28mt | A: The Sufi advocates a certain way, or one or other of a large number of methods, because these are the methods which gave rise to the results which you so unreservedly applaud. So, in effect, they say: 'You like this result? Very well, this is the method by which it was arrived at. You want some other result? Very well, you must apply to those who are responsible for the other result, and seek their methods.'\nvmjl | IN AND OF THE SUFI WAY\nmb7q | I remember hearing this question asked of a certain Sufi. His answer was this:\nbv49 | 'If you want to learn Sufism, you must follow the Sufi path. If you want information about why you should follow the Sufi path, you must apply to someone who is not teaching, but who is giving out scholarly opinions about the relative merits of various paths.'\nbu3g | As to humility, we can link it with learning by noting the statement of Kalabadhi in his Taaruf:\n71rn | 'Humility is the acceptance of the truth about the truth, from the truth.'\nizj1 | The question can both be asked and answered by the same person if he will first attend to the matter of the difference between learning of the Sufi Way and learning in the Sufi Way.\nfs2a | You see this tendency very often, where things which might be\nkujj | admissible under one set of circumstances are turned into 'perennial truths'.\nlw6o | Someone was asking me just now, for instance, about the question of 'selling knowledge'. He felt that people should not make a charge for wisdom, and expected me to condemn those who did so.\nwj7p | You see how it works? First the fact that knowledge and wisdom are the product of processes is ignored, and they are unconsciously redefined almost as commodities. Then only is it possible to talk about 'selling them'. Now, I can sell you information, or sacks of coal, but neither I nor anyone else can sell knowledge.\nnbcc | JESUS AND THE APPLES\nlijc | I have recently been reading, too, a remark attributed to Jesus in one of those gospels which are, for one reason or another, condemned by the various churches. Listen to what is said there about selling:\no9cg | 'Jesus said: \"There went forth two men to sell apples. The one chose to sell the peel of the apple for its weight in gold, caring nought for the substance of the apples. The other desired to give the apples away, receiving only a little bread for his journey. But men bought the peel of the apples for its weight in gold, caring nought for him who was fain to give to them, nay even despising him.\"'\nfuy7 | Think about this story and see something of the vehicle and the objective, the nature of human thought and behaviour, and the question of human studies and the materials within the structure.\nj1ij | The Vehicle and the Objective\nb4ju | Q: What is your attitude on the structure of human studies and the materials within the structure?\ndt7j | A: A characteristic disease of human thought is to mistake the vehicle and the objective, or the instrument and the aim.\nvglm | This tendency is seen in all human communities, whether they are what we call 'advanced' or otherwise. It is as strongly present in civilised as in barbaric societies, only its manifestations are different.\njoqd | The rule is that:\nsguz | Something which was functional becomes prized for itself: whether it is an exercise becoming a ritual, or an individual worker becoming idolised, or a tool becoming a totem.\nm26c | Whoever encourages this tendency will always find supporters, because this warp is already in the human environment, and its derivatives will seem 'right'.\np4kb | On the other hand, the concept of vehicle and instrument, of not seeing the wood for the trees, and other manifestations of this possible confusion, are so well established that there will always be people who will understand the importance of thinking straight on the container and that which is contained, and on other manifestations, including the grub-chrysalis-butterfly one.\nq7d5 | The means and the end are not the same. Studies, courses and processes exist for determining, perceiving and profiting from the knowledge of 'means' and 'end'.\nssg4 | Do you remember Omar Khayyam saying:\n13u8 | 'Temples and the Kaaba of Mecca are the houses of devotion/ striking the bell is the sound of worship/the girdle and church and rosary and cross/every one is the sign of devotion.'\nygo4 | The tool becoming a totem is especially marked as a tendency when people want to generalise theories, laws and rules out of situations which require a greater flexibility than just one or two alternatives.\nzvle | Concern and Campaign\n7j6q | Q: If one feels something very strongly, is it not right to pass this on to others, to get them 'concerned', and to form bodies of people who have similar interests?",
