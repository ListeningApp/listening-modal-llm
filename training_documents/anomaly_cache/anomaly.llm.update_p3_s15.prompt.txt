You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

p2n3 | We follow [7, 22, 39] and use extracted features obtained by a pre-trained network on ImageNet [13] instead of RGB images as direct input for our models. Such networks have been shown to be universal feature extractors whose outputs
ohh7 | carry relevant semantics for industrial anomaly detection.
vbni | In addition to RGB data, our approach is easily extend- able to multimodal inputs including 3D data. If 3D data is available, we concatenate depth maps to these features along the channels. Since the feature maps are reduced in height and width compared to the depth map resolution by a factor d, we apply pixel-unshuffling [56] by grouping a depth image patch of d × d pixels as one pixel with ď2 chan- nels to match the dimensions of the feature maps.
dgcw | Any 3D data that may be present is used to extract the foreground. This is straightforward and reasonable when- ever the background is static or planar, which is the case for almost all real applications. Pixels that are in the back- ground are ignored when optimizing the teacher and stu- dent by masking the distance and negative log likelihood loss, which are introduced in Sections 3.1 and 3.2. If not 3D data is available, the whole image is considered as fore- ground. Details of the foreground extraction are given in Section 4.2.1.
gvwz | Similar to [22], we use a sinusoidal positional encod- ing [50] for the spatial dimensions of the input maps as a condition for the normalizing flow ft. In this way, the occurrence of a feature is related to its position to detect anomalies such as misplaced objects. An overview of our pipeline is given in Figure 3.
sk5m | 3.1. Teacher
qws8 | Similar to [22, 38, 39], we train a normalizing flow based on Real-NVP [15] to transform the training distribution to a normal distribution N(0, I). In contrast to previous work, we do not use the outputs to compute likelihoods and thereby obtain anomaly scores directly. Instead, we inter- pret this training as a pretext task to create targets for our student network.
877u | The normalizing flow consists of multiple subsequent affine coupling blocks. Let the input x E Rwxhxnfeat be
rzhj | feature maps with nfeat features of size w x h. Within these blocks, the channels of the input x are split evenly along the channels into the parts x1 and x2 after randomly choosing a permutation that remains fixed. These parts are each con- catenated with a positional encoding c as a static condition. Both are used to compute scaling and shift parameters for an affine transformation of the counterpart by having sub- networks si and ti for each part:
bfax | y2 = X2 Des1 ([21,c]) + t1 ([x1, c])
f2y8 | (1)
o7qm | y1 =x10es2([x2,c]) + t2 ([x2, c]),
d52l | where O is the element-wise product and [., .] denotes con- catenation. The output of one coupling block is the con- catenation of y1 and y2 along the channels. Note that the number of dimensions of input and output does not change due to invertibility.
qlbb | To stabilize training, we apply alpha-clamping of scalar coefficients as in [4] and the gamma-trick as in [39]. Using the change-of-variable formula with z as our final output

0b39 | over all (foreground) pixels at pixel position (i, j).
qecd | 3.2. Student
1o7p | As opposed to the teacher, the student is a conventional feed-forward network that does not map injectively or sur- jectively. We propose a simple fully convolutional network with residual blocks which is shown in Figure 4. Each residual block consists of two sequences of 3 × 3 convo- lutional layers, batch normalization [25] and leaky ReLU activations. We add convolutions as the first and last layer to increase and decrease the feature dimensions.
cp13 | Similarly to the teacher, the student takes image features as input which are concatenated with 3D data if available. In addition, the positional encoding c is concatenated. The output dimensions match the teacher to enable pixel-wise distance computation. We minimize the squared ₡2-distance between student outputs fs (x) and the teacher outputs ft (x) on training samples x € X, given the training set X, at a pixel position (i, j) of the output:
bgre | Cij = 1.f (x)ij - ft(x)ij112.
57lp | (4)
ukth | Averaging % over all (foreground) pixels gives us the final loss. The distance Cs is also used in testing to obtain an anomaly score on image level: Ignoring the anomaly scores of background pixels, we aggregate the pixel distances of one sample by computing either the maximum or the mean over the pixels.
kpvt | 4. Experiments
jie2 | 4.1. Datasets
d0ik | To demonstrate the benefits of our method on a wide range of industrial inspection scenarios, we evaluate with a diverse set of 25 scenarios in total, including natural ob- jects, industrial components and textures in 2D and 3D. Ta- ble 1 shows an overview of the used benchmark datasets MVTec AD [6] and MVTec 3D-AD [8]. For both datasets, the training set only contains defect-free data and the test set contains defect-free and defective examples. In addition to image-level labels, the datasets also provide pixel-level an- notations about defective regions which we use to evaluate the segmentation of defects.
0x0s | MVTec AD, which will be called MVT2D in the follow- ing, is a high-resolution 2D RGB image dataset containing
4exe | 10 object and 5 texture categories. The total of 73 defect types in the test set appear, for example, in the form of dis- placements, cracks or scratches in various sizes and shapes. The images have a side length of 700 to 1024 pixels.
0myz | MVTec 3D-AD, to which we refer to as MVT3D, is a very recent 3D dataset containing 2D RGB images paired with 3D scans for 10 categories. These categories include deformable and non-deformable objects, partially with nat- ural variations (e.g. peach and carrot). In addition to the de- fect types in MVT2D there are also defects that are only rec- ognizable from the depth map, such as indentations. On the other hand, there are anomalies such as discoloration that can only be perceived from the RGB data. The RGB im- ages have a resolution of 400 to 800 pixels per side, paired with rasterized 3D point clouds at the same resolution.

syiw | 4.2.1 Image Preprocessing
kg3t | Following [12, 39], we use the layer 36 output of EfficientNet-B5 [47] pre-trained on ImageNet [13] as a fea- ture extractor. This feature extractor is not trained during training of the student and teacher networks. The images are resized to a resolution of 768 × 768 pixels resulting in feature maps of size 24 x 24 with 304 channels.
