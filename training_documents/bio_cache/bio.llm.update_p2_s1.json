This has contributed to a divisive and unresolved debate concerning the compatibility of environmental and socioeconomic development goals. Elucidating the relationship between positive and negative social impacts and conservation outcomes of protected areas is key for the development of more effective and socially just conservation. We conducted a global meta-analysis on one hundred sixty-five protected areas using data from one hundred seventy-one published studies. We assessed how protected areas affect the well-being of local people, the factors associated with these impacts, and crucially the relationship between protected areas' conservation and socioeconomic outcomes. Protected areas associated with positive socioeconomic outcomes were more likely to report positive conservation outcomes. Positive conservation and socioeconomic outcomes were more likely to occur when protected areas adopted comanagement regimes, empowered local people, reduced economic inequalities, and maintained cultural and livelihood benefits. Whereas the strictest regimes of protected area management attempted to exclude anthropogenic influences to achieve biological conservation objectives, protected areas that explicitly integrated local people as stakeholders tended to be more effective at achieving joint biological conservation and socioeconomic development outcomes. Strict protection may be needed in some circumstances, yet our results demonstrate that conservation and development objectives can be synergistic and highlight management strategies that increase the probability of maximizing both conservation performance and development outcomes of protected areas.\nbd9h | Una Evaluación Global de los Resultados Sociales y de Conservación de las Áreas Protegidas\nm047 | Resumen: Las áreas protegidas son una estrategia clave para la protección de los recursos biológicos, pero estas varían considerablemente en su efectividad y son reportadas frecuentemente por tener impactos negativos sobre los habitantes locales. Esto ha contribuido a un debate divisivo y sin resolución con respecto a la compatibilidad de los objetivos de desarrollo socioeconómico y ecológico. Esclarecer la relación entre los impactos sociales positivos y negativos y los resultados de conservación de las áreas protegidas es esencial para el desarrollo de una conservación más efectiva y más justa socialmente. Realizamos un meta-análisis de ciento sesenta y cinco áreas protegidas usando datos de ciento setenta y un estudios publicados. Evaluamos cómo las áreas protegidas afectan al bienestar de los habitantes locales, los factores asociados con estos impactos y significativamente, la relación entre los resultados socioeconómicos y de conservación de las áreas protegidas. Las áreas protegidas asociadas con resultados socioeconómicos positivos tuvieron una mayor probabilidad de reportar resultados positivos de conservación. Los resultados positivos, tanto socioeconómicos como de conservación, tuvieron una mayor probabilidad de ocurrir cuando las áreas protegidas adoptaron regímenes de co-manejo, les otorgaron poder a los habitantes locales, redujeron la inequidad económica y mantuvieron los\ngy8c | beneficios culturales y de sustento. Mientras los regímenes más estrictos de manejo de áreas protegidas intentaron excluir las influencias antropogénicas para alcanzar los objetivos de conservación biológica, las áreas protegidas que integraron explícitamente a los habitantes locales como actores tuvieron la tendencia de ser más efectivos en la obtención de resultados conjuntos de desarrollo socioeconómico y de conservación. La protección estricta puede ser necesaria en algunas circunstancias, pero nuestros resultados demuestran que los objetivos de desarrollo y de conservación pueden ser sinérgicos. También resaltan las estrategias de manejo que incrementan la probabilidad de maximizar tanto al desempeño de la conservación como a los resultados de desarrollo de las áreas protegidas.\ny4mj | Introduction\nvpgq | An alarming erosion of taxonomic and functional biodiversity is occurring in half of tropical protected areas. The magnitude of this decline is directly linked to human mediated habitat disruption, including land-use change, hunting, and exploitation of other forest-related resources. These human-induced pressures on protected areas and conflict between biodiversity conservation and the needs of local people are predicted to increase due to numerous factors, including market forces and a reduction in distance between protected areas and human population centers. Conflicts between local people and conservation initiatives have generated one of the greatest and longest running debates in conservation science. At one end of the spectrum is the fences-and-fines approach, which contends that to deliver successful conservation outcomes people must be excluded, even forcibly, from protected areas. Opponents of this approach consider such exclusionist protection arrangements ethically troubling because they frequently result in protected areas having disadvantageous social outcomes for local people that ultimately result in ineffective long-term conservation outcomes. An increasingly advocated strategy is that to deliver effective and long-term environmental protection protected areas must accommodate the needs of local people so as to secure sustainable livelihoods and enhance their well-being. The debate between adherents to these two approaches and the importance of considering human well-being in conservation remains lively, intense, and unresolved.\nousl | A key factor limiting the resolution of this debate is the insufficient evidence base, which is currently limited to individual case studies, with few studies specifically testing causal pathways and lack of a global analysis. Available case studies do, however, usefully highlight several key issues. First, social impacts of protected areas take different forms, including economic, livelihood, and cultural impacts, and can result directly from protected area policies, such as hunting regulations, or indirectly through\nm4ju | wider social and economic changes, for example the effects of increased tourism. Second, how local people experience and respond to the social impacts of protected areas is influenced by socio-political contexts at both local and regional scales. Third, impacts of protected areas are unevenly distributed. They are felt most intensely at local rather than national scales and within communities along lines of class, gender, ethnicity, and caste; benefits tend to accrue to the wealthiest and most powerful and costs fall on the weakest and poorest.\na0mb | The lack of a global study on the impact of key recurring factors affecting protected area socioeconomic and conservation outcomes has resulted in three specific knowledge gaps: how the socioeconomic and biodiversity conservation outcomes of protected areas are linked to specific social impacts; how social impacts are influenced by the management and other characteristics of protected areas; and how social impacts relate to socioeconomic and biodiversity conservation outcomes, given the insufficient performance of many protected areas. Addressing these questions is critical for the design of efficient and effective conservation and development interventions that meet both biodiversity conservation targets and socioeconomic needs.\nki8m | We conducted a global review and analysis of the scientific literature that addresses these knowledge gaps regarding the principal drivers of the social impacts of protected areas and their consequences for biodiversity conservation. We used data from one hundred sixty terrestrial and marine protected areas distributed across six continents and that were representative of all International Union for Conservation of Nature protected area management and governance categories. We quantified and determined how protected areas' geographical, physical, and management characteristics were associated with their social impacts. We then evaluated how these geographical, physical, and management characteristics were associated with overall protected area socioeconomic and biodiversity conservation outcomes and assessed whether these two contrasting types of outcomes trade off against each other or are positively associated.\nkm8w | Methods\nwzno | Case Study Selection\n```",
