Summary\nu5ug | As soon as a security management system involves more than a single person, then a Command and Control structure will need to be in to ensure that all aspects of the security management programme are coordinated and controlled in an effective and professional manner. The Command and Control Structure should be able to manage Routine Activities, Minor Incidents and Crisis Situations, and should allow information to be passed up the command chain from front-line responds who have information on any situation and instructions to be passed down the command chain from managers who may well be located far away from the incident site. The ability to create effective command chains is at the heart of effective security management, and it is almost always the case that it is failures in command chain management that is one of the major causes of most security management failures.\ni9k5 | In summary:\n20z2 | A three-level command system - Gold, Silver, Bronze - can be applied to any security operation, and clearly sets out the responsibility associated with each command level.\n4cgs | The purpose of any command system is two-fold: to allow information to be passed up the command chain, and orders and directions to be passed down.\nhtre | If a command system fails, it is almost always because there has been a breakdown in communication.\nda3c | Additional complexity increases the likelihood of failure.\n890q | Command systems work best when all of the people involved in the operation know each other, have worked together before, and share a common organisational culture.\njomo | The more you train together, the more successful the response operation will be.\n06fi | Six point six. Self-assessment exercises\nhb4s | Self-assessment two: Create a Response Programme for three separate incidents, one involving local teams within an organisation, one involving teams from across the organisation, and one involving teams from both inside and outside the organisation.\ncqq2 | Self-assessment three: Write a report for the CEO of your company, explaining the arguments for the introduction of a GSB command system within the company security department. (Make sure that the system you are describing is large enough to support the GSB system).\n1ews | Seven. Maintaining Sustainable Capability\nafyn | As has already been mentioned in previous sections, the secret of creating effective security management capability is to ensure that whatever programmes and protocols are introduced are not seen as one-off events, but are embedded into the organisation so that they become a natural part of its operating procedures and its organisational culture. For many security management systems, this is the hardest part of the management process. Protocols can be written, programmes designed and personnel trained, but to create organisational change is one of the hardest things for any manager to achieve, and even if they have succeeded in doing so, the natural tendency is for organisations to revert to previous practices. This section will introduce some ideas as to how security managers can self-audit their own organisation, and can identify areas where weak practices or lack of management oversight are likely to produce vulnerabilities that could allow small scale potential problems to develop into genuine problems.\n8sye | Seven point one. Effective Protocols\nr04h | There is often a desire in security management to try and identify every possible problem, and then to introduce increasingly detailed and situation-specific protocols to try and manage those scenarios. The problem is that if the control systems become too intrusive and disruptive, the natural reaction is to ignore them or to switch them off. This is then not just a problem with that particular situation, but creates a culture where it is not only permissible, but is accepted practice to ignore guidelines and directives. The purpose of the security management team should always be to support the overall operations and objectives of the organisation, and though it may be tempting to introduce more and more controls, that is self-defeating in the long run. It is better to have a few guidelines that are accepted and adhered to, rather than a whole raft of directives that are ignored.\norpr | Seven point two. Crisis Cognition\nk36m | It is a basic rule in life that the earlier you are aware of a potential problem, the more likely you are to be able to deal with it smoothly, effectively and with the minimum of disruption to the rest of the operating network. If you allow that problem to go unmanaged, it is likely to escalate to a level where it sets alarm bells ringing, at which point the system takes notice and responds, but will often need a much higher level of intervention to deal with the situation than if it had been detected and managed earlier in the escalation cycle.\nwnuz | By becoming aware of a potential problem earlier rather than later in its development cycle:\nsy14 | You have more options to deal with it.\nghss | You can respond with a lower level of intervention.\n3s61 | You are safer from both a personal and organisational perspective.\ns3rm | By being unaware of a potential problem, or by ignoring a problem you are aware of:\npqxb | You will have less options to deal with it.\n08qc | You will need to respond with a higher level of intervention.\nhdj2 | You will be in greater danger from both a personal and organisational perspective.\na57g | Seven point three. Normal Accidents\ng8m3 | In most situations, crises do not just happen. They are only the final stage in a long process of gestation and development. In most situations, the reason that a major problem occurs is not because of an outside event, but rather because there is a lack of ability to respond effectively. In almost all situations, there will have been warning signs that the conditions that will allow the crisis to develop are in place, and there are what have been called Normal Accidents that occur on a repeated basis, which highlight the organisational weakness that is allowing those situations to occur, but which are ignored or accepted.\na9av | Seven point four. Complexity\n73l3 | Many organisations are complex - that is the nature of our interconnected world. However, it has been well recognised that organisational complexity itself creates an increased likelihood of problems arising - or even catastrophic failure, which threatens the continued existence of an organisation. Although the issue of organisational complexity is a subject in itself, from the security manager's perspective there are two clear consequences of an organisation's over-complexity which may well (actually, undoubtedly will) create avoidable situations that have the likelihood of developing into genuine and serious problems.\nornm | Seven point five. Information Transfer\nu2z1 | One of the clearest signs of harmful organisational complexity is if there are regular breakdowns in the transfer of information. This can either be because the lines of communication between different sections of the organisation are ineffective, or because different sections of the organisation are unaware of the need to pass information across to other sections. An example that many security managers might recognise is if the Business Development section creates plans to open a new office or factory in a country where there is genuine risk, whether political, social, criminal or health based. These are problems that the security department would be well aware of, and could highlight if they were part of the business development process. A Risk Analysis of any new country (or even city) should be a natural part of the business development process, but this is dependent on the working relationship between the different divisions. A similar example would be if the HR department is responsible for booking flight tickets for travelling executives, but doesn't inform the security department if one of the company's managers is travelling to what could be perceived as a high-risk area. If the first time that the security department is aware of a problem is when the HR department contact them because that executive's wife has called them because she hasn't heard from her husband in five days, then there is clearly a breakdown in organisational communication and planning.\natmh | Seven point six.
