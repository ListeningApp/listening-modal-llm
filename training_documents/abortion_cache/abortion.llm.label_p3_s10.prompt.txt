You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

ylhz | Results
a3td | Between 20th March 2018 and 20th March 2019, Aid Access provided mifepristone and misoprostol by mail to <LATEX>4 5 ^ { 8 } 4</LATEX> people. Among these, 3,186 provided follow-up information for a follow-up rate of 70% (Figure 1). Of those who provided follow-up information, 2797 (88%) confirmed use of the medications and provided infor- mation on the outcome of their abortion, while 389 (12%) confirmed non-use of the medications. Reasons for non-use included spontaneous pregnancy loss (45%), accessing abortion care in a clinic (21%), decid- ing to continue the pregnancy (19%), shipping delays (6%), having self-managed using another method (3%), the pregnancy being a false alarm (3%); and experienc- ing symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy, for which they reported receiving clinical treatment (0.5%). An addi- tional 3% did not specify a reason for not using the med- ications.
ex5k | The demographic and clinical characteristics of those who provided follow-up information vs. those who did not are shown in Table 1. Among those who provided follow-up, 94.9% reported being under 7 weeks preg- nant at the time of requesting the service. The majority (63.1%) were aged under 30. Virtually all (99.4%) felt OK about their decision to have an abortion and none

A greater proportion of those who provided follow-up were aged 20 or over (89.1% vs. <LATEX>8 5 . 4 ,</LATEX> <LATEX>\left. p < 0 . 0 I \right) ,</LATEX> already had children (58.1% vs. 48.4%, <LATEX>\left. p < 0 . 0 0 I \right) ,</LATEX> and had not received an ultrasound scan prior to their abor- tion (90.4% vs. 87. 6%, <LATEX>\left. p = 0 . 0 0 5 \right) .</LATEX> There were no signif- icant differences in any characteristic, including gestation, that might reasonably bias the follow-up group towards more favorable outcomes.
5esx | Among those who confirmed use of the medications <LATEX>\left( n = 2 , 7 9 7 \right) ,</LATEX> 2402 (86%) reported being under 10 weeks pregnant, while 395 (14%) reported being 10 weeks pregnant or more. Overall, 99.0% of all those who used the medications reported having ended their pregnan- cies (Table 2), and 96.4% reported a successful medica- tion abortion (i.e., ending their pregnancies with no surgical intervention). There was no significant differ- ence by gestation in the proportion reporting ending their pregnancies (99.1% vs. 98.2%, p=0.097), but those who were less than 10 weeks pregnant had a lower rate of surgical intervention compared to those who were 10 weeks or more (2.0% vs. 6.1%, <LATEX>\left. p < 0 . 0 0 I \right) .</LATEX> Overall, among the <LATEX>7 2</LATEX> people who reported receiving a procedure to help end their pregnancy, 54 received D&C, 12 received aspiration, and 6 did not specify pro- cedure type. No ectopic pregnancies were reported among those who confirmed use of the medications.
m5ka | Potentially serious adverse events were not common (Table 3). Overall, 29 people (1.0%) reported experienc- ing any serious adverse event. Of these, 18 people (0.6%) reported receiving a blood transfusion and 15 (0.5%) reported receiving IV antibiotics (4 people reported receiving both). No deaths were reported by family, friends, clinicians, the authorities, or the media. Rates of adverse events overall were more common among those who reported a gestation of 10 weeks or more as compared with those who were less than 10 weeks (2.3% vs. 0.8%, p=0.009).

colo | Discussion
d6r4 | We used a data set containing all available outcomes of self-managed medication abortions provided through online telemedicine, outside the formal healthcare sys- tem, in the U.S. for one year. We found that abortions self-managed using this model were highly effective, with reported success rates comparing favorably with medication abortions carried out up to 10 weeks within the formal U.S. healthcare setting.19 The reported preva- lence of serious adverse events was very low, and the users of service reported high levels of satisfaction.
9mrz | Our results offer the first insight into the outcomes of self-managed medication abortions provided using online telemedicine in the U.S. The high effectiveness rates and low prevalence of serious adverse events we found mirror findings from other countries where med- ication self-management is used.20-22 We note that although most people in our study did not receive an ultrasound, they reported awareness of the duration of their pregnancy at the time of medication use. These findings are in line with prior evidence suggesting that last menstrual period is an accurate method for deter- mining gestation in early pregnancy23 and WHO guide- lines, which clearly specifies that ultrasound is not a necessary pre-requisite for medication abortion.14
pk06 | Our findings also add to evidence on the safety and effectiveness of self-managed medication abortion beyond 10 weeks. While rates of surgical intervention were higher among the small proportion in our study who used the medications after 10 weeks compared to those at 10 weeks or under, almost all were able to end their pregnancies and the rate of successful medication
7wn9 | abortion was similar to other studies examining medica- tion abortion in the late first trimester,24 and medica- tion self-management after 13 weeks using an accompaniment model.25 Those self-managing after 10 weeks in our study also tended to have experienced ship- ping delays and some received modified instructions according to the WHO protocol for medication abortion at 12 weeks and over14 and additional support from Aid Access. In addition, no ectopic pregnancies were reported after using the medications and indeed a small number were diagnosed quickly by the service at the time of initial contact.
wcd0 | This study has several limitations. The first is that abortion outcomes were self-reported by people who self-managed. However, since these abortions take place outside of the formal healthcare system, self-reporting is by definition the only possible method of follow-up. Moreover, a previous large randomized controlled trial showed that self-assessment of the outcome of medica- tion abortion was non-inferior to clinical follow-up, indi- cating that people are capable of determining on their own whether or not their abortion has been success- ful.26 Since an examination of the outcomes of medica- tion abortions taking place outside the formal healthcare setting cannot be dealt with by a randomized controlled trial or clinical trial, we have drawn on the best available "real world" data to answer these impor- tant questions.
caos | Second, although the 70% follow-up rate in this study is incomplete, it is on par with or better than many clinical studies, since most outcomes are only recorded if patients decide to follow up with the clinic.27
qrvy | www.thelancet.com Vol 10 Month June, 2022
pn9j | Moreover, we took a more conversative approach than most clinical studies in that we did not consider those for whom no outcome data were available as presumed successful abortions. Third, while self-reporting could be subject to recall or social desirability bias, the short time period between the abortion and the collection of follow-up information should minimize recall bias.
1pmc | While treatment for serious adverse events was a rarely reported outcome in our study, rates were still higher than those reported in studies of abortions tak- ing place in the clinical setting.19,28 We note, however, that we are not able to verify whether the treatment received by users of the service who did engage with the formal healthcare system was appropriate to their situa- tion. For example, most of those who reported receiving surgical intervention also received antibiotics, which may have been given prophylactically or to treat an exist- ing infection. Studies in other countries have shown that rates of intervention and additional treatment dur- ing clinical abortion follow-up are highly variable, espe- cially in countries where hospital staff are not trained to care for abortion patients.29 While we did examine whether any deaths were reported to the service, we were of course unable to fully assess whether any deaths occurred in the group that did not provide follow-up information.
5z6q | It is also important to consider the rates of self- reported adverse events shown in this study in the con- text of the other possible outcomes for people in the U. S. who cannot access in-clinic abortion care. Between 200,000 and 1.2 million unsafe abortions are estimated to have taken place per year in the U.S. in the 1950s and 1960s pre-Roe, with the resulting burden of morbidity and mortality falling disproportionately on racially minoritised people.3º While we do not expect the same prevalence of unsafe abortion today, we cannot assume that none will occur. Moreover, those forced to carry a pregnancy to term would also be at higher risk than those who self-manage using Aid Access. Rates of hem- orrhage postpartum in the U.S. are over five times higher than those reported in this study, with Black women at disproportionately high risk.31,32
yeoh | The trajectory of highly restricted access to in-clinic abortion in the U.S. and the future possibility of full abor- tion bans in some states means that self-managed abor- tion is likely to become an increasingly used alternative. The FDA recently permanently suspended the in-person dispensing requirement on mifepristone, paving the way for expanded clinic-based telemedicine abortion services. However, at least 19 states already have laws banning telemedicine for medication abortion and in these juris- dictions the FDA ruling will have little effect.33 These states are the also the ones with the highest rates of requests to Aid Access.4 In the majority of U.S. states, self-management is not illegal, and clinicians who may provide follow-up care have no reporting obligation.34 It is important to note, however, that there have been 24

99fo | cases of unjust prosecution for alleged self-management since 2000, with populations already subject to increased surveillance and biased treatment, including people with low incomes and racially minoritised people, at highest risk.35 While legal risks remain, our findings demon- strate that self-management using medications provided through online telemedicine is a safe, effective, and acceptable option for people in the U.S. and thus it is both an important method of harm reduction and a means of preserving reproductive autonomy.
