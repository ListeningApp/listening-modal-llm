You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

06yq | Microdosing with psychedelics to self-medicate for ADHD symptoms in adults: A naturalistic study

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

7imw | Recall from Section 2.3, and in particular in Proposition 2.4, that the estima- tor <LATEX>\widehat { \Phi } _ { \eta , t }</LATEX> defined in (2.38) has asymptotic variance of order <LATEX>\sigma _ { R , \eta } ^ { 2 } / \eta ^ { 2 } .</LATEX> Indeed, (2.42) suggests that this asymptotic variance is of the same order as the one associated with the equilibrium estimator, i.e. <LATEX>\sigma _ { R , 0 } ^ { 2 } / \eta ^ { 2 } ,</LATEX> up to a small bias of order

For each of the dynamics, the scaled asymptotic variance as a function of n is illustrated in Figure 6, where the values of na(€) are represented as dashed vertical lines to highlight the great reduction in variance potential. As expected, Figure 6 is consistent with (4.9), and it shows that increasing the regime of linear response has a dramatic effect on the variance.

Note that for Langevin dynamics, the results here presented for the modified fluctuation-dissipation and the Feynman-Kac forcing both correspond to their p counterparts.
5hk6 | Table 1: Impact of synthetic forcings on variance reduction: gain (4.10) for various synthetic forcings for each dynamics.
viei | The results in Table 1 show that the variance can be dramatically reduced with the use of synthetic forcings. Although no choice of extra forcing is universally better, we can achieve reduce the variance by a factor of over 1000 in all cases.
rk0j | 5. Extensions and perspectives. Let us conclude this work by discussing potential extensions of our approach and practical applications to real molecular dy- namics systems. The notion of synthetic forcings, as here presented, can be applied to a number of actual systems to assist in the computation of transport coefficients, e.g. Lennard-Jones fluids for the computation of shear viscosity, or systems of atom chains for the computation of thermal transport (see [32, 8, 31]).
c6x9 | The methodology here presented, however, must undergo some adaptation to be applied to actual systems. The numerical method we rely on, namely discretizing and solving the associated PDEs, does not scale well to higher dimensions and thus cannot be used as such. One typically relies on Monte Carlo simulations, which normally limits the number of values of n used due to the high computational cost. Additionally, the computation of the optimal values of o, presented in Section 3.3, also cannot be done as such, as it relies on either the PDE approach, or the computation of full response curves.
g5at | One preliminary idea for the computation of o in real systems is the notion of prescreening. Transport coefficients are intensive quantities, i.e. they do not depend

This suggests, in practice, that one performs two simulations with small system sizes, with 01 / @2, from which the value of a* can be extrapolated, which can then be used in a large scale simulation. The results here presented suggest that such an adaptation, which is work in progress, is worth the effort.
gl5i | Appendix A. Analysis of eigenvalues for Feynman-Kac forcings. As discussed in Section 3.2.1, the operator Ln, a = Lo +n ([phys + @[extra) admits a non- zero principal eigenvalue An,a when Lextra corresponds to the Feynman-Kac forcing, discussed in Examples 3.3 and 3.6. As a consequence, the Poisson equation (2.25) must be reformulated for such operators. In this section, we start by formally show- ing that An,& is of order n2, then we discuss the reformulation of (2.25), in particular to compute a *. This analysis could be made precise by adapting the approach of [16].

Computing the optimal value <LATEX>\alpha ^ { \star }</LATEX> defined in (3.13) requires computing the second-order response, as discussed in Section 3.3. In particular, this is done by using the recursive expression (2.25), obtained from the Fokker-Planck equation via formal asymptotics. We reformulate (2.25) for Feynman- Kac systems to compute the second-order response, using that, in view of (A.3),
