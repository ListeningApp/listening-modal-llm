One tries to raise a reflective discussion concerning various forms of racism and cultural imperialism, and one is heard as assuming homogeneity, total culpability, and a whole variety of things about all people designated white. A parallel phenomenon still besets feminists routinely when a discussion of the oppression of women is heard as trashing all men or entailing a biologistic determinism about masculinity. Discussions about sexual violence and sexual harassment, in particular, at least in my experience, evoke charges of \"male bashing\" even when no causal analysis is even broached, much less developed and defended. In one lecture I gave to a religious group, my very reporting of the FBI statistics on rape was characterized as being anti-male. Such responses make us disinclined to speak about racism or sexism in any form unless we are in the mood for a fight. The statement made by Rudolph Giuliani that was quoted at the beginning of this chapter also indicates this strategy: in response to a question about the charges of racism made against his administration-charges based especially on his unconditional support for a police force that had gunned down unarmed black and Latino men-Giuliani deflects to humanism. But clearly, a concern with racism is not antithetical to humanism and should in fact be an integral part of any humanism.\ny219 | Despite these clear cases of strategic obfuscation, I want to acknowledge that the anxiety about identity has at times some legitimate motivations. That is, there have been unfair attributions and unrealistic ascriptions of homogeneity, to be sure, coming from within progressive social movements. The problems of enforced conformism within identity groups, and of what the left used to call narrow nationalism or narrow group politics, do exist and deserve critique. And essentialist constructions of cultural, ethnic, racial, and gendered identity are on the upswing, found on both left and right, not only among the less educated but\n06ht | among the highest academic elite, as in the work of Samuel Huntington, Peter Brimelow, Charles Murray, Allan Bloom, and many others. But my principal interest in this chapter and throughout this book is with the idea that social identity itself is an a priori problem, that identities, under any description, pose dangers and commit one to mistaken assumptions when they are believed to be real and or acted upon politically. I want to differentiate this formulation of the problem of identity-as an a priori problem-from other kinds of formulations of the problem that express a concern only with overly homogenizing, essentialist, reductive, or simplistic constructions of identity. In my view, there are certainly serious difficulties with some constructions of identity, but I have been curious about the claim that identity itself, under any construction, is a problem and even a kind of mistake.\nv3r2 | Identity Politics\nnv42 | If identity has become suspect, identity politics has been prosecuted, tried, and sentenced to death. Like essentialism, identity politics has become the shibboleth of cultural studies and social theory, and denouncing it has become the litmus test of academic respectability and political acceptability. A partial list of the main liberal or progressive critics would include Todd Gitlin, Eric Hobsbawm, Nancy Fraser, Betty Friedan, Frances Fox Piven, Paul Berman, Arthur Schlesinger, Richard Rorty, Robert Hughes, Jean Bethke Elshtain, Wendy Brown, and Jean-Luc Nancy, but there are many others. In contrast, there has been a noticeable thaw regarding the concept of essentialism which has sustained such widespread feminist critique since the early nineteen eighties. Christine Battersby, Elizabeth Grosz, and Teresa de Lauretis have pointed out that only the Aristotelian concept of essence has been used in the feminist debates-that is, the idea of a fixed and stable feature common to all members of a natural kind. On such an account, an essence is something real in a prelinguistic sense. But modern philosophers criticized Aristotle's concept precisely because it would seem to require us to know something that by definition we cannot know: the real as it exists hidden from perception and thus description. Hobbes and Locke then proposed a concept of nominal essences wherein the essence of a thing is its verbal definition: it is no more than an accident for which we give a certain name to any body, or the accident which denominates its subject. In this way, as Battersby argues, a feminist advocacy of nominal essences could deal comfortably with linguistic, historical, and cultural variations in the way that the female is defined. Susan Babbitt has gone even further to defend a nondeterministic naturalist (and thus non-nominalist) account of essentialism as consistent with feminism's liberatory aims as well as with the heterogeneity of women's experiences. She suggests that the problem for feminism is not the concept of essentialism but the deterministic account of gender, and neither essentialism nor naturalism commit us to a hard determinism about gender identity. On scrutiny it turns out, then, that the denunciations of essentialism were based on an inadequate exploration of the concept, its history, and its variable meanings. I believe it is time we reassess identity politics in the same light.\n```",
