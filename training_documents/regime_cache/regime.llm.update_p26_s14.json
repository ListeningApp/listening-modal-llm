        "content": "ppkp | Recall from Section two point two point one that, for small values of n, we can think of the response as a polynomial in seven:\n8br6 | ra(n) = En, (R) = np1(a) + n two p2(a) + Â· + n n minus one p n minus one (a) + O(n).\nde3k | In practice, we want to choose a such that the contribution from nonlinear terms is minimized. There are two main approaches to choosing such an optimal a, by (i) canceling the second-order response, or (ii) bounding the relative error with respect to the linear regime. We next discuss both options.\n2kb3 | Canceling the second-order response. A first approach to reduce the nonlinear response is to cancel the second-order term of two, as this is the dominant part of the nonlinear bias when n is small. The second-order response is characterized by f two in equation two point two five, which reads here\nlqcx | equation three point one two, f two (a) equals (Lo one)*(Cphys plus @Cextra)*(Lo one)*S equals f two, phys plus @f two, extra,\n3h7w | where we decomposed the second-order perturbation of the invariant measure into its physical and synthetic parts. Since f two is linear in a, the value of a for which p two is\nth5p | EXTENDING LINEAR RESPONSE WITH SYNTHETIC FORCINGS\nb7nk | cancelled is easily obtained from the definition of the second-order response. Indeed,\ncbb5 | rho sub two (alpha) equals the integral over X R mathfrak f sub two, phys psi sub zero plus alpha integral over X R mathfrak f sub two, extra psi sub zero equals rho sub two plus alpha rho sub two, extra. Therefore, rho sub two (alpha star) equals zero for\n5qcf | alpha star equals negative the fraction of the integral over X R mathfrak f sub two, phys psi sub zero over the integral over X R mathfrak f sub two, extra psi sub zero, equation three point one three,\n8u2c | provided that the integral over X R mathfrak f sub two, extra psi sub zero is not equal to zero. The latter condition ensures that widetilde mathcal L extra has a nontrivial contribution to the second-order response, and can therefore be used to cancel the second-order response. An important remark is that although alpha star cancels rho sub two, it might significantly increase rho sub three and higher order terms.\nc1e3 | Note that for Feynman-Kac forcings, the computation of alpha star must be reformulated. This is due to the fact that equation two point two five comes from the Fokker-Planck equation, which admits a nontrivial principle eigenvalue for Feynman-Kac forcings, as discussed in Section three point two point one and made precise in Appendix\n7pez | A. In general, the optimal value alpha star cannot be determined a priori. It requires, in principle, two sets of simulations with alpha sub one not equal to alpha sub two, from which alpha star can be extrapolated due to the linearity of rho sub two (alpha) in alpha. We discuss in Section five how to implement this approach for actual systems of interest.\nqs5t | Remark three point seven. For certain situations, it is possible to determine the impact of the extra perturbations from the response curve for the physical forcing. Consider for instance the setting of Example three point two. We define mathbb E sub eta, alpha as the steady-state average for psi sub eta, alpha, the solution to the Fokker-Planck equation mathcal L sub eta, alpha dagger psi sub eta, alpha equals zero. Since mathcal L sub eta, alpha is proportional to mathcal L sub eta over one plus alpha eta, zero (recall that we require one plus alpha eta not equal to zero), a simple computation shows that psi sub eta, alpha equals psi sub eta over one plus alpha eta, zero, so\nen4s | forall eta in mathbb R, q u a d r sub alpha (eta) equals r sub zero (eta over one plus alpha eta). Then,\ncsb5 | r sub alpha (eta) equals r sub zero prime (zero) eta over one plus alpha eta plus one half r sub zero double prime (zero) eta squared over (one plus alpha eta) squared plus O (eta cubed) equals r sub zero prime (zero) eta plus [ one half r sub zero double prime (zero) minus alpha r sub zero prime (zero) ] eta squared plus O (eta cubed). This allows us to find the optimal alpha which cancels rho sub two, given by",
