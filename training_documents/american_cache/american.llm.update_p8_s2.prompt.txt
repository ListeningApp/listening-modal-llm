You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

baj1 | Webster resolved this dilemma by turning to the discourse of geogra- phy, in particular the spelling of place-names. He assured his readers that a geographical lexicon could overcome local differences. Commenting in the Grammatical Institute, Webster writes that "the advantage of pub- lishing, in a work of this kind, the names of the United States, the coun- ties in each, etc. will not be disputed by any American." Thus, while the opacity surrounding the English language was fueling the regionally moti- vated debates over the proper wording of the Republic's basic document, Webster imagined that the "undisputed" pronunciation of geographical words could provide a sense of clarity and a practical code when imagin- ing a unified community.11
n1wo | The assertion that the consensual pronunciation of geographic place- names was the nation's neutral linguistic ground provided Webster with a formula through which he simultaneously decolonized and nationalized his speller. Webster's self-assigned challenge was to displace the British schoolbook A New Guide to the English Language, by Thomas Dilworth, a speller that had dominated the classrooms and homes of British Ameri-
5bq3 | cans since the 1740s. On first sight, Webster's book hardly differed from his imperial predecessor. Both were written in the English language; both endorsed the alphabetic pronouncing-form method. But by focusing on Dilworth's textbook, Webster chose to compete against one of the more popular spellers that promoted geographical literacy. Dilworth's speller emphasized place-names as the literary context through which his British reading subjects would facilitate communication in the British common- wealth as well as uphold its imperial economy on a global scale; or, as Dil- worth put it, it is only "by this means a Briton holds correspondence with his friend in America or Japan, and manages all his business." Webster targets this section, offering, instead of "twelve or fifteen pages devoted to names of English, Scotch and Irish towns and boroughs," eight pages of "the names of the United States, the counties in each, etc." Whereas Dilworth had been rehearsing primarily the place-names found in En- gland, Webster now offered those of the new American nation-state.12
ezla | Indeed, in transforming his speller into an agent of national unifica- tion, Webster incorporated a spelling exercise that anticipated the found- ers' signing ritual. As if projecting the visual form of the United States map of 1783, he introduced the students to the proper spelling of Ameri- can toponyms by including district and city names of all thirteen states. In print the alphabetic assembly of the national map looked like this:
rsbu | The United States of America
magd | States Capital Towns New Hampshire Ports mouth Mas sa chu setts Bos ton
tb74 | Rhode-Island New port Con nect i cut Hart ford New-York New-Jersey Tren ton Pen syl va ni a Del a ware Ma ry land Vir gin i a North-Car o li na New bern
8l69 | New-York
1jyv | Phil a del phi a
olce | Bal ti more
erx1 | Rich mond
b3bt | South-Car o li na Ge or gi a
0w8m | Charles ton
vcu3 | The effect of this spelling table was to establish the geographical order of the national map as an alternative to the alphabetical order of English. Names of states and cities were organized according to their geographical coordinates from north to south rather than from A to Z.13
hjzj | Given the table's role in securing a "standard of pronunciation," it meshed the textual structure of the national map with the practice of oral alphabet lessons. The pronunciation of American place-names imi- tated the typographic hyperextension of place-names on maps. Just as the written word "Massachusetts" implied a larger territorial unit by be- ing stretched across the face of a map, so too did the pronunciation of "Mas-sa-chu'-setts" imitate the territorial form of the geographic referent. Being sounded aloud, the place-name now signaled spatial demands, invoking territorial rights and borderlines for both readers and listeners. Moreover, as the chorus of students rehearsed its lines of geographic location, its tonal scale subordinated regional differences to the largest common territorial denominator. In Webster's lineup, pupils voiced the words "The United States of America" before those of the states. For the duration of these pronunciation exercises, as place-names wafted through American classrooms or parlors, students learning to spell also learned how to noisily claim the national map as the soundscape encom- passing a common linguistic identity.
j79f | Having folded the pronunciation of the national map into his alphabe- tic spelling book, Webster uses geographical literacy as the touchstone of his language reform. Initially, his Grammatical Institute warned the reader that the American community was not so much threatened by the flex- ibility of the English language per se, but that the English variants and dialects were infinitely more debilitating to the project of unifying the national reader through one linguistic standard. Yet, toward the end of his introduction to the Grammatical Institute Webster concludes that spellers and grammars were not in need of improvement, but that lan- guage reformers needed better geographical primers. "The accounts from several states, are yet imperfect," he writes, "but care will be taken to collect, by the best means of information, such accurate accounts from
6tbv | the several states, as to correct any errours and supply any defects, that the present imperfect and fluctuating state of geography in this country may unavoidably occasion."14
xb13 | Describing the state of geographic literacy becomes Webster's way of describing the state of literacy instruction in America. During the first three decades of nationhood, as his spelling books rapidly replaced those of a colonial make, lessons in geographic literacy seeped into spell- ing exercises. For example, new editions of former colonial classics such as George Fisher's handbook The Instructor; or, Young Man's Best Com- panion (1794) appended their chapters on language instruction with a re- hearsal of American place-names. For Enos Weed, the alphabetization of the map became the principal method of spelling instructions; his American Orthographer, part 2, The Geographical Spelling-Book (1798) had students practice their alphabetic skills in tables containing lists of place-names that, broken down into their syllabic components, imitated the stress and pauses of speech and also used the hyperextended printing of letters to demarcate geopolitical and cultural spaces on the map. With the emergence of schoolbooks like these, Webster's mapping gam- bit had succeeded beyond merely instituting place-names as a method- ology of language instruction. As a result of his spellers and reading books, an entire generation of American citizens studied the English lan- guage through the geographer's lexicon and the cartographer's mode of projection.15
cxqi | As much as the initial reading lessons of the early Republic revolved around Webster's oral approach, language instructions also depended on the visual pedagogy of the picture primer. In order to achieve an unmedi- ated, transparent relationship between words and the material world, or between signifiers and their signifieds, proponents of English language reforms embraced and emphasized pictorial instruction schemes. In fact, after the Revolution the programmatic dissemination of dozens of newly conceived illustrated primers became the disciplinary site through which
qfmx | the new citizens sought to train students into models of republican vir- tue and self-discipline. For such reformed primers, it was not only ques- tionable orthography or slippery grammatical systems that rendered lan- guage inherently volatile and therefore open to factious appropriation, but the very nature of written language itself. Pictures, instead of serving as supplements to written text, became a second language. Authors re- peatedly engaged a visual code to reimagine language and hoped to forge the new nation through this new language.16
