Reaction mechanisms of the two E T and two EPT channels for the water oxidation catalyst undergoing electrochemical P C E T. Schematic structures of O x, OxH+, Red-, RedH, and the associated complexes are labeled. The transferring proton is colored red. The charge given for each species includes the H sub three O plus and O H minus charges, which are therefore not shown explicitly.\nhy0l | Article\n4jmz | The apparent reduction rate constants k sub a p p superscript R e d were measured at p H equals one, three, and five at various applied potentials, thereby altering the driving force negative Delta G naught. The potential-dependent apparent rate constant of this interfacial E T slash P C E T system can be described by the MG theory, where the rate constant plateaus at a large driving force. Based on the experimentally measured p K sub a of the R u superscript three plus dash O H sub two complex attached to I T O, the mechanism was presumed to be E T at p H equals one but P C E T at p H equals three and five. At low p H, the axial ligand coordinated to R u is H sub two O, and therefore only E T is possible, but at higher p H, the ligand coordinated to R u is O H, and E T is accompanied by proton transfer to the O H ligand to generate a water ligand. A weak p H dependence was observed for the overall process. When the p H increases from three to five, the maximum rate constant only decreases by around three-fold rather than decreasing one hundred-fold, as would be expected according to a model based on a single P C E T pathway with H sub three O plus as the proton donor, or being p H-independent, as would be expected according to a model based on a single P C E T pathway with H sub two O as the proton donor.\nb7cq | R u superscript two plus dash O H sub two. Here, we focus on the P C E T process associated with the reduction of the R u superscript three plus catalyst attached to I T O. The two E T and two EPT channels, as well as O x, OxH+, Red, and RedH for this process, are depicted in Figure Three. As no buffer solution was added in the experiments, the diagram in Figure One gives a complete set of the possible E T and EPT channels in this system, which is recreated using system-specific notation in Figure Four. The experimental rate constant was obtained by analyzing the absorbance change of the R u superscript two plus catalyst (the product) as a function of time. In this system, the R u superscript three plus catalyst, which is the reactant, is generated by photoexcitation. The equilibrium assumption thus requires P T and complex association to be faster than E T and EPT. This assumption is reasonable for this system in the p H and potential range studied experimentally (see the S I). Note that the experimental measurement of the change in total concentration of the reduced species (i.e., the R u superscript two plus catalyst) is consistent with our\n0b39 | kinetic model, which tracks the total concentrations of the reduced and oxidized species.\nqecd | Prior to analyzing the experimental data, we introduce certain physically motivated assumptions regarding the parameters. We can estimate the values of K sub one and K sub two using density functional theory calculations in conjunction with the experimentally measured p K sub a, O x and p K sub a Red. These calculations lead to estimates of K sub one approximately ten to the power of zero point two and K sub two less than ten to the power of four point five. Furthermore, since the potential-dependent rate constant can be well described by MG theory, the maximum rate constant has the same expression for both E T and\n1o7p | EPT superscript nineteen k sub max equals open parenthesis two pi divided by h bar close parenthesis rho open parenthesis epsilon sub F close parenthesis absolute value V sub e l absolute value squared",
