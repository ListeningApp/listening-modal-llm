        "content": "dgcw | Nine point three point three point two Cross-shelf distribution\ngvwz | Pacific hake form dense daytime aggregations on the continental shelf break and near the edges of mid-shelf banks and basins, sometimes extending forty kilometers or more offshore over water depths as great as two thousand meters. Pacific hake are found primarily between depths of fifty and five hundred meters during the day, most commonly in aggregations at depths of between one hundred fifty and two hundred fifty meters.\nsk5m | From south to north in the CCLME, Pacific hake aggregations increase in depth and move further offshore along the continental shelf to the shelf break. This pattern probably reflects ontogenetic effects on depth preferences, that is, smaller, younger juvenile fish do not migrate as far north as older Pacific hake, and juvenile Pacific hake exhibit a greater preference for shallower shelf locations than mature fish. At least in some years, hake have been shown to be preferentially aggregated off the shelf break at the depth of the sub-surface poleward-flow of the California Undercurrent.\nqws8 | Temperature gradients may be an important mechanism driving Pacific hake depth distribution, but preferred temperature ranges for Pacific hake have not been established. The distribution of Pacific hake across years demonstrates that they are able to live within a range of temperatures. Temperature and depth are correlated with other factors, including currents and prey availability. Swartzman suggests that euphausiids sense and orient to oceanographic factors and Pacific hake sense and orient to euphausiids.\n877u | Biology, fisheries, assessment and management of Pacific hake\nrzhj | Nine point three point three point three Diel migrations\nbfax | Adult Pacific hake form pelagic schools during the day, mostly between the depths of fifty and five hundred meters, then disperse and migrate towards the surface at dusk; during spawning, they neither feed nor migrate vertically. The vertical migration is usually thought to facilitate predation upon fish and zooplankton in the water column and may be influenced by several factors, as observed in other marine fishes.\nf2y8 | Nine point three point four Prey and predation\no7qm | Pacific hake is both an important food source for many predators and likely the most important consumer of zooplankton and forage fish in the CCLME. Larvae and smaller juvenile hake feed on copepod eggs, copepods and juvenile euphausiids. The diet of large juveniles and adults is composed primarily of euphausiids, fish and pandalid shrimp, with evidence of adult cannibalism on juveniles. The amount of spatial overlap and cannibalism between adult and juvenile fish varies annually in response to environmental and demographic factors as discussed previously. Larger zooplankton and fish become more important dietary components as Pacific hake grow. Pacific hake are usually considered to be opportunistic feeders, particularly upon schooling or aggregating prey. The daily ration for juvenile and adult Pacific hake has been estimated variously between zero point four percent and three point five percent of body weight. Euphausiids nearly always appear as a very important component of the Pacific hake diet, but some studies have demonstrated seasonal and inter-annual changes in the mix of prey types utilized throughout the CCLME. These shifts include from primarily euphausiid prey (primarily Thysanoessa spinifera) to increased consumption of Pacific herring in late summer off Vancouver Island and during the nineteen ninety-seven to nineteen ninety-eight El Ni√±o, and from mostly fish prey to euphausiids in the summertime off Oregon and Washington.\nd52l | Pacific hake are also important prey for other species. Pacific hake embryos and larvae are preyed upon by copepods, amphipods and gelatinous zooplankton. Pacific hake juveniles and adults are also prey for other nekton, including dogfish, sablefish, lingcod,\nqlbb | Hakes\nnhsg | arrowtooth flounder, rockfishes and tunas, as well as apex predators such as California sea lions, Steller sea lions, harbor seals, sperm whales and other toothed whales, sooty shearwaters, western gulls and common murres. The predation of Humboldt squid upon adult Pacific hake has recently received attention, as these squid have become periodically more common in the northern CCLME. In particular, the northward expansion of Humboldt squid in two thousand nine resulted in considerable overlap in depth and geographic range with Pacific hake. This hake forms an important link between upper and lower trophic levels in the CCLME.\nhy0l | Nine point three point five Population dynamics\n4jmz | Pacific hake live more than twenty years, attaining lengths of over fifty centimeters of total length, with fifty percent reaching maturity by the age of four years, at about thirty-seven centimeters. Dorn et al. estimated a natural mortality rate of zero point two three per year. Hamel and Stewart used a meta-analytical approach incorporating multiple life-history correlates to develop a log-normal prior for M with mean zero point one nine three per year.",
