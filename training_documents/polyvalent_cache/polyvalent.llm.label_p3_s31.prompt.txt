You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

zxz6 | An explanation of the derivation of ª ratios is presented in the Supporting Information (eqs S24-S27). Equation 7 is derived in the Supporting Information as eq S29. This approach (first proposed by Friguet21) enables the comparison of a signal from total phage active sites and partially saturated phages. The ratio 4 (eq 7) refers to the ratio of the signal recorded for partially occupied phage's active sites in a mixture of TnT and phage (a) and the signal recorded in the absence of soluble TnT (a0) which may be interpreted as a signal from all active sites. Experimental determination of the ª ratio is a0 necessary to calculate the [TnT] Ka ratio, which is crucial for further analysis.
xnth | Theoretically, a correlation between the concentration of phage-exposed active sites and a measured signal may be approximated in at least two ways. According to the first
vafm | Article
2zmw | approach, the ELISA signal is linearly proportional to the concentration of phages exposing at least one active site or linearly proportional to the logarithm of the concentration of these forms (Supporting Information, eqs S28 and S30, respectively). The signal tends to be proportional to the logarithm of concentration in a wide range of concentrations and linear in a specified narrow range. On the other hand, the signal may be proportional to the total concentration of active sites, i.e., to the concentration of each TnT-phage complex ([M13-(TnT)¡]) with an assumption of their stoichiometry (eq S29). Logarithmic interpretation of this case might also be considered (eq S31). Friguet's model21 and the model presented in this work are focused on a linear approximation of the signal-concentration function. However, this work extends the original Friguet model with calculations for non- monovalent systems, which has not been analyzed earlier. To our knowledge, it is the first attempt to comprehensively study relations between a receptor (a phage exposing specific peptides) and ligands (target protein) at the equilibrium stage during an ELISA test. It is important to mention that only for linear approximation it is possible to present the ª ª0 ratio independent from co113. This fact is a significant advantage due to difficulties in precise measuring of physical phage particle concentration. As a substitute, a biological titer of phages (in plaque-forming units per milliliter) is used in the literature and this work. Another attempt to develop a method enabling more accurate determination of phage concentration was spectrophotometrically measuring phages' ssDNA in the sample. 31,32 This method is not recommended for phage samples obtained via PEG precipitation.33 The true physical concentration may be determined via mass spectrometry34 under the assumption of a certain pVIII protein number per virion. Nevertheless, during ELISA, one also measures a signal from phage particles unable to infect bacteria and/or activate dye metabolism, which may cause a difference between physical phage concentration and biological titer. Also, Friguet's original paper21 avoids the requirement of antibody concentration, which enables calculations for impure antibod- ies (with mixed specificity). The important assumption claiming that the signal measured in ELISA (a) is a linear function of the active sites (of antibodies in Friguet's paper or phages in this work) was shown empirically in both works. Possible differences between linear and logarithmic interpre- tation are discussed in the Supporting Information (eqs S28- S31). Application of the discussed model in this case is possible only for linear approximation of concentration-signal dependence, as was also stated in Friguet's work. The experiments presented in this work were designed to fulfil Friguet's assumption, and therefore the obtained data does not allow examination of the logarithmic approach. A detailed discussion of the systems in which logarithmic approximation is preferred extends the frames of this investigation and may be studied in future work.
bf9k | Calculation of the ratio [InTl Ka is possible analytically for 1:1 (eq 8) and 1:2 stoichiometry, but in the second case, expressions are very complicated (eq S35), so numerical methods are recommended to solve them. For higher valences, the ratios - have to be calculated numerically. Ka

7wn9 | During an ELISA experiment, as proposed by Friguet,21 a constant concentration of phages is incubated with different concentrations of TnT. Saturation of phages (in solution) by soluble TnT limits the ability of phages to bind to immobilized TnT, and therefore, increasing concentration of TnT causes a decrease in signal from the phages, in our case, the M13. Theoretically, two options have to be discussed: (1) a signal (a) is generated for each phage with at least one unoccupied active site (eq 11) and (2) a signal (a) is generated to the total concentration of unoccupied active

caos | The first variant would be more probable for high <LATEX>\mathrm { T n T }</LATEX> surface density (significantly higher capability than phages present in solution) where phages are mostly bound to the layer. According to the second variant, it is also possible that the recognition and binding process is slow enough to make the reaction kinetically limited. In this case, phages with a higher number of free active sites are more likely to be bound than more saturated ones. Nevertheless, the incubation times

5z6q | Bio-Panning. In each bio-panning round, the input and output phases were titrated immediately before or after the experiment. The results of titrations are shown in Table 1. The presented mean <LATEX>p \left( O / I \right)</LATEX> value for each bio-panning round may be interpreted as the efficiency of phage binding. In chemical nomenclature, <LATEX>p \left( x \right)</LATEX> is defined as <LATEX>- \log \left( x \right) ,</LATEX> so a higher <LATEX>p \left( O / I \right)</LATEX> means a lower ratio of phage output-input. The <LATEX>p \left( O / I \right)</LATEX> value for the first panning round is relatively low. However, usage of more concentrated Tween-20 (from 0.1 to 0.5%) causes a significant increase in <LATEX>p \left( O / I \right)</LATEX> values for the second round (around 4) despite a higher phage input. In addition, there is a difference between the second and the third <LATEX>p \left( O / I \right) ,</LATEX> which may be interpreted as an enrichment of TnT-binders in the phage pool, and it is the main aim of bio-panning via phage display. The increase in phage recovery yield is a widely reported observation by manufacturers and other au- thors. 14,17,35,36

It is worth mentioning that both TnT- and BSA-precoated wells were blocked with the same 0.1% BSA solution, so BSA was present in each well in significant excess. Nevertheless, the presence of TnT causes a noticeable increase of signal, which may suggest a higher affinity of clones to TnT than BSA. Signals from wells that do not contain phages (blank sample) and wild-type phage, which does not expose any peptide, are at least 2 to 5

The significant drawback of this experiment is the inequality of concentrations of different clones because although all solutions were about 1010 pfu/mL, the exact value of the pre-exponential factor differed. Nevertheless, a comparison of the signal of each clone for TnT and BSA reveals a difference.
863b | Analysis of Exposed Peptides on the Selected TnT- Binding Phages. Sequencing of a fragment of gene encoding pIII minor coat protein showed the presence of 12-amino-acids peptide at the N-terminus in almost all phages. Simultaneous analysis of the sequenced variants (Table 2.) shows some conservative motifs in all four independent phage pools recovered after 3 rounds of bio-panning. The peptides DHAQRYGAGHSG (frequency 4 out of 16 proper sequences) and QMGFMTSPKHSV (frequency 8/16 proper sequences) are the most abundant. The isoelectric point (calculated using the online tool https://PepCalc.com/)37 of almost all sequenced peptides is above pH 7.4. The recognition steps were performed in PBS, making these peptides positively charged. This result may suggest that these peptides interact with TnT via electrostatic interactions because, in these conditions, the N-terminal region of TnT27,38 is negatively charged. In these peptides, predominantly hydrophilic amino acids with hydrogen bond donor groups are present, enabling them to interact with the glutamate-rich regions (which may act as hydrogen bond acceptors). Interaction with the negatively charged helical N-terminus may play a crucial role in recognizing the cardiac TnT isoform due to the tissue- specificity of this region. 27,38 In conserved central and C- terminal TnT regions, there is a low number of aromatic amino acids (Phe: 6, His: 4, Trp: 3, Tyr: 4); however, this fact and the coincidence with the conservation of His residue in most of the peptides may suggest possible sites of interaction via T-T stacking. Additional studies are needed to prove the site where selected peptides may interact with TnT; however, the mentioned conserved positively charged peptides and His residue give hope that the site is located in the cardiac-specific N-terminal region.
