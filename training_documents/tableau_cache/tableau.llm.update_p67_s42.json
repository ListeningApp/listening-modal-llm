In the upper-right corner under Filters, click on Add.\n6sbj | Two. Click on Add again.\nd8m4 | Three. Select the field that you wish to filter. We filtered on Measure.\nx6o5 | Four. Since Measure is a measure and not a dimension, we see a continuous spectrum of values. But we want to include everything except null values.\niw9a | Five. Click on the Special button on the upper-right side.\ndni7 | Six. Click on Non-null values.\nuhfc | Seven. Click on OK.\nx4b2 | Eight. Click on OK again.\npbg2 | The data source shows values of zero, but not null. The data source is almost complete. The only item that is remaining before we can start using filter is joining it with another table in the same data source.\n0oy0 | Chapter Three\nlr84 | Joining tables\n0vq1 | In this exercise, we will join the fact table with a dimension of the countries so that we can group the countries by region. A join is a logic statement in which you tell Tableau's data engine how two tables are related to each other. There are two parts to it, the join types the left join, inner join, right join, or outer join and the join conditions.\ngkya | The left join: This keeps all the records from the left or first table and the corresponding records from the right or second table.\nc2iz | The inner join: This keeps only the records from both the tables that match the join condition.\nya41 | The right join: It is the opposite of the left join; it keeps all the records from the right table and only the corresponding records from the left table. Outer joins keep all the fields from all the tables.\naa56 | The availability of join types depends on your data source. For this data source, we can create an inner join or a left join.\nqfgp | A join condition is where you tell Tableau Public's data engine, which is functioning as a database management system in this case, how the two tables are related. In order to join tables, you need to have at least one field whose contents occur in both tables. In the following example, we will join our tables by the country name so that we can see the corresponding region for each country.\nyu1c | \n1j33 | Tableau Public will automatically join your tables on the first fields that occur alphabetically in both the tables and have the exact same field name and field type.\nk3a8 | In order to add new tables, you need to drag them from the list of tables on the left into the workspace next to the existing tables:\n2s31 | One. Drag the Country Metadata table into the workspace and drop it next to the Environmental Fact Table.\notwe | Two. Tableau Public automatically detects the field that occurs first in both data sources alphabetically and has the following properties:\n4cb7 | The exact same field name, including capitalization and punctuation\n9wka | The same field type\n9gxs | Connecting to Data\ne8ks | Three. You can view and edit the Join details by clicking on the Venn diagram icon between the tables, as shown in the following screenshot. In this case, our data sources are joined by Country Code, which is correct. In order to select different fields, click on the name of the joined field and replace it with someone more appropriate:\n072r | Four. When you are satisfied that the join condition is correct, click on the Venn diagram icon again.\ntqrj | \nmjm3 | The additional fields, with their source table name appended in parentheses, are included in the data set below the workspace.\nlji8 | Five. Just because a field is included in a join condition, it does not mean that you need to load it in the workbook. You also do not need duplicates of existing fields. For that reason, click on the Country Name Country Metadata and Country Code Country Metadata fields, which already occur in the fact table, and from their context menus, select Hide, as shown in the following screenshot:\ncser | Six. If you would like to see the fields that you have hidden, click on the checkbox next to the Show Hidden Fields text above the data source.\nhjvn | Chapter Three\ndm7r | The data source is now ready to be used in a visualization. To create a visualization, click on a sheet number or name in the ribbon at the bottom. If you'd like to get back to the data source, you can click on the data source icon from any worksheet.\n4j98 | When you load a new data source, the following are some of the several items that you should check before you can use it:\n98sg | Confirm that all the dimensions are in fact in the Dimensions pane, rather than in the Measures pane\n9c31 | Confirm that the data source types of all the fields are correct. For instance, in this data source, Year is formatted as a string, but it really should be a number\nc399 | We can change the data type by right-clicking on the field, selecting Change Data Type, and choosing Number whole\nzqx9 | Connecting to web-based data sources\n87zy | The steps required to connect to OData are different from the steps required to connect to the previously mentioned sources because they involve web servers and network security. These steps are a subset of the steps in Desktop Professional that are used to connect to a server:\ng2ke | One. Enter the URL of the website.\nek4d | Two. Select the authentication method.\nodgr | Three. Establish the connection.\nvbm1 | Four. Name the data source.\nsmtx | Connecting to Data\n7euw | Another big difference between using local sources and online sources is that while the local sources can be refreshed with just a right-click on the data source name, online sources must connect to the website, which needs to be refreshed.\nysjg | In order to refresh a web-based data source, perform the following steps:\n8zjq | One. Right-click on the data source name in the data pane.\nr9c6 | Two. Click on Edit Connection.\nh1z1 | Three. In the previous dialog box, which will be populated with the connection parameters, click on the Connect button in step three of the preceding list. It isn't necessary to repopulate the connection parameters or create a new connection to refresh the data.\nea3z | Check out the visualization in the following screenshot, where we used this data source to graph the average C O two emissions per capita by region since nineteen eighty:\nu37t | Summary\n989u | In this chapter, you learned one of the most critical concepts of using Tableau Public and producing accurate, informative data visualizations- connecting to, transforming, and loading data. The precepts that we discussed, such as making sure that your data source is clean and formatted properly, are relevant to working with data.\nbfwg | In the next chapter, we will discuss the different types of visualizations that you can make with your data and how to use each type correctly and in the most compelling manner.\no74e | Four Visualization Tips and Types\n1638 | A journalist or blogger who uses Tableau Public must convert data to visualizations so that readers can quickly understand large quantities of data that have been distilled down to a single graphic. The role of an author is data abstraction, the conversion of real-life data into visual cues, primitives, as some people who work in the field of data science call them, such as colors, shapes, lengths, and positions. The role of your reader is to do the reverse, consume data primitives and convert them back into real-life things, events, and phenomenon. If you have done a poor job choosing the elements of your data visualization, your readers will have a difficult time relating your visualization to the real world, which means that the story that you're telling isn't as compelling as it should be. Your visualization will not have the value that you wanted, because the connection between the data visualization and the underlying data has been broken.\n80ko | Before you create a visualization for people to utilize, there are several considerations that go into the design. The following are some of these considerations:\n```",
