        "content": "zeew | The superficially religious apply 'tests' for sincerity which enable ignorance and misunderstanding to continue.\nrwxl | THE BEDOUIN TEACHER\nsb5f | Rumi brings us a fine analogy of this, showing how people in judging things from ignorance of the facts, come to false conclusions.\ngea4 | In this tale, a bedouin was listening to another man saying prayers. He began by repeating a passage from the Koran, where it is said, in Chapter Nine ('Repentance') verses ninety-seven onwards:\n1jlx | 'The Arabs of the desert are the worst in unbelief and hypocrisy ... '\nzf33 | Infuriated, the Arab gave him a blow on the head.\nybbd | The man at prayer continued the quotation, coming to the passage:\nzwjo | ... But some of the desert Arabs believe in God and in the Last Day ..\nhjzx | That's better!' said the bedouin, 'now I have taught you how to behave .. . '\nff68 | Here the bedouin stands for the superficial and assumption-prone part of the mind of the literalist religious person, whose 'faith' seems demonstrably based on conduct, and whose assessment of the faith of others is based on his own imagination of what the other person's beliefs mean.\nlcmg | Rumi's bedouin and our questioner about sincerity could have made this test, had they known of it, to think of the aphorism:\nlq9c | 'If you think that you are not self-deluded, just check whether you think well of yourself or not.'\nbir8 | The Would-Be and Should-be people\ni2k7 | THERE can be all the difference in the world between the would-be followers of the Tradition and the should-be followers.\nsuwg | Each of them may have the necessary capacity.\nvikl | The should-be ones could very well never have heard of metaphysics. They could even hate the idea of esotericism. Nowadays there are still very many people who have no ideas about-nor interest in-religion, mysticism, 'things of the mind': though they are fewer every day.\nmtia | The would-be ones are those who have been attracted at some time or other to a scrap of genuine inner activity. They may have met some person, engaged in some such activity, read some literature. They are would-bes because they believe that because they have heard about something, might even have tried to practise it, for that reason they have a right to it.\necym | In general, close contact with the would-be shows that his interest is comparatively shallow. He is guilty, as the psychologist would claim, of desiring a system which fits in with preconceptions, seeking no more than to achieve any kind of personal equilibrium.\nsmx6 | He may have the capacity. Most frequently he does not have the necessary attitude. He will tend, of course, to believe that he has got the right attitude. He will accuse others of not having it.\n1hnf | Both types need education in Sufi evolutionary philosophy, initially by means of familiarisation with its viewpoints and some of its materials. This is difficult because few general-purpose expositions of this material exist contrary to the popularised belief that 'it must be in books': or, 'I won't bother with books, but I will get it from someone in the flesh.' But this is why there are, and always have been, Sufi schools. This is one reason why the schools take, to the crude observer, mystifyingly diverse outward forms.\n7nua | As the Akhlaq-i-Muhsini says:\ny2rt | The bird which knows not of sweet water Has his beak in salt water all the year.\nf5lz | IS YOUR BEAK IN SALT WATER?\ncdcu | This salt water, in the mind of the Sufi, is what is otherwise called 'The World'. The ordinary person imagines that that which he more instantly perceives, like material objects and obvious (to him) thoughts, must logically be what is more real. But the Sufi says that so-called concrete things are not experienced but inferred.\n8zkf | You infer fire from smoke, and smoke may appear to be real, but its underlying reality is the fire. When this habit of assuming that instantly perceptible things are more important than more subtle ones goes, the latter become perceptible. Sufi study is devoted to this task.\nkcxe | It is for this reason that the great Sheikh Abdul-Karim Jili says:\nve8e | Truth, reality is felt, perceived:\nyyym | The world is inferred.\nxgow | As long as one regards what are in fact secondary things (including one's secondary, conditioned self) as primary, the subtler but more real primary element-Reality and the Essence of the individual-will not be perceived.\n31z2 | A MEETING WITH THREE DERVISHES\nczp3 | I met three dervishes in the Middle East, and asked them whether they had ever encountered any Seekers from the West. 'Frequently' they told me. I asked them if they ever taught these people anything. 'This is what happens' one of them said. 'They come to us and say \"Teach us\", and we start to try, sitting before them or leaving them there and retreating to communicate by direct perception.' I wondered what happened next. 'Always the same thing. After two or three days they set off again, complaining that we are not doing what we said we would do.'\nkqfo | Satisfactions and Purpose of Ritual\n7hgo | Q: We see people all over the world deriving satisfactions from ritual. How can we get beyond ritual?\n0g5b | A: Initiation and celebratory rituals carried out by religions, societies and other groupings can have various-very different-origins, purposes and functions.\nqdgv | We might liken all these purposes, origins and functions to, say the various processes which are known to and carried out in any given science. In chemistry, distillation is not the same as fermentation; the use of alkalis is not the same as the use of acids. There is both industrial and research chemistry.\n7bvf | In the case of the science of man, there are similar distinctions.\nq4ev | WHEN RITUALISM STARTS\n4vmp | When the knowledge of these distinctions disappears, ritualism takes over, or else the limited use of such processes. When the use and possibility is limited, the effect is slight: it may even be harmful. As Saadi says: 'Though the fire-worshipper may tend his flame for a hundred years, if he falls into it, he will be killed.'\nvk6x | Take prayer. When prayers are carried out among people with a certain preparation, and when due regard is taken for such things as correct attunement, there will be one effect of prayer. If people are encouraged to pray without these or other elements, their prayer may become a psychotherapeutic tool: immensely valuable, but nonetheless at a lower level than its optimum function.\ni27n | EMOTION MISTAKEN FOR HIGHER FEELINGS\npsyx | In such a case, emotional feelings are mistaken for spiritual ones. The only objection to such an activity is that a person or community triggered to associating prayer with emotion will be al-\ngdhe | most incapable of developing further, because the conditioning invariably elicited by the sight, sound or participation in prayer will be an emotional one.\nrf7l | Communities and individuals reared in the emotional and conditioned use of rituals and other procedures have to undergo a reorientation before they can perceive a higher content in such observances.\nxvsx | This is difficult, because such people generally seek a deepening of their familiar experience, not an improvement upon it.\ncs88 | Saadi says, in his Boston: 'Do not expect, my child, a reward from Omar, when you are working in the house of Zaid.'\nkgsq | DEFINITION OF A SUFI\nxe2x | To learn, people must give up a great deal, and this includes ritual as something from which they imagine they might learn. It is to emphasize this that Abu-Yaqub al-Susi, quoted in Kalabadhi's Taaruf, states that the Sufi is 'One who does not care when something is taken from him, but who does not cease to seek for what he has not.'",
