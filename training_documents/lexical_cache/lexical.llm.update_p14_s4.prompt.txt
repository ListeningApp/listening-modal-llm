You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

1k9e | A single-syllable fragment (e.g., the first syllable of octopus or oktober) produced significant facilitation if it matched, but did not produce inhibition if it mismatched, i.e., was taken from a word with the contrasting stress pattern (Donselaar et al.,
5bjs | 2005); the same pattern appeared in a fragment priming study in German by Friedrich (2002). Friedrich, Kotz, and Gunter (2001) presented fragments of varying length, but did not use target pairs contrasting in onset stress such as octopus- oktober, so that (as in Donselaar et al.'s study with museum) no competition and hence no inhibition was involved; however, these authors found that facilitation did not significantly increase with increasing fragment size. The difference in inhibition due to the constraint in the competition process exercised by two syllables versus one is presumably a function of number of remaining potential competitors; after two syllables the competitor set will be smaller. In either case, cues to stress in the realization of word-initial portions are clearly used by listeners.
uodj | This series of studies on Spanish, Dutch, and German has brought the invest- igation of cues to stress into the currently accepted activation-competition frame- work of spoken-word recognition theory. Friedrich (2002) also measured evoked response potentials (ERPs), and found evidence for a difference in these measures between prime-target pairs which matched versus mismatched in F0 correlates of stress. It is to be expected that the coming years will see more studies of this issue using electrophysiological and brain imaging techniques. What is remarkable is that although, overall, most research on the perception of stress has been conducted on English, directly comparable experiments to those just described in Spanish, Dutch, and German have not been done in English. In fact there is good reason for this: directly analogous experiments are actually impossible. This is because of the strong tendency in English for any unstressed syllable adjacent to a stressed syllable to contain a reduced vowel. Thus there are effectively no such pairs in English as octopus/oktober in Dutch; the second syllable of English octopus, for instance, is reduced and hence has a different vowel than English October.
k16v | This does not however rule out partially comparable experiments. One pos- sibility in English is to compare pairs in which the stress placement contrast does not involve primary stress on the first syllable versus primary stress on the second syllable, but another placement contrast. In fact Soto-Faraco et al.'s (2001) stress experiment included some pairs contrasting primary stress on second versus third syllables (e.g., coMEdia 'comedy' versus comeDOR 'dining room'), and so did Donselaar et al.'s (2005) Dutch fragment priming experiment (e.g., dyNAmo 'dynamo' versus dynaMIET 'dynamite'). These are again not possible to match exactly with English examples; but a first- vs. third-syllable contrast in primary stress can be achieved. There are in fact many English pairs in which the second syllable is reduced in both, but primary stress is either on the first or the third syllable - e.g., admiral versus admiration. In such pairs a fragment comprising only the first two syllables (e.g., admi-) would in one case have primary stress plus a weak syllable, in the other secondary stress plus a weak syllable.
b2lm | Cooper, Cutler, and Wales (2002) carried out a fragment priming study using such English word pairs, and found clear evidence that English listeners too can make use of cues to stress in recognizing spoken words: admi- with primary stress on the first syllable activated ADMIRAL to a greater extent than ADMIRATION, while admi- with secondary stress on the first syllable activated ADMIRATION to a greater extent than ADMIRAL. Single-syllable fragments (e.g., mus- from music or museum) also produced facilitation when stress cues matched. Cooper et al. found, however, no evidence of inhibition from stress-mismatching primes, either with one- or two-syllable fragments; they argued that stress cues contribute less
ti7f | to resolution of inter-word competition in English than segmental information does, and in particular less than the wider range of stress contrasts contributes in Spanish and Dutch.
oksu | However, their results do show that English listeners can exploit suprasegmental stress cues in word recognition if they are given the opportunity. Cooper et al.'s conclusion thus modifies an earlier conclusion by Cutler (1986), reached on the basis of a priming study using not fragments but minimal stress pairs: for example FORbear versus forBEAR, or trusty versus trustee. Such pairs are rare but a few do exist in English. The task used was cross-modal priming of associated words: listeners were presented with sentences which were neutral until the occurrence of the critical pair, e.g .: The person that she was hurrying to see was the trusty/ trustee ... , and made lexical decisions about words presented visually at offset of the critical word in the sentence. Whichever member of the stress pair had been heard, listeners' responses to associates of both members of the pair were facilitated in comparison to control words. Cutler argued that the undoubted suprasegmental differences between, for instance, FORbear and forBEAR were ineffective in constraining lexical activation, so that for English listeners forbear was effect- ively a homophone. L. Slowiaczek (personal communication) reached the same conclusion on the basis of the finding that phrase-stress and compound-stress realizations of sequences such as green house primed associates related to both. The findings of Cooper et al. (2002) suggest, however, that the proposed inutility of stress cues in the initial stages of lexical activation does not extend to all types of stress contrast in English. Note that a cross-modal priming study in Dutch, planned as a direct replication of Cutler's (1986) experiment, failed to find significant priming at all by initially-stressed members of minimal stress pairs (VOORnaam 'firstname'), and inconsistent results for finally-stressed tokens (voorNAAM 'respectable') (Jongenburger & van Heuven, 1995a; Jongenburger, 1996), despite the other clear evidence for the use of stress cues in activation in Dutch; studies of minimal pairs may thus not provide the best window on the exploitation of stress information.
wtow | 11.3.2 Lexical selection
o22k | Other types of word recognition studies, using tasks which do not tap into the early activation and competition stages, also show that listeners exploit stress cues in distinguishing between spoken words. Connine, Clifton, and Cutler (1987), for example, asked listeners to categorize an ambiguous consonant (varying along a continuum between [d] and [t]) in either DIgress-TIgress (in which tigress is a real word) or diGRESS-tiGRESS (in which digress is a real word). Listeners' responses showed effects of stress-determined lexical status, in that /t/ was reported more often for the DIgress-TIgress continuum, but /d/ more often for the diGRESS-tiGRESS continuum. The listeners clearly could use the stress information in the signal, and in their stored representations of these words, to resolve the phonetic ambiguity. However, this does not entail that knowing stress patterns in advance can facilitate access to the stored representations of words. Cutler and Clifton (1984) examined the effects of providing such information in a word recognition task, by comparing recognition of the same words in a blocked-
nwfz | presentation condition (all items presented were bisyllabic and initially stressed, for example) versus a mixed condition. They found that neither visual nor auditory lexical decision was speeded by prior specification of stress pattern.
