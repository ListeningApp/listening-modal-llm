You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

pk06 | A female researcher (L.B.) with a background in psychology and palliative care research (B.Sc., M.Sc.) conducted the interviews in participants' preferred locations, between October 2018 and April 2019. L.B. had previous training in qualitative research and experience in conducting interviews with people with serious illness and their families. L.B. was not known to participants before the interviews.
7wn9 | The interviews followed a
wcd0 | semistructured interview topic guide (online supplement E1) developed with input from people with lived experience relevant to both COPD and frailty, and their informal carers (service user representatives). The topic guide explored participants' current health and priorities, support and unmet needs, and expectations and experiences of pulmonary rehabilitation. On the advice of the service user representatives, the researcher identified and used participants' own language in relation to frailty, for example, slowing down, difficulties walking, lack of strength or energy. Service user representatives also prompted the researcher to consider the participant's assets and resilience in addition to limitations. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. The researcher completed detailed field notes to describe interview flow, contextual factors, participant responses, and initial reflections immediately after each interview.
caos | Data collection continued until the data set was deemed to be approaching thematic saturation (34) (i.e., rich data with breadth and depth in relation to the study objectives, with evidence of replication across several participants [35]). To determine potential thematic saturation, we conducted a preliminary analysis of the detailed reflective field notes, considering the above definition while also reflecting on Malterud and colleagues' (36) dimensions of information power. These dimensions consider the data in relation to the breadth of the study aim, sample specificity, level of existing contributing theory, dialogue quality, and the need for cross-case analysis.
qrvy | Analysis
pn9j | We conducted a reflexive thematic analysis to identify patterns of meaning within the data (37). First, one researcher (L.B.) familiarized themselves with the data through revisiting the audio recordings, transcripts, and field notes. They generated initial codes to capture meaningful basic elements of the data in relation to the study objectives. A service user representative with qualitative analysis training (M.O.) also familiarized themselves with, and generated initial codes for, a sample of the data. Meanings were primarily considered at a semantic (explicit) level, but with consideration of latent (implicit) interpretations. L.B. inductively generated themes by reviewing and refining codes, and writing definitions accompanied by illustrative quotes. The themes and related codes were refined using three processes: revisiting the original interview data to ensure fair interpretation, comparing our findings with existing theory to assess if this may deepen our understanding, and review
1pmc | by stakeholders with differing backgrounds to work toward a richer and more nuanced understanding of the data (38). The latter included review by coauthors from different disciplines (e.g., nursing, physiotherapy) and representing relevant academic, clinical, and service user experiences. Finally, we constructed a narrative of the findings, with reference to illustrative quotes. Although described as a linear process, we moved forward and backward between the stages as thinking changed and progressed.
