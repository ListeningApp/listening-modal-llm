        "content": "sc5y | One respiratory specimen (a minimum of four milliliters) and one stool specimen (a minimum of three grams) were collected per child. Xpert was performed at JUMC Laboratory from respiratory specimens as part of the routine practice at the medical center, whereas tuberculosis culture and stool Xpert were performed at Jimma University Mycobacterium Research Center for the research purposes.\n0yab | The respiratory samples were collected as per the standard of care. The treating physician collected single gastric aspirate or expectorated sputum. Gastric aspirate samples were collected early in the morning through nasogastric tube following an overnight fasting and tested by Xpert and LJ culture. Expectorated sputum instead of gastric aspirate was used in the patients who were able to produce sputum.\nw95z | Respiratory specimens were divided into two parts; the first part was diluted two to one by volume with Xpert sample reagent, followed by vigorous shaking and incubation at room temperature for fifteen minutes. Then, two milliliters of liquefied specimen was aspirated using sterile pipette provided with Xpert kit and added to Xpert cartridge and loaded into the GeneXpert instrument to run the test. The results were reported to the treating physicians as soon as possible for participants' management.\n0i1k | Xpert MTB/RIF for the diagnosis of childhood tuberculosis\ndqlg | The second part of respiratory specimen was neutralized with phosphate buffered solution immediately after collection and stored at four to eight degrees Celsius for two to three days until processing for culture. Equal volume of N-acetyl-L-Cysteine and four percent sodium hydroxide solution were added to the fifty milliliters specimen tube. After mixing on the vortex, the sample tube was left standing for twenty minutes at room temperature for liquefaction and decontamination. Then, sterile phosphate buffered solution (pH six point eight) was added up to forty-five milliliters to neutralize the alkaline solution, followed by centrifugation at three thousand g for fifteen minutes. After discarding the supernatant, the pellet was re-suspended in two milliliters phosphate buffered solution and two drops of the resulting diluted deposit was inoculated on the slants of LJ medium.\np6pq | Stool specimen (approximately three to five grams) was collected in a wide-mouthed specimen collection jar on spot or submitted the following day and was stored at negative twenty degrees Celsius until processed as described previously. Stool Xpert was performed by single step, centrifuge-free stool processing protocol adapted from KNCV tuberculosis foundation. Briefly, one gram of thawed stool was transferred to fifty milliliters falcon tube using wooden applicator stick; eight milliliters of sample reagent was poured in the sample tube and mixed very well, and left undisturbed for twenty minutes at room temperature. The supernatant was carefully aspirated and added to Xpert cartridge using sterile pipette.\nzse6 | Diagnostic classification for analysis\np2n3 | Children were classified into three categories based on their clinical, radiological, and laboratory results. (i) \"Confirmed tuberculosis\" :- child has symptoms suggestive of tuberculosis and tuberculosis disease is confirmed microbiologically (positive gastric aspirate Xpert and/or culture); (ii) \"Unconfirmed tuberculosis\" :- child has at least two of the following: symptoms suggestive of tuberculosis, chest radiograph consistent with tuberculosis, or documented exposure to MTB and positive response to ATT but tuberculosis disease is not confirmed microbiologically (negative gastric aspirate Xpert and/or culture); (iii) \"Unlikely tuberculosis\" :- no criteria for \"Unconfirmed tuberculosis\" was met and tuberculosis is not confirmed microbiologically (negative gastric aspirate Xpert and/or culture). CRS is defined as either confirmed tuberculosis or unconfirmed tuberculosis in the definition of tuberculosis and cases that met \"unlikely tuberculosis\" criteria were classified as not tuberculosis.\nohh7 | Data analysis\nvbni | Data were entered in Epidata version three point three and analyzed using SPSS software package version twenty. The Xpert sensitivity, specificity, positive, and negative predictive values and their ninety-five percent confidence intervals were calculated using the following as one of the reference standards: i) LJ culture alone; ii) LJ culture and/or Xpert (confirmed tuberculosis); and iii) composite reference standard (CRS) (confirmed tuberculosis and unconfirmed tuberculosis). Differences and similarities between the two methods (stool Xpert versus gastric aspirate Xpert) was determined based on the ninety-five percent confidence intervals. Non-overlapping ninety-five percent confidence intervals indicated a difference between the two methods (stool Xpert versus gastric aspirate Xpert) and vice versa.\ndgcw | Ethical consideration\ngvwz | Ethical approval was obtained from Institutional Review Board of Jimma University, Ethiopia. We obtained written informed consent from parents or legal guardians of children and assent from children above ten years old.\nsk5m | Results Characteristics of study participants\nqws8 | A total of one hundred seventy-eight children with presumptive pulmonary tuberculosis were enrolled to the study. Out of these, twenty-six children were excluded from the final analysis: seventeen were unable to provide stool specimen and nine\n877u | Xpert MTB/RIF for the diagnosis of childhood tuberculosis",
