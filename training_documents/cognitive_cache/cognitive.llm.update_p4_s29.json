This is a simplifying assumption to reduce the number of parameters in equation two. We chose this simplification, following Draney, Wilson and Pirolli, because we are focused on refining the cognitive model rather than evaluating student knowledge growth.\n0b39 | Three. Some productions are more likely to be known than others. Thus, we use an intercept parameter for each production.\nqecd | Four. Some productions are easier to learn than others. Thus, we need a slope parameter for each production.\n1o7p | Based on the assumptions, we developed a multiple logistic regression model.\ncp13 | In two equals sum of alpha chi plus sum of beta y plus sum of gamma y t.\nbgre | \n57lp | Where\nukth | P equals the probability to get an item right\nkpvt | X equals the covariates for students\njie2 | Y equals the covariates for skills\nd0ik | T equals the covariates for the number of opportunities practiced on the skills\n0x0s | Y T equals the covariates for interaction between skill and the number of practice opportunities for that skill\n4exe | Alpha equals the coefficient for each student, i.e. the student intercept\n0myz | Beta equals the coefficient for each rule, i.e. the production intercept\nxh3i | Gamma equals the coefficient for the interaction between a production and its opportunities, i.e. the production slope.\nsyiw | Four point two. Difficulty Factors\nkg3t | A difficulty factor refers specifically to a property of the problem that causes student difficulties. By assessing the performance difference on pairs of problems that vary by one factor at a time, we can identify the hidden knowledge components that can be used to improve a cognitive model. Difficulty factors have been used to empirically evaluate a small number of alternative models.\nlvae | In our study, subject experts identified four multi-valued factors for the Area Unit of the Geometry Tutor. Table two lists their names and values.\no9sc | \"Embed\" indicates whether a shape is embedded in another shape. Consider two tutor problems requiring the same production rule CIRCLE-AREA at some step in the problem. In one of the problems, the circle is embedded in a square; while in the other one, the circle is presented alone. Students may find it harder to find the area of circle when it is embedded in another figure because extra effort is necessary to find the circle and its radius. \"Backward\" means whether the production rule to be used is in its backward form of a taught formula, or its forward form. The forward form of Compose-by-addition is S equals S one plus S two, and its backward form is S one equals S minus S two. \"Repeat\" indicates whether the production rule has been used previously in the same problem. \"FigurePart\" indicates the part of the figure in the geometry shape to be computed.\n121u | Four point three. Combinatorial Search\nzh03 | The goal of the combinatorial search is to do model selection within the logistic regression model space. Difficulty factors are incorporated into an existing cognitive model through a model operator called Binary Split, which splits a skill with a factor value, and a skill without the factor value. For example, splitting production Circle-area by factor Embed with value alone leads to two productions: Circle-area with the factor value alone, and Circle-area with the factor value embed. Table three shows the data before and after a split with Embed.\n1mvw | Table three. The data before and after split. Factors are incorporated in column Skill. The opportunities change accordingly.\n6d4s | A star search is the combinatorial search algorithm in Learning Factors Analysis. It starts from an initial node, iteratively creates new adjoining nodes, explores them to reach a goal node. To limit the search space, it employs a heuristic to rank each node and visits the nodes in order of this heuristic estimate.\nmqah | In our study, the initial node is the existing cognitive model. Its adjoining nodes are the new models created by splitting the model on the difficulty factors. We do not specify a model to be the goal state because the structure of the best model is unknown. We do specify the stopping criterion by setting the upper bound of the number of node expansions, for this paper to fifty node expansions per search.\nxxr8 | The heuristic guiding the search is one of the two scoring functions for regression models, Akaike Information Criterion, and Bayesian Information Criterion. Each search is run twice, guided by a different heuristic each time. A good model captures sufficient variation in the data but is not overly complicated by balancing between model fit and complexity minimizing prediction risk. AIC and BIC are two estimators for prediction risk, and hence used as heuristics in the search.\nrl4j | AIC equals negative two times log likelihood plus two times number of parameters. BIC equals negative two times log likelihood plus number of parameters times number of observations.\nvz32 | Where log-likelihood measures the fit, and the number of parameters, which is the number of covariates in equation two, measures the complexity. Based on these two formulas, the lower the AIC or BIC, the better the balance between model fit and complexity. BIC puts a more severe penalty for complexity, leading to a smaller model than other methods.\nncb0 | A more interpretable metric for fit is Mean Absolute Deviance, the average of the absolute values of the differences between observed values and predicted values. We do not use it as a heuristic because it leads to over fitting. We include it as a measure of the improvement in the model fit.\n8mp0 | Figure four illustrates A star search with AIC as the heuristic. The original model is evaluated and AIC is computed. The model is then split into a few new models by incorporating the factors. AICs are computed from each of the new model. A star selects the best one for the next model generation. A star does not always go down. It may go up to select a model to expand if all the new models have worse heuristic scores than a previous model has. After several expansions, it finds a best node with the lowest AIC value.\nxjyk | Five. Experiments and Results\nmt0f | Five point one. Experiment one\n```",
