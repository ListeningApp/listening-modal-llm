        "content": "2nib | The concatenated multi-omics data (in the form of a joint matrix) is provided as input to different classical M L methods such as decision tree, naive Bayes, artificial neural networks, support vector machine, k-nearest neighbors, random forest, and K-Star in the literature. For example, a joint matrix of multi-omics features (which included gene expression, copy number variation and mutation) was used with classical random forest and support vector machine to predict anti-cancer drug response.\nnaev | Similarly, multivariate LASSO models have been investigated. Also, Boosted trees and support vector regression have been investigated for finding the longitudinal predictors of glycaemic health.\n7h0h | Other than classical M L algorithms, deep neural networks have also been widely used to analyse concatenated multi-omics data. They have been studied to identify robust survival sub-groups of liver cancer using R N A, miRNA, and methylation data.\na64c | Four point one point two. Unsupervised learning concatenation-based methods\ngi7n | Various concatenation-based unsupervised methods have been used for clustering and association analysis. Different matrix factorisation-based methods have evolved in recent years. Joint non-negative matrix factorisation was proposed to integrate multi-omics data with non-negative values. It involved decomposing the joint matrix into loadings and factors, bringing the different omics into a common basis matrix. Joint non-negative matrix factorisation is computationally slow and needs large memory allocation.\n3pn1 | Similarly, Shen proposed iCluster framework which used principles similar to non-negative matrix factorisation but allows integration of datasets having negative values. They showed the functioning of the framework by using copy number, mRNA expression and methylation data to conduct a cancer subtype discovery in glioblastoma. This framework was also employed for a landmark study that used genomic and transcriptomic data from two thousand breast tumors and discovered novel sub-groups amongst them.\nwjuz | Later, the iCluster+ framework by Mo, offered a significant enhancement over iCluster framework. The iCluster+ framework can discover patterns and combine a range of omics having binary, categorical and continuous values and was demonstrated by combining genomic data from the colorectal cancer datasets.\n3yxv | Another adaptation of non-negative matrix factorisation was evaluated as JIVE (Joint and Individual Variation Explained) which captures joint variation across integrating data types and structural variation of each data type along with the residual noise. It was used to investigate gene expression and miRNA data on brain tumor samples. The sparsity\nd8zj | problem in JIVE was improved by Joint Bayes Factor. Joint Bayes Factor used joint factor analysis to evaluate the feature space and converted it into shared and datatype-specific components.\nywxn | The MoCluster proposed by Meng, used multi-block multivariate analysis for highlighting the patterns across different input omics data and then finds the joint clusters amongst them. MoCluster was validated by integrating proteomic and transcriptomic data and shows a noticeably higher clustering accuracy and lower computation cost in comparison to both Cluster and iCluster+.\nuxhs | Fridley has studied the genomic effects due to the gemcitabine drug using high-throughput data from mRN A expression and SNPs. They integrated these two datasets into one large input matrix and developed a Bayesian pathway analysis that uses a stochastic search variable selection. Their proposed that the Bayesian integrative model offers better performance in detecting the genomic effects in comparison to using conventional single-omics analysis. Similarly, Zhu has also explored Bayesian network to\ned6e | understand cell regulation in yeast using metabolomics and transcriptomics data.\n6qqm | Also, LRAcluster was developed to integrate high-dimensional multi-omics data and find low-dimensional manifold to identify molecular subtypes of cancer.\nonum | Recently, iClusterBayes was introduced by Mo, which is a fully Bayesian latent variable model. It overcomes the limitations of iCluster+, in terms of statistical inference and computational speed. iClusterBayes includes a binary indicator prior for selection of variable and generalises for binary data and count data. Also, Argelaguet have developed Multi-Omics Factor Analysis which disentangles the heterogeneity shared across different omics to discover the principal source of variability. It can integrate partially overlapping datasets.\n3iir | Four point two. Model-based integration methods\n7a0a | Model-based integration methods create multiple intermediate models for the different omics data and then build a final model from various intermediate models. Stage one sets up the raw data from the three individual omics along with the corresponding phenotypic information. In Stage two, individual models are developed for each of the omics which are later integrated into a joint model in Stage three. Finally, in Stage four the joint model is analysed. The major advantage of model-based integration methods is that they can be used for merging models based on different omic types, where each model is developed from a different patient group having the same disease information.\no1qp | Model-based integration approaches facilitate the understanding of interactions amongst different omics for a certain phenotype. The final multi-dimensional joint model in Stage four can be built using an M L algorithm (such as neural networks) which uses the most relevant variables from each omics models (from Stage three). This approach allows the analysis of the improvement in the predictive power for individual models and also finds the best discriminating features.\njrik | The different model-based integration methods can be further classed as follows.\nxv78 | Four point two point one. Supervised learning model-based methods\nsdks | Model-based supervised learning methods include a variety of frameworks for developing a model, such as majority-based voting, hierarchical classifiers, and ensemble-based approaches (such as XGBoost and KNN).",
