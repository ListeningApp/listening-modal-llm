        "content": "lvae | infra), mass balance determinations were made to ensure that the amount of unreacted substrate and products corresponded to the amount of substrate added to the reaction. In addition, reactions containing zero point eight millimolar one B as well as the usual quantity (eight millimolar) of one were carried out to determine if the latter would survive the hydroxylation conditions and/or compete with one for the enzyme. Mock experiments were carried out without addition of NADH, and the substrate was recovered following the usual extraction and concentration procedures.\no9sc | Isotope Effect Studies. Reactions with MMO from M. capsulatus (Bath) were investigated with one and its mono-, di-, and trideuterated derivatives at the methyl position. An intramolecular isotope effect was investigated through studies of the mono- and dideuterated derivatives. The product alcohol one A from reactions with each substrate was analyzed by GC/MS. The isotope effect was then calculated by comparison of the intensities, after statistical corrections, at M by Z one four eight and one four nine for alcohols arising from the monodeuterated substrate and at M by Z one four nine and one five zero for alcohols derived from the dideuterated substrate.\n121u | Intermolecular isotope effects were evaluated by comparison of the rate of formation of one A in MMO-catalyzed reactions with the undeuterated and the trideuterated derivatives. The experiment was performed in two ways, as a competitive reaction and as separate reactions with each substrate. Competition experiments were performed with equal amounts (zero point five microliters) of both derivatives present in the reaction vial. The mass spectral intensity at M by Z one four eight, representing reaction of the undeuterated substrate, was divided by the intensity at M by Z one five zero, representing reaction with the trideuterated substrate, and the ratio was taken as the intermolecular isotope effect. In separate reactions with the two derivatives, two-(P-hydroxyphenyl)methylcyclopropane (one C), a product of the enzymatic reaction (vide infra), was used as an internal standard for the purpose of quantitation. The amount of one A relative to one C was calculated for each derivative. The ratio of alcohol to phenol for the undeuterated derivative was divided by the same ratio for the trideuterated derivative to provide the intermolecular isotope effect.\nzh03 | Results\n1mvw | The hydroxylation of one yielded two products as revealed by both GC and GC/MS analysis. They were identified as alcohol one A and two-(P-hydroxyphenyl)methylcyclopropane (one C) by comparison of their retention times and mass spectra with those of authentic standards. Quantitation of the peaks revealed that the two products are formed in approximately equal concentrations and at equal rates over a twenty-minute reaction period (Figure S1, supplementary material). To ensure that all added material was accounted for in the analysis, mass balance studies were carried out. The amount of material recovered in control reactions run in the absence of reductant corresponded to eighty-four point four divided by zero point six percent of the substrate initially added, the remainder apparently being lost\n6d4s | through the various extraction manipulations. When NADH was present to initiate and sustain enzyme turnover, eighty-five point zero plus or minus zero point five percent of the material added was recovered, five point zero plus or minus zero point two percent of which was one A, and five point one plus or minus zero point one percent, one C. No rearranged alcohol one B was detected. The possibility that one B formed but was unstable under the hydroxylation conditions was investigated through analysis of a reaction containing eight millimolar one and zero point eight millimolar one B. In the presence of NADH, seventy-eight point six plus or minus one point three percent of one B was recovered, compared to seventy-eight point two plus or minus one point zero percent in control reactions without NADH. This result indicates that one B is unaffected during the hydroxylation reaction. The yields of one A and one C remained unchanged.\nmqah | Hydroxylation studies of the mono- and dideuterated derivatives of substrate one gave values for K H over K P of five point one five plus or minus zero point three eight and five point zero three plus or minus zero point four two, respectively, for the intramolecular isotope effect. The intermolecular isotope effect was determined by comparing results for one with those for its trideuterated derivative. A value of one point one eight plus or minus zero point one five was obtained for reactions that were performed separately, whereas competitive reactions performed with both derivatives present in the reaction mixture yielded a value of zero point eight nine plus or minus zero point one zero (see Experimental Section). In the competition study, the ratio of phenols (one C-D zero to one C-D three) was one point one.\nxxr8 | GC analysis of hydroxylation reactions with two revealed only a single product, which was identified by comparison to an authentic standard as the alcohol two A. No peaks that might arise from rearranged alcohol two B or aromatic hydroxylation products were detected. A plot showing the rate of product formation is given in Figure S2.\nrl4j | Analysis of the extracts from reactions with trans-one,two-dimethylcyclopropane (three) revealed only one product, the concentration of which increased linearly with time over a ten-minute period (Figure S1). It was identified as the unrearranged alcohol, trans-(two-methylcyclopropyl)methanol (three A), through comparison of its GC retention time with that of an authentic standard. No four-penten-two-ol (three B) or two-methylbut-three-en-one-ol (three C) was detected.",
