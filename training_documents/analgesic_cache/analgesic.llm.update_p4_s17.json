However, no\no7qm | Effect of dipyrone on cyclooxygenases in cats M A A Pereira et al.\nd52l | significant adverse effects and alterations in laboratory tests were observed throughout the study. In addition, dipyrone was as effective as meloxicam for postoperative analgesia.\nqlbb | During the literature search, no previous papers evaluating the effect of dipyrone on COX activity in cats were found. This study was based on the one performed by Duz et al., which described this technique in horses.\nnhsg | The administration of the drugs led to an inhibition of COX-one activity, as observed by the plasma TXB two concentration decrease. These results corroborate previous studies\nhy0l | on the use of dipyrone in other species and meloxicam in other species and in cats.\n4jmz | The COX-one activity inhibition was greater at both dipyrone doses than meloxicam from four hours on. Even though this inhibition is similar to that caused by nonselective NSAIDs, dipyrone was not associated with any adverse effects commonly observed with NSAIDs. A multicentric study of humans reported higher gastrointestinal safety with dipyrone than classical NSAIDs and its low acidity may be responsible for the favorable gastrointestinal tolerance.\nb7cq | Despite the significant COX-one inhibition seen in this study, no postoperative bleeding was observed in any cat. In a similar study in dogs, a single dose of dipyrone twenty-five milligrams per kilogram I V alone or in combination with meloxicam zero point two milligrams per kilogram I V inhibited platelet aggregation for three and five hours, respectively, with no alterations in thromboelastometry and buccal mucosal bleeding time.\n0b39 | The ex vivo evaluation of COX-two activity inhibition showed that it occurred in all groups, similar to results from studies in other species. At zero point five hour, PGE two concentrations had decreased significantly in all groups, lasting longer four hours in group M.\nqecd | In the present study, both dipyrone doses strongly inhibited both COX isoforms in a nonselective way; COX-one inhibition was greater and longer lasting than that of COX-two. The COX\n1o7p | selectivity ratio was not calculated because ex vivo assays cannot be used for these estimates. Hinz et al. observed that four-methylamino antipyrine, an active metabolite of dipyrone, led to a substantial COX inhibition of both isoforms equally.\ncp13 | Meloxicam also inhibited both COX isoenzymes, however inhibition of COX-one by meloxicam was less intense than from dipyrone, whereas COX-two inhibition was longer lasting. Previous studies, including assays of canine and feline whole blood after administration of meloxicam, identified only a slight COX-two selectivity COX-one to COX-two ratio of ten and three point five, respectively. Blood collected from ten cats revealed that meloxicam inhibited COX-one by at least twenty percent at minimal plasma concentrations and exceeded forty percent at therapeutic plasma concentrations. These results are similar to those in the present study.\nbgre | Despite the nonselective COX-two inhibition, the drugs and dosages administered in the present study resulted in no adverse effects or alterations in laboratory tests throughout the evaluation period. In group M, serum SDMA concentrations decreased at twenty-four hours compared with seven days before and seven days after anesthesia. In group D twenty-five, they were significantly lower at twenty-four hours compared with seven days postoperatively. However, the changes showed a similar pattern in all groups, and the values did not exceed the feline normal reference interval (zero to fourteen micrograms per deciliter). These results suggest that glomerular filtration rate increased after the surgical procedure, probably influenced by intra-operative fluid therapy. There were no differences among\n57lp | Effect of dipyrone on cyclooxygenases in cats M A A Pereira et al.\nukth | groups in concentrations of SDMA, however, one cat in M presented a high value (fifteen micrograms per deciliter) at seven days postoperatively.\nkpvt | Pain is a vital sign that has a complex pathophysiology. Sensitization of nociceptors or hyperalgesia is a common finding in inflammatory pain and is a consequence of the action of inflammatory mediators such as PGE two. These mediators lower the threshold of excitability of receptors, facilitating the activity of notoriously painful substances, such as histamine and bradykinin. NSAIDs, such as meloxicam, have a proven analgesic potential related to COX inhibition, decreasing the production of PGE two in cats.\njie2 | Although dipyrone is not a new drug, the mechanism of action is complex and not yet completely understood. Based on studies in other species, it was hypothesized that effects of dipyrone depend at least partially on COX inhibition and consequently on the reduction in PGE two synthesis peripherally. Our findings corroborate these data; however, it is likely that dipyrone also produces analgesia through other mechanisms in cats. Chandrasekharan et al. reported the existence of a splicing variant of COX-one, referred to as COX-three, and suggested that dipyrone selectively inhibits this enzyme. However, that in vitro study used constructs of canine COX-three and murine COX-one and COX-two with disparate activity levels, leading to uncertainties and controversies. In addition, there is no evidence regarding the presence, physiological role and dipyrone selectivity for COX-three in the feline species.\nd0ik | Pain scores did not differ significantly among groups, indicating that all analgesic protocols were effective in controlling\n0x0s | Effect of dipyrone on cyclooxygenases in cats M A A Pereira et al.",
