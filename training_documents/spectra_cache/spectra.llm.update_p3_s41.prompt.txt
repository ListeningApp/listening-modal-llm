You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

Note that the authors of the papers7a,11,27 were working at the intensity of ultrasound that is higher than the threshold of instability of the bubble surface, i.e., at conditions where the bubble disruption and the detachment of tiny bubbles from the bigger one seem incredible.7a
w95z | The sonoluminescence spectra of hydrocarbons show no emission lines or bands of charged particles,14 which is also in disagreement with the electrical discharge hypotheses.
0i1k | Nevertheless, there are no well-recognized hypotheses about the mechanism of sonoluminescence and sonochemistry, and the debates still continue.4,8e,f,22 To our knowledge, the majority of experimental results can be explained by the thermal hypothesis and its variations. Next we shall try to explain the data obtained in this work with the help of this hypothesis.
dqlg | Sonoluminescence as Blackbody Radiation. SL occurs at the compression of a cavitation bubble just before the minimum of its size is reached.10 The velocity of the bubble wall can exceed 130 m/s11 or even around the speed of sound in the gas.10 The time of SL flash is less than 50 ps, and the number of photons emitted from one flash is around 105.27 The spectra of SL emitted by a single cavitation bubble have a maximum <LATEX>a t \approx 2 3 0 n m . ^ { 6 , 7 }</LATEX> The authors of mentioned papers believe that <LATEX>\mathrm { S L }</LATEX> is a blackbody radiation with temperature =25 0006 or 16 200 K.7 The decrease of bulk solution temperature from 22 to 10 °C increases a blackbody temperature to 50 000 K.6
p6pq | Suppose that sonoluminescence is the equilibrium thermal radiation at 25 000 K. Let us estimate the number of photons emitted by a single bubble. The SL flash occurs at the bubble radius <LATEX>R _ { S L } \simeq 2 . 2 \times 1 0 ^ { - 4 } c m . ^ { 1 0 }</LATEX> The density of the bubble content at its minimum size should be around liquid density.13 Thus, the number of particles inside the bubble <LATEX>N _ { 0 }</LATEX> at <LATEX>R = R _ { S L }</LATEX> is about <LATEX>N _ { 0 } \simeq 1 0 ^ { 1 2 } .</LATEX> The number of particles <LATEX>N _ { i }</LATEX> with the energy of <LATEX>\epsilon _ { i } \simeq 5 . 4 \epsilon \mathrm { V }</LATEX> <LATEX>\left( 1 = 2 3 0 \quad n m , \right.</LATEX> maximum in the spectra6,7) is, in accordance with the Boltzmann distribution, <LATEX>N _ { i } \simeq N _ { 0 } \exp \left( - \epsilon _ { i } / \right.</LATEX> <LATEX>\left. k T \right) \approx 7 \times 1 0 ^ { 1 0 } .</LATEX> The experimentally determined value of <LATEX>N _ { i }</LATEX> is <LATEX>= 1 0 ^ { 5 , 2 7 } \text { So } ,</LATEX> at equilibrium temperature of 25 000 K the number of photons emitted by one cavitation bubble must be 5 orders larger than the experimental value. For <LATEX>N _ { i }</LATEX> to be equal to the calculated value, temperature inside the bubble has to be around <LATEX>4 0 0 0 - 4 5 0 0 \quad K .</LATEX> However, in this case according to Wein's rule, the maximum in the spectra has to be situated in the region of 725-644 nm. Thus, the temperature inside the bubble cannot be so high (25 000 K or even 50 000 <LATEX>K ^ { 6 } ,</LATEX> and it is probably around the values estimated in refs 28 and 29.
zse6 | The calculations of temperature from the experimental data on the broadening of potassium lines28 or on the rohvibrational distribution of the lines in the <LATEX>C _ { 2 } *</LATEX> band29 gave the values of <LATEX>3 3 6 0 \pm 3 3 0</LATEX> and <LATEX>5 0 7 5 \pm 1 5 6 K ,</LATEX> respectively. The temperature inside the bubble is distributed irregularly: its maximum in the center can be 5-fold higher than average one.30 For example, according to ref 31, the liquid temperature around the bubble does not differ essentially from that in the bulk liquid; however, the temperature on the bubble-liquid frontier from the bubble side can be <LATEX>\approx 1 9 0 0 K</LATEX> and in the bubble center
