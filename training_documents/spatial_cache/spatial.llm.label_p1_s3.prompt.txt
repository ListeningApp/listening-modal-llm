You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

1pjs | The Analysis of Spatial Association by Use of Distance Statistics
o2kr | Introduced in this paper is a family of statistics, G, that can be used as a measure of spatial association in a number of circumstances. The basic statistic is derived, its properties are identified, and its advantages explained. Several of the G statis- tics make it possible to evaluate the spatial association of a variable within a specified distance of a single point. A comparison is made between a general G statistic and Moran's I for similar hypothetical and empirical conditions. The empirical work includes studies of sudden infant death syndrome by county in North Carolina and dwelling unit prices in metropolitan San Diego by zip-code districts. Results indicate that G statistics should be used in conjunction with I in order to identify characteristics of patterns not revealed by the I statistic alone and, specifically, the Gi and G* statistics enable us to detect local "pockets" of dependence that may not show up when using global statistics.
v6sk | INTRODUCTION
1wj6 | The importance of examining spatial series for spatial correlation and autocor- relation is undeniable. Both Anselin and Griffith (1988) and Arbia (1989) have shown that failure to take necessary steps to account for or avoid spatial autocor- relation can lead to serious errors in model interpretation. In spatial modeling, researchers must not only account for dependence structure and spatial hetero- skedasticity, they must also assess the effects of spatial scale. In the last twenty years a number of instruments for testing for and measuring spatial autocorrelation have appeared. To geographers, the best-known statistics are Moran's I and, to a lesser extent, Geary's c (Cliff and Ord 1973). To geologists and remote sensing analysts, the semi-variance is most popular (Davis 1986). To spatial econometri- cians, estimating spatial autocorrelation coefficients of regression equations is the usual approach (Anselin 1988).

06yq | 190 / Geographical Analysis
dpv6 | A common feature of these procedures is that they are applied globally, that is, to the complete region under study. However, it is often desirable to examine pattern at a more local scale, particularly if the process is spatially nonstationary. Foster and Gorr (1986) provide an adaptive filtering method for smoothing param- eter estimates, and Cressie and Read (1989) present a modeling procedure. The ideas presented in this paper are complementary to these approaches in that we also focus upon local effects, but from the viewpoint of testing rather than smoothing.
8r5j | This paper introduces a family of measures of spatial association called <LATEX>G</LATEX> statis- tics. These statistics have a number of attributes that make them attractive for measuring association in a spatially distributed variable. When used in conjunc- tion with a statistic such as Moran's <LATEX>I ,</LATEX> they deepen the knowledge of the processes that give rise to spatial association, in that they enable us to detect local "pockets" of dependence that may not show up when using global statistics. In this paper, we first derive the statistics <LATEX>G _ { i } \left( d \right)</LATEX> and <LATEX>G \left( d \right) ,</LATEX> then outline their attributes. Next, the <LATEX>G \left( d \right)</LATEX> statistic is compared with Moran's <LATEX>I .</LATEX> Finally, there is a discussion of empirical examples. The examples are taken from two different geographic scales of analysis and two different sets of data. They include sudden infant death syn- drome by county in North Carolina, and house prices by zip-code district in the San Diego metropolitan area.
2taz | THE <LATEX>G _ { i } \left( d \right)</LATEX> STATISTIC
o3ya | This statistic measures the degree of association that results from the concentra- tion of weighted points (or area represented by a weighted point) and all other weighted points included within a radius of distance <LATEX>d</LATEX> from the original weighted point. We are given an area subdivided into <LATEX>n</LATEX> regions, <LATEX>i = 1 , 2 , \ldots , n ,</LATEX> where each region is identified with a point whose Cartesian coordinates are known. Each <LATEX>i</LATEX> has associated with it a value <LATEX>x</LATEX> (a weight) taken from a variable <LATEX>X .</LATEX> The variable has a natural origin and is positive. The <LATEX>G _ { i } \left( d \right)</LATEX> statistic developed below allows for tests of hypotheses about the spatial concentration of the sum of <LATEX>x</LATEX> values associated with the <LATEX>j</LATEX> points within <LATEX>d</LATEX> of the ith point.
r5il | The statistic is
5gui | <LATEX>G _ { i } \left( d \right) = \frac { \sum _ { j = 1 } ^ { n } w _ { i j } \left( d \right) x _ { j } } { \sum _ { j = 1 } ^ { n } x _ { j } } , \quad j \text { not equal to } i ,</LATEX> (1)
82qc | where <LATEX>\left\{ w _ { i j } \right\}</LATEX> is a symmetric one/zero spatial weight matrix with ones for all links defined as being within distance <LATEX>d</LATEX> of a given <LATEX>i</LATEX> i; all other links are zero including the link of point <LATEX>i</LATEX> to itself. The numerator is the sum of all <LATEX>x _ { j } ,</LATEX> within <LATEX>d</LATEX> of <LATEX>i</LATEX> but not including <LATEX>x _ { i } .</LATEX> The denominator is the sum of all <LATEX>x _ { i }</LATEX> not including
ls7d | <LATEX>x _ { i } .</LATEX> Adopting standard arguments (cf. Cliff and Ord 1973, pp. 32-33), we may fix the value <LATEX>x ,</LATEX> for the ith point and consider the set of <LATEX>\left( n \quad - \quad 1 \right) !</LATEX> random permutations of the remaining <LATEX>x</LATEX> values at the <LATEX>j</LATEX> points. Under the null hypothesis of spatial independence, these permutations are equally likely. That is, let <LATEX>\mathrm { X } _ { j } ,</LATEX> be the random variable describing the value assigned to point <LATEX>j ,</LATEX> then
tzt3 | <LATEX>P \left( X _ { j } = x _ { r } \right) = 1 / \left( n - 1 \right) , \quad r \neq i ,</LATEX> and
