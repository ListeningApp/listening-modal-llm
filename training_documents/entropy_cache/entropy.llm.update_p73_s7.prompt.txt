You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

3qp5 | Here's how you can compute the expected energy (E) and the entropy S of any system starting from its partition function Z(B) as a function of the coolness ß. I'll show you why these formulas are true, and then we'll test them out on the harmonic oscillator, where we have already computed the expected energy and entropy by other methods.
guux | 66
fhkp | THE PARTITION FUNCTION KNOWS THE EXPECTED ENERGY
ur19 | If a system has partition function Z (6) = . e-BE(x) dx then
ytow | do Inz = - 72 Z dß Z d6 Jx = − 1 d - e-BE(x) dx = = E(x) e BE(x) dx Z Jx
ozjl | Jy E(x) e-BE(x) dx X
xux5 | X e-BE(x) dx
53mt | = (E)
owo1 | In short, the expected energy is (E) = - dß d ln Z
zz70 | The partition function is all-powerful! For starters, if you know the partition func- tion of a physical system, you can figure out its expected energy. The expected energy (E) is minus the derivative of In Z with respect to the coolness ß = 1/kT.
slcr | How do we show this? Easy: just look at the calculation above! We get a fraction, which is the expected value of E with respect to the Gibbs distribution.
z9at | By the way, this trick of taking the derivative of the logarithm of a function is famous: it's called a 'logarithmic derivative'. Notice that
7dov | f'(x)
znos | f(x)
bngy | Thus the logarithmic derivative says how fast a function is growing compared to the value of the function itself-like the interest rate in compound interest.
xja2 | THE PARTITION FUNCTION KNOWS THE ENTROPY
b9a5 | If a system has Boltzmann distribution
thi8 | p(x) = e-BE(x) Z where Z = ye-BE(x) dx
entm | then its entropy in thermal equilibrium is
knql | S = - k |p(x) Inp(x) dx = -k |_p(x) In e-BE(x) Z dx
ez57 | = k |p(x) (In Z + BE(x) dx
xwza | = k ln Z + B(E)
kw2g | But since (E) = - In Z, this gives
evst | S = k In Z-6InZ dß
r4ei | The entropy is a bit more complicated. But don't be scared! The Boltzmann distribution p(x) is a fraction, so the log of this fraction breaks into two parts:
v3un | ln p(x) = ln - e-BE(x) ln Z = - (In Z + BE(x)).
mmh7 | Thus our integral for entropy breaks into two parts:
15mo | S = - k | p(x) In p(x) dx = k | p(x) In Z dx + k3 | p(x)E(x) dx.
haqw | The first part is just k ln Z since the integral of p(x) is 1. The second part is k3(E). If we use what we just learned about (E):
89i1 | (E) = - 18 In Z
gfu5 | we get this formula for entropy in terms of the partition function:
mvzl | This formula seems hard to understand at first. To extract its inner meaning, we need a new concept: 'free energy'.
buwu | 68
zsfu | THE PARTITION FUNCTION KNOWS THE FREE ENERGY
hyvo | To maximize entropy while holding expected energy constant, you can just minimize the free energy
5l9v | F = (E) - TS We've seen
6tv1 | (E) = - dß d ln Z and S=k |In Z - 3-In Z dß d
l79g | so with ß = 1/kT a little algebra shows
d8ia | F = - In Z
v012 | We can understand the relation between entropy, energy and the partition function if we bring in a concept I haven't mentioned yet: the free energy
crl5 | F =(E) -TS.
xqom | Since we know formulas for (E) and S in terms of the partition function, we can work out a formula for F. And it's really simple! Much simpler than S, for example. It's just
mwss | F =- In Z.
qba8 | But what's the meaning of free energy? Remember: to maximize the Shannon entropy H subject to a constraint on expected energy, we introduced the Lagrange multiplier $ = 1/kT and maximized the quantity H - B(E). But if you multiply this quantity by -kT, you get free energy:
24cj | -kT(H-B(E))=(E)-TS =F.
kkr4 | So, as long as T > 0, maximizing entropy subject to a constraint on expected energy is equivalent to minimizing free energy!
p3um | Thus, free energy turns a problem of maximizing entropy subject to a constraint into a minimization problem without a constraint. The point is not that we've turned maximization into minimization: that's just an arbitrary business with signs. The point is that free energy lets us stop thinking about the constraint.
fcs1 | There's a huge amount to say about the free energy, which is also called the 'Helmholtz free energy', since there are other kinds. You can think of TS as the amount of energy in useless random form, since it comes from entropy. Since (E) is the total expected energy, F = (E) - TS is the amount of 'useful' energy. More precisely, the free energy is the maximum amount of work obtainable from a system at a constant temperature. But showing this would take us out of our way.
5rxi | THE PARTITION FUNCTION KNOWS ALL: REVISITED
cm65 | If Z (3) is the partition function of a system, in thermal equilibrium at coolness ß its expected energy is (E) = - 1 In z
ux5y | and its free energy is
c8vn | F = - In Z
alzc | We can compute its entropy from these using
0dos | F = (E) - TS and we get
bc48 | S = k InZ-InZ dß
f3v7 | Now we can tell a simpler story, which is easier to remember. Free energy, being the energy in useful form, is the expected energy minus the useless energy, which is temperature times entropy. Thus
8s6f | F=(E)-TS
x7h9 | so
ygmb | S = (E) - F T
0o5y | = kß(-F + (E))
dnu3 | and using our formulas for F and (E) in terms of the partition function Z, we get
dsty | S = k In Z - B- InZ).
ci0z | The story here is more of a mnemonic than a true explanation, because I'm not saying much what it means for energy to be 'useful' or 'useless'. I've only given this hint: when a system is in thermal equilibrium, its free energy is minimized. For more on the meaning of free energy, try a good book on thermodynamics, like this:
sban | Right now I'd rather say a bit about the meaning of the partition function.
hy6w | THE MEANING OF THE PARTITION FUNCTION
wlk5 | Say X is a set where each point i has an 'energy' E; E R. Its partition function is
ais9 | Z = De-BEi iEX
cdkq | where B E R is the coolness.
ajvs | The partition function counts the points of X-but it counts points with large energy less, since they're less likely to be 'occupied'.
mwef | If ( = 1/kT, points with energy E; >> kT count for very little.
k8pl | But as T -> +oo, all points get fully counted and Z -> | X|. In physics we call Z the number of accessible states.
04f6 | Say we have a system with some countable set of states X. In thermal equilibrium at temperature T, the probability that the system is in its ith state is proportional to exp(-BE;), where E; is the energy of that state and ß is the coolness. Thus, physicists say the partition function
3nhr | Z = Le-BEi iEX
4hg2 | is the number of accessible states: roughly, the number of states the system can easily be in at temperature T, where ß = 1/kT.
