You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

qhnu | It is not a question of where you go, or whether you join a

799w | THE HOUSE AND THE LORD OF THE HOUSE
r3vu | Bayazid Bistami emphasised the different ranges in perception of Truth when he said that the first time he visited the Kaaba at Mecca, he saw the Kaaba. The second time he saw the Lord of the Kaaba. The third time he saw neither of these, not the Kaaba nor the Lord of the Kaaba.
k899 | Journeys to the East
29to | Q: Do you want us to go to the East, or to join Sufi groups?
0bo0 | A: I have said and written so much about Sufism and the Sufis that some people imagine that I am trying to influence them to join a cult or a religious grouping.
sbs5 | It is, in fact, not possible for me to mount such a campaign, as I will now explain to you.
einv | Hearing and reading what I have had to say about the Sufis has caused hordes of the religious-minded to flow towards the often grotesque versions of Sufism in the East. It has also, with equal force, caused masses of the curious and greedy to flock around the guru-ist cults of the West.
1vda | This leaves those who are uninformed, those who want to learn more of what Sufism is, and those who are unconcerned.
zfos | This operation has been highly successful, but this part of it has had no higher function for the majority than any other instru- ment which sorts things - or people - out.
gzuq | THE AIM AND THE DESTINATION
crr5 | A mere journey to the East generally has the effect of the jingle: 'Two men looked out from prison bars/One saw mud, the other stars.' What is the wayfarer like, quite apart from the road or the destination? Sheikh Saadi reminds us: 'I fear that you will not reach Mecca, O Traveller, for you are on the road to Turkestan!'
a0je | Take heart from the fact that this tendency to wander about looking for knowledge, and to set off for distant destinations (sup- posedly for knowledge but in reality just to get moving) is a very human tendency. There are plenty of examples of it and of its consequences, in my Tales of the Dervishes, and how this charac- teristic cropped up again and again in the lives of the classical Sufis and their disciples.
egcq | So we have to assess who it is that is proposing to go to The
klw0 | East, when this person wants to go, with whom - if anyone - and to where.
uhd3 | More people go to the East and find nothing than ever realise guy heart's desire, because they do not know how to structure their enterprise.
9ivc | CAN YOU WAIT 150 YEARS?
dd00 | Have you heard how Mulla Nasrudin heard that some parrots live to 150 years-and bought a young one to check whether this would turn out to be true?
n9f1 | 'Joining Sufi groups' is unlikely to be useful to people who find groups that they have the option to 'join', without being ad- mitted after assessment as to whether they could usefully join.
o0ah | One would have to know about the 'Sufi group' before giving an answer which implied that people are likely to encounter real Sufi groups among the derivative 'orders' or 'schools' or "teachers' which have set themselves up publicly ...
tblh | VARIETY OF STATEMENTS
e3h8 | Whether studying in groups or travelling to the East, or whether otherwise engaged, I note that not many people seem to heed a wide enough variety of Sufi statements.
5e6c | One such which would repay deeper study before searching is the advice of the iUuminate Mumshad Dinwari:
ghh6 | You learn, he says, by association with a realised teacher. But you can gain nothing from such a person if you bring a sense of personal pride.
ddky | The widespread compulsion to do things for which one is not fitted, and also to assume that one's choice of action is appropriate, is seen everywhere, in all epochs.

xmzo | In the contemporary world there is an excellent opportunity to see this working in the human behaviour reported in the daily and *Recorded in his TadhMrat al-Awltyya by Faridudin Attar.
c3ng | weekly Press. Take this almost random example. It shows be- haviour which underlies such things as unthinking group-joining or journeys to the East. Are they the product of spiritual aspira- tions or of sheer non-thinking elevated into a virtue?
9dle | A cat-burglar, who climbed girders and houses to steal, and who carried out at least forty-one thefts, was caught and brought to court. Of course he was caught, in spite of his great skill: because he happened to have no legs, having had diem amputated years before .*
xhxk | What a Sufi Teacher Looks Like
kidv | Q: How should a teacher appear to the students, according to the Sufis?
zawm | THE BRICK AND THE HOUSE
6apv | A: This question, like so many others which assume that they can be usefully answered in a few words, reminds me of a story about Mulla Nasrudin. Someone asked him what his house was like, basically. In reply he brought this man a brick, saying: 'It is just a collection of these.' What the fool may do without realising it is foolish, the wise man may have to do or say in order to show how unthinking the question is.
w9mq | How can you say what a teacher should look like? The most one can do is to make a few remarks about it.
p2ic | What is so perplexing to conditioned attitudes about the Sufis is that, unlike teachers of other kinds, they refuse to stick to one kind of appearance. As an example, if you go to see a Sufi divine, he may not look, talk or act like a mystical master at all. This is because he says either: 'You can teach only by the method indicated for each pupil, and you may have to teach by what seems to him unlikely'; or else because he says: 'There is a time and a place and certain company. According to these, we will teach. When it is a time to be serious, we will be serious. When it is a time to work through what looks like ordinary things, we have to do so.'
dz65 | So important is this lesson that it can be said to go before all others: in the sense that failure to know this can prevent you from learning more - and can leave you attached to the externals of hypocrites. This includes, of course, unconscious hypocrites.
4lxl | If the Sufis are right in their claim that time affects behaviour, and that personal appearance should change (and even tempera- ment) then obviously all the people who cultivate a reverend appearance, and all those who acquire it, mistaking this for spirituality, are wrong.
iqju | It is this unspoken contradiction which makes it almost im- possible for people who want continuity and easily identifiable teaching figures, to accept the change in circumstances and atti- tudes which the Sufi Way demands.
lxvt | These people, of course, will not have thought it out like this. All they know is that 'A holy man must seem holy to me'; or 'If he always behaves in the same manner, or always exhorts me to the same things, I believe that he may be right'.
j2lw | The other problem is that the observer is confusing, as he is bound to confuse without having understood, continuity and con- sistency with reliability or truth. Because butter always tastes the same when it looks the same, he expects a similar 'reliability' in his spiritual teacher. He is, of course, self-deceived in this as- sumption.
