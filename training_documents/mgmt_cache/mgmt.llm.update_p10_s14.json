In the United States, for example, larger micro-divisions called \"platforms\" have been created instead of xiaowei, and-in contrast to xiaowei in China-every employee was part of several platforms, and remuneration was not entirely based on platform performance. In Russia, the top management team formed a xiaowei along the Chinese xiaowei lines; however, rank-and-file employees continued to work in a hierarchical organization without forming ZZJYTs or xiaowei. Low adoption levels outside China raise important questions about the applicability of Rendanheyi in different national contexts, which underlines the importance of understanding how context matters for management innovations.\nmqah | How Context Mattered to Haier's Rendanheyi\nxxr8 | In our research, we used the six categories mentioned earlier, that is, three categories in the environmental context and three categories in the organizational context.\nrl4j | Environmental Context\nvz32 | The three categories of environmental context are the competitive, technological, and institutional environments-all of which are characterized by increasing VUCA forces that have affected the development of Rendanheyi.\nncb0 | Competitive. Haier has been operating in a VUCA environment for more than a decade. The competitive environment for Haier has become more uncertain since the early two thousands. Foreign rivals such as Panasonic, Sanyo, Whirlpool, Bosch-Siemens, and Electrolux already entered the Chinese market in the nineteen eighties and nineteen nineties. But it was in the early two thousands that Chinese white goods manufacturers came under considerable competitive pressure from foreign competitors in the Chinese market. In December two thousand one, China formally joined the World Trade Organization and opened the white goods sector to competition. The previous sales quotas on white goods were scrapped, and foreign manufacturers were allowed to also engage in distribution and service activities in the Chinese market. The most important foreign home appliance brands (with the notable exception of GE) started manufacturing and R&D activities in China. Whirlpool (which previously withdrew from China) re-entered the Chinese market in two thousand two through strategic partnerships with local firms Gome and Suning, while other foreign rivals also expanded their presence in China.\n8mp0 | With increased volatility from domestic competition, Chinese white goods firms experienced production overcapacity for the first time as the market share of foreign firms in refrigerators quickly went up from twenty-six percent to thirty-one percent, and in washing machines from thirty-one percent to thirty-eight percent, within a year. A fierce price war broke out. Domestic competition from foreign rivals and lower margins pushed Haier to expand globally to counter foreign rivals on their home turf in the United States and Europe. In anticipation of China's WTO membership, Haier opened manufacturing and R&D centers in Italy and Germany in two thousand one and established a U.S. factory in two thousand two.\nxjyk | As Haier became a truly global company with presence in more than one hundred countries, it faced a more complex environment consisting of many different markets, all with unique market characteristics and consumer preferences. It also faced further uncertainty due to slower demand and greater competition amid the global recession and a sharp decline in China's property market. Haier's senior management believed that its workers were not productive enough compared with global competitors.\nmt0f | The development of Rendanheyi two point zero coincided with slower growth rates in China's economy, which declined in each consecutive year from ten point six percent in twenty ten to six point nine percent in twenty fifteen, while total investment in China's economy declined from forty-seven point nine percent of GDP in twenty ten to forty-four point seven percent in twenty fifteen. As an additional burden, the value of the Chinese currency has steadily appreciated, from eight point two seven six five yuan per U.S. dollar to six point one two four eight yuan per U.S. dollar between the start of two thousand five and the start of twenty fifteen.\nawab | There were also signs that the white goods sector would become more consolidated. In two thousand five, Whirlpool acquired Maytag, once considered one of the most admired premium brands. China's entry into the WTO and greater global\nixcc | Management Innovation Made in China: Haier's Rendanheyi\n8p6h | competitive uncertainty persuaded Zhang that Haier needed to reinvent itself and become a user-oriented organization. Today, we know that fears about global consolidation were justified as a merger wave has swept through the white goods industry. In twenty sixteen, Whirlpool purchased Indesit, Midea bought Toshiba's white goods business, Ar√ßelik took over Dawlance, Bosch bought out its partner Siemens, and, in twenty seventeen, Haier completed a five point six billion U.S. dollar takeover of GE's white goods business. Competitive pressures were, therefore, also a driver for Haier to start introducing Rendanheyi.\npmgl | Technological. The white goods sector was traditionally a slow-moving, mature industry. But there was increasing ambiguity about the directions for future consumer demand, amid booming e-commerce, demand for niche products, and a shift toward a customized user experience. Zhang was an early web enthusiast. When he conceived his early ideas on Rendanheyi around two thousand five, he assumed that the Internet would change the relationship between companies and customers. Zhang recognized that the Internet brought about (in his own words) \"zero-distance access to information,\" meaning customers can get information more quickly than companies. In his view, this required a shift from mass production to mass customization. When the ZZJYT model was introduced around twenty ten, Zhang developed a vision of complementary physical and virtual networks and envisaged that Haier's online platforms should be used as vehicles for close collaboration with users to develop new products and to provide a customized user experience.\n90no | Zhang was influenced by authors such as Don Tapscott and Jeremy Rifkin, who painted a picture of communications-driven technological revolutions in the business world. He invited many such authors to visit Haier in the Qingdao headquarters. When the \"Maker Movement\" (related to digital fabrication) surfaced, Zhang invited the editor-in-chief of Wired Magazine Chris Anderson in for talks and workshops, identifying everyone as a \"maker\" on their business cards and job descriptions. Zhang became convinced that technology would fundamentally alter the basis of competition in future, moving from competition between close-ended hierarchical companies toward competition between open online platforms that can link companies with users and external partners to jointly create value. One of Zhang's favorite quotes is \"the world is your R&D department,\" which suggests that R&D resources can be acquired through collaboration with users, through collaboration with external partners, or through purchases from third parties. He made a distinction between a traditional \"customer\" for a one-time money transaction, and a \"user\" for continuous interaction and participation. Zhang wanted to create a community of users.\njt0y | Zhang also observed technological advancements made by other companies. He was particularly impressed by Apple's iPad, which became \"magical\" once app designers were invited in to populate the iPad boxes with their ideas, and once Apple's customers could personalize their iPads with the variety of apps becoming available, in the process transforming each iPad into a truly unique device. Zhang argued that the iPad was a \"platform\" for expressing and realizing\nqb7o | the dreams of other ecosystem players-app designers and users-and that Haier could similarly be transformed into a platform for the dreams of others, and, in the process, would become faster, more open, and without boundaries.\n```",
