You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

pqxb | 10) Sperm Anatomy and Motility (see Figures 16, 17)
08qc | a) Head - The genetic material transported by the spermatozoa is located in the nucleus of the head region. The nuclear chromatin is densely packed and homogeneous. Sperm nuclei contain either the X or Y chromosome. It is therefore the male gamete that determines the sex of the offspring. The head region also contains the acrosome, which covers a large portion of the nucleus like a cap. The acrosome contains hydrolytic enzymes that, upon release (the acrosome reaction), function in the penetration of the cumulus and zona pellucida surrounding the egg and facilitate fertilization. The absence of the acrosome (a genetic defect) is termed "round-headed sperm" or globozoospermia (See Chapter 14 for details).
hdj2 | b) Neck - also called the connecting piece. At the base of the nucleus is the proximal centriole (CEP135 is a gene encoding a key protein in this structure), followed by an atypical distal centriole and the axoneme, which are all located in the connecting piece.
a57g | c) Midpiece - contains the mitochondria (mitochondrial sheath), which is the main machinery for trapping, conserving, and supplying the energy needed for motility. Also, the beginning of the axoneme, which makes up the flagellum.
g8m3 | d) Principal Piece and End Piece - The flagellum of the tail of the spermatozoon. It is surrounded by a dense fibrous sheath.
a9av | 11) Sperm Motility Characteristics
73l3 | a) The sperm tail beats approximately 10 times/sec. In seminal plasma, the sperm velocity ranges from 10-60 micrometers per second (top speed of 13,400 m.p.h .! ). The average motility for a normal male is approximately 50%-60% within 0.5-1 hour of ejaculation.
ornm | Tobacco, sexual lubricants, saliva, alcohol, and drugs may decrease sperm motility. Genetic defects can also impact sperm motility.
u2z1 | b) Axonemal Structure of Sperm Tails and the Sliding Microtubule Theory (Figure 9): The microtubule structure of the human sperm tail is the same as that of most plants and animals. The axoneme, or central core of the sperm tail, originates within the mitochondrial sheath and extends the length of the sperm tail (Amelar et al., 1980). The axoneme consists of two central microtubules surrounded by nine microtubule doublets, which has been referred to as the "9+2 configuration" (Figure 17). Each axonemal doublet is composed of two subfibers, A and B. Subfiber A is a complete microtubule while subfiber B is a "C-shaped" microtubule which is
atmh | attached to a subfiber A (Figures 16, 17). Radial spokes, or arms, composed of dynein extend from each subfiber A to the adjacent subfiber B.
7hgg | When powered by ATP hydrolysis, the microtubule doublets "walk along" each other by means of their dynein arms. Given the shear resistance within the axoneme, as the microtubule doublets walk along each other bends form in the tail and propagate in such a way as to produce the characteristic movements of the sperm tail (Amelar et al., 1980). This propagation of movement due to the sliding of microtubules along each other is called the "Sliding Microtubule Theory" (Amelar et al., 1980).
xwsv | The presence of the dynein arms is crucial for proper flagellar movement, as are the other structures shown in Figure 16 and 17 and described in more detail in Chapter 14. If these dynein arms are absent, sperm will display complete asthenozoospermia (no motility). For example, Kartagener syndrome (also called immotile sperm or immotile cilia syndrome) is a hereditary condition characterized by ciliary immotility due to the absence of dynein arms (Aitken, 1983). Men with this syndrome will suffer infertility due to immotile sperm. The condition is also associated with other abnormalities due to immotile cilia, such as bronchiectasis and chronic sinusitis. However, in this case, the sperm are not dead, just immotile. Eosin vital staining (a dye exclusion test) can differentiate between dead sperm (or necrozoospermia) and severe asthenozoospermia.
756b | 12) HORMONAL CONTROL OF SPERMATOGENESIS: The proper hormonal environment is essential for spermatogenesis. The hormones testosterone, FSH, and possibly growth hormone are involved directly with the developing germ cells. In addition, FSH, LH, and prolactin may be involved indirectly.
6bx7 | 13)
spl6 | a) The Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Testicular Axis:
7wzm | As discussed earlier, the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis is a closely integrated series of closed loop feedback systems involving the higher centers in the central nervous system, the hypothalamus, the pituitary, and the testicular endocrine and germinal compartments.
e9xj | The endocrine and exocrine functions of the testis are under the control of the pituitary through its secretion of the gonadotropins LH and FSH (Figure 18). The hypothalamic secretion of the LH- releasing hormone gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH), in turn, regulates the anterior pituitary. Steroids secreted by the testis under the influence of the gonadotropins can feedback on the hypothalamus and pituitary and modulate their secretions. The interrelationships between the hypothalamus, pituitary, and testis, therefore, represent a fine-tuned control mechanism for hormone secretion.
9vl6 | The hypothalamus secretes the decapeptide GnRH, which is responsible for stimulating the release of pituitary gonadotropins. The secretion of GnRH is episodic rather than constant and results in episodic release of LH.
c2fd | The rate of testosterone synthesis and secretion by the Leydig cells is primarily dependent upon the amount of LH secreted. The secretion of LH is reciprocally controlled by the action of testicular steroids on the hypothalamus and pituitary. When either androgen or estrogen concentrations
jzvp | increase in the blood circulation, LH levels decline (negative feedback). This action of testicular steroids can occur at the hypothalamic level, reducing the amount of GnRH secreted, or at the pituitary level, modulating the sensitivity of the pituitary to GnRH. When gonadal steroid levels decline, LH levels increase. These interactions result in a delicate balance between pituitary and testicular function.
f71y | Secretions from the Sertoli cells modulate the pituitary in much the same way that testicular steroids do. The Sertoli cell produces and secretes inhibin, which can selectively modulate the release of FSH from the pituitary.
31e1 | There are two forms of inhibin: inhibin A and inhibin B, which are formed from three subunits. Inhibin A is made up of one « subunit and one BA subunit. Inhibin B is made up of one o subunit and one BB subunit. Human males only produce inhibin B.
40ry | b) Direct Hormonal Control
d1j2 | The transformation of the primordial germ cells to the primitive type A i) spermatogonia may require testosterone during the ontogeny of the fetal testis.
wstc | ii) The initial division to type B spermatogonia and the subsequent steps to pachytene spermatocytes do not require gonadotropins or gonadal steroids, but may require retinoic acid and perhaps growth hormone.
ba1e | iii) The process of reductive division (primary to secondary spermatocytes) requires testosterone.
en95 | iv) Early stages of spermiogenesis do not require hormonal control.
