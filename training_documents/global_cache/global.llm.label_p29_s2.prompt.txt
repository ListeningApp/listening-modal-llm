You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

ffx8 | Our use of the term "global" here should not be miscon- strued as necessarily implying a planetary reach. For each issue under study, a separate determination must be made as to how far exactly large-scale processes and structures extend. In much existing work, historians have prematurely confined their in- quiries to fixed containers and geographical constraints. It would be equally fallacious to go to the opposite extreme and presuppose globality in every instance. What "global" suggests, therefore, is an openness to pursuing links and the question of causality beyond conventional containers and spatial units; it denotes "simply the methodological concern with experi- menting beyond familiar geographical boundaries."14
s6su | If "comparisons and connections" serves as the conven- tional shorthand for global history, then we must add a third "c": causality, pursued up to a global scale. The decision to focus on large forms of structured transformation and inte- gration is a choice that sets global history apart from other ap- proaches, such as comparative and transnational history. The emphasis on global integration will almost certainly raise a host of questions. Does this choice make it impossible to write global history about eras before integration, and before mo- dernity? Will this choice narrow the range of possible topics by insisting on an identifiably global causality? Does it com- pel global historians to study this global level explicitly? I will take up these issues in the following chapter.
y219 | Beyond connectivity: competing narratives
06ht | In order to better understand the significance of a non- internalist approach, and of the analytical role of global inte- gration, it may be helpful to briefly compare the perspective
v3r2 | of global history with three influential but contrasting ways in which historians have hitherto understood and interpreted transformations on a planetary scale. Somewhat schemati- cally, we can label them as Western exceptionalism, cultural imperialism, and the paradigm of independent origins. I will briefly sketch these three narratives and point out their short- comings when compared to a global history approach.
nv42 | The first metanarrative, still firmly entrenched in many text- books and general overview works, assumes a general process of modernization that originated in Europe and was then gradually disseminated around the globe. The defining fea- tures of this notion of modernity are familiar: the functional differentiation of social spheres, such as the economy, poli- tics, the social, and culture; and a gradual rationalization of all these spheres, giving birth to a capitalist and industrialized economy, the nation-state, and meritocratic bureaucracies; the replacement of hereditary estates by a class society and the modern individual; and the overcoming of traditional and re- ligious cosmologies through what Max Weber called the "dis- enchantment of the world."
xags | In principle, these were seen as universal developments, but in actual practice they emerged in Europe first and were then conveyed to the rest of the world. Such a diffusionist reading-epitomized by William McNeill's The Rise of the West-lay at the heart of many older world histories, espe- cially when guided by modernization theory, but also in many of the Marxist variants of world histories. "For the last thou- sand years," as David Landes has summarized this narrative, "Europe (the West) has been the prime mover of development and modernity."15 Such triumphalist formulations have be- come much less common, so that most accounts now replace the unabashed Eurocentrism of earlier days with a recognition
jc47 | of the various forms of negotiation and adaptation that at- tended the process. At its core, however, the basic assumptions of this narrative are still in place: Europe/the West is seen as the locus of innovation, and world history is essentially un- derstood as a history of the diffusion of European progress.16
ko3c | Against this formerly dominant view, a second interpreta- tion emerged that was based on a radically critical reading of the dissemination of Western modernity. This view is associ- ated with postcolonial, subaltern, and some Marxist perspec- tives. In it, modernity remains essentially European and is still equated with the march of universal reason. But the spread of modernity is seen not as emancipatory but as a process of deprivation.
xek3 | There are two different, but related arguments involved. The first is the hypothesis that it was Enlightenment univer- salism that lay at the root of the West's expansionist urge. It was only a small step, the critique runs, from positing univer- sal standards to deciding to intervene and to implement these standards, by force, under the auspices of a paternalistic civi- lizing mission. The second argument is related. The spread of Western modernity is understood as a form of cultural impe- rialism with the potential to eradicate alternative worldviews. Critical scholars have interpreted the spread of Enlighten- ment tenets in the nineteenth century as a process of coerced and often brutal diffusion, made possible and driven by highly asymmetrical relations of power.17
bbpr | Both approaches discussed so far-emancipatory modern- ization and cultural imperialism-are essentially diffusion- ist and take the European origins of modernity for granted. What is more, they rest on the supposed absence of substan- tial cultural and social development elsewhere as one of their
5zyf | axiomatic tenets. In recent years, however, the European claim to originality, to exclusive authorship of modernity, has been called into question. Historians have begun to look for paral- lels and analogies to the European "march of civilization," for autochthonous processes of rationalization that did not de- pend on, but led to similar results as, developments in Europe. This is the third paradigm sketched here, and it forms part of a larger scholarly debate on the origins of modernity. It was born out of a desire to challenge diffusionist notions of mod- ernization, and to acknowledge the social dynamics that pre- vailed in many societies before their encounter with the West. The aim was to replace older notions of traditional societies and "people without history" with a broader understanding of multiple modernities. But in the end, this approach posits an identical telos-a modern, capitalist society-even if this goal is not achieved via transformations inspired by contact with the West, but rather builds on indigenous cultural resources: a teleology of universal disenchantment, realized in each soci- ety internally, but across the globe.
9own | All three approaches converge in their methodological bias for national and civilizational frames. Their many differ- ences notwithstanding, all rely on internalist logics in their attempt to explain what must be understood as a global phe- nomenon. If we are going to take the challenge of global his- tory seriously, we need to move beyond these three approaches and focus on the connectivities and processes of integration that have shaped and reconfigured societies globally. Sanjay Subrahmanyam has argued that modernity is "historically a global and conjunctural phenomenon, not a virus that spreads from one place to another. It is located in a series of histori- cal processes that brought hitherto relatively isolated societies
bqfb | into contact, and we must seek its roots in a set of diverse phe- nomena."18 From such a vantage point, it is less instructive to search for alleged origins-European or otherwise-than to focus on the global conditions and interactions through which the modern world emerged. This is why notions of global in- tegration and system-like dependencies are crucial: changes in one location within the integrated world ripple through the system to affect other parts as well.
wwdt | It is clear that the four approaches discussed above-world history, postcolonialism, multiple modernities, and global history-cannot be neatly separated, but overlap in many re- spects. They are, in other words, ideal types. For heuristic pur- poses, however, it is helpful to keep them apart analytically. Let us very briefly look at a few issues and see how these dif- ferent paradigms may lead to very different results (indeed: to different questions)-before then using the case of national- ism to illustrate in greater detail the analytical surplus that is characteristic of a global history approach vis-à-vis the three other paradigms.
mn1r | A first example is the case of human rights, on which a substantial historiography has recently emerged. A standard world history perspective would hold that the rights of man have a European genealogy that reaches back to humanism, and even a bit earlier, before coalescing into a program with global reach during the French Revolution. These rights with their universal claims then traveled beyond their place of ori- gin and gradually gained acceptance around the world.19 A postcolonial reading would instead emphasize the parochial and culturally specific notion of human rights and the indis- criminate way in which it was used to marginalize, and indeed efface, alternative concepts of entitlement and equality that
5vqw | were less dependent on the concepts of nation and the indi- vidual. A third approach, that of multiple modernities, insists on indigenous cultural and political resources that allowed multiple notions of human rights to emerge in many different places, largely independent of each other. Building on these three approaches, recent forays into a global history of human rights focus instead on the emergence of human rights as a truly global discourse. Historians have thoroughly explored the global scope of human rights discourse by placing the em- phasis less on the French Revolution and more on the appro- priation and universalization of a language of rights in Haiti a few years later.20 In the twentieth century, the 1970s appear as a pivotal moment, when the decline of socialism and national- ism as political ideologies paved the way for the rise of human rights claims to the status of a hoped for "Last Utopia." The intellectual origins of human rights, in this reading, are of less importance than the synchronous global conditions of their overall acceptance, and of their fusion with local genealogies in very diverse locations.21
meyw | A similar case can be made in the field of international law. For a long time, historians have seen the Law of Nations, as it emerged in the wake of Hugo Grotius, as well as the subse- quent development of international law, as a rationalization of international relations. Against this belief in the benevo- lent spread of a European accomplishment, critical scholars have pointed out the close connection between the Law of Nations and European imperialism, and have judged ostensi- bly universal claims to be no more than a thin veil concealing colonial ambitions.22 Third, in their quest to identify inde- pendent origins for international law in today's global order, scholars have begun to mine the cultural and legal history of
2e62 | various societies to show that parts of what is currently held to be common sense are contributions from alternative non- Western traditions. A global perspective would want to ad- dress more specifically why international law emerged when it did, why it was appropriated by different actors around the world, and in what ways it can be understood as a response to a global challenge. A preoccupation with the inventors and intellectual patent-holders, in other words, would lose its pri- macy, while the actual practice of international law moved to center stage.23
75y3 | We can extend the heuristic differentiation of these four ap- proaches to virtually all fields of historical inquiry. Was the concept of race a European invention, a tool of empire, a no- tion that grew from various indigenous roots-or a response to global challenges? Was the Enlightenment the accomplish- ment of European salon culture, a Western imposition, the product of many indigenous cultures of rationalization-or rather a way in which social elites around the world came to terms with new global realities?24 Or think of attempts to his- toricize the global history of fascism. World historians have tried to define the term by drawing up a laundry list of neces- sary features: a charismatic leader, mass mobilization, an ide- ology of ultra-nationalism, and so on. All of these features, however, were derived from the European experience. Other instances of fascism, in Japan or Argentina, for example, would seem to fall short of the requirements; in fact, even German National Socialism did not live up to the model set by Italian Fascism, and vice versa. By using global history as a correc- tive lens for this slightly myopic analysis, historians have paid more attention to transfers and direct contacts and have thus been able to reveal to what extent Italy and Germany served as models and inspiration in many places around the world.
s2g2 | Moving beyond comparison and transfer history, finally, a more systematic focus on global integration would begin with the shared global situation of the interwar years, and the quest, by many societies, for a "third way" between classical liberal- ism and communism, a quest that led many governments to experiment with new forms of social organization and mobi- lization. From such a perspective, the absence of this or that item on the laundry list-Was there a mass party challenging the establishment, or only mobilization "from above"? for example-is of less importance than understanding different cases as related, but differentiated ways of coping with struc- tural transformations and a changing international order.25
q1q2 | Case Study: Nations and Nationalism in global history
cb7r | In this final section, let us look in greater depth at the his- toriography of nationalism, as it is here that we can observe most clearly how new global perspectives have been able to complement and modify earlier ways of situating the nation within world history. In some respects, the nation is an un- likely candidate for such an endeavor. Not too long ago, in the 1990s, when "globalization" became the "in" word, some pundits were quick to predict the end of the nation-state alto- gether. In the realm of scholarship, its future prospects were equally bleak. Transnational and global histories were written with the explicit purpose of moving beyond the nation-state. But this moment of crisis-or was it one of euphoria ?- soon abated, and gave way to the recognition that nation-states had staying power and would continue to be relevant, albeit in an altered setting. It has also become clear that global history is
68xu | not about consigning the nation/nation-state to the dustbin of history, but rather about reassessing its historical role and better explaining its emergence and significance.
hd35 | How do these more recent approaches compare with ear- lier attempts to place the nation in the world? To a certain extent, it is no exaggeration to say that the theory of national- ism operated on a global scale from its very beginnings. Thus, the explanatory approaches inspired by early modernization theory-most notably by Ernest Gellner-were universal in scope. They posited the formation of nations as an effect of the ongoing transition from traditional to modern societies. While nationalist activists typically emphasized the distinc- tive character of a given nation, Gellner discarded all claims to uniqueness by postulating a universal law of development: industrial manufacturing destroyed the hierarchies of agri- cultural society in order to guarantee the mobility of labor and thus continuous growth. Nationalist self-legitimation may have stressed a shared history, a common language, and com- mon cultural patterns, but for Gellner, nationalism was "the establishment of an anonymous, impersonal society [. . . ], in place of a previous complex structure of local groups [. . . ]. That is what really happens."26
2zpk | In this view, all nationalisms were, despite their superficial variations, essentially the same, and nationalism everywhere was an effect of socioeconomic modernization that could be explained in entirely endogenous terms. That being the case, there was no obstacle to comparing the experiences of far-flung locales with one another. By contrast, more recent approaches have instead highlighted connections and transfers. They have concluded that the worldwide prevalence of nationalism in the nineteenth century cannot be ascribed to internal factors alone, but must be understood as a result of diffusion as well.
