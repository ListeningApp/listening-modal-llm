The nuclear chromatin is densely packed and homogeneous. Sperm nuclei contain either the X or Y chromosome. It is therefore the male gamete that determines the sex of the offspring. The head region also contains the acrosome, which covers a large portion of the nucleus like a cap. The acrosome contains hydrolytic enzymes that, upon release, function in the penetration of the cumulus and zona pellucida surrounding the egg and facilitate fertilization. The absence of the acrosome, a genetic defect, is termed \"round-headed sperm\" or globozoospermia.\njomo | b) Neck - also called the connecting piece. At the base of the nucleus is the proximal centriole, followed by an atypical distal centriole and the axoneme, which are all located in the connecting piece.\n06fi | c) Midpiece - contains the mitochondria, which is the main machinery for trapping, conserving, and supplying the energy needed for motility. Also, the beginning of the axoneme, which makes up the flagellum.\nhb4s | d) Principal Piece and End Piece - The flagellum of the tail of the spermatozoon. It is surrounded by a dense fibrous sheath.\ncqq2 | Eleven Sperm Motility Characteristics\n1ews | a) The sperm tail beats approximately ten times per second. In seminal plasma, the sperm velocity ranges from ten to sixty micrometers per second. The average motility for a normal male is approximately fifty to sixty percent within half to one hour of ejaculation.\nafyn | Tobacco, sexual lubricants, saliva, alcohol, and drugs may decrease sperm motility. Genetic defects can also impact sperm motility.\n8sye | b) Axonemal Structure of Sperm Tails and the Sliding Microtubule Theory, Figure Nine: The microtubule structure of the human sperm tail is the same as that of most plants and animals. The axoneme, or central core of the sperm tail, originates within the mitochondrial sheath and extends the length of the sperm tail. The axoneme consists of two central microtubules surrounded by nine microtubule doublets, which has been referred to as the \"nine plus two configuration\". Each axonemal doublet is composed of two subfibers, A and B. Subfiber A is a complete microtubule while subfiber B is a \"C-shaped\" microtubule which is\nr04h | attached to subfiber A. Radial spokes, or arms, composed of dynein extend from each subfiber A to the adjacent subfiber B.\norpr | When powered by ATP hydrolysis, the microtubule doublets walk along each other by means of their dynein arms. Given the shear resistance within the axoneme, as the microtubule doublets walk along each other, bends form in the tail and propagate in such a way as to produce the characteristic movements of the sperm tail. This propagation of movement due to the sliding of microtubules along each other is called the \"Sliding Microtubule Theory\".\nk36m | The presence of the dynein arms is crucial for proper flagellar movement, as are the other structures shown in Figure Sixteen and Seventeen and described in more detail in Chapter Fourteen. If these dynein arms are absent, sperm will display complete asthenozoospermia. For example, Kartagener syndrome, also called immotile sperm or immotile cilia syndrome, is a hereditary condition characterized by ciliary immotility due to the absence of dynein arms. Men with this syndrome will suffer infertility due to immotile sperm. The condition is also associated with other abnormalities due to immotile cilia, such as bronchiectasis and chronic sinusitis. However, in this case, the sperm are not dead, just immotile. Eosin vital staining can differentiate between dead sperm, or necrozoospermia, and severe asthenozoospermia.\nwnuz | Twelve HORMONAL CONTROL OF SPERMATOGENESIS: The proper hormonal environment is essential for spermatogenesis. The hormones testosterone, follicle-stimulating hormone, and possibly growth hormone are involved directly with the developing germ cells. In addition, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, and prolactin may be involved indirectly.\nsy14 | Thirteen\nghss | a) The Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Testicular Axis:\n3s61 | As discussed earlier, the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis is a closely integrated series of closed loop feedback systems involving the higher centers in the central nervous system, the hypothalamus, the pituitary, and the testicular endocrine and germinal compartments.\ns3rm | The endocrine and exocrine functions of the testis are under the control of the pituitary through its secretion of the gonadotropins luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone. The hypothalamic secretion of the luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone gonadotropin releasing hormone, in turn, regulates the anterior pituitary. Steroids secreted by the testis under the influence of the gonadotropins can feedback on the hypothalamus and pituitary and modulate their secretions. The interrelationships between the hypothalamus, pituitary, and testis, therefore, represent a fine-tuned control mechanism for hormone secretion.\npqxb | The hypothalamus secretes the decapeptide gonadotropin releasing hormone, which is responsible for stimulating the release of pituitary gonadotropins. The secretion of gonadotropin releasing hormone is episodic rather than constant and results in episodic release of luteinizing hormone.\n08qc | The rate of testosterone synthesis and secretion by the Leydig cells is primarily dependent upon the amount of luteinizing hormone secreted. The secretion of luteinizing hormone is reciprocally controlled by the action of testicular steroids on the hypothalamus and pituitary. When either androgen or estrogen concentrations\nhdj2 | increase in the blood circulation, luteinizing hormone levels decline negative feedback. This action of testicular steroids can occur at the hypothalamic level, reducing the amount of gonadotropin releasing hormone secreted, or at the pituitary level, modulating the sensitivity of the pituitary to gonadotropin releasing hormone. When gonadal steroid levels decline, luteinizing hormone levels increase. These interactions result in a delicate balance between pituitary and testicular function.\na57g | Secretions from the Sertoli cells modulate the pituitary in much the same way that testicular steroids do. The Sertoli cell produces and secretes inhibin, which can selectively modulate the release of follicle-stimulating hormone from the pituitary.\ng8m3 | There are two forms of inhibin: inhibin A and inhibin B, which are formed from three subunits. Inhibin A is made up of one alpha subunit and one beta-A subunit. Inhibin B is made up of one alpha subunit and one beta-B subunit. Human males only produce inhibin B.\na9av | b) Direct Hormonal Control\n73l3 | The transformation of the primordial germ cells to the primitive type A i) spermatogonia may require testosterone during the ontogeny of the fetal testis.\nornm | ii) The initial division to type B spermatogonia and the subsequent steps to pachytene spermatocytes do not require gonadotropins or gonadal steroids, but may require retinoic acid and perhaps growth hormone.\nu2z1 | iii) The process of reductive division, primary to secondary spermatocytes requires testosterone.\natmh | iv) Early stages of spermiogenesis do not require hormonal control.\n```",
