You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

3yxv | Quickly getting rid of all the things associated with the deceased- giving them away or disposing of them in any way possible even to the point of having a quick disposal of the body-can lead to a complicated grief reaction. This is usually not healthy behavior and is often indicative of a highly ambivalent relationship with the deceased. Ambivalent rela- tionships are one of the mediators of mourning described in Chapter 3.
d8zj | Searching and Calling Out
ywxn | Both Bowlby and Parkes have written much in their work about search- ing behavior. Calling out is related to this searching behavior. Frequently somebody may call out the name of the loved person: "John, John, John. Please come back to me!" When this is not done verbally, it can be going on subvocally.

ed6e | Sighing
6qqm | Sighing is a behavior frequently noted among the bereaved. It is a close correlate of the physical sensation of breathlessness. Colleagues at the Massachusetts General Hospital tested respiration in a small group of bereaved parents and found that their oxygen and carbon diox- ide levels were similar to those found in depressed patients (Jellinek, Goldenheim, & Jenike, 1985).
onum | Restless Hyperactivity
3iir | A number of widows in our Harvard studies of bereavement entered into restless hyperactivity following the deaths of their husbands. The woman mentioned previously whose husband left her with two teenage children could not stand to stay at home. She would get into her car and drive all over town trying to find some sense of relief from her restless- ness. Another widow could stay in the house during the day because she was busy, but at night she fled.
7a0a | Crying
o1qp | There has been interesting speculation that tears may have potential healing value. Stress causes chemical imbalances in the body, and some researchers believe that tears remove toxic substances and help reestab- lish homeostasis. They hypothesize that the chemical content of tears caused by emotional stress is different from that of tears secreted as a function of eye irritation. Tests are being done to see what type of cat- echolamine (mood-altering chemicals produced by the brain) is pres- ent in tears of emotion (Frey, 1980). Tears do relieve emotional stress, but how they do this is still a question. Further research is needed on the deleterious effects, if any, of suppressed crying. Martin (2012), who has worked with individuals and families experiencing grief from trau- matic events, has written an interesting paper titled "Grief That Has No Vent in Tears Makes Other Organs Weep." This helps us to understand how highly traumatic experiences, emotionally and cognitively unpro- cessed, may become bodily expressed.
jrik | Visiting Places or Carrying Objects That Remind the Survivor of the Deceased
xv78 | This is the opposite of the behavior that people engage in to avoid reminders of the lost person. Often underlying this behavior is the fear of losing memories of the deceased. "For 2 weeks I carried his picture with me constantly for fear I would forget his face," one widow told me.
sdks | Treasuring Objects That Belonged to the Deceased
y8fb | One young woman went through her mother's closet shortly after her mother died and took many of her clothes home. They wore the same size, and although this might seem like an example of someone being thrifty, the fact was that the daughter did not feel comfortable unless she was wearing something that had belonged to her mother. She wore these clothes for several months. As her mourning progressed, she found it less and less necessary to wear clothing that had belonged to her mother. Finally, she gave most of it away to charity.
521q | The reason for outlining these characteristics of normal grief in such detail is to show the wide variety of behaviors and experiences associ- ated with loss. Obviously, not all these behaviors will be experienced by one person. However, it is important for bereavement counselors to understand the wide range of behaviors covered under normal grief, so they do not pathologize behavior that should be recognized as normal. Having this understanding will also enable counselors to give reassur- ance to people who experience such behavior as disturbing, especially in the case of their first significant loss. However, if these experiences persist late in the bereavement process, they may be indicative of a more complicated grief (Demi & Miles, 1987).
yogo | GRIEF AND DEPRESSION
2285 | Many of the normal grief behaviors may seem like manifestations of depression. To shed some light on this, let's look at the debate about the similarities and differences between grief and depression.
ys0g | Freud (1917/1957), in his early paper "Mourning and Melancholia," addressed this issue. He tried to point out that depression, or melancho- lia, as he called it, is a pathological form of grief and is very much like mourning (normal grief) except that it has a certain characteristic fea- ture of its own-namely, angry impulses toward the ambivalently loved person turned inward. It is true that grief looks very much like depres- sion, and it is also true that grieving may develop into a full-blown depression. Klerman (Kierman & Izen, 1977; Klerman & Weissman, 1986), who was a prominent depression researcher, believed that many depressions are precipitated by losses, either immediately following the loss or at some later time when the patient is reminded of the loss. Depression may also serve as a defense against mourning. If anger is directed against the self, it is deflected away from the deceased, and this keeps the survivor from dealing with ambivalent feelings toward the deceased (Dorpat, 1973).
7zvp | Grief Counseling and Grief Therapy
ww6u | The main distinctions between grief and depression are these: In depression as well as grief, you may find the classic symptoms of sleep disturbance, appetite disturbance, and intense sadness; however, in a grief reaction, there is not the loss of self-esteem commonly found in most clinical depressions. That is, the people who have lost someone do not have less regard for themselves as a result of such a loss, or if they do, it tends to be for only a brief time. And if the survivors of the deceased experience guilt, it is usually guilt associated with some spe- cific aspect of the loss rather than a general overall sense of culpability. Even though grief and depression share similar objective and subjec- tive features, they do seem to be different conditions. Depression over- laps with bereavement but is not the same (Robinson & Fleming, 1989, 1992; Wakefield & Schmitz, 2013; Worden & Silverman, 1993; Zisook & Kendler, 2007). Freud believed that in grief, the world looks poor and empty, while in depression, the person feels poor and empty. These differences in cognitive style have been identified by Beck and associ- ates (1979) and other cognitive therapists who have suggested that the depressed have negative evaluations of themselves, the world, and the future. Although such negative evaluations can exist in the bereaved, they tend to be more transient.
