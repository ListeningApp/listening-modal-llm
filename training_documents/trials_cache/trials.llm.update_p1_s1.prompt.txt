You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

u2ob | CLINICAL TRIALS SESSION 3 THE SIZE OF TRIALS
2gnm | 1 Objectives

5rcb | · Understand the importance of the size of a trial to provide reliable results
524j | . Explain the key factors in determining the required size for a particular trial
xd3m | · Discuss the importance of power for sample size calculations

7xi5 | 2 Introduction
w8r5 | In previous sessions the focus has been on the importance of randomisation, control groups and blinding (where appropriate) to avoid bias in the results from a clinical trial. A further key issue in the design of a clinical trial is ensuring there are sufficient numbers of patients.
ybik | The aim of a trial should be to provide reliable evidence of the effectiveness and safety of a treatment. To achieve this, enough patients are needed in our trial to give a good chance of detecting a clinically important treatment difference if such a difference exists, while being able to reasonably conclude that no such difference exists if our results do not show it.
gii5 | Given the importance of sample size there are several approaches that can be taken to answer the question "How many patients do we need?". For example:
q5eu | (1) Statistical/scientific approach. This approach is concerned with determining how many patients are needed to get firm evidence of a treatment difference if it exists, and to estimate any difference precisely (i.e. within a sufficiently small confidence interval (CI)).
a7ao | (2) Economic/pragmatic approach. In reality, other constraints will impact on the ability to recruit the numbers required from a purely statistical approach. For example, how many patients are available, and how much time, effort and cost is involved?
29a3 | (3) Ethical approach. In many clinical trials decisions need to be made as to how long it is ethical to continue a trial. The question that might be asked here is "How soon can we stop a trial to avoid some patients getting inferior treatment?". This will be dealt with in detail in session 4: "Data Monitoring".
sb1e | (4) Credibility. If a trial is very small, it's results may not be seen as providing believable evidence.
w2yn | 3.1
ap6l | In determining the required size of a trial all of the above approaches are usually considered, but this session is mainly concerned with (1) the statistical approach. The compromises to be made between purely scientific objectives and practical constraints, and the implications of trials which are too small will also be considered.
iest | In order to appreciate the impact of sample size for interpreting trial results consider the table below showing the results from two placebo-controlled trials assessing the impact of streptokinase for reducing mortality in patients who have experienced a myocardial infarction (MI).
cox8 | <LATEX>p < 0 . 0 0 0 1</LATEX> <LATEX>R i s k \quad r a t i o = 0 . 7 7 \left( 9 5 C I \quad 0 . 7 0 \quad t o \quad 0 . 8 4 \right)</LATEX> The estimated treatment effect is very similar in the two trials. Further, the proportions of patients who die in the two trials are also very similar. However, while the ISIS-2 trial provides very strong evidence of a treatment effect with <LATEX>\mathrm { p } < 0 . 0 0 0 1</LATEX> and a tight confidence interval, the 1st Australian trial is unconvincing with <LATEX>p = 0 . 3 2</LATEX> and a wide confidence interval. Even though more than 500 patients were recruited, the trial was too small in these circumstances.
ppqi | 3 Key factors in determining the required sample size
oxou | The previous section indicated the impact the size of a trial can have on the interpretation of results. In particular, trials which are too small lead to results which are inconclusive. There are a number of key factors that determine the required size of a trial and in particular there are five key questions that need to be asked. In order to illustrate these factors, the UK PACE study in fitting a dual chamber vs. single chamber pacemaker for patients with atrioventricular block is used.
495n | Note that while questions (2) and (5) are more technical these are fairly standard whereas questions (3) and (4) are perhaps the most important and difficult to address. The answers to these two questions will have the most impact on the required size as will be shown later in the session.
awri | (1) What is the principal outcome measure of the trial?
bl28 | In designing a trial, a suitable primary outcome measure is chosen to reflect the main purpose of conducting the trial. The sample size requirements need to be based on this outcome measure in order to reliably address the prime purpose of the trial.
d5bz | For example, in the UK PACE trial the purpose was to assess whether dual chamber pacing could reduce mortality compared to the more usual single chamber by comparing mortality at four years.
ap5o | 3.2
7zvf | (2) How will the data be analysed to detect a treatment difference?
mov9 | Some thought should be given to the appropriate analysis for the outcome being measured. For example, is the outcome the occurrence of some event (e.g. death) or a continuous outcome (e.g. blood pressure). In addition, the level of statistical significance that will be accepted as indicating evidence of a treatment difference should also be considered. This is usually set at 5% i.e. if the final p-value <0.05 then this would be accepted as there being some evidence for a real treatment effect.
ks7m | For, example, the simplest analysis for the UK PACE trial is a comparison between the groups of the percentage of patients who die within four years of randomisation using a <LATEX>x ^ { 2 }</LATEX> test. A 5% significance level was used.
w1w1 | (3) What results are expected in the control group?
h8gv | Clearly the results that will be observed in the control arm will not be known. However, there may well be information from previous trials or observational studies as to what might be expected.
kwkp | For example, in the UK PACE trial it was expected that 24% of patients would die by four years in the single chamber group.
yj0m | (4) How small a treatment difference, if it exists, is important to detect?
ewfp | This is perhaps the key decision that needs to be taken in determining sample size. If a very large treatment difference exists, then this can be detected with relatively few numbers. For example, in the UK PACE trial if the dual chamber pacing reduced mortality by three-quarters (i.e. from 24% to 6%) then relatively few patients are needed (in fact less than 200). Of course, such a difference is unlikely and, more importantly, a difference much smaller than this would be clinically very important to detect if it were true.
oczy | It could be argued that any difference would be important to detect but this is unrealistic as huge trials would be required (an example of this will be given later). What needs to be decided upon is the smallest clinically relevant difference that would be important to detect if it were true.
2ttg | For example, in the UK PACE trial it was decided that a one quarter reduction (i.e. from 24% to 18%) would be clinically important to detect.
his3 | (5) What degree of certainty is needed to be able to detect the treatment difference in (4)?
