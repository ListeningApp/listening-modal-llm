You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

v6sk | Enzymatic Oxidation of Methane
1wj6 | ABSTRACT: Methane monooxygenases (MMOs) are en- zymes that catalyze the oxidation of methane to methanol in CHA methanotrophic bacteria. As potential targets for new gas-to- . liquid methane bioconversion processes, MMOs have attracted intense attention in recent years. There are two distinct types of MMO, a soluble, cytoplasmic MMO (sMMO) and a membrane-bound, particulate MMO (pMMO). Both oxidize CH OH methane at metal centers within a complex, multisubunit scaffold, but the structures, active sites, and chemical mechanisms are completely different. This Current Topic review article focuses on the overall architectures, active site structures, substrate reactivities, protein-protein interactions, and chemical mechanisms of both MMOs, with an emphasis on fundamental aspects. In addition, recent advances, including new details of interactions between the sMMO components, characterization of sMMO intermediates, and progress toward understanding the pMMO metal centers are highlighted. The work summarized here provides a guide for those interested in exploiting MMOs for biotechnological applications.
936l | A erobic methane oxidation in nature is carried out by methanotrophic bacteria, organisms that can use methane as their sole source of carbon and energy. Despite the extremely strong C-H bond in methane (AH298 = 105 kcal/mol)," these bacteria are capable of oxidizing methane to methanol under ambient conditions using metalloenzymes called methane monooxygenases (MMOs). Understanding the biochemistry of MMOs is critical to their applications in bioremediation2 and to the development of biological processes for conversion of natural gas to liquid fuels and chemicals.3 Moreover, detailed characterization of MMO active sites may lead to new biomimetic catalysts.4 A range of alkane-oxidizing enzymes exist in the environment, but only the two types of MMO, soluble MMO (sMMO) and particulate MMO (pMMO), as well as the close pMMO homologue ammonia monooxygenase (AMO),' can oxidize methane. Although sMMO and pMMO perform the same chemical reaction, their structures, cofactor requirements, and mechanisms are completely different.
06yq | sMMO requires three protein components for activity: a hydroxylase (MMOH, 251 kDa), a reductase (MMOR, 38.5 kDa), and a regulatory protein (MMOB, 15.9 kDa).7 MMOH is responsible for methane oxidation and is composed of a, , and y subunits encoded by the mmoX, mmoY, and mmoZ genes, respectively. MMOB and MMOR are encoded by the mmoB and mmoC genes. The pMMO hydroxylase consists of the pmoB, pmoA, and pmoC subunits, encoded by the pmoCAB operon (Figure 1). No regulatory protein has been identified for pMMO, and the identity of its native reductase remains unclear." Most methanotrophs express only pMMO. A few species express only sMMO, and a subset contains genes for both pMMO and sMMO.10 In this subset, sMMO expression occurs when copper levels in the growth medium are below 1 HM, and pMMO expression is predominant at copper levels

o3ya | above 5 uM.11-13 This "copper switch" parallels the metal cofactor requirements of the MMOs: sMMO has a catalytic diiron center,14 and pMMO utilizes a copper active site." The mechanism of the copper switch is still unknown, but recent work suggests that the copper-chelating natural product methanobactin, genes encoded by the methanobactin operon, and mmoD, a gene product of unknown function encoded by the sMMO operon, could play a role. 15,16 A transcriptional activator, mmoR, and a GroEL-like chaperone protein, mmoG (Figure 1), are required for sMMO expression.17,18
r5il | Studies of both MMOs over the past quarter century have provided much insight into their structure and function. This Current Topic summarizes work addressing the architecture, active sites, substrate reactivities, protein-protein interactions, and chemical mechanisms of both systems, with emphasis on fundamental aspects that must be considered if MMOs are to be exploited in new gas-to-liquid methane bioconversion processes. In addition, recent advances that have not been reviewed previously are highlighted. A more comprehensive review is available elsewhere.19

MMOB, which has no cofactors, consists of seven ß strands arranged in two ß sheets and three a helices. MMOR consists of two mixed aß domains: an FAD- and NADH-binding domain provides electrons to a [2Fe-2S] ferredoxin domain for transfer to the MMOH active site.7,22

The first crystal structure of pMMO was that of the M. capsulatus (Bath) enzyme, determined in 2005 to 2.8 Å resolution.23 Structures of pMMOs from Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b, Methylocystis species strain M, and Methylocystis species strain Rockwell have also been reported (Table 1).24-26 The pmoB, pmoA, and pmoC subunits are arranged as a 300 kDa @33313 trimer (Figure 2B), which is consistent with electron microscopic data.27 The pmoB subunit (42 kDa) consists of two cupredoxin-like domains linked by two transmembrane helices. The pmoA (24 kDa) and pmoC (22 kDa) subunits are composed primarily of transmembrane helices. In three of the four pMMO crystal structures, an additional helix not connected to any of the pMMO subunits is observed and appears to interact closely with the pmoC + 24-26 In the Methylocystis sp. str. Rockwell pMMO structure, this interaction is mediated by a lipid molecule (Figure 3).20 Since pMMO is crystallized from the native organism, this yet to be identified helix is likely physiologically relevant.
2zmw | Figure 3. One aßy protomer of Methylocystis sp. strain Rockwell pMMO (PDB accession code 4PHZ) showing the unidentified helix (purple) and two bound lipids (green and yellow). The unidentified helix is also observed in structures of pMMO from M. trichosporium OB3b and Methylocystis sp. strain M. The lipid shown in green forms hydrogen bonds with conserved arginine residues from pmoC and mediates the interaction between pmoC and the mystery helix.

This diiron center is housed within a four-helix bundle of which surface-exposed helices E and F play key roles in modulating structural changes throughout the catalytic cycle.22 Fe1 is coordinated by His147, Glu114, and a water molecule, and Fe2 is coordinated by His246, Glu243, and Glu209.2º The two iron ions are bridged by residue Glu144 and two hydroxides (Figure 4A).

This shift opens a site for reaction with dioxygen (Figure 4B).21,28 It is well established that the two iron ions are present as an antiferromagnetically coupled diiron(III) site in oxidized MMOH and a weakly ferromagnetically coupled diiron(II) center in reduced MMOH.29-32 A mixed valence form can also be generated, but does not play a role in the catalytic cycle.7
9mrz | Particulate MMO. In contrast to MMOH, several metal centers are observed in the structures of pMMO. All structures contain a copper binding site at the N-terminus of the pmoB subunit with ligands His33, which is the amino terminal residue of pmoB, His137, and His139 (M. capsulatus (Bath) numbering) (Figure 5). Guided by extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) data,33 this site was modeled as two copper ions with a Cu-Cu distance of ~2.5 Å in the structures of M. capsulatus (Bath)23 and M. trichosporium OB3b24 pMMO, and in one protomer of Methylocystis sp. str. M pMMO.25 However, the moderate crystallographic resolution (2.6-3.9 Å) precludes definitive assignment of the nuclearity. This site was modeled as monocopper in Methylocystis sp. str. Rockwell pMMO20 and in two protomers of Methylocystis sp. str. M pMMO.25 Both of these pMMOs exhibit low copper binding stoichiometries once the enzyme is purified and concentrated. In the Methylocystis sp. str. Rockwell pMMO structure, a solvent molecule is modeled coordinated to the single copper ion (Figure 5) and is within hydrogen bonding distance of Glu31 (Glu35 using M. capsulatus (Bath) numbering).20 A monocopper site is also present at the equivalent location in the 1.8 Å resolution structure of the soluble domain of the amoB
