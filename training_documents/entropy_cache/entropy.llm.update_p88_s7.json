As long as Kappa is greater than zero, the energy depends quadratically on two degrees of freedom so expected energy equals k T. But when Kappa equals zero it depends on just one, and suddenly expected energy equals one-half k T. How is such a discontinuity possible? In other words: how can a particle care so much about the difference between an arbitrarily small positive spring constant and a spring constant that's exactly zero, making its expected energy twice as much in the first case?\nyufa | I'll warn you: this puzzle is deliberately devilish. In a way it's a trick question!\n4ggu | PARTICLE IN A BOX: FREE ENERGY\nvbg6 | A classical free particle of mass m in a one-dimensional box of length L has partition function\no5y1 | Z equals one divided by two times temperature times mass times length minus beta\ngxus | The free energy of any system is given by F equals negative natural logarithm Z, so B one\nkfy5 | F equals negative natural logarithm\neg1f | Using one divided by kT and fiddling around a bit, we can rewrite this as\n4npi | F equals negative k T (natural logarithm L plus negative natural logarithm kT plus negative natural logarithm one-half natural logarithm constant K T plus one-half two times mass times constant H squared\nq93a | From the partition function of a classical free particle in a one-dimensional box we can also compute its free energy!\ngxvi | PARTICLE IN A BOX: ENTROPY\nigdg | We've shown that in thermal equilibrium, a classical particle of mass m in a one-dimensional box of length L has expected energy expected energy equals k T one\n3u7c | and free energy\ncx2c | F equals negative k T (natural logarithm L plus negative natural logarithm kT plus negative natural logarithm one-half times one-half times two times mass times constant H squared\nuoim | But entropy S is always (expected energy minus F) divided by T, so\ndwsl | S equals k natural logarithm L plus one-half natural logarithm kT plus natural logarithm one plus one-half\nlpnq | Having worked out the expected energy expected energy and free energy F for a single classical particle in thermal equilibrium in a one-dimensional box, it is easy to work out its entropy. We just subtract the free energy from the expected energy and divide by temperature:\nc0cp | S : (expected energy minus F T .\nvm3e | The formula we get is not very snappy:\nky8f | S equals k (natural logarithm L plus five natural logarithm kT plus natural logarithm one divided by two times mass times constant H squared plus two) .\ngtxr | We will get a better formula later, and ponder its meaning. For now, let's just make these observations:\nehqu | When we make the length L of the box larger, the entropy becomes larger.\n5hiy | When we increase the temperature T, the entropy becomes larger.\nghiq | When we increase the mass m of the particle, the entropy becomes larger.\nytlm | The first two facts should feel intuitively obvious. When we increase the box's length, there is more unknown information about the position of the particle in thermal equilibrium. When we increase the particle's temperature, there is more unknown information about its momentum. The third fact is less obvious. When we introduce the concept of 'thermal wavelength', we will see that increasing the particle's mass decreases its thermal wavelength, which in turn increases its entropy in thermal equilibrium.\nfg9j | WHERE ARE WE NOW?\nwt58 | The mystery: why does each molecule of hydrogen have approximately twenty-three bits of entropy at standard temperature and pressure?\ngcgx | The goal: derive and understand the formula for the entropy of a classical ideal monatomic gas:\nxeng | N (natural logarithm ) volume three N plus negative natural logarithm kT plus unknown constant two\njf2c | including the mysterious constant y.\n9qk9 | The subgoal: compute the entropy of a single classical particle in a one-dimensional box:\nmki0 | S equals k natural logarithm L plus negative natural logarithm kT plus natural logarithm T plus two one\ndin5 | The sub-subgoal: explain entropy from the ground up, and compute the entropy of a classical harmonic oscillator:\nqc24 | how kT one checkmark\nktw4 | Let's pause to remember where we are in our game plan. First we computed the entropy of a classical harmonic oscillator. Now we've computed the entropy of a single classical particle in a one-dimensional box. The answer looks a bit like the entropy of an ideal gas! That's no coincidence we're almost there now.\n0wr0 | In case you wanted to know the entropy of a particle in a three-dimensional box, don't worry. It's the same as the entropy of three particles of the same mass in three one-dimensional boxes of appropriate lengths: the length L, width W and height H of our three-dimensional box. So we can just sum those three entropies and get our answer. Since natural logarithm L plus natural logarithm W plus natural logarithm H equals natural logarithm volume where volume is the volume of our three-dimensional box, we get\n01xg | S equals k natural logarithm volume plus natural logarithm kT plus two natural logarithm three H squared two plus three).\ni6d2 | Later we'll do this calculation more rigorously and more generally for a box of any shape.\nlg8p | But you may have another question: what's the meaning of our formula for the entropy of a classical particle in a one-dimensional box? It's pretty complicated, after all, and we'll need to understand it to have any chance of understanding the mysterious constant y in the formula for a classical ideal monatomic gas.\n3fo4 | We can understand our formula better if we delve into a tiny bit of quantum mechanics, and the concept of 'thermal wavelength'. So let's do that.\nbs9g | THE WAVELENGTH OF A PARTICLE\nwyx9 | In quantum mechanics particles are waves! A particle with momentum p has wavelength\nlmig | h\n63vd | one equals p where h is the unreduced Planck's constant, exactly\nihsk | For example, the wavelength of an electron moving at one meter per second is about zero point seven millimeters.\nyohk | One of the most amazing discoveries of twentieth-century physics: particles are waves. The wavelength of a particle is Planck's constant divided by its momentum! This was first realized by Louis de Broglie in his nineteen twenty-four Ph.D. thesis, so it's called the 'de Broglie wavelength'.\n0qgi | Why am I telling you this? Because I want to explain and simplify the formula for the entropy of a particle in a box. Even though I derived it classically, it contains Planck's constant! So, it will become more intuitive if we think a tiny bit about quantum mechanics.\nawut | A good explanation of quantum mechanics would require a whole other course. But it's good to know that in quantum mechanics, a particle with a given momentum has a wavelength associated to it: we shouldn't imagine it as having a definite location; it's a bit 'blurry'.\npjzb | This will give a more intuitive explanation for our complicated formula of the entropy of a particle in a one-dimensional box. We'll use this intuition to simplify our formula. That will make it easier to generalize to N particles in a three-dimensional box that is, a classical monatomic ideal gas!\na2ry | THE WAVELENGTH OF A WARM PARTICLE\n8zhz | In thermal equilibrium, the average energy of a classical free particle in three-dimensional space is\nnokn | expected energy equals C k T three\nn0c4 | where T is the temperature and k is Boltzmann's constant.\nviyb | If the particle has mass m,\ndz2n | expected energy equals m v squared, p equals m v equals p equals square root of two times m times expected energy equals square root of three m k T\nh9r0 | In quantum mechanics, a particle of momentum p has wavelength X equals h divided by p where h is the unreduced Planck's constant. So, at temperature T, the typical wavelength of a free particle of mass m is roughly\nggnb | square root of three m k T\nw3d0 | Particles are waves! Their wavelength is shorter when their momentum is bigger. And the warmer they are, the bigger their momentum tends to be. So there should be a formula for the typical wavelength of a warm particle. And here it is! It helps us visualize the world: particles are a bit blurry, with a characteristic wavelength that depends on temperature.\n```",
