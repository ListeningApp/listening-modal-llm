You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

4lum | INTRODUCTION
lxht | Venture capitalists (VCs) play a significant role in the financing of high-risk, technology-based business ventures. Many of America's best-known public companies began as VC-backed firms: Amazon.com, Apple, FedEx, Intel, Microsoft, and Starbucks, to name a few.1 Not

7h2f | surprisingly, venture capital is considered to be an important contributor to economic growth in the United States and elsewhere.2
td95 | The steps in the venture capital cycle are by now familiar.3 A venture capital firm creates and raises capital for a limited-life fund.4 The VCs select portfolio companies for inclusion in the fund, investing in these companies through multiple rounds of financing.5 Along the way, the VCs advise and monitor the portfolio companies, sometimes replacing the companies' founders.6 Before the end of the fund's life, VCs "exit" from their investments in the portfolio companies and return capital to the fund's investors.7 The fund's investors can then recycle the returned capital into another venture capital fund.
9rkk | Venture exits usually take one of three forms: (1) an initial public offering (IPO) of the portfolio company's shares followed by the sale of the VC's shares into the public market; (2) a "trade sale" of the company to another firm; or (3) the dissolution and liquidation of the company.8 Of these three types of exits, IPOs have received the most scrutiny.9 This attention is

3b9j | not surprising. IPO exits tend to involve the largest and most visible VC-backed firms.10 And, perhaps just as important, the IPO process triggers public-disclosure requirements under the securities laws, making data on IPO exits easily accessible to researchers.
cyef | But trade sales are actually much more common than IPOs and, in the aggregate, are likely to be almost as financially important to VCs.11 Indeed, in certain industries-like medical devices-and during certain periods-like the last decade, when the IPO market was tepid-trade sales are likely to be more important to VCs than IPOs.12 Unlike IPOs, however, trade sales do not trigger the securities laws' intense public-disclosure requirements; they instead take place in the shadows.13 Thus, although trade sales are important to the venture capital cycle, researchers know relatively little about them.
bcz3 | The purpose of this Article is to shine light on how VCs arrange to sell startups in trade sales. In particular, we seek to investigate how VCs induce the "entrepreneurial team"-the founder, other executives, and common shareholders-to go along with a trade sale that they might have an incentive to resist.
y4ss | We begin by describing the standard cash-flow and control rights that VCs receive when investing in startups. Turning first to cash-flow rights, we explain that VCs almost always invest through convertible preferred stock. In a trade-sale exit, VCs choose between retaining their preferred shares (and capturing most or all of the proceeds through their liquidation preferences) or

pjrx | CARROTS AND STICKS

ajzn | converting the preferred shares into common shares. In an IPO, VCs (as a practical matter) must convert to common stock.14 Turning next to control rights, we explain that VCs seek board seats and shareholder-voting rights, in part to make it easier for them to exit and realize their cash-flow rights.
gpc2 | We then explain why founders, executives, and common shareholders are more likely to oppose a trade-sale exit than an IPO exit. In an IPO, the founder (if still the CEO) can continue running the firm and will face less direct oversight as shareholdings become more diffuse.15 Other executives of an IPO firm can typically keep their jobs, also with less shareholder oversight than before. And the original common shareholders of the IPO firm generally do well; VCs would not push for an IPO exit unless the common shares-to which the VCs must convert in an IPO-have considerable value.
4h3w | By contrast, in a trade sale, the founder (if still the CEO) and other executives may lose their jobs or find themselves subject to more direct oversight as shareholdings become concentrated in the hands of a single shareholder (the acquirer). In other words, they become "mere" employees. And because VCs in trade sales often exit as preferred shareholders with liquidation preferences that must be paid in full before common shareholders receive any payout, common shareholders may receive little (if any) payout.16 At the same time, the sale eliminates any "option value" (upside potential) of the common stock held by the founder, other executives, and employees.17 For all these reasons, VCs pushing for a trade sale may face resistance from the entrepreneurial team, particularly when common shareholders receive very little.
7vce | Two points are worth emphasizing here. First, an entrepreneurial team resisting a trade sale may not necessarily believe that the startup has a reasonable chance of going public if it remains independent. Rather, team members may resist a trade sale today because they believe that, if the startup remains independent, there is a good chance that it can exit in the future via a more attractive trade sale-one that provides significantly better employment opportunities for the entrepreneurial team and more value for the common shareholders.18

4evh | CARROTS AND STICKS
8zr0 | Second, there may be situations where the entrepreneurial team favors a trade sale opposed by the VCs. For example, the entrepreneurial team might wish to accept an offer that is personally lucrative but which provides only a modest return to the VCs.19 Thus, we do not claim that the entrepreneurial team will always oppose a trade sale. Rather, our claim is that there are likely many scenarios where VCs will favor a trade sale that the entrepreneurial team opposes.
cytw | After describing the entrepreneurial team's potential incentive to resist a trade sale, we then discuss the various strategies the team might use to impede the sale. The executives and common shareholders can impede a trade sale through their influence over the board, which must approve the transaction. The common shareholders can try to block the sale by exercising their voting rights or by threatening litigation. Finally, the executives can refuse to cooperate in the sale process or, if the acquisition requires their continued participation in the enterprise, refuse to commit to such participation.
4cck | Next, we identify the various bribes (carrots) and coercive tools (sticks) that VCs can use to induce a reluctant entrepreneurial team to support, or at least not impede, a trade sale. For the founder and other executives, the VCs can offer bonuses for a successful sale (carrots). The VCs can also threaten termination or blacklisting if the executives do not cooperate (sticks).
pcqv | For common shareholders, VCs can offer to share part of the VCs' cash-flow rights with the common shareholders through a "carve-out to common" (carrot). They can also use vote buying or other transactions that dilute common shareholders' voting rights to undermine common shareholders' ability to block a transaction via their voting rights (sticks).
zoj6 | To investigate the use of carrots and sticks in trade sales, we use a hand-collected database of 50 VC-backed Silicon Valley firms sold to acquirers in 2003 and 2004. The firms are primarily in the biotech, telecommunications, software, and internet sectors. The average sale price is $55 million, but there is considerable variance in outcomes. A number of sales are essentially liquidations, while other sales are for well over $100 million; one firm sold for over $500 million. For each firm, we collect data on the carrots and sticks used in connection with the sale.20

57xn | We find in our sample a heavy reliance on carrots. To induce executives to cooperate in selling their firms, VCs frequently offer sale bonuses. In 16 of the 50 firms, VCs pay an average sale bonus of $1.63 million. In 11 of 50 firms, VCs give common shareholders as a class an average of $3.7 million extra. In 45% of the firms, VCs give at least one type of carrot, with these carrots on average amounting to 9% of the deal's value. Across all 50 firms in our sample, an average of 4.3% of deal value-2.4% on a dollar-weighted basis-is used to fund these two types of carrots: sale bonuses and carve-outs to common.21
xfyq | We also find some use of sticks, such as threats to blacklist founders who refuse to cooperate and attempts to undermine common shareholders' voting rights. But the overt use of these sticks is relatively infrequent. And although 60% of the founders in our firms are replaced before the sale, we find no evidence that VCs fired or threatened to fire founders to ease the sales of firms.
c0te | Our study makes three important contributions to the literature. First, it sheds light on an important but underexplored aspect of corporate governance in private, VC-backed firms. In particular, it highlights the potentially divergent interests of different players in VC-backed firms around trade-sale exits and shows that VCs frequently must overcome potential opposition to these sales.
1rvy | Second, our study provides additional evidence that managers of a target firm can extract value by holding up a sale of the firm. Researchers have reported on the use of side payments to executives in the sale of publicly traded firms.22 We show that such "bribes" are used not only in public firms with dispersed ownership but also in closely held private firms.
v64e | Third, our study provides some evidence on whether VCs are constrained from abusing their power in startups. The relatively infrequent use of sticks in our sample supports the view that reputational or other nonlegal considerations substantially constrain (but do not completely prevent) sharp-elbowed behavior by VCs in Silicon Valley.23
l03c | The remainder of the Article is structured as follows: Part I describes the typical structure of VC cash-flow and exit-facilitating control rights in startup firms. Part II explains why founders, other executives, and common shareholders may wish to impede a trade sale as well as the means they have

q56v | VCS' CASH-FLOW AND CONTROL RIGHTS
abl4 | A. VCs' Cash-Flow Rights
b39o | In the United States, VC-backed startups almost always issue two classes of stock: common and convertible preferred.24 The founders and employees of the startup hold the common stock.25 The convertible preferred stock is held by the VCs, who invest in startups almost exclusively through this type of security.26 Most venture-backed startups issue a new series of preferred stock for each round of financing.27
t894 | Like most preferred stock, VCs' preferred shares carry a liquidation preference and are convertible into common stock.28 If VCs retain their preferred stock and preserve their liquidation preferences, those preferences must be satisfied before common shareholders receive any payment. In this scenario, the VCs' cash-flow rights resemble debt.29 If the VCs convert their preferred shares to common, giving up their liquidation preferences, the VCs have the same cash-flow rights as common shareholders.30 Thus, convertible

r7wa | preferred stock combines downside protection with upside potential.
62ej | In a trade sale, the VCs will choose whether to exit as preferred shareholders and reap the benefits of their liquidation preferences or to exit as common shareholders. If the VCs exit via an IPO, underwriters will typically insist that the VCs convert their preferred shares to common shares and give up their liquidation preferences along with other rights attached to the preferred stock. To prevent holdouts, a startup's charter will, with respect to the holders of each series of preferred stock, generally either (a) require all of the holders of that series to convert to common stock or (b) allow a majority of the holders of that series to forcibly convert all holders of that series to common stock.31 Thus, one way or the other, VCs in IPO firms will typically exit as common shareholders.
x3xe | B. VCs' Exit-Facilitating Control Rights
f4bh | To exit their investment, VCs must arrange an IPO, trade sale, or dissolution of the firm. Below, we describe the two types of control rights most relevant to facilitating an exit: (1) the right to fill seats on the board of directors and (2) shareholder-voting rights.32
jlnu | 1. Board Seats
448v | The board of directors is responsible for managing the day-to-day business and affairs of the company.33 Critically, the board is also the only corporate body that can initiate fundamental transactions, such as mergers, IPOs, and dissolutions.34 These transactions, in turn, are almost always

d2bj | necessary for the VCs to exit; hence, we will call them "VC exit transactions." Thus, VC exit transactions-including trade sales-cannot go forward without board approval. But, as we will see, board approval alone is not sufficient. Shareholder approval is also necessary.
fvm9 | The board, in turn, is elected-and can be replaced-by the shareholders.35 In the typical public company, default statutory-voting rules give the holder of each share one vote for each open board seat.36 By contrast, in a VC-backed firm, the parties typically negotiate a voting agreement that overrides default statutory voting rules.37 The agreement specifies the allocation of board seats among: (1) representatives of the common shareholders; (2) representatives of the VC investors; and (3) so-called "independent" directors, who are mutually appointed by the common shareholders and the VCs and typically are industry experts or other outsiders with valuable experience and connections.38
ee07 | Because board approval is necessary for VC exits, VCs negotiate aggressively for board seats when investing in startups.39 While data on board composition in private, VC-backed firms are scarce, two persistent patterns emerge from various small-scale studies of VC contracting documents and VC-backed firms. First, VC board representation tends to increase with new financing rounds, especially outside rounds that bring in new VCs.40 Second, in a plurality of firms, neither common shareholders nor VC-appointed directors ever achieve outright control; the swing vote remains in the hands of an independent director.41 Keeping the swing vote in the hands of an independent director makes it more difficult for either the common shareholders or the preferred shareholders to act opportunistically with respect to the other class of shareholders.42 But as one of us has argued in

u39d | 2. Shareholder Rights
3hhn | As noted above, for VCs seeking an exit transaction, board approval is not sufficient. Shareholder approval is also necessary.
