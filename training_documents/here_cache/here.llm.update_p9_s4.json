        "content": "xek3 | Against this historical and global backdrop of a world imagined as empire and race, I seek to achieve with this book a degree of educational accountability. Although this phrase typically refers to holding teachers responsible for student achievement scores on standardized tests, what I have in mind is that educators owe those they teach some account-if always partial-of what we have taught them about the world. The ethics of accountability, as I would cast it here, is about examining what this form of schooling has underwritten and who it has denied. It is about giving an account of education's and scholarship's role in a recent historical phenomenon that has had incalculable global ramifications. The account called for here concerns the significance of such divides as East and West, primitive and civilized; it concerns how the world has been constructed around centers and margins, and how these divisions were bolstered through forms of scholarship supported by imperialism. As I am a teacher, I owe students an account of my work within the educational project that sought to put the world together in this way. I owe them an account of why education has not done more good in the world, why it has not done more to realize fully the democratic promises that continue to underwrite public education. I owe them an account of why I remain committed to expanding the concerns of education to include this reflective and self-critical function.\nbbpr | What might such an account sound like? Leon Litwick, in his presidential address to the Organization of American Historians in nineteen eighty-seven, captured the spirit of educational responsibility that I am invoking here, when he called upon historians to acknowledge that no group of scholars was more deeply implicated in the miseducation of American youth and did more to shape the thinking of Americans about race and blacks than historians. This particular burden of scholarship does not fall, of course, on historians alone. It is distributed across the educational experiences that, in all likelihood, we and our children have gone through. However one wants to label this work-and Litwick would not use postcolonial to describe his position-there is a need to examine education's continuing contributions to what were and continue to be colonizing divisions of the world. Everywhere in this work there is a worrying about the consequences of knowing.\n5zyf | that might have been inspired by the ethical compass set out in the eighteenth century by Montesquieu:\n9own | If I knew something useful to myself and detrimental to my family, I would reject it from my mind. If I knew something useful to my family but not to my homeland, I would try to forget it. If I knew something useful to my homeland and detrimental to Europe, or else useful to Europe and detrimental to Mankind, I would consider it a crime.\nbqfb | This book is about the accumulation of learning that proved eminently useful to Europe and often detrimental to the larger body of humanity. It is concerned with what remains of that crime, as Montesquieu would have it, in the lessons we continue to teach the young and in the way many of us still see the world.\nwwdt | To let students in on how their education may still be marked by European imperialism resembles the project proposed by the literary scholar Gerald Graff when he calls on scholars to teach the conflicts. Rather than following the typical pedagogical tack of conflict evasion, Graff recommends that university classes explore the contest of ideas that dominate public forums and scholarly enclaves. Perhaps the recent controversy surrounding Stanford University's Western civilization courses would be a good place to start in trying to understand the politics of imperialism's educational aftermath. However, when it comes to excluding dissenting voices, few institutions can best the public high school, which is the educational home to a far wider range of the public than is the university. To hold off teaching the conflicts of imperialism's educational legacy until college, or to treat it simply as an intellectual contest, diverts our attention from how the ideas of the primitive and the civilized become part of a commonsense division of the world by race, culture, and nation. The common sense of these divisions, I will argue, can be attributed to the success of this legacy, from primary grades to graduate school, from television's Wild Kingdom to National Geographic. This book turns to the less glamorous site of the public school because this is where most people form their ideas about history, science, literature, and other disciplines.\nmn1r | The aim of this account giving is to afford students (and readers of the book) a critical distance from their own education, which may well, in turn be in need of revision itself one day; the aim is to hasten and focus change that are already under way in creating a multicultural curriculum by offering readers a review of the history and the sort of education that have brought to this point. I do not intend the intellectual legacy of imperialism to be the whole of anyone's education, but neither should it go completely missing in a dozen years of schooling. Such teaching as I propose is not about realizing, or teaching to, the true identity of the student. It is intended, rather, to help students understand their own education and the education of others as a worthy object of inquiry. Whatever criticisms of education this inquiry raises, it still reflects a faith in learning.\n5vqw | In writing this book, I have sifted through the rich history of imperialism, drawing on primary documents and firsthand accounts as well as contemporary polemics and advances in critical theory; I have worked with students, teachers, and textbooks in today's schools. The pattern I follow in this book is to move from the larger historical record of imperialism to specific components of today's classrooms. Along the way, I pause at the nineteen sixties as the critical juncture when the current generation of baby boomers that swell the ranks of today's teaching force was schooled and when twenty-eight nations, from Algeria to Zaire, successfully struggled through war and diplomacy to wrest their independence from the imperial powers. It was a time when Frantz Fanon published his scathing indictment of colonialism, The Wretched of the Earth; and Great Britain attacked the United Nations for pursuing a new and dangerous path of decolonization as it pressured Portugal to grant independence to Angola, Mozambique, and Portuguese Guinea. Meanwhile, the United States was amassing some fourteen thousand military advisers in Vietnam while at home it faced, as Time put it, the pressures of Negro revolution bursting out all over. Federal troops had to accompany African American students to school in Little Rock, Oxford, and Tuscaloosa, while two hundred thousand people gathered during the triumphant March on Washington to hear Reverend Doctor Martin Luther King Junior tell the world, I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.",
