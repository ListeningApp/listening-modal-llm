You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

vm29 | R: RITUALS AND ROUTINES FOR A SECURE SELF
kwxl | Any secure relationship with yourself will include the rituals and routines that sup- port you in your self-care and sanity. If we refer back to early childhood, it is easy to see how children thrive when there is enough structure and predictable routine for the different needs of their bodies and the various transitions within a day. As adults, this does not change. There are natural rhythms to our cycles of sleeping, eating, resting and having sex that suffer when ignored. Both men and women have hormonal cycles that fluctuate, impacting our mood, mental acuity, how sensitive we feel and how short or long our fuse for anger and frustration will be. Secure at- tachment with self includes knowing your inner rhythms (biological, emotional and mental) and figuring out what routines and daily rituals best support you to be in alignment with your own needs and pacing.
kd8r | Larger, more intentional or ceremonial rituals also play an important part in your relationship with yourself. Rituals and rites of passage that are intended to ini- tiate us into higher aspects of self or mature us into adulthood are all but lost in our Western culture, and the few that remain (confirmation of faith, the bar/bat mitzvah, marriage, the sweet sixteen or quinceañera, high school or college gradu- ation) have been co-opted and commercialized so as to divest them of their
z2jh | traditional purpose, which was a literal change of consciousness for which the peo- ple involved had been physically, mentally and emotionally prepared, leaving only a vestigial symbolic importance. The loss of the impact of such culturally approved rites of passage means that the millennia-old practice of having a ritual-based ma- trix in place to assist us with adjusting to life events (and the accompanying change of consciousness required to accommodate those events) is often no longer available to us.
nvte | The traditional ashrama system in Hinduism, for example, specifies that after having been a student and a householder and fulfilling one's earthly responsi- bilities in the culture, a person should undergo the ritual of sannyasa (renunciation of worldly affairs) and shift consciousness towards preparation for giving up their body at the time of death. Without such a custom, we are often left to deal with the anxiety and stress of end-of-life issues without a supportive community or a clearly understood cultural context that contributes to our psychic security.
994g | The modern "psychedelic renaissance"-when Westerners travel to South and Central America and partake in ayahuasca rituals for the purposes of healing and self-discovery-also underscores the lack of such important rituals in our own cul- tural milieu, while simultaneously demonstrating how far people will go to restore the much-needed self-awareness such rituals potentially provide. When examining the apparent emptiness of much sacramental or ritual activity in the West and its lack of ability in modern times to alter the consciousness of the person undergoing it, many philosophers (Carl Jung and Terence Mckenna, among others) have noted that over time, sacraments have become merely symbolic. Fortunately, nothing stops us from revitalizing older rituals or even creating new ones to assist us with living successfully and happily in the world we inhabit.
p39w | When focusing on establishing a more secure relationship with yourself, one of the most influential routines we can implement is what I refer to as self-alignment practices. When we start to clear away the debris of our insecure attachment styles, we reveal a secure self that can be cultivated and aligned with. Many of us already have a sense of the parts of us that we might refer to as our better self or higher
g6k3 | self, or what I refer to as my secure self or aligned self (this is the part of me that is aligned with my better skills, values, visions and morals). When we actively engage in practices that bring these parts of us to the forefront, we are rewiring ourselves to resonate more easily with a self that is more peaceful, joyful, loving and accept- ing. If we give fuel to a negative self in the form of constant or obsessive mental reinforcement of that version of ourselves, then we strengthen that construct. But it also stands to reason that the opposite is true. If we live in alignment with our most secure, loving and happy self and practice living through the lens of the qual- ities about us that are remarkable, then we stabilize that construct until that is who we will eventually become.

nlm3 | T: TURNING TOWARDS YOURSELF AFTER INNER CONFLICT AND DOING TRIGGER MANAGEMENT
muf5 | In the previous chapter, the T in HEART was about turning towards each other after conflict, focusing on how we repair with our partners when there have been discon- nections, fights or misunderstandings. Repairing with ourselves is also essential. How we treat ourselves when we have made a mistake, when there is an internal battle between different parts of ourselves or when we have fallen short of our own standards, ethics or expectations, is imperative in building a strong inner secure foundation. In the section on expressed delight with yourself, I have already spoken about the importance of working with one's inner critic, which is equally relevant here as well. When your inner critic is beating you up, bullying you or injecting self- doubt into your consciousness, knowing how to work with this part of you and re- claim your power from it is enormously helpful. Left unchecked, our inner critic can further feed cycles of attachment anxiety and avoidance that can be destructive and paralyzing.
