Which conservation strategies and practices should be pursued (and which should not), in turn, remains an additional matter of debate, the subject of the ethics of conservation that supplements the ethics of extinction.\n29a3 | Lastly, there are two remarkable aspects to the literature surveyed. Firstly, most arguments pertaining to the wrongness or badness of species extinctions are not primarily concerned with 'species' as such. Rather, the matter of moral concern, such as the locus or source of value, is often located somewhere else: in the nonhuman individuals involved, in people's relationship to particular species or landscapes, in biodiversity including variability within species and between ecosystems and so on, which reflects that there is more of moral relevance to the ethics of extinction than merely the numerical loss of species and their respective intrinsic or instrumental value. Views on the moral wrongness of anthropogenic extinctions result also, amongst other things, from underlying premises of what constitutes an appropriate human-nature relationship, which is why the current anthropogenic mass extinction event is of significant moral concern.\nsb1e | Secondly, considering how marginal de-extinction technologies still are as a (potential) practice of biodiversity conservation, it is noticeable how much interest the environmental ethics literature has shown on this topic. However, more important than the interrelated questions of whether species can and should be 'resurrected' is the uptake of a second set of broader related questions. These questions concern the morally permissible (or impermissible) uses of biotechnology for conservation purposes under conditions of climate change when conventional conservation practices such as habitat preservation and even more proactive approaches such as assisted migration reach their limits of effectiveness. As this is a growing area of interdisciplinary debate, we believe that providing critical analysis of these questions in the intersection between environmental ethics and the ethics of technology will be a significant area of environmental philosophical contribution during the upcoming years.\nw2yn | assertion that the untimely 'extinction of populations and species is bad'. After providing an explanation of the disciplinary perspective taken, the concept of extinction and its history within that literature are introduced. Then, different reasons for why anthropogenic extinctions might be morally problematic are presented based on (one) the loss of species' value, (two) harm to nonhuman individuals, (three) the loss of valuable biological variety and (four) duties to future generations. Subsequently, (five) cases where anthropogenic extinctions might be justified are considered. Regarding how to respond to extinctions, a selection of topics is addressed concerning (one) risks and (two) de-extinction. Finally, the review introduces other viewpoints from the 'extinction studies' literature.\n```",
