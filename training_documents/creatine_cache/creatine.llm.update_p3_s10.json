The young male, who had kidney disease for eight years and was treated with cyclosporine (i.e., immunosuppressant) for five years, had recently begun ingesting creatine supplementation (fifteen grams per day for seven days; followed by two grams per day for seven weeks). Based on increased blood levels of creatinine and subsequent estimate of calculated creatinine clearance, his kidney health was presumed to be deteriorating, although he was otherwise in good health. The patient was encouraged to discontinue creatine supplementation. At this time, it was already known that blood and urine creatinine levels can increase following ingestion of creatine containing food products, including creatine supplements. This was ignored by the authors of this case study, as was the inclusion of two investigations which demonstrated that creatine supplementation did not negatively impact renal function. The dosage of creatine during the maintenance phase, which was also\na7ao | ignored, was only slightly higher than the daily creatine intake of a typical omnivore's dietary intake, or in terms of food, a large hamburger or steak per day (meat contains about zero point seven grams of creatine per six ounce serving). In response to this case study, two separate teams of experts in creatine metabolism wrote letters to the editor of Lancet. However, the notion that creatine supplementation leads to kidney damage and/or renal dysfunction gained traction and momentum.\n```",
