You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

dqlg | intracellular calcium levels, influencing flow-induced, anti-atherogenic and pro-atherogenic responses, such as cell alignment80,87,89. NOTCH1 mediates stable flow-induced cellular alignment, suppression of cell proliferation and maintenance of cell-cell junctional integrity, and pro- tects against atherosclerosis development81. These effects have been suggested to be controlled by tension-induced NOTCH1 signalling and modulation of intracellular calcium levels81. However, another study showed that shear stress-mediated activation of the NOTCH1 response requires PIEZO1, warranting additional clarification regarding the mechanosensory role of NOTCH1 (ref. 76). G protein-coupled receptors, such as the proton-sensing GPR68, undergo conformational changes in response to flow in endothelial cells, mediating shear-induced cal- cium influx53,90. Plexin D1, potentially in connection with the junctional mechanosensory complex, mediates flow-dependent atherosclerosis development by regulating calcium uptake, phosphorylation of vas- cular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2), AKT, eNOS, ERK1 and ERK2, as well as induction of the major flow-sensitive transcription factors, Krüppel-like factor 2 (KLF2) and KLF4 (ref. 82).
p6pq | In cell-cell junctions, platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM1), VE-cadherin and VEGFR2 form the junctional mechanosen- sory complex, which mediates integrin activation, cellular align- ment and eNOS activation in response to stable flow via PI3K-AKT signalling69. On the basal surface of endothelial cells, flow induces conformational activation and expression changes in extracellular matrix-binding integrin mechanosensors91,92. Stable flow activates the integrin avß3, causing increased binding to the extracellular matrix and inactivation of downstream RHO signalling91. In addition,

Many mechanosignal transduction pathways result in activation of transcription factors including Krüppel-like factor 2 (KLF2) and KLF4, nuclear factor-KB (NF-KB) and hypoxia-inducible factor 1x (HIF1x).

ohh7 | Flow mechanosensing in endothelial cells activates numerous early-to-intermediate (seconds to minutes) cell signalling pathways that lead to long-term (hours to days) atheroprotective or pro-atherogenic processes. However, it is important to note that both pro-atherogenic disturbed flow and atheroprotective stable flow often activate many of the same early-to-intermediate signalling pathways, especially in in vitro studies. For example, stable flow transiently activates NF-KB signalling without leading to long-term endothelial inflammation, whereas disturbed flow induces persistent NF-KB activation resulting in endothelial inflammation94. The mechanisms that distinguish these flow-pattern-dependent activation pathways, especially in vitro, are not well understood and remain crucial knowledge gaps that need to be filled. This uncertainty is due in part to the common experimental strat- egy of conducting in vitro studies with endothelial cells cultured under no-flow conditions that are suddenly subjected to stable flow or disturbed flow. Under these conditions, early-to-intermediate responses might over- lap with common adaptative changes in response to altered mechanical cues regardless of flow patterns and magnitudes. With this caveat in mind, we review the literature that provides crucial knowledge in understanding flow-dependent endothelial cell mechanosignal transduction pathways.
vbni | PIEZO1
dgcw | PIEZO1 mediates both atheroprotective and pro-atherogenic flow- dependent endothelial cell responses74,80,85,95. PIEZO1 mechanosens- ing of stable flow induces intracellular calcium influx, leading to ATP
gvwz | release and eNOS activation and the production of the atheroprotective and vasorelaxant nitric oxide from endothelial cells80,85. The PIEZO1- induced effect on ATP is mediated by the P2Y2 and Gag/11 pathways, which activate AKT, which in turn activates eNOS96,97. PIEZO1 also mediates pro-atherogenic endothelial responses of disturbed flow. Disturbed flow stimulates NF-KB activity and endothelial inflammation via PIEZO1- Gag/11-mediated integrin activation, which in turn activates the focal adhesion kinase (FAK)74. Endothelial cell-targeted deletion of Piezo1 in Ldlr-knockout mice inhibited atherosclerotic plaque development in disturbed flow regions, suggesting a pro-atherogenic role of PIEZO1 in endothelial cells74.
sk5m | Plexin D1
qws8 | Plexin D1is another mechanosensor that responds to both stable flowand disturbed flow, mediating both atheroprotective and pro-atherogenic responses, respectively. Knockdown of Plxnd1, which encodes plexin D1, in mouse endothelial cells inhibits atheroprotective signal transduction pathways, such as eNOS activation, cell alignment and KLF2 and KLF4 expression in response to stable flow82. Interestingly, Plxnd1 knockout in endothelial cells also prevents pro-atherogenic inflammatory responses, including expression of VCAM1 and CCL2 in response to disturbed flow82. Endothelial cell-specific knockout of Plxnd1 in mice prevented atherosclerosis development in arterial regions with disturbed flow but exacerbated plaque development in arterial regions with stable flow82. These results suggest that plexin D1 is a mechanosensor with dual functions depending on blood flow patterns.
877u | Junctional mechanosensory complex
rzhj | Stable flow stimulates eNOS activation through the mechanosensory complex formed by PECAM1, VE-cadherin and VEGFR2 or VEGFR3, which in turn activates the PI3K-AKT pathway69. Stable flow also induces integrin avß3 and NF-KB activation through the junctional mechanosen- sory complex69. However, Pecam1 knockout in mice prevents endothe- lial inflammation and atherosclerosis in arterial regions with disturbed flow69,98. This finding suggests that PECAM1 is a mechanosensor that mediates pro-atherogenic effects of disturbed flow in vivo.
bfax | Integrins
f2y8 | Integrin activation in response to stable flow inactivates RHO GTPases through RHO-like GTPase signalling99. RHOA inactivation promotes YAP phosphorylation (at Ser127 and Ser381) in the cytoplasm to maintain an atheroprotective endothelial cell phenotype100. These interactions between integrins and RHO GTPases further activate RAC, leading to the assembly of the junctional mechanosensory complexes101. Addition- ally, the RHO GTPase CDC42 is polarized and activated in an integrin- dependent manner and subsequently regulates the polarity of the microtubule-organizing centre102,103. Under disturbed flow conditions, the cooperation between RGD-binding integrins (including &5ß1andavß3 integrins) and fibronectin has been shown to drive pro-inflammatory signal transduction involving the nuclear translocation of NF-KB, YAP and serine/threonine-protein kinase PAK 104-107.
