        "content": "1ujy | Similarly, in Chu Keng Lim v The Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights was considered once again. While it was not determinative of the decision in that case, Brennan, Deane and Dawson JJ made their position clear. Their Honours said:\nqzor | We accept the proposition that the courts should, in a case of ambiguity, favour a construction of a Commonwealth statute which accords with the obligations of Australia under an international treaty. The provisions of [the relevant statute] ... are, however, quite unambiguous.\na0by | The significance of Mabo in this respect is therefore that it has reinforced the legitimacy of international law and instruments as proper sources of influence in the development of the domestic common law of Australia. The proper inference to be drawn is that, after Mabo, the astute lawyer in Australia will, where appropriate, direct the attention of Australian courts to relevant international material. Courts themselves, upon the basis of Mabo and the subsequent cases, will increasingly regard such material as legitimate sources of data. As the cases bear out, such use of international material need not be limited to circumstances in which 'international law declares the existence of universal human rights'. The use will come to extend to other, perhaps more mundane, circumstances. In this respect, Mabo has dictated that the common law of Australia will in future be influenced by legal authority, policy, principle and applicable rules of international law.\nu1ky | What is so revolutionary about this notion? In the age of nuclear fission, the Human Genome Project, global telecommunications, jumbo jets, international problems such as HIV/AIDS and so on, do we not need a legal system - and legal weapons in our judicial armoury - which, in appropriate cases, can bring our Australian law into harmony with the advancing law of the community of nations? I suggest that we do. Mabo advances this necessary and beneficial legal development apt for the coming century.\nhtm9 | In Defence of Mabo\n8hul | HOW REMARKABLE IS THE RECOGNITION OF NATIVE TITLE?\n87vz | The recognition of indigenous or Aboriginal land rights is by no means peculiar to the law of Australia. Indeed, Australia is one of the last of the common law nations to acknowledge in its legal system the legitimacy of indigenous or aboriginal land rights.\nym66 | For example, the right of indigenous people to native title has been recognised, in a similar form to Mabo, in Canada. Likewise, in Amodu Tijani v The Secretary, Southern Nigeria, the Privy Council recognised that a 'usufructuary' right was vested in the indigenous people of a part of Nigeria, despite the fact that the 'radical' title to land was held by the British Crown. In New Zealand, the courts have been vigilant in their protection of the common law rights of the Maori -- although in that country the Treaty of Waitangi establishes a special relationship between the Crown and the Maori people which has no equivalent in Australian history.\nl0a3 | Where the particular factual circumstances prevent the recognition of native title, by the application of the established common law principles, native title has often been recognised by legislative enactment. It is surprising to note that, in the United States, the recognition of indigenous native title at common law, once adopted by the Supreme Court, now appears to be denied. It has largely become the domain of the legislature.\nu8nw | Without embarking on any detailed analysis of the developments in other jurisdictions, the point to be made is that, by whatever means chosen in each particular jurisdiction, native or indigenous title has been recognised in most settler and non-settler communities of the common law. In many cases, principles have been adopted similar to those applied in Mabo. The particular factual circumstances sometimes demanded a different result. However, an inference may clearly be drawn that the High Court's decision in Mabo was by no means remarkable - still less\nl2v9 | revolutionary - tested against international developments. Instead, it was in line with the international developments of accepted responsibilities towards indigenous people and it was in line with the responses of many legal system similar to our own, which had long ago abandoned the fiction of terra nullius.\nafbe | To those who say that the creative judiciary ought to have waited for the legislatures of Australia to correct this long-standing affront to justice to an unimportant section of the Australian community - the questions come back: why had they not acted before now? How long must the courts wait before discharging their own constitutional duty to ensure justice under the law?\n78r8 | CONCLUSIONS\n320g | In my respectful opinion, the Mabo decision is commendable in a number of respects. First, the High Court recognised the legitimate claims of indigenous people to native title. It did so overruling the inappropriate application of the common law doctrine of terra nullius to the Australian continent. That the application of terra nullius was inappropriate to inhabited countries -- such as Australia undoubtedly was - was explicitly recognised by the court. No fair-minded person, with knowledge of the Aboriginal presence in Australia before British settlement, could seriously object to the decision of the nation's highest court in refusing any longer to build its laws as to land title on a myth and a falsehood.\ntp8g | Second, the High Court provided valuable guidance to Australian courts in respect of two crucial aspects of the future development of our common law system. Those are: the proper influence which international law and international instruments may play in the development of the common law; and the proper circumstances in which long-standing rules of the common law in Australia may be overruled.\ngxfd | Third, the decision itself, and the subsequent debate, brings to the fore the important issue of the judicial role in a constitutional democracy. The criticism of the decision upon the basis that the High Court in Mabo usurped a legislative function overlooks the legitimate judicial function of judicial creativity in the law. The High Court has increasingly assumed that function in recent years, as I have shown. Other Australian courts have also followed suit. The creative function invites, to some degree, a rejection of the concept of strict judicial restraint. But creativity in the common law judiciary is by no means a recent development. Ultimately,\ns2v1 | In Defence of Mabo\njkp9 | the duty of the courts of Australia requires of them the attainment of a proper balance between stability and adaptation of the common law to new and ever changing social circumstances. The Mabo decision is consistent with, and is an example of, the High Court's performance of its judicial function.\nz8tt | It is clear that Mabo, as it stands now, leaves many questions unanswered. However, those questions did not have to be answered by the High Court in that case. The decision has, nevertheless, provided a framework for the recognition of indigenous native title. That framework must now be completed, either by subsequent case law or by legislative enactment. At least now, Australia has a judicial stimulus to action: to establish a more just legal system as it affects the Aboriginal people of this continent.\n9g22 | Without Mabo, that stimulus might never have been provided. As a civilised people, we need to ponder that fact when we criticise the decision in Mabo and the judges responsible for it. In the long perspective of history, Mabo will probably be seen as remarkable not for its delivery in one thousand nine hundred ninety-two but because it was so long coming in Australian law. It will be viewed as an illustration of the way in which the common law system eventually corrects itself of most errors and rights most wrongs. Being a system based upon human reason and justice, it eventually attains those goals. It did so here. The correction creates, it is true, some uncertainty and some opposition at the time. But, far from being a revolutionary usurpation by the judges of legislative power, Mabo is an example of the common law in action.",
