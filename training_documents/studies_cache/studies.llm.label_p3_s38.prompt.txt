You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

06yq | Microdosing with psychedelics to self-medicate for ADHD symptoms in adults: A naturalistic study
dpv6 | ARTICLE INFO
8r5j | ABSTRACT
2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

xmgs | "middle aged," "aged," and "child" because these were associated with social-ecological critical theory in psychology, which is different from the SES focus of this article. We also restricted the search to the subject areas of environmental science, social
bd9h | science, agricultural and biological science, Earth and planetary science, economics, econometrics and finance, energy, "multidisciplinary," and decision sciences. We excluded environmental education because the overlaps with the health and psychological literature produced a lot of nonrelevant studies. Further, we restricted our search to journals, books, and book series, and to publications in English, and items published or in press. Our final search, conducted on 22 July 2015, yielded a result of 5222 documents. In addition to the abstracts and (index and author) key words, we downloaded the year published, journals published in, number of citations, and the institutions and geographical locations of authors.
m047 | First screening and coding
gy8c | The next step was to screen abstracts for inclusion or exclusion in the study. We characterized papers as follows:
y4mj | · Review: a review of papers about SES, theoretical concepts, and/or frameworks;
vpgq | · Framework: papers that explicitly proposed a framework for understanding SES;
ousl | · Framework and place-based: papers that proposed a framework, and also used this framework to analyze a place- based system;
m4ju | · Theory: articles that did not propose a framework, but focused on understanding an aspect of thinking about SES, or developing SES theory, without focusing on a particular place-based SES;
a0mb | · Place-based article: empirical studies that focused on placed- based SES;
ki8m | · Irrelevant: studies that very clearly did not make reference to SES as integrated social and ecological systems and were not relevant to the focus of this study, e.g., studies focusing on the psychological social-ecological theories that were not filtered out in the initial search. These articles (124) were not further considered in our review. Removing these articles brought our total database to 5098 records.
km8w | Second screening and document analysis
wzno | In the second screening of abstracts, we focused only on the documents that were classified as place-based articles (4479 articles). Of these 4479, 37.4% contained the term "social- ecological" in their title, abstracts, and key words, while 61.4% contained the term in their full texts. To keep the analysis manageable, we randomly selected 2000 of these place-based articles, and read the abstract, title, and key words. For each article, we recorded the scale of the SES studied (local, regional, national, multinational, and global), as well as research methods used (as could be derived from the abstract and key words). We did not classify articles where we could not infer methods used from the abstract (293 of the 2000 surveyed documents). This left 1707 read and classified articles. Scopus records the research affiliations and countries of researchers affiliated with papers; we thus had these data for the full dataset, i.e., 4479 articles. However, we also recorded, in the subset of data (n = 1707), the names of countries mentioned in the abstract and key words, i.e., the location where the research took place.

iwn5 | Data analysis
uooz | Growth and types of SES research
pxbq | To track the development of the SES research field, we analyzed the growth of all SES publications (n = 5098) as a proportion of the total number of publications in Scopus within the same disciplines. We investigated the significance of the relationship between year and relative publications with a Spearman-rank test, and used both change point analysis (R package "changepoint"), and Bayesian change point analysis, to detect significant inflection points. We used a chi-squared test to statistically analyze the different types of SES papers (namely "theory," "framework," "place-based research," "review") across all years, against a null hypothesis of equal proportions.
jfsr | Hotspots of SES research
u15r | From the full place-based data set (n = 4479), we used the names of countries and institutions associated with each research paper (as denoted by Scopus) to calculate the number of SES publications produced by each country and research institution over time. We weighted these totals by a notional research capacity for each country (number of universities per country as reported in the database of the International Association of Universities (IAU; http://www.whed.net/home.php). We compared the average research output/capita per year using ANOVA tests.
lq35 | To identify hotspots of SES research sites, we calculated the number of place-based studies conducted in each country (n = 1707). We created a graduated heat map in ArcGIS 10.5 (ESRI 2017) using raw frequencies, as well as normalized frequencies, accounting for surface area. Countries were assigned to regions. After normalization of country frequencies, data were normally distributed, and we performed a one-way ANOVA to test for statistical significance between regions.
3g9w | Popularity of journals over time
d09o | To assess the development of journals publishing SES research over time, we focused on the five most popular journals over all years. Here we used the full dataset (n = 5098). We recorded the proportion of total publications in each time period (1990-1990, 2000-2008, 2009-2012, 2013-2015). Time periods were informed by the results of the change point analysis. We performed a Kruskal-Wallis test to analyze differences in average annual number of SES publications between journals.
ylhz | Thematic topics in SES research
a3td | We used word cloud and frequency analysis of author key words to extract major topics of SES research. We removed all spaces between words of key word terms (e.g., "ecosystem services" became "ecosystemservices"), so that we could run word cloud analysis on terms, rather than single words, using the wordCloud package in R (v3.01). We extracted the most frequent terms (see Appendix 2) from which we constructed a list of thematic topics for place-based SES research. We then searched the abstracts and author key words of all 4479 place-based studies to obtain the frequency with which these terms were used in the abstracts and key words of studies in our dataset. Finally, we constructed a two- by-two matrix of methods, highlighting main associations.
ex5k | Method extraction and categorization
9d4o | We manually screened key methods from 2000 abstracts of place- based SES studies, 1707 of which mentioned a research method.
cjq2 | Abstracts varied in the number and detail of methods provided, for example, some would note that they had employed "modeling," while others detailed the type of models they used. This was particularly true for statistical methods, and data collection. In the first instance, we listed methods as they were listed in the abstract. We cleaned the resulting method list (632 individual methods, after removing of duplicates) by merging very similar methods. We also removed "methods" that we considered broader approaches, e.g., resilience assessment, adaptive management, transdisciplinary. This process produced a list of 311 methods (see Appendix 3).
5esx | We clustered these 311 methods into 27 categories, or method typologies, verifying and debating them in a workshop setting, held at the Stockholm Resilience Centre in October 2016. Our motivation for categorizing methods was twofold: (1) abstracts were not consistently detailed in the kind of methods that they highlighted; (2) it was difficult to conduct a meaningful analysis of more than 300 methods in a way that we could service our objective of providing an overview of the field. We assigned each method to a single category, although many methods could fit under several categories. Categories were based on the way that these methods were perceived to be used in SES research by experts at the workshop, and ones that were considered to have a similar function, or that had similar sets of assumptions. Some categories contained only one or two methods, e.g., agent-based modeling, because workshop participants felt that they were either very broadly used in SES research, or fulfilled a unique function. Conversely, other categories, e.g. statistical methods, contained a diversity of methods, but were not seen to play a unique role in SES research, and resources for their use are readily available. The final set of categories are intended to provide an entry point for discussion around methods that are being used in SES research, and not as a definitive list of methods that can or should be used.
m5ka | To obtain the frequency of method categories in our database, we searched the full set of 4479 place-based studies for the 311 methods we had extracted from the subset of 2000 articles, and classified which categories each record belonged to. We were able to categorize 2742 of our place-based articles in this way. Thus, the remaining 1737 articles (38%) either did not mention the methods we detected in our search, or did not mention any methods in their abstracts. Readers should thus keep in mind that the list of methods identified in this study was not comprehensive.
byu8 | Features and dynamics of complex adaptive systems
76b0 | We used Preiser et al.'s (2018) typology of six organizing principles of CAS (Table 1) to qualitatively assess each method category in terms of its ability to account for key organizing principles of CAS. By "account" we mean the extent to which a method's assumptions and application allow them to investigate systems that are constituted relationally, context-dependent, radically open, adaptive, dynamic, and have complex causality. We chose this typology on account of Preiser et al.'s (2018) clear conceptualization of SES as CAS. We distinguished between method categories that "did not account for this feature of complexity" (0); "can account for this feature of complexity, depending on how it is employed" (1, sometimes); "can account for this feature of complexity, and is usually employed in a way that does" (2, most times); and "explicitly accounts for this
zxz6 | Ecology and Society 24(4): 16 https://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol24/iss4/art16/
xnth | element of complexity in the way it is constituted" (3, always). In our analysis, we considered the ways in which the different types of methods are, to our knowledge, normally used. Each of the authors independently scored the method clusters against each principle, and subsequently debated the scores that we disagreed on. Based on our discussions, we simplified our scores into two categories: "does not usually account for this complexity feature" (0), and "usually accounts for this complexity feature" (x).
vafm | RESULTS
2zmw | Terms used
bf9k | Of the chosen search terms, "nature society relations" (71.8%), "social-ecological" (31.78%), "man-environment* relations" (29.67%), "socio-ecological" (17.15%), "social-environmental" (12.1%), and "coupled human*" (3.2%) were the most commonly used in the full final result set <LATEX>\left( n = 5 0 9 8 \right) .</LATEX> Many publications contain more than one of these key words. The term "man- environment* relations" and "human environment" appeared to be more popular in earlier years, whilst the term "social- ecological," "socio-ecological" and "nature-society relations" have become more dominant in recent years (Fig. 1).
otkr | Growth of the SES research space
ibgs | Our results show that there is a significant increase in the number of publications in the SES space, relative to the growth in all publications over time (Spearman's rank correlation, <LATEX>\mathrm { p } < 0 . 0 1 ,</LATEX> <LATEX>\left. r h o = 0 . 0 8 2 3 \right) .</LATEX> Significant change points were detected between 1989 and 1990, between 1999 and 2000, and 2009 and 2010. A single change point analysis revealed the change between 1999 and 2000 to be the most significant change point <LATEX>\left( \mathrm { p } < 0 . 0 5 \right.</LATEX> Similarly, the Bayesian change point analysis revealed most probable change points between 1989 and 1990 <LATEX>\left( p r o b = 0 . 9 9 , \right.</LATEX> <LATEX>\chi ^ { 2 }</LATEX> = 0.0003), 1999 and 2000 <LATEX>\left( \mathrm { p r o b } = 0 . 9 5 2 \right. ,</LATEX> <LATEX>x ^ { 2 } = 0 . 0 0 2 ,</LATEX> but put a third change point between 2012 and 2013 (prob 0.940, <LATEX>x ^ { 2 } = 0 . 0 0 2 .</LATEX> A fourth change point, between 2008 and 2009, had a posterior probability of 0.604 (Fig. 2). A posterior probability is a term in Bayesian statistics that refers to the conditional probability assigned to a proposition after relevant evidence has been considered (Lee 2012).
colo | Journals over time
d6r4 | We identified 1234 different sources that published papers on SES. The top 20 journals each published between 0.63% and 7.73% of all publications, accounting for 28.05% of publications in total (Fig. 3a). There were significant differences in the median number of publications between the five most prominent journals <LATEX>\left( x ^ { 2 } = \right.</LATEX> 32.1302, <LATEX>\mathrm { D F } = 4 ,</LATEX> <LATEX>\mathrm { p } < 0 . 0 0 0 1 ,</LATEX> with Ecology and Society having significantly more publications (compared to Ambio, <LATEX>\mathrm { p } < 0 . 0 0 0 1 ,</LATEX> Ecological Economics, <LATEX>p = 0 . 0 1 9 ,</LATEX> Global Environmental Change, <LATEX>p = 0 0 1 ,</LATEX> Journal of Environmental Management, <LATEX>\left. \mathrm { p } < 0 . 0 0 0 1 \right) .</LATEX> There were no significant differences between other journals (Fig. 3b). Ambio and Global Environmental Change published proportionally more papers in the SES field prior to 2000, while Ecology and Society has become increasingly dominant as the main journal publishing SES research since 2000 (Fig. 3c).
