        "content": "oksu | Attitudes towards the British government\nwtow | MOOD also shows that the public had limited knowledge about the 'Empire' and imperial relations. Many had little interest in British politics, which could be observed when British members of parliament visited Hong Kong in nineteen seventy-six. Apart from knowing that M Ps were elected, the Hong Kong public had virtually no idea about what members of parliament did. The report pointed out that 'some respondents believed that the visits were for the purpose of \"checking up\" on the Hong Kong government'. Despite the degree of autonomy enjoyed by Hong Kong, the public still held the impression that the colonial state was 'to a large extent, \"controlled\" by the United Kingdom government'. The UK parliamentary members were viewed as 'inspectors'. The same report also reflected the absence of confidence and scepticism towards both the colonial state and the British government. Many contacts argued that local officials would not present the parliamentary members with an accurate picture of the situation in Hong Kong:\no22k | They assumed quite intuitively that government officers would try to show the visitors only the better side of things. It simply did not occur to them that Hong Kong government very often tried to make visitors see Hong Kong's difficult and intractable problems in the hope that they could be better understood.\nnwfz | The only information respondents of all classes and educational backgrounds had about the British government was its 'deteriorating economy', notably the 'shrinking pound'.\nnvfy | The royal visit by the Queen in nineteen seventy-five enabled MOOD to evaluate attitudes towards the head of state and answer students' radicalism. The announcement of the trip 'did not arouse much enthusiasm, particularly from the grass-roots level'. Many even denounced the trip as 'untimely' under the 'gloomy economic situation' as they misbelieved that a substantial amount of public expenditure would be spent. Despite the warm welcome\nmror | upon the Queen's arrival, most families certainly were not 'well-wishers'. They only considered the royal visit 'no more than items of entertainment'. People 'do not regard themselves as subjects of the Queen of Great Britain, but rather as Chinese people coming by choice and force of circumstance to live under an alien government'. Most respondents called Queen Elizabeth the Second either neoi wong (the Queen) or jing neoi wong ( the Queen of England). MOOD interpreted this as an absence of political allegiance to both the United Kingdom and the British Crown. Hong Kong's grass roots and junior civil servants were apathetic. Some identified the Queen as either si tau po ( the female boss) or baau zou po ( the landlady), demonstrating that their relations with the Crown were practical and instrumental. Similar reactions were detected in the celebration of the Silver Jubilee in nineteen seventy-seven and the visit of Prince Charles in nineteen seventy-nine. The nineteen seventy-seven MOOD again suggested that most Hong Kong people did not 'consciously think of themselves as British subjects', 'except when they actually seek to travel on a British passport'. The visit of Charles was 'very well received' in nineteen seventy-nine only because Charles was often described by the mass media as 'charming, friendly and approachable', and that 'no lavish decorations or public funds had been wasted'. The visit did not instil 'public confidence and trust in the British government'.\nzlxc | Although some students started a campaign to boycott the royal visit in nineteen seventy-five, Hong Kong society in general was 'on the whole unsympathetic towards the boycott'. The majority believed that the boycott was 'meaningless and of no avail' since it certainly would have zero impact on the colony's constitutional position. The lower-income groups, in particular, paid no attention to it. A 'non-conformist and aggressive attitude' was spreading from university to senior secondary students. Nonetheless, the post-secondary students were 'on the whole divided'. Graduates, in particular, were more pro-establishment. While some undergraduates believed that they could use the campaign as a channel to express their discontent, most were 'indifferent' and showed 'reluctance to get personally involved over the issue, either as a supporter or critic of the boycott'. In private conversations, many even 'expressed disapproval'. The growing student movement in the nineteen seventies did not only divide the student community, but also the general public. Some viewed rising student political engagement as 'a healthy and beneficial trend for the community'. However, more believed that young students were 'impulsive and immature'.\nk0bw | Attitudes towards China\naq5a | According to MOOD, before nineteen sixty-seven, most Chinese migrated to Hong Kong as they 'disliked communist ideology' and 'hated and feared the Central People's Government'. Most immigrants looked at communism 'with suspicion and hostility'. Some even worried that any link with the communists would 'get them into black books of the Hong Kong government'. In terms of political allegiance, some were loyal to the Kuomintang and viewed Taiwan as the legitimate government of China. They hoped that Taiwan would eventually take over China. MOOD reveals that despite the unpopularity of the leftist-inspired nineteen sixty-seven riots, the public was less hostile to China in the mid-nineteen seventies because it was clear that the central Chinese government had no intention of taking back Hong Kong early. By avoiding direct confrontation with the colonial government, communist\nsc5y | China seemed content to maintain the status quo in Hong Kong for 'cogent and important reasons'. China's willingness to supply Hong Kong with scarce resources, such as water during droughts in the nineteen sixties and oil during the oil crisis in nineteen seventy-four, also gave the general public an impression that China was 'quite ready to help Hong Kong'. According to the observation of the Home Affairs Department staff, it became more prevalent to 'celebrate' the National Day of the People's Republic of China in the colony:\n0yab | The number of 'celebration dinner parties' has increased significantly. It appears that invitations have been very widely distributed to non-communist groups, including associations known to have right-wing connections or sympathies. Many more 'neutral' people have accepted the invitations. They feel much less inhibited about attending such parties. Some of them even regard it as an honour to have been invited.\nw95z | Different views were shared by former migrants from China and the locally born young generation. A large proportion of middle-aged and elderly groups still viewed communism with scepticism. The young generation took a relatively 'relaxed attitude' about 'the likelihood of Hong Kong returning to China'. Most post-war baby boomers however 'still preferred the status quo' and did not 'cherish returning to live in China under a communist regime'. The general optimism towards China stretched into the late nineteen seventies: 'a general feeling of relief and confidence currently prevails'. While it was conventionally believed that 'older Chinese had often kept their negative views of the People's Republic of China', MOOD shows that attitudes of the middle-aged and elderly towards China had improved significantly in nineteen seventy-eight. Many were 'now more relaxed about China and welcome the improvement of Hong Kong and Beijing relations'. For the young generation, the Return Home Movement lost momentum and MOOD detected 'no significant trend' of students wanting to return to China.",
