Smith takes it for granted that 'species taxa are real' but subspecies are not. Therefore, only species are of intrinsic value. Critics have seen this presumption, in turn, as a failure to properly consider subspecies and higher categories in taxonomy.\n6d4s | Finally, Ronald Sandler understands species as 'groups of biologically related organisms that are distinguished from other organisms by virtue of their shared form of life'. What distinguishes organisms in this way, according to Sandler, are, for example, their ways to acquire energy (what they\nmqah | eat), how they move (and whether they move at all), how they reproduce and so on. Because Sandler argues against objective values being applicable to species (understood in this way), he points out that species can be still valuable in other ways. For example, some species are subjectively (finally/non-instrumentally) valuable (i.e. valuable because people actually value them) in two ways: firstly, in the form of 'preference value' as the 'value that something has because people have a preference for it'. That value is also sometimes called 'existence value', which according to Espen Stabell 'can be understood to involve self-regarding as well as other-regarding and nonanthropocentric preferences'. Secondly, species can also have 'integral value' as the 'value that something possesses when it is valued in a way that flows from one's worldview of core value commitments' according to Sandler.\nxxr8 | This last account of the value of species neither relies on species having objective value (like Rolston), nor on species having interests akin to living beings (like Johnson), nor on the premise that species are being able to flourish (like Smith), and thus, it relies on less premises that might be controversial. However, in contrast to those other accounts its scope is much narrower because it concedes that only some anthropogenic species extinctions are lamentable by involving the loss of such value and only if this value is actually held by some humans.\nrl4j | Resulting from harm to nonhuman individuals\nvz32 | Non-anthropocentric individualist accounts within environmental ethics - that is sentientist (i.e. all sentient beings are morally considerable) or biocentric (i.e. all living beings are morally considerable) accounts - are only indirectly concerned with extinctions. What primarily matters to such positions is either the harm, impediment to well-being or injustice that is borne by individual nonhuman beings, and thus, the relevant harm involved in extinctions is not found on the species level. Yet, it is often argued - for different reasons - that these two levels of analysis are closely related. For example, according to animal rights theorist Tom Regan the preservation of the biotic community follows from showing 'proper respect for the rights of the individuals' that are part of that community.\nncb0 | As an example of emphasising the current anthropogenic mass extinction within an individualist framework, Anna Wienhues argues in favour of a biocentric theory of interspecies justice. Within this account, anthropogenic extinctions function as indicators of potential previous distributive injustices to nonhuman beings, due to the unjust deprivation of habitat that can ultimately lead to species extinctions. Within this context, extinctions are not injustices in themselves, but an outcome of interspecies injustice - metaphorically speaking she argues that 'each anthropogenic extinction is a memorial for past injustices'.\n8mp0 | A commonality of all of these individualist accounts is that they are only indirectly concerned with extinctions and cannot explain why an extinction is in itself morally lamentable. Moreover, such accounts usually cannot morally distinguish between saving a specimen that belongs to a near-extinct species and one that does not belong to such a species. If ethical relevance is placed solely on individual entities rather than species, then the extinction status of the species\nxjyk | the entity belongs to does not necessarily count ethically, which could be more of a problem for some individualist accounts, than for individualist accounts that allow for a degree of value pluralism (as opposed to everything of moral relevance being reducible to, e.g., individual well-being) and/or that allow for a degree of ethical pluralism.\nmt0f | An alternative solution is presented by individualist accounts that conceptualise the individual's interests as extending to 'all other organisms that are relatives' in terms of its species (understood following Mayr's biological species concept). Based on Nicholas Agar's account, that consequently allows for an individualist argument that proposes that individuals that are part of endangered species and therefore rare are more valuable than their plentiful counterparts. According to Agar that follows because the value of an individual is not 'a function only of its own goals. Its demise affects the other-directed and other-requiring goals of its conspecifics, depending on how plentiful its species is', which includes, for example, the ability of individuals to mate and successfully reproduce.\nawab | Yet, non-individualist accounts consider a theoretical focus on the individual to be a weakness. As Johnson puts it, '[an] ethic that deals adequately with the issues of extinction must not only avoid being anthropocentric, it must avoid being atomistic'. That might make one favour again one of the earlier introduced values of species accounts, but an account like Johnson's faces in turn a range of difficulties in its own as already indicated above.\nixcc | Leading to the loss of valuable biological variety\n8p6h | Besides accounts that consider the loss of parts of biodiversity to be problematic because of the moral relevance of species or nonhuman individuals, other perspectives consider species extinctions to be problematic due to the involved loss of biological variety. While biodiversity loss does not necessarily follow from species extinctions and vice versa, they are clearly conceptually related and practically implicated in each other. Problematising the loss of (bio)diversity, in turn, is a notable topic in the context of species extinctions because it has been institutionalised on an international level via the Convention of Biological Diversity (established in nineteen ninety-three).\n```",
