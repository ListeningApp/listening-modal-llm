Here, long-distance axonal microtubule networks provide significant support to the neuronal E-L system. These spatial challenges to address a unique structural geometry, high metabolic demand, enhanced responsiveness to chemical or electrical stimulation, and the requirement for longevity due to their postmitotic nature, place a tremendous burden on the E-L system. Nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons have an additional burden in terms of long and highly branched axons, larger surface area, selective transporters for external toxins, large fluctuations in free calcium, less buffering capacity, and higher oxidative stress, reducing their threshold for degeneration. These vulnerabilities are further exacerbated with aging. Faced with environmental and genetic risk factors, disease pathogenesis abounds.\ned6e | In nineteen ninety-seven, identification of dominant mutations in the alpha-synuclein gene which encodes alpha-synuclein as a cause of familial PD, brought a conceptual shift toward the importance of genetics in disease pathogenesis. Subsequent findings revealed various other genetic mutations, with at least ten to fifteen percent of PD patients having familial PD of an absolute genetic origin. Leucine-rich repeat kinase two and Parkin mutations are the most common genetic variants of dominant and recessively inherited PD, respectively. Mutations and gene multiplications of alpha-synuclein and Glucosidase Beta Acid are also highly prevalent, whereas PD pathology was also noted with abnormal forms of Parkinsonism associated with deglycase or DJ1, and PTEN induced putative kinase one. There is also compelling evidence for a genetic component to sporadic PD. In fact, a rigid distinction between the genetic and environmental basis of PD pathogenesis may not exist considering that cases are phenotypically indistinguishable (except for the onset), implying genetic and sporadic cases share common underlying mechanisms. Even after considerable studies on these familial mutations and their interaction with environment, the core pathomechanisms of PD are still unclear, limiting treatment strategies. Over the past ten years, advancements in high-throughput sequencing, the application of genome wide association studies, and meta-analysis, have identified new genetic mutations. Intriguingly, most of these identified genes have links to the E-L system. Mechanistic studies also suggest that these proteins are the downstream targets of previously identified broad spectrum dysfunction in alpha-synuclein and LRRK2 mutations. It is now becoming clear that most PD-linked genes and known pathomechanisms are, in one way or another, associated with the E-L system, strongly suggesting this pathway as the key master regulator of PD pathogenesis. Recent studies suggest that neurodegeneration is initiated at the dopaminergic presynaptic terminals of striatum, years before the clinical diagnosis. Evidence that most of the E-L system genes associated with PD function at this terminal further establishes their fundamental role in PD pathogenesis. Below, we discuss our understanding of the known functions of these E-L system genes and their dysfunction in PD. We also discuss how other key PD-associated proteins target E-L pathways.\n6qqm | Three. Clathrin-mediated synaptic vesicle endocytosis: A prime target?\nonum | Three point one The DNAJ family of heat shock proteins in the presynaptic terminal and beyond:\n3iir | SV endocytosis is predominantly mediated through CME. Following exocytosis, the SV membrane is endocytosed primarily through CME, which involves formation of a clathrin coat, composed of an outer clathrin layer and an inner layer of adaptors. The most common adaptors such as AP-two and AP one hundred eighty binds to endocytic motifs on the SV membrane, as well as phosphatidylinositol four, five-bisphosphate present in the plasma membrane. Endophilin A1 and alpha-synuclein drive membrane bending and curvature formation of the developing clathrin coated pit. Following this, the clathrin coated pit in conjunction with dynamin and other accessory proteins undergoes membrane fission to form a CCV. Regeneration of SVs from CCVs and recycling of clathrin and related coat components for further endocytosis requires un-coating of clathrin from CCVs. The clathrin uncoating step is carried out by the coordinated action of the PI phosphatase synaptojanin-one and the co-chaperone auxilin with sixty kilodalton heat shock cognate. Endophilin A1 and cyclin G Associated Kinase also regulate clathrin uncoating to facilitate CME at the presynaptic terminal. Mutations of these E-L system genes in familial PD envisage synaptic endocytosis dysfunction as a prime trigger for PD pathogenesis.\n7a0a | Auxilin: DNAJC6 gene encodes auxilin, the major presynaptic endocytic protein linked to PD. Auxilin is a brain specific co-chaperone belonging to the DNAJC family, a subclass of heat shock proteins. Auxilin plays an important role in clathrin uncoating, recruiting adenosine triphosphate-activated sixty kilodalton heat shock cognate to CCVs, which in turn, disassembles clathrin from vesicles facilitating their recycling. Loss-of-function autosomal recessive mutations of auxilin have been shown to cause juvenile or early onset PD, first observed in two teenage brothers of a Palestinian family. The study noted abnormal messenger RNA splicing and a decrease in auxilin messenger RNA levels. Other variants of auxilin mutations were later noted in a Brazilian family with similar mis-splicing of messenger RNA, whereas mutations affecting the J-domain were observed in a few other consanguineous families. Along with typical PD symptoms, patients with nonsense mutations have cognitive impairment, one of the cardinal non-motor symptoms of PD. Epilepsy and mental retardation have also been noted for some PD patients with auxilin mutations. These human genetic studies suggest widespread neuronal dysfunction besides nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurodegeneration. Hence, future studies on post-mortem brains documenting PD-typical Lewy body pathology and dopaminergic neuronal loss are necessary to concretely categorize the pathology as PD or parkinsonism.\n```",
