You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

ywwr | Using transient absorption spectroscopy and monitoring the recovery of the MLCT absorption of the <LATEX>\mathrm { R u } ^ { \mathrm { I I } }</LATEX> complex, the interfacial ET and PCET reaction kinetics were quantified from pH 0.7 to 6.8. The kinetics as a function of the applied potential for the reaction at each pH are provided in Figure 7c, and a plot of the maximum rate constant for the PCET reaction as a function of pH is shown in Figure 7d. For <LATEX>p H < 5 ,</LATEX> we observed the same behavior as in our previous study. The <LATEX>k _ { \mathrm { a p p } } \left( E \right)</LATEX> curves for <LATEX>p H > 3</LATEX> are shifted toward lower potentials compared to the curve for <LATEX>p H = 0 . 7 .</LATEX> For the maximum rate constant, the value at <LATEX>p H = 3 . 1 0</LATEX> is similar to that at <LATEX>p H = 0 . 7 ,</LATEX> and a weak decrease is observed in the <LATEX>p H</LATEX> range of 3-5. On the other hand, the <LATEX>k _ { \mathrm { a p p } } \left( E \right)</LATEX> curves for <LATEX>p H = 6 . 6 3</LATEX> is right on top of the curve at <LATEX>p H = 5 . 8 9 ,</LATEX> indicating <LATEX>p H</LATEX> independence in this pH range.

0i6j | <LATEX>p H .</LATEX> CONCLUSIONS
87cq | In this paper, we developed a multichannel kinetic model to describe the pH dependence of PCET reactions. The apparent standard potential and apparent rate constant can be expressed as functions of the mole fractions of different forms of the reactant (i.e., the protonated and deprotonated forms), which in turn depend on pH. We derived the general expressions for the apparent rate constants of both homogeneous and electrochemical PCET reactions and the specific expressions corresponding to Butler-Volmer and Marcus-Gerischer kinetics. The power of this model is that the multiple competing channels encompass both sequential and concerted mechanisms and, in contrast to common square schemes, the possibility of more than one proton donor and acceptor.
0qs3 | We also applied this model to the light-initiated electro- chemical reduction of an ITO-attached Ru-based water oxidation catalyst and explained the experimentally observed weak pH dependence of the maximum rate constant for <LATEX>p H</LATEX> between 1 and 5. Our analysis indicates that the hydronium ion is not directly involved in a concerted PCET reaction involving proton transfer from the hydronium to a hydroxide axial ligand upon reduction of the ruthenium center. Instead, our analysis suggests that the dominant channels are either ET, where the axial ligand is water, or PCET via an ETPT mechanism, where reduction of the ruthenium is followed quickly by protonation of the hydroxide axial ligand. At low pH, the dominant channel is ET, whereas at higher pH, the mechanism becomes PCET via the ETPT mechanism. The observed pH dependence arises from the intrinsic difference between the rate constants of these two channels and the dependence of their relative contributions, as determined by the reactant mole fractions, on pH. Our model also predicts that the maximum rate constant will become pH-independent at higher pH. This prediction was confirmed by our experiments for this water oxidation catalyst attached to ITO
z8f7 | by siloxane anchor groups, where the maximum rate constant is clearly pH-independent at pH > 5.
7w7j | Although this specific model is consistent with the experimental data and its prediction was validated, we cannot rule out the possibility that other models might yield similar results. In particular, the assumption of a potential-dependent pKa,Ox has not been verified on an ITO surface. In addition, our calculations assumed that the rate constants can be described by MG theory and that the electronic coupling is the same for the ET2, EPT1, and EPT2 channels. The association equilibrium constants and reorganization energies were computed with DFT methods that also introduce some assumptions. As further experimental data become available, we will refine the assumptions used to determine the fundamental quantities as well as further test the model itself.
51vd | This general multichannel model for describing the kinetics of both homogeneous and electrochemical PCET reactions will have widespread applications. For each system, all relevant reaction channels must be identified. Then, a combination of computational and experimental data can be used to determine the various equilibrium constants and intrinsic rate constants or, in some cases, reasonable ranges for them. Within the framework of this multichannel model, analysis of the dominant forms of the redox species and the dominant channels as a function of pH will provide a deeper mechanistic understanding of PCET reactions.
