You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

75y3 | Can United States Healthcare Become Environmentally Sustainable? Towards Green Healthcare Reform
s2g2 | 'n 2014, the United States health care industry
q1q2 | produced an estimated 480 million metric tons of carbon dioxide (CO2); nearly 8% of the country's total emissions.1 Carbon dioxide emissions contribute to climate change, climate-change related health haz- ards, and international suffering.2 At the same time, caring for those affected by climate change health hazards produces more carbon emissions. This cycli- cal response to climate change health hazards is self- defeating. The importance of sustainability in health care - as a business reliant on fossil fuels for transpor- tation, lighting and energy, streams of resources, and operational functioning - is slowly being accepted in both the US3 and abroad.4 Yet, current efforts to green health care are incomplete since they focus on health care structures. The treatments provided in the course of the therapeutic relationship is the essence of health care - not the buildings that contain the practice.5 Notably, hospital care and physician/clinical service sectors contribute the most CO2 within the US medi- cal industry, with structures/ equipment and pharma- ceuticals at third and fourth, respectively.6
cb7r | In recognition of the need for comprehensive green health care reform, this article will first postulate rea- sons for a lack of environmental sustainability in US health care. Many of these reasons are on the national level where the physician-patient relationship remains a less frequently discussed pathway towards green health care reform. As such, this article will, second, identify current green health care initiatives in the United States in which patients and physicians par- ticipate. In many cases, other health care profession- als participate in green initiatives, but this article will focus on physicians or doctors in order to narrow the scope of inquiry. Third, the rationale for participa- tion in green initiatives will be explained. Fourth, the article will propose that, based on the environmental values of patients and physicians, health care insur- ance plans, which may be private or governmentally- run, and health care insurance companies can be petitioned for green health care reform. Health care insurance plans and health care insurance companies are largely absent from participation in sustainability initiatives; hence they must be involved to close the loop of sustainable health care delivery.
68xu | I. Lack of Sustainability in US Health Care
hd35 | Reducing the carbon impact of global health care has been written about,7 lobbied for,8 and, in some cases,
2zpk | implemented.9 This reifies both the support for sus- tainable health care and the possibility for enacting it. However, health care in the United States is not environmentally sustainable for several reasons. First, there is not national consensus on the importance of sustainability in domestic policy. Historically, US citizens and companies have fallen on both pro-envi- ronment and anti-environment sides of, for instance, permitting fracking in Michigan,10 building the Alaska oil pipeline,11 passing the Environmental Protection Act,12 and supporting the Endangered Species Act.13 More recent opportunities for the United States to join with other international political leaders in the fight against climate change have been disappoint- ing. With the US withdrawing from the Paris Climate Agreement in 2019,14 and obstinately refusing to move towards clean and sustainable energy,15 actions which may move the US towards sustainability do not enjoy national consensus which would lead to a green over- haul of every sector - health care included.
epu7 | Second, and similarly, the priority of health care in the United States varies widely.16 While health care reform is consistently named as a top voting issue,17 the push and pull over the Affordable Care Act, with lingering attempts to "repeal and replace," highlight the conflicting views of US citizens towards health care for all.18 As private19 or employer-sponsored20 health insurance has been the norm in the United States, and with a strong dislike of the "Welfare state," US citizens tend to reject measures which would put individual taxes towards national health care. Given these fragmentations, a functionally coherent health care system has been impossible in the United States, let alone an infrastructure of sustainable health care. If the nation cannot move towards environmentally sound health care policies, then health care systems would need to reform themselves.
7od1 | Yet, third, many health care and hospital systems fail to initiate or maintain sustainability initiatives. Complex individual and group factors ranging from diffusion of responsibility, to paralysis about the enor- mity of the environmental problem,21 to the "bystander effect" - whereby an individual believes that someone else will address the situation - stymie environmen- tal action22 and derail attempts at greening health systems. While there are a variety of sustainability initiatives which hospitals in the United States may participate in, including collaboration with organi- zations such as Practice GreenHealth,23 Health Care Without Harm,24 or the now-retired Healthier Hos- pitals Initiative,25 to implementation of sustainability measures in individual facilities - such as recycling - these are voluntary and do not address health care delivery. Current sustainability models that focus on
0bqy | the structural aspects of health care are limited in their efficacy as they can only "green" buildings or medical infrastructures and rarely examine the carbon of the practice of medicine itself.26 This is equivalent to mak- ing an automobile plant solar-powered, but continu- ing to manufacture cars that run on fossil fuels.
b780 | Fourth, the environmental movement has failed to offer health care an effective paradigm for sustainabil- ity. The mantra "reduce, reuse, recycle" is insensible to medical consumers and health care providers in their day-to-day work, which relies on quick-use disposable instruments. Health care is not a highly visible carbon polluter, even though it has significant carbon emis- sions. An image of a destroyed rainforest has gravi- tas; a dead fur seal invokes pity. Less persuasive is the environmental destruction associated with the poly- pharmacy of an elderly woman or a young man in a long-term care facility. Similarly, environmental activ- ists have focused on issues with a clearly identifiable aggressor and victim, such as hunters of the endan- gered grey wolves or nuclear power plants dumping toxic waste in urban areas. But, unlike other environ- mental transgressions, every person is culpable for the carbon emissions of health care. This is a matter of degree, not kind. Although there is not equitable use of - or access to - health care in the US, facilities stand ready to use, emitting carbon and contributing to the national health care carbon footprint. Individu- als protect themselves from the scrutiny of environ- mental ethics by normalizing high-carbon health care use.27 Unlike private transportation, for instance, which can be exchanged for more sustainable options, alternatives to resource intensive medical treatments are not highly visible. Of course, all health care is optional, many medical procedures have limited clinical benefit, or are futile28 which means carbon is wasted without meeting health goals.29 Moreover, pre- ventative care, such as avoiding alcohol and tobacco, eating within guidelines, and getting enough exercise reduces illness30 and therefore saves health care car- bon which is incurred from treating preventable dis- eases and conditions.
ccmb | Finally, the invocation of biomedical ethics to sup- port sustainable health care is met with resistance under the erroneous belief that health care ought not be accountable for resource use, since unlimited medical treatments are an inviolable right.31 Pub- lic discussions about health care prioritization often devolve into panic over allocation and triage.32 Both anger and fear emerge when ICUs, elective surgeries, life-extending treatments, and experimental therapies are discussed for cost containment. This quickly turns to rhetoric about death panels.33 Many of the themes which mark the resistance to conversations about
ma93 | health care resource allocation redouble when sus- tainability is invoked. To posit carbon containment as a rationale for health care delivery reduction is a steep fight indeed.
