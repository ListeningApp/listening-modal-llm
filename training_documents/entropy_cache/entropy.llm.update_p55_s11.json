First let's do a system with one degree of freedom where the energy is E of x equals x squared over two. In this case, after a change of variables, the Gibbs distribution becomes a Gaussian with mean zero and variance one, and that gives the desired result. Or just do the integrals and see what you get! The expected energy E is k-T.\nyohk | PROOF OF THE EQUIPARTITION THEOREM: Two\n0qgi | More general case: a system with n degrees of freedom where the energy E: R-N maps to R is F of x equals M l-squared over two\nawut | We can reduce this to the case with one degree of freedom:\npjzb | The expected value of E equals R-N\na2ry | two T\n8zhz | Integral from negative infinity to infinity of e to the negative B l squared over two dn x\nnokn | Integral from negative infinity to infinity of e to the negative B l squared over two dn x\nn0c4 | JIR-N\nviyb | Next we do a system with n degrees of freedom where the energy is a sum of n terms of the form x squared over two. It's no surprise that each degree of freedom contributes k-T to the expected energy, giving\ndz2n | Expected value of E equals five n k T\nh9r0 | But make sure you follow my calculation above. I skipped a couple of steps!\nggnb | PROOF OF THE EQUIPARTITION THEOREM: Three\nw3d0 | General case: a system with n degrees of freedom where the energy E: R-N maps to R is any positive definite quadratic form. Then\nu3z1 | E of x equals one half norm A x squared for some invertible n by n matrix A. When A is a diagonal matrix this gives\nag51 | E of x equals the sum from i equals one to n of c-sub-i x-sub-i squared over two where c-sub-i is greater than zero. We can reduce the general case to the previous case by a change of variables\nj0m4 | y equals A x: The expected value of E equals the integral over R-N of one half norm A x squared e to the negative beta norm A x squared over two d-n x divided by the integral over R-N of e to the negative beta norm A x squared over two d-n x equals the integral over R-N of one half norm y squared e to the negative beta norm y squared over two d-n y divided by the integral over R-N of e to the negative beta norm y squared over two d-n y equals n over two k T. Finally let's do the general case. A quadratic form on R-N is a map Q: R-N maps to R such that\nsc0s | Q of x equals the sum from i equals j equals one to n of q-sub-i-j x-sub-i x-sub-j for some numbers q-sub-i-j in R. We say it's positive definite if\npnsc | x not equal to zero implies Q of x is greater than zero. One can prove that a quadratic form Q: R-N maps to R is positive definite if and only if\np1qs | Q of x equals one half norm A x squared for some invertible n by n matrix A. The factor of one half here is just to make our calculations easier.\nk5kg | Thanks to this, if we have a system whose space of states is R-N and its energy function E: R-N maps to R is a positive definite quadratic form, we can compute\ne002 | The expected value of E equals the integral over R-N of E of x times exp of negative beta E of x dx divided by the integral over R-N of exp of negative beta E of x dx by reducing it to the previous case using a change of variables. We get\n9klo | The expected value of E equals one half n k T.\npbpw | So, each degree of freedom still contributes a k-T to the expected energy. That's the equipartition theorem!\n6tr9 | But be careful. The equipartition theorem doesn't apply when the energy is an arbitrary function of n variables. It also fails when we switch from classical to quantum statistical mechanics.",
