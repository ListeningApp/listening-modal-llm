You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

nav4 | cases. Shoulder-to-Shoulder (Horizontal) may, therefore, be a further factor in defining body shape. Systems like FFIT could include this measurement.
gem8 | We, therefore, reject hypothesis 4.
e8nr | A one-way between-groups analysis of variance explored the FFIT body shape's association with shoul- der-to-shoulder (horizontal) measurements. There was a statistically significant difference at the <LATEX>p < 0 . 0 5</LATEX> level for shoulder measurements for the FFIT's seven body shapes; <LATEX>F \left( 6 , 8 8 . 8 7 \right) = 4 1 . 6 5 8 ,</LATEX> <LATEX>p < 0 . 0 1 .</LATEX> The <LATEX>^ { 2 }</LATEX> was 0.16, indicating a large effect size. The ANOVA test achieved <LATEX>\left( 1 - \beta \right.</LATEX> err <LATEX>\left. \mathrm { p r o b } \right) = 1 . 0 ,</LATEX> Effect size <LATEX>f =</LATEX> 0.41, satisfying our statistical power requirements. Table 7 presents the post hoc - pairwise - comparisons using the Tukey HSD test, with a Bonferroni adjustment of
k78w | <LATEX>p = 0 . 0 0 7 .</LATEX> Despite the ANOVA's statistically significant result, there is little difference between shoulder-to-shoulder (horizontal) and the FFIT Body Shapes. While Top Hourglass has a significantly different shoulder meas- urement than every other body shape, other body shapes have at least one insignificant difference. Figure 5 visualises the confidence intervals, revealing the sig- nificant overlap between shoulder measurements and body shapes. Therefore, we cannot imply a person's shoulder-to-shoulder (horizontal) measurement with confidence from the FFIT body shape alone.
g9du | Discussion Unauthoritative body shape classification
f682 | We show that the FFIT Body shape classification sys- tem is unauthoritative because slight differences in measurement placement definition leads to different
li1k | shape classifications of the same body: in up to 39.6% of cases. Something likely to occur because of variabil- ities in scanner definition and a lack of clarity regard- ing measurement definitions that hold the same nomenclature. This paper, therefore, highlights a limi- tation in the current body shape calculation methodol- ogies, stemming from applying inconsistent measurement definitions in the FFIT. The results verify the FFIT may classify a single person in up to three different body shape depending on the measurement definitions associated with the named measurement. With a vague definition of body shape between sour- ces, multiple shape interpretations occur depending on where on the body the measurement is placed, highlighted within Table 1.
pbea | Hourglass and rectangle are the dominant body shapes within our sample, as Table 3 shows. However, the shape classification transforms with the alteration in measurement definitions; see Table 3 and Figure 4. The FFIT's waist, for example, is higher in the waist region than SizeUK's waist, as defined by the SizeUK Measurement Extraction Protocol (SizeUK 2002). The mismatch in measurement definitions emphasises high specificity's importance in the way ergonomists and garment construction practitioners take measurements to extract the repeatable and accurate measurements that drive shape classification.
ccpt | Significantly smaller waist measurements in the FFIT causes alternative body shape classifications. These arose when the 3 D body scanner searched for the nar- rowest point within the FFIT's broader waist region of SoB + 6.35 cm. The difficulty here is the 3 D body scan- ner's propensity to place the waist at the ribcage's base, a measurement smaller than the actual waist. The actual waist should occur in the waist region's soft tis- sue (Gill et al. 2014). Furthermore, as Sokolowski and Bettencourt (2020) note, the FFIT assumes the waist region is smaller than the bust and hip. Sokolowski and Bettencourt (2020, 22) show that the FFITs categorisa- tion - as Yim Lee et al.'s (2007) formulate - incorrectly categorises plus-sized women 'often because the waist circumferences were larger than either bust or hip'.
0fpw | In summary, ergonomists and garment construction practitioners require a non-equivocal and repeatable set of measurement placement definitions to produce a stable and repeatable body shape classification sys- tem. The FFIT does not adhere to this, using flawed Hip and Waist definitions that can place measure- ments in inappropriate regions. If the FFIT instead uses an anatomically correct Hip definition - as SizeUK's Measurement Extraction Protocol (SizeUK 2002) uses - it will raise a question about the math- ematical descriptors' accuracy, presented in Table A1 in Appendix. The mathematical descriptors were, after all, developed using information from literature, experts' tacit knowledge in apparel design and fit, and the visual analysis of segmental proportions that exist in the female body's bust-to-hips zone. Ergonomists, garment construction practitioners, and researchers cannot, therefore, consider the FFIT as accurate orap- propriate enough for scientific or cultural discussion, a forum requiring non-equivocal categorisation.
dqn8 | The need for shoulder anthropometrics
cop0 | Our results show two shoulder measurements differenti- ate between the FFIT body shape classifications Shoulder-to-Shoulder (Horizontal) and Shoulder- to-Shoulder (Calliper). While the FFIT shapes may have an eminent power in predicting horizontal shoulder widths (see Table 5), the remaining measurements only show small to medium effect sizes. These close associa- tions show limited power relative to the higher com- plexities of shoulder anthropometrics such as pitch, slope length, and front-to-back depth. Multiple interpre- tations of the FFIT definitions confound this, as Figure 4 outlines. Including shoulder measurements within a more advanced - future - body shape classification sys- tem may lead to more effective and stable shape out- comes that align to newer ISO standards. This outcome is expected yet previously unproven. FFIT has a limited applicability in defining more complex body morph- ology than 'typical' female form - as Sokolowski and Bettencourt's (2020) evolution of FFIT to include

82ju | plus-sized women proves. Existing knowledge of anthropometric inter-relationships (Pheasant 1986) - and how alternative Body Shape algorithms utilise different body measurements (Johnson 1990; Sheldon 1954; Simmons, Istook, and Devarajan 2004a) - indicates the need for a study addressing body shape that is consist- ent. However, we show Shoulder-to-Shoulder (horizontal) measurements have a large effect size differentiating body shape classification. It is surprising that FFIT excludes the Shoulder-to-Shoulder (horizontal) measure- ment given its importance in industrial ergonomics and garment construction (Beazley and Bond 2003) and use systems that predate FFIT (Farr 2004; Debenhams 2014; Rasband 1994). Measurement selection is, after all, mutu- ally exclusive to anthropometric measurement extraction technology. Through using the FFIT, ergonomists, aca- demics, and garment construction practitioners have a deficiency in how they consider bodies.
y2qo | Industrial implications
1piq | Our finding's implications are vital because clothing academics and ergonomics researchers are using the FFIT as the theoretical basis of their body shape ana- lysis. Nevertheless, this paper proves that the FFIT's measurement definition and classification methodolo- gies are limited as the FFIT uses Hip and Waist defini- tions that deviate from measurements defined in standards and in product development. The FFIT pro- vides a foundational approach to body shape classifi- cation by key circumferences. Nevertheless, FFIT is prone to variability in application, where two practi- tioners can classify the same body into different shapes. We support this through replacing the FFIT's Hip definition with an anatomically correct Hip defin- ition - as the SizeUK Measurement Extraction Protocol (SizeUK 2002) uses, producing different body shape classifications while still within the FFIT's loose
7fqw | measurement definitions. Practitioners' use of FFIT is not necessarily flawed if the same measurement defi- nitions are used within comparisons - as with Yim Lee et al. (2007). Instead, problems arise when a practi- tioner unknowingly uses different measurements in their work to that of the research they are comparing their results against. Nevertheless, few publications uti- lising FFIT provide sufficient specificity to allow practi- tioners to avoid such potential error. Ergonomists, academics, and garment construction practitioners must give further critical consideration to the reliabil- ity and suitability of all comparative research reliant upon body shape - especially the FFIT - within their work.
rhaz | This paper shows that a person's shoulder-to-shoul- der (horizontal) measurement cannot be inferred from the FFIT body shape alone. As shoulders are one of the critical measurement zones for some upper-body cloth- ing (Beazley and Bond 2003; Aldrich 2015), FFIT cannot describe a body's form that is entirely suitable to gar- ment selection, as with fashion retail's virtual fit/gar- ment size prediction tools (Januszkiewicz et al. 2017). There is, therefore, a need to develop more complex body shape identification systems that include shoulder measurement and addresses the needs for standardisa- tion to avoid classification changes because of small discrepancies in measurement location.
wak1 | Conclusion
wtfz | We set out to assess the stability of FFIT's body classi- fication system for ergonomists, garment construction practitioners, and scientific researchers. In these fields, practitioners often classify measurements by name, meaning definitions can be challenging to ascertain. In pursuing this aim, we prove that slight differences in measurement placement definition1 lead to differ- ent shape classifications of the same body. Because two practitioners can use two different sets of meas- urements sharing the same name, but with slight dif- ferences in definitions within the FFIT's tool, the FFIT body shape classification can lead to inconsistent con- clusions. FFIT can reduce, or remove, this inconsistency by publishing their measurement placement defini- tions in a non-equivocal and replicable format.
qy1i | Relating body shape to garment construction, hori- zontal shoulder measurements - one of the critical measurement zones for some upper-body clothing (Beazley and Bond 2003; Aldrich 2015) - only exhibits a medium association with body shape classifications.
1k9e | A higher level of association with the torso measure- ments used to establish body shape by FFIT would have provided an opportunity to use the FFIT system to predict the torso's broader morphology, including the shoulder region. This indicates a need for any reli- able and authoritative body classification system to include a wider variety of shoulder anthropometry.
5bjs | The FFIT applied without consistent use of the same definitions is limited. Further research is needed to achieve a reliable and appropriate body classifica- tion system for scientific research or garment con- struction. The results provide a detailed examination of the variable approaches to defining body measure- ment and how these affect results. It highlights the need for researchers from all fields to work together to agree on more standardised approaches to anthropometric and ergonomic practices.
uodj | Our finding's mean clothing ergonomics academics and garment construction practitioners must question the authority of their practice that depends upon sys- tems that have loose measurement definitions - like FFIT. They must seek to ensure measurement definitions are consistent, even when names are the same. We must, therefore, rethink and build on the last decade of progress in nationality-based body shape comparisons, body shape-based health estimations, and consumer self-perception that have drawn from the FFIT. Systems like FFIT would benefit from defining measurements by averaging over regions, reducing the influence of local- ised changes. Such systems could lead to more stable body shape classification systems. Researchers may have exposed between-study differences in body shape classi- fication, but the researchers' interpretation of the FFIT's measurement placement may drive the differences, instead of genuine population body shape differences.
k16v | Ergonomics academics and garment construction practitioners need a more reliable and repeatable body classification system than currently exists. Including shoulder anthropometrics into a new body classification system should, if produced through rigor- ous empirical methods, create a system with direct application in clothing's development and construc- tion processes. Then, maybe even online fashion retail's virtual try-on systems can meaningfully utilise body shape and 3 D Body Scanning.
b2lm | Limitations and further research
ti7f | This paper raises important questions about how ergo- nomists, garment construction practitioners, and researchers categorises body forms and how the field must consider body shape in the future.
oksu | While we prove that slight differences in measure- ment placement definition lead to different shape classifications of the same body, our investigation is limited to the FFIT and its relevant measurements. Exploring a more comprehensive range of body cat- egorisation systems with a broader range of alterna- tive measurement definitions will determine the generalisability of our findings outside of the FFIT.
wtow | Our research does not develop a new - more appropriate - body shape classification system. We, instead, set out clear arguments for any development in body shape classification to include unequivocal measurement definitions, apply to garmentʼs construction practices, and include the body's add- itional regions aligning to contemporary ISO stand- ards. Our work with FFIT has inspired the need for empirical investigation to define those shapes' measurements, algorithm, and classification needs. To propose a system without such rigour would be inappropriate.
o22k | Future classification systems must provide a higher degree of specificity with a lower degree of alternative interpretation for measurement location and collection compared to the FFIT. Such work must use sophisti- cated computational analysis that may have been unavailable to Simmons, Istook, and Devarajan (2004a; 2004b) - who used elementary logic. Our results have begun this process by showing such a new body shape classification system should include shoulder circumferences. Nevertheless, more complex additional measurements than the FFIT, and this paper, considers - such as pitch, slope length, and front-to-back depth - may lead to more appropriate body classifications for ergonomists, garment construction practitioners, and researchers to work with a higher level of preci- sion. Other body anthropology, such as the breast, should be included as body classification has, historic- ally, focussed on the female form.
