As adults, even though we seek regular and consistent proximity to our partner, we can tolerate much longer periods of separation from our partners by employing mental representations of them to help give us an understanding of why we are apart (e.g., \"I know my partner is at work,\" \"My partner is away on a trip\" or \"I have this weekend with my kids and I'll see my partner\nggbe | in a few days\"). As adults, we are also better equipped than children to leverage positive fantasies about our partner; we can imagine what it will feel like when we're reunited, and we can access a bodily felt sense of their presence, which can offer reassurances of comfort and security when physically apart.\nvefl | Two additional changes in adult attachment compared to parent-child attachment include mutual caregiving and sexuality. As children, caregiving is asymmetrical: a child under secure circumstances receives care from their attachment figures but does not provide it in return. But as adults, caretaking becomes more symmetrical and shared between partners. Sexuality also becomes an integrated part of the attachment and caregiving behavioral systems.\nk6et | A child with a secure attachment style will likely grow up into an adult who feels worthy of love and seeks to create meaningful, healthy relationships with people who are physically and emotionally available. Securely functioning adults are comfortable with intimacy, closeness, and their need or desire for others. They don't fear losing their sense of self or being engulfed by the relationship. For securely attached people, \"dependency\" is not a dirty word, but a fact of life that can be experienced without losing or compromising the self.\nmw5f | Conversely, securely functioning adults are also comfortable with their independence and personal autonomy. They may miss their partners when they're not together, but inside they feel fundamentally alright with themselves when they're alone. They also feel minimal fear of abandonment when temporarily separated from their partner. In other words, securely attached people experience relational object constancy, which is the ability to trust in and maintain an emotional bond with people even during physical or emotional separation.\nm1ik | Object constancy is a developmental milestone where a child is able to understand that their attachment figure is a separate person. This person can love and be there for them, but they can leave the room and, even if they're temporarily out of sight, it doesn't mean they're completely gone. In adulthood, relational object constancy enables us to trust that our connections and bonds with people will endure even if we're apart. People with secure attachment are able to internalize their\naj2w | partners' love, carrying it with them even when they're physically separate, emotionally disconnected or in conflict.\nxhz8 | Another important aspect of secure attachment is that, when distressed, a person can both emotionally regulate on their own, and can also co-regulate and receive support from their partners. People functioning from a securely attached style are better able to take care of their own needs as well as ask their partners to help out. In my psychotherapy practice, I've noticed that more securely attached partners are often better able to set healthy boundaries. They truly say no when they mean no and yes when they mean yes. To me, this is the foundation of true consent.\naqos | Research has also shown that having a secure attachment style as an adult is correlated with higher levels of relationship satisfaction and balance, higher levels of empathy, respect and forgiveness for partners, and higher levels of sexual satisfaction when compared to people who are insecurely attached in their relationships. Additionally, having a secure base with a partner can increase sexploration, a term coined to describe \"the degree to which a person co-constructs a sex-positive, supportive, and safe environment with their partner\". If you've been to one of my talks on attachment, you will have heard me say that secure attachment is the new sexy!\n209y | Statements that someone with a secure attachment style might make:\nyrjp | . I find it easy to make emotional connections with others.\nhzcm | . I enjoy being close with others.\ndz5o | . I am comfortable depending on others and having others depend on me.\nm2rl | . I don't often worry about being abandoned or about someone getting too close to me.\nek0a | . If I am in distress I can easily turn to my attachment figure for comfort and support.\ne4tl | . I am aware and accepting of my partners' strengths and shortcomings, and I treat them with love and respect.\nvoil | . During conflict or disagreement, I am able to take responsibility for my part,\n24g5 | apologize when needed, clear up misunderstandings, apply problem-solving strategies and forgive when needed.\nj1i2 | . I do well with the transition of going from being by myself to then being together with a partner, and I also do well with the transition of going from being together to then being alone again.\n22xo | WHEN ATTACHMENT NEEDS ARE NOT MET\nye4p | So far, I've described the optimal situations for attachment in childhood and then adulthood-but approximately half the time, this ideal is far from achieved, leading to the three different expressions of insecure attachment: avoidant, anxious and disorganized. In general, with these three different insecure styles, regardless of what specific insecure adaptations a child develops, they will go on to have difficulty with certain relational skills and personal capacities. A person with any of the insecure styles will usually struggle with regulating their own emotional states in healthy ways. They may deactivate, suppress or deny their emotions, or they may hyperactivate and inflame their emotions, and be easily taken over by emotional states.\nxdal | We learn how to self-regulate through our connections with our attachment figures. So, if our parents were unable to regulate their own emotions (whether from their current stress levels or their previous unresolved trauma), and therefore couldn't support us in regulating our own emotions, we lost a foundational developmental experience. In the absence of the foundational neuropsychological experience of receiving soothing and emotional regulation from our parents, as adults we then have to learn these difficult developmental tasks on our own. We have to figure out how to identify and articulate our emotional states and then find ways to self-soothe as a healthy response instead of pulling away, shutting down or lashing out in emotional reactivity. We also need to learn how to healthily rely on others and to figure out when it's appropriate to seek support from them to help regulate our emotions.\ni4yy | Children who experienced an insecure attachment environment, regardless of\n3e6g | which style they adopted, can internalize the beliefs that to some degree the world is unsafe and people cannot truly be relied on. These children will also struggle with having a sturdy relational object constancy. Since relational object constancy is the ability to trust that your connection and bond with someone will persist beyond an initial separation or conflict, as an adult, having a compromised relational object constancy can make it extremely difficult to get through the disappointments, uncertainties, healthy conflicts, and natural ebbs and flows that adult romantic relationships inevitably produce. Research also demonstrates that people with insecure attachment styles in adulthood struggle with relationship satisfaction. They find it hard to trust their partners, forgive them and respond intentionally instead of reacting out of habit. They also face challenges when it comes to commitment, whether they tend to commit too soon or not commit at all.\np9wt | A Caveat to the Attachment Styles\nbg6v | Before you read the next section, which describes the three different insecure styles, there are several important points that I'd like for you to keep in mind.\n```",
