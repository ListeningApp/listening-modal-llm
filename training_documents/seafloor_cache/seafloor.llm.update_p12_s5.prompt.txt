You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

yfum | Site C is a large volcanic cinder cone, rising to ~70 m above the seafloor and with a diameter of ~120 x 90 m (Figs. 2, 5C, D). Chimney complexes and mounds occur on the flank of this cone in the vicinity of a circular slump feature. TKAD032 intercepted unconsolidated volcaniclastic cover material to 1.8 m, followed by intensely altered volcaniclastic breccia to 6.9 m b.s.f. (App. Fig. A12). The altered sequence consists of monomict lapillistone with subrounded to subangular vesic- ular clasts but variable clay alteration. The uppermost lapil- listone is matrix supported with variable sulfate cement and veins and disseminated pyrite, sphalerite, and chalcopyrite (decreasing downhole). Several horizons are clast supported (up to 60% clasts), with angular monomict clasts, and appear to be autobreccias. One gypsum-rich interval occurs at 6.4 to 6.6 m b.s.f. TKAD033 was drilled at the edge of a small crater or collapse feature near the summit of the cone. The recov- ered rock types are similar to those in TKAD032, with a tran- sition between the volcaniclastic cover and the clay-altered footwall occurring at 1.1 m b.s.f. (App. Fig. A13). Variable alteration intensity gives this rock a polymict appearance.
ppx4 | Site D is an irregularly shaped topographic high, ~70 × 80 m in diameter, in the saddle between two cinder cones (Figs. 2, 5C, D). Chimneys occur on the north flank, where there is local venting of milky fluids from fractures near the base of the chimneys. On the northern side of the chimney cluster, TKAD017 intersected unconsolidated volcaniclas- tic cover material to ~1.4 m, separated from an interval of chimney talus by a layer of oxidized mud and chimney frag- ments (App. Fig. A14). The chimney talus extends to a depth of 5.2 m b.s.f. but is interrupted by a second layer of oxidized mud at depths of 2.6 to 3.3 m b.s.f. The altered footwall com- prises subrounded, matrix-supported, monomict lapilli-sized clasts with minor disseminated pyrite and patchy anhydrite + gypsum cement that increases downhole to a depth of 7.4 m b.s.f. A few subrounded fragments of chimneys are also found in the footwall. The upper oxidized layer between the cover sequence and the mineralized interval can be traced ~20 m eastward to TKAD030 (App. Fig. A15). The lower oxidized layer was not recovered at TKAD030; instead, a buried sphalerite-rich chimney was intersected. The drilled sphalerite-rich chimney is underlain by chimney talus, which appears to be continuous with material in TKAD017. Altered lapillistone to 5.3 m b.s.f. consists of several beds that are dis- tinguished by changes in grain size and proportion of clasts to matrix and by a higher proportion of sulfate cement. The two oxidized intervals encountered in TKAD017 were also traced 25 m to the south in TKAD031 (App. Fig. A16). The volcaniclastic cover sequence is absent in this drill hole, but
qf11 | a large chalcopyrite- and sphalerite-rich chimney block that likely came from a chimney complex located upslope to the south was drilled. The uppermost layer of chimney talus was similarly encountered here, extending to a similar depth (~5 m b.s.f.). The cover sequence is also absent in TKAD018 to the east. This hole started in oxidized chimney talus that is continuous with the uppermost oxidized interval in the other drill holes (App. Fig. A17). The chimney talus here is only ~0.6 m thick, grading to the clay-altered footwall at 1.2 m b.s.f. The clay-altered lapillistone at this location con- tains a higher proportion of fine-grained material (tuff). In the southeast, TKAD019 encountered only unconsolidated volcaniclastic cover material (to 6.1 m b.s.f.) that accumulated within a topographic low at the periphery of a chimney cluster (App. Fig. A18). Within the thick accumulation of cover mate- rial, there are several distinct intervals of intensely oxidized sediment, which may be continuations with the oxidized lay- ers in the other holes.
8oqt | Site E is on the southernmost cinder cone near several small craters (Figs. 2, 5E). TKAD005 is near an inactive chimney complex on the eastern margin of the northernmost crater; TKAD003 is on a small ridge south of TKAD005, near a scarp that may be a crater wall or slump and adjacent to a site of active venting. Both drill holes recovered moderately sorted, clast-supported, monomict lapillistone with weak grading and intense clay alteration. The matrix consists of anhydrite cement with minor disseminated sphalerite and pyrite that decrease in abundance downhole and are locally oxidized to hematite.
6zah | Site F is located west of the main NS-trending fissure, where chimneys and mounds are aligned in a circular pattern, but con- structional volcanic features are absent (Figs. 2,5F). TKAD007 was drilled next to a site of active venting in a sequence of clast-supported, clay-altered monomict lapillistone character- ized by moderately sorted subangular clasts. The lapillistone is cemented by anhydrite, which increases in abundance down- hole and is locally fracture controlled. The breccia also con- tains minor disseminated pyrite and fracture-controlled patchy iron oxide. A few centimeter-wide pyrite-chalcopyrite veinlets associated with the most intense clay alteration occur at the top of the recovered core. Inactive chimney complexes and mounds surround the area of active venting and appear to be aligned along structural corridors (Fig. 2). TKAD008 is located along one of these NW-SE-trending structures, 102 m south of TKAD007, on a low-relief ridge with numerous inactive chim- ney complexes and mounds. The upper part is matrix-sup- ported lapillistone that grades downhole into a clast-supported lapillistone similar to that in TKAD008. Increasing clast size and angularity and decreasing alteration intensity downhole suggest that this drill hole may be at the periphery of the main hydrothermal upflow zone.
