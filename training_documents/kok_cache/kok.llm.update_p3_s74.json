        "content": "o9sc | However, there are cases where the Kok effect is not always associated with photorespiration. The change in the slope was occasionally observed to be present under high-carbon dioxide conditions, and in C four leaves and under low-oxygen conditions albeit to a smaller extent. Gong et al. reported an even lower R sub D to R sub D K ratio in C four than in C three leaves. Buckley et al. observed a similar extent of change in the slope under both twenty-one percent and two percent oxygen conditions for broad-bean mature leaves. Nevertheless, the Kok effects reported in the early years are mostly associated with the abrupt transition in the slope, whereas the G five minus G M photosynthesis model predicts only a smooth transition.\n121u | Of the possible mechanisms that potentially explain the magnitude of the Kok effect, F sub A C T and Rho sub two are hard to measure accurately by existing equipment, especially at low irradiances along the Kok curve. Also, the pattern of changing R sub D in response to I sub abs is hard to quantify with existing methods. In this study, we will illustrate, using equations one through three, that how R sub four responds to I sub abs would have relevance to the Kok effect and in estimating Phi sub carbon dioxide. We surmise that if the varying Gamma star over C sub C ratio is a major factor accounting for the Kok effect, as stated by Farquhar and Busch, then the magnitude of the Kok effect should be associated with the Gamma star over C sub C ratio, regardless of how the variation of this ratio is created. To this end, we designed an experiment in which we used various oxygen and carbon dioxide concentrations or temperatures to generate varying relative amounts of photorespiration, that is, various Gamma star over C sub C ratios. Based on a modelling analysis of the\nzh03 | experimental data we quantitatively assess: whether the change of Gamma star over C sub C and the decrease of Phi sub two with increasing I sub abs could explain, in part, the Kok effect; if so, what the relative contribution of the two components is in determining the Kok effect; and what the maximum real inhibition of R sub D by light is. We demonstrate that our results help to identify common threads explaining seemingly contradictory findings among previous studies on\n1mvw | R sub D.
