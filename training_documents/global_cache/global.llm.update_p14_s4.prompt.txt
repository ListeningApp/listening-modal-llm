You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

87vz | Heuristically, however, it is helpful to keep perspective and process apart. After all, the approach is much newer than the process; global history as a paradigm is of fairly recent origin, while the processes it studies reach far back into the past. As the two chronologies do not neatly correspond, it is useful to separate them analytically. Moreover, this is a field still very much in the making. For this reason, historians who attempt a global approach need to be self-conscious about methodol- ogy, and the chapters that follow will put the emphasis on this issue. Even if we assume that there is a process somewhere "out
ym66 | there," it is crucial to ponder the methodological challenges of uncovering it, and the implications of our choices.
l0a3 | Promises and limits
u8nw | The global history trend is unlikely to slow down any time soon, and it has already helped to bring about some signifi- cant changes in historical scholarship. One clear indication of this is the fact that the major history journals, such as the American Historical Review and Past & Present, have increas- ingly published work in this new field. No longer merely a niche or sub-discipline, it has become mainstream, extend- ing to both research and teaching. Specialized journals, book series, and conferences have created forums where scholars are encouraged to exchange ideas and discuss research. These forums do not exist merely in parallel to the rest of the disci- pline. They are not exotic. While "world history," the global his- tory of earlier decades, was most often an occupation of estab- lished and generally older historians, today even dissertations may pursue a global agenda. The approach has also influenced teaching, in both specialized seminars and even entire degree curricula. It is also interesting to note that debate over this ap- proach has made its way to very diverse quarters. Environmental and economic historians are as interested in the global his- torical context as are social and cultural historians. Indeed, all aspects of historical scholarship can be subject to a global perspective.
l2v9 | In the light of the interconnectedness of today's world, it is difficult to imagine that this trend might reverse itself. At the same time, there remain many obstacles to overcome. Insti- tutionally, creating space for the new approach may prove an
afbe | arduous process. Even in Western Europe and the United States, it can by no means be taken for granted that the dis- cipline of history, so heavily dominated by the history of the nation, will be receptive to undertakings with a global his- torical scope. And even in settings where global perspectives have garnered general support, they compete with other ap- proaches for funds and faculty positions. A new hire in global history might mean sacrificing a position in medieval history or in some other time-honored field related to the national past. Global history comes at a cost.17
78r8 | The rise of global perspectives is unarguably an important development that helps us move away from a merely partial view of reality. As the relevance of territorial boundaries has been called into question, history has become more complex. In retrospect, some older studies may now appear to us like broad- casts of a football game that show only one of the two teams, to say nothing of other factors, such as the audience, weather conditions, and league ranking. Global history, by contrast, al- lows a wide-angle view of processes that were for a long time undetectable by the knowledge systems of the academy, or were at least considered irrelevant.
320g | In important ways, then, this is a welcome and in some re- spects even liberating development. But as the old adage goes, change has its price. A global history approach is not a panacea or a free pass. Not every research project requires a global per- spective; it is not always the global context that is most central to the issue. Everything is not linked and connected to every- thing else. It would be a mistake, certainly, to regard global history as the only valid approach-either in terms of its his- toriographical perspective or in the reach and density of the entanglements it explores. In every situation, a range of forces are at play, and it is not cross-border, let alone global, processes
tp8g | that are a priori the most important. Many phenomena will continue to be studied in concrete, precisely demarcated con- texts. Likewise, we must not lose sight of those historical ac- tors who were not integrated into extensive networks, lest they fall victim to the current obsession with mobility. That said, it would nonetheless be difficult to turn back and forsake the insights that the global turn has generated.
gxfd | Chapter Title: Global history as a distinct approach
s2v1 | CHAPTER 4 Global history as a distinct approach
jkp9 | The recent trend towards global perspectives is a broad move- ment. As we have seen in the last chapter, a whole range of approaches contribute, each in its own way, to our under- standing of a past viewed outside the framework of the nation- state. Beyond this multiplicity, however, and building on these other variant modes of engaging the world, a more distinct global history approach has begun to emerge. In this chapter, I will introduce a number of characteristic traits that many re- cent forays into the field share. Taken together, they form the methodological core of what global history signifies as an ap- proach. Special emphasis will be given to the notion of global integration, or structured transformations on a global level.
z8tt | We can best understand the features of global history when pitting them against an ideal type-an admittedly oversim- plified portrayal-of the older tradition of world history. We should keep in mind, however, that this juxtaposition of world and global history is a heuristic move. It suggests a clear delin- eation between an older approach and a sophisticated modern approach, while in practice many historians use the two terms interchangeably.
9g22 | The concept of world history has a history that reaches back several centuries. Today, it remains the name of a school
41fx | subject in many countries, generally designating a narrative that encompasses the entire world or that looks comparatively at large geographical regions. World histories thus usually fol- low a macro agenda, typically striving for a full picture of the planet's past-or, as is characteristic in many non-Western countries, they deal with "the rest of the world," with every- thing that happened outside one's own nation. There are also world histories of specific topics: world histories of empire, of state-formation, of courtly encounters, and world histories of sugar, of tea, and of cotton. In most cases, they trace these institutions and goods not only across the planet, but through time as well, sometimes taking the story all the way from an- tiquity to the present.1
7um8 | As their points of departure, macro-perspectives of this sort operate with large-scale comparisons of societies or, more typically, whole civilizations. In most older world histories, interactions and exchange between these enormous building blocks were not ignored, but the main focus was on the dif- ferent trajectories of the civilizations, whose dynamics were primarily depicted as generated from within. These parallel his- tories were then linked by increasing diffusion from centers of power to the periphery. In the modern period, this diffu- sion typically assumed the form of a transfer from the West to "the rest." A Eurocentric bias has thus been a rather com- mon feature of world histories for a long time, as the title of William McNeill's influential book, The Rise of the West, made no attempt to conceal.2
