        "content": "jt0y | The variable Phi sub two as a possible cause for the Kok effect\nqb7o | As with previous reports, Phi decreased with increasing irradiances in all three sets of measurements. Compared with the A versus I sub a l plots, the A versus I sub a b s P two plots had a similar shape (thus, they are not shown), but the obtained B sub one to B sub two ratios were slightly lower than the b sub one to b sub two ratios. As expected, the regression of A against I sub a b s P two yielded consistently lower intercepts, and therefore higher estimates, R sub D one and R sub D two, compared with r sub d one and r sub d two, respectively, confirming the results of earlier studies. For the same reason, the R sub D one to R sub D two ratios were smaller than the r sub d one to r sub d two ratios. There were no consistent trends for absolute values of r sub d one, r sub d two, R sub D one and R sub D two with changing O two or CO two concentrations; but unsurprisingly they increased consistently with increasing temperature.\noae5 | Association of the Kok effect with the variable\ns0fl | Gamma star divided by C sub c. We estimated parameter values of the aforementioned three g sub m modes. The estimate of the m factor for mode three was zero, which means that modes two and three had identical results. To test whether a nonzero m factor influenced the calculated C sub c, we fixed m to zero point three, our recent estimate of this parameter. The three g sub n modes yielded the same goodness of fit with R squared of zero point nine six six. The modeled A by the three modes did not differ essentially. Using the modeled A, we calculated the Gamma star divided by C sub c ratio across irradiance of all the three sets of measurements. The Gamma star divided by C sub c ratios calculated by mode two or three at first very low irradiances were more variable than those given by mode one, but the average Gamma star divided by C sub c ratio along a given A minus I sub i n c curve did not differ much between the three modes. We also used the variable J method of Harley et al to inspect any variation of g sub m and found no evidence g sub m with either C sub i or with I sub i n c or with O two. In the following analysis, we show the results based on the estimate using mode one, as they did not differ much from those using mode two or three.\n43ia | The obtained average Gamma star divided by C sub c ratio varied from zero point zero zero eight to zero point one nine five when O two varied from two percent to fifty percent, from zero point three two two to zero point zero four nine when CO two varied from one hundred to seven hundred micromol per mol, and from zero point zero six six to zero point one one zero when temperature varied from fifteen to thirty-five degrees Celsius. Plotting the b sub one to b sub two ratio or the B sub one to B sub two ratio against the Gamma star divided by C sub c ratio showed linear relationships, and because these linear relations did not differ significantly among the three sets of measurements, the common regression line was obtained, and the intercept of the line at the zero Gamma star divided by C sub c ratio was close to one.\n3g2y | The extents to which the Kok effect was explained by variable Phi sub two and",
