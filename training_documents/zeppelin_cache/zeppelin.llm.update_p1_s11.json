The term supergroup was first applied to Blind Faith in nineteen sixty-nine, made up of Eric Clapton and Ginger Baker of Cream, Steve Winwood of Traffic, and Rick Grech of Family, all of them (especially Cream) with strong histories of record and ticket sales. Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young were another example of the phenomenon (they too debuted in sixty-nine), as David Crosby had emerged from the chart-topping Byrds, Graham Nash from the Hollies with their own string of hits (\"Bus Stop,\" \"Carrie-Anne\"), and Stephen Stills and Neil Young from the Buffalo Springfield (\"For What It's Worth\"). Later the \"supergroup\" label was put to various highly successful bands, but it was most accurately employed as a description of ensembles made up of musicians boasting proven backgrounds in the business: Beck, Bogert and Appice; Emerson, Lake and Palmer; Asia; Damn Yankees; the Traveling Wilburys; and so on.\nb2lm | By some standards, Led Zeppelin was a supergroup, but by most they were not. Jimmy Page, Robert Plant, John Paul Jones, and John Bonham were all full-time working players when they joined forces in nineteen sixty-eight; Page and Jones had established solid reputations as session men, and Page had been a member of the world-touring Yardbirds; Plant had recorded and released songs under the CBS label; and by sixty-eight Bonham was drumming for the rising star Tim Rose as well as catching the ears of other comers such as Joe Cocker and Chris Farlowe. The nineteen sixty-eight Atlantic Records press release that announced the label's signing of Led Zeppelin boasted that the group \"consists of four of the most exciting musicians performing in Britain today,\" portraying Plant as \"one of England's outstanding young\nti7f | Led Zeppelin FAQ\noksu | blues singers\" and claiming that Bonham \"caused a sensation with his drum solos.\" In contrast to previous generations of rock 'n' roll groups, Zeppelin were not a gang of teenage friends who'd worked their way up together playing dances, parties, and clubs in their home town-they were adult veterans signed on into serious performing and recording commitments from the start, and they were expected to deliver.\nwtow | On the other hand, of all the men of Led Zeppelin only Page had been connected to a truly successful act, and it was his link to the Yardbirds that was put front and center in the group's earliest publicity handouts. Though Jones would certainly have continued to have an access to the higher levels of music production and management had Zeppelin not taken off, and though Plant and Bonham might have eventually found their own footings in the British music scene had Page taken on Terry Reid and B. J. Wilson as vocalist and drummer, respectively, none of them would have had the star factor of genuine supergroup recruits. If anything, it was generous of Page and Peter Grant not to extract a Jimmy Page Group or a Jimmy Page and the Mad Dogs out of the defunct Yardbirds, although in the long run the equal billing would give the foursome more credibility. Groomed to be a lucrative project of seasoned experts, Zeppelin nevertheless can't be properly put into the supergroup category. Surviving members have been involved in supergroups, though: Jones in Them Crooked Vultures, alongside Josh Homme of Queens of the Stone Age and Dave Grohl of Nirvana and the Foo Fighters, and Page in the Firm, with Paul Rodgers of Bad Company.\no22k | Have You Heard the News: Led Zeppelin as \"Hype Band\"\nnwfz | Just as Zeppelin's \"supergroup\" status may be confused by Page and Peter Grant's registering their music publishing company as \"Superhype,\" so did the name virtually invite accusations that the band itself was no more than a product of corporate manipulation and capitalist greed. The charge is not without foundation, but neither is the way Led Zeppelin conclusively disproved it.\nnvfy | Following the watershed impact of Sgt. Pepper and the groundbreaking attractions of Cream and the Jimi Hendrix Experience, the record industry of nineteen sixty-eight to sixty-nine had begun to codify some of the market trends observable during the era. Albums could be as lucrative as singles; artists didn't need Top forty hits to draw a steady audience; blues-based, improvisatory electric guitar workouts were followed reverently by college-age fans; sexual, chemical, or other countercultural references in the music and on the record covers could be more and more overt; talking up the \"mind-blowing\" potential of new acts was a valid sales strategy. Atlantic Records took all these into\nmror | But in the Long Run\nzlxc | account when signing Led Zeppelin in nineteen sixty-eight for a trade-headline-grabbing two hundred twenty thousand dollars, a huge amount at the time and a sum few new acts have been granted since. With Cream disbanding and Jimi Hendrix, Iron Butterfly, Fleetwood Mac, the Who, and Vanilla Fudge more than demonstrating the continuing appeal of their heavy rock formula, Zeppelin looked and sounded like a good investment.\nk0bw | From the point of view of many punters, however, and certainly of many of the youthful reviewers writing for US rock magazines like Rolling Stone, Creem, and Crawdaddy, Led Zeppelin seemed to be a calculated ploy-a deliberately packaged band whose sound and style were designed to resemble those of a roster of famous acts, touted in the pseudo-groovy language that was even then creeping into the lexicon of Wall Street, Madison Avenue, and Hollywood. The aforementioned Atlantic press release, ascribed to Bob Rolontz of the label, told of the \"hot new group\" whose \"pulsations\" had caught the ears of \"top English and American rock musicians,\" prompting comparisons \"to the best of Cream and Hendrix.\" \"Led Zeppelin is the eighth British group to be signed by Atlantic during the past twenty-four months,\" the statement closed. \"The others are Cream, Bee Gees, Julie Driscoll-Brian Auger and The Trinity, The Crazy World of Arthur Brown, The Marbles, The Magic Lanterns, and Jimmy James and The Vagabonds.\" Oh yes, the incomparable Marbles and Magic Lanterns. Led Zeppelin's first promotional flyers and zeppelin-shaped giveaway balloons were replete with slogans like \"The Only Way to Fly,\" \"Isn't that a gas!\" and \"Led Zeppelin Two... Now Flying!\"\naq5a | This was all hype-public relations efforts to stimulate interest in a fresh act Atlantic Records had already wagered a lot of money on and which had to earn its keep. Around this time other big entertainment companies had tried to push the countercultural authenticity of their artists or movies and were met with suspicion by the hip youth market. There was MGM's \"Bosstown Sound\" attempts to sell Boston-based bands like Ultimate Spinach, Kangaroo, and Chameleon Church, all of whom flopped; ditto \"now\" Hollywood films like Getting Straight and Zabriskie Point, attempting to cash in on nineteen sixty-seven's blockbusting The Graduate and nineteen sixty-nine's Easy Rider. In this climate, given the kind of promo motifs used to introduce Led Zeppelin to North America, listeners had a right to be skeptical. An early Creem review called the band \"only redone joplinshake heavybody drughendrix,\" while Rolling Stone dismissed the premier Led Zeppelin album as a template taken up in \"the aftermath era of such successful British bluesmen as Cream and John Mayall.\"\nsc5y | Such criticism frustrated the four members of Led Zeppelin, and their intense run of touring and recording between nineteen sixty-nine and nineteen seventy-three may be seen",
