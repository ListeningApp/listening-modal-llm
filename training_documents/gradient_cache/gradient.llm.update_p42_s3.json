        "content": "4khi | Gradient-based learning algorithms can use one of two classes of methods to update the parameters. The first method, dubbed \"batch gradient,\" is the classical one: the gradients are accumulated over the entire training set, and the parameters are updated after the exact gradient has been so computed. In the second method, called \"stochastic gradient,\" a partial, or noisy, gradient is evaluated on the basis of one single training sample (or a small number of samples), and the parameters are updated using this approximate gradient. The training samples can be selected randomly or according to a properly randomized sequence. In the stochastic version the gradient estimates are noisy, but the parameters are updated much more often than with the batch version. An empirical result of considerable practical importance is that on tasks with large, redundant data sets, the stochastic version is considerably faster than the batch version, sometimes by orders of magnitude. Although the reasons for this are not totally understood theoretically, an intuitive explanation can be found in the following extreme example. Let us take an example where the training database is composed of two copies of the same subset. Then accumulating the gradient over the whole set would cause redundant computations to be performed. On the other hand, running Stochastic Gradient once on this training set would amount to performing two complete learning iterations over the small subset. This idea can be generalized to training sets where there exist no precise repetition of the same pattern but where some redundancy is present. In fact stochastic update must be better when there is redundancy, i.e., when a certain level of generalization is expected.\n7fh2 | Many authors have claimed that second-order methods should be used in lieu of gradient descent for Neural Network training. The literature abounds with recommendations for classical second-order methods such as the Gauss-Newton or Levenberg-Marquardt algorithms for quasi-Newton methods such as Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno, limited-storage Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno, or for various versions of the conjugate gradients method. Unfortunately, all of the above methods are unsuitable for training large Neural Networks on large data sets. The Gauss-Newton and Levenberg-Marquardt methods require Order of Number cubed operations per update, where the number is the number of parameters, which makes them impractical for even moderate size networks. Quasi-Newton methods require \"only\" Order of Number squared operations per update, but that still makes them impractical for large networks. Limited-storage Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno's and conjugate gradients require only Order of Number operations per update so they would appear appropriate. Unfortunately, their convergence speed relies on an accurate evaluation of successive \"conjugate descent directions\" which only makes sense in \"batch\" mode. For large data sets, the speed-up brought by these methods over regular batch gradient descent cannot match the enormous speed up brought by the use of\n5isn | stochastic gradient. Several authors have attempted to use conjugate gradient with small batches or batches of increasing sizes, but those attempts have not yet been demonstrated to surpass a carefully tuned stochastic gradient. Our experiments were performed with a stochastic method that scales the parameter axes so as to minimize the eccentricity of the error surface.\n5vry | Owing to the reasons given in Appendix B, we prefer to update the weights after each presentation of a single pattern in accordance with stochastic update methods. The patterns are presented in a constant random order, and the training set is typically repeated twenty times.\n9w33 | Our update algorithm is dubbed the stochastic diagonal Levenberg-Marquardt method where an individual learning rate (step size) is computed for each parameter (weight) before each pass through the training set. These learning rates are computed using the diagonal terms of an estimate of the Gauss-Newton approximation to the Hessian (second derivative) matrix. This algorithm is not believed to bring a tremendous increase in learning speed but it converges reliably without requiring extensive adjustments of the learning parameters. It corrects major ill-conditioning of the loss function that are due to the peculiarities of the network architecture and the training data. The additional cost of using this procedure over standard stochastic gradient descent is negligible.\njohv | At each learning iteration a particular parameter W K is updated according to the following stochastic update rule:\n2olp | Eighteen\nzb7x | W K plus W K minus T H A W K\nuadf | where E P is the instantaneous loss function for pattern P. In convolutional Neural Networks, because of the weight sharing, the partial derivative J E P by O W K is the sum of the partial derivatives with respect to the connections that share the parameter W K\nwuf4 | J E P O W K (i, j) E V K\nlfk1 | O U I J Nineteen\nrwjw | where U I J is the connection weight from unit J to unit I, V K is the set of unit index pairs (I, j) such that the connection between I and J share the parameter W K, i.e.,\niazp | W I J equals W K for all (I, J) in V K Twenty\nksn3 | As stated previously, the step sizes E X are not constant but are function of the second derivative of the loss function along the axis W K\n8xbx | Twenty-one\naod5 | E K equals one over I plus H K K\nayqs | where I is a hand-picked constant and H K K is an estimate of the second derivative of the loss function E with respect to W K. The larger H K K is, the smaller the weight update. The parameter U prevents the step size from becoming too\njnpq | large when the second derivative is small, very much like the \"model-trust\" methods, and the Levenberg-Marquardt methods in nonlinear optimization. The exact formula to compute H K K from the second derivatives with respect to the connection weights is\nr4w4 | H K K equals the sum of (I, j) in V K and (K, L) in V K\nsswz | J U I J by O U K L. Twenty-two.\n0uoj | However, we make three approximations. The first approximation is to drop the off-diagonal terms of the Hessian with respect to the connection weights in twenty-two\n0c89 | Partial squared E\n658v | H K K equals\n4gqa | Twenty-three\nmpgz | the sum of (I, j) in V K\ngf06 | Naturally, the terms Partial squared E by O U squared are the average over the training set of the local second derivatives\n75hv | P equals one through P times Partial squared E P\ntbiu | Partial squared E one Half R\n413q | Twenty-four\n8wkl | Those local second derivatives with respect to connection weights can be computed from local second derivatives with respect to the total input of the downstream unit\nnext | Partial squared E P by Partial squared a i equals Partial squared E P\n3dfm | Twenty-five\nhjmm | where x is the state of units J and Partial squared E P by Partial squared a is the second derivative of the instantaneous loss function with respect to the total input to unit I (denoted a). Interestingly, there is an efficient algorithm to compute those second derivatives which is very similar to the back-propagation procedure used to compute the first derivatives\ns0s6 | k Partial squared E P by partial squared a plus f prime of I with the sum of U N by a E P\ncxx7 | d a equals f prime of a squared summing U K Partial squared E P\nuzqc | Twenty-six\ndqwn | Unfortunately, using those derivatives leads to well-known problems associated with every Newton-like algorithm: these terms can be negative and can cause the gradient algorithm to move uphill instead of downhill. Therefore, our second approximation is a well-known trick called the Gauss-Newton approximation, which guarantees that the second derivative estimates are nonnegative. The Gauss-Newton approximation essentially ignores the nonlinearity of the estimated function (the Neural Network, in our case), but not that of the loss function. The back propagation equation for Gauss-Newton approximations of the second derivatives is\ng58m | Partial squared E P equals f prime of a squared summing U N I K Partial squared E P by partial squared a\nkf9u | Twenty-seven\ntl2g | This is very similar to the formula for back propagating the first derivatives, except that the sigmoid's derivative and the weight values are squared. The right-hand side is a sum of products of nonnegative terms, therefore the left-hand side term is nonnegative.",
