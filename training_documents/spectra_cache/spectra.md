## Spectra of Water Sonoluminescence

The sonoluminescence spectra of water saturated with helium, argon, krypton, and xenon gases were studied in a two hundred twenty to five hundred nanometer interval. Total light power of sonoluminescence and the yield of hydrogen peroxide increased in the order helium less than argon less than krypton less than xenon. The peak position of the hydroxyl radical at three hundred ten nanometers did not depend on the dissolved gas, but in the region two less than three hundred ten nanometers the light emission had maxima at two hundred sixty-two, two hundred sixty-eight, two hundred fifty, and two hundred forty-two nanometers for helium, argon, krypton, and xenon, respectively. The intensity of this part of the spectra increased in the same order. The results show that sonoluminescence is a kind of luminescence, and the source of sonoluminescence is not blackbody radiation or electrical discharge.


## Introduction

Acoustic cavitation in liquids is accompanied by a number of effects, one of which is the light emission-sonoluminescence. This peculiar phenomenon has been the subject of many experimental and theoretical investigations over the past few decades, but it still remains to be poorly understood.

A few hypotheses have been proposed on the mechanism of sonoluminescence and sonochemical reactions. All of them are based on the formation, growth, and implosive collapse of cavitation bubbles as the source of the phenomenon. Noltingk and Neppiras proposed that sonoluminescence arises from blackbody emission of the adiabatic collapsed cavity. Recently, Hiller, studying the spectra of water sonoluminescence from a single nonlinearly pulsating cavitation bubble, suggested sonoluminescence to be blackbody radiation with temperature of heated bubble content of twenty-five thousand kelvin. Atchley found that the temperature inside a collapsed cavity can exceed sixteen thousand two hundred kelvin.

An electrical discharge inside or outside the bubble has been proposed several times for the explanation of sonoluminescence.

Some researchers believed that the generation of a shock wave inside the collapsing bubble is the source of sonoluminescence, and recently it was found experimentally that sonoluminescence arises when the speed of a bubble compression exceeds the speed of sound in the gas. However, the results of Atchley show that it is not necessary, and a speed of one hundred thirty meters per second is enough to produce sonoluminescence from a single nonlinearly pulsating cavitation bubble.

A hot-spot chemiluminescence model is based on the opinion that the emission arises from active species that are formed by high temperature inside the cavitation bubble. Taylor and Jarman proposed that sonoluminescence is partly chemiluminescent in its nature and partly due to emission of heated gas.

Thus, many hypotheses have been proposed, and there is no generally accepted one.

Spectral investigations of sonoluminescence were carried out in several papers. It has been shown that dissolving in liquid gases essentially changes the sonoluminescence intensity and spectra. The spectra of sonoluminescence of water saturated with oxygen, nitrogen, or their mixture are difficult to interpret because of the large number of emitting light particles, which can be formed by the chemical reactions inside the cavitation bubble. On the other hand, the sonoluminescence spectra of noble gas-saturated water were studied insufficiently, and the interpretation of them is not still realized. This work is devoted to the studies of sonoluminescence spectra of water saturated with helium, argon, krypton, and xenon gases. A preliminary report of this work has been published.

The objectives of this paper are to reconsider the possible mechanisms of sonoluminescence and to present the sonoluminescence spectra of noble gas-saturated water and to interpret them. We conclude that sonoluminescence is not a blackbody radiation or electrical discharge and is a kind of luminescence. The changes of sonoluminescence spectra in the order of inert gases from helium to xenon are explained by the difference in noble gas characteristics and the peculiarities of the conditions inside the bubble when sonoluminescence occurs.


## Methods

The details of experimental arrangement and procedure are presented in the previous paper.

Distilled water was sparged with a suitable noble gas for one hour before ultrasonic irradiation and in the course of spectra acquisition in a zero point five liter glass vessel placed in a thermostated water bath. The liquid was continuously rotated through the irradiation cell by using a peristaltic pump. Ultrasonic irradiation of water was carried out at three hundred thirty-seven kilohertz with total absorbed power of ultrasound fifteen point five watts checked calorimetrically. The temperature inside the cell was controlled by a thermistor and maintained at twenty-one plus or minus zero point five degrees Celsius. It was necessary from one to two hours for stabilizing the transducer output and for the liquid-gas system to achieve the equilibrium, as we worked at high enough intensity of ultrasound and with the cavitation field. After that time the spectra were a little modified because of the instability of cavitation field dynamics. To overcome this problem, spectra were collected and averaged from four to ten separate ones.

The ends of irradiation cell were fitted with the piezoceramic transducer and quartz window, respectively. The resulting sonoluminescence passed into a monochromator with the grating twelve hundred rulings per millimeter, which was blazed at two hundred fifty nanometers. The detector was a photomultiplier tube calibrated in two hundred to eight hundred nanometer intervals. The relative response function of the detection system was determined by a thirty watt deuterium lamp with measured spectral irradiance. Total sonoluminescence light power was obtained without a monochromator when the ultrasonic cell was coupled directly with the photomultiplier tube. The resultant output of the photomultiplier was compared with that from a calibrated beta-light source with known spectral irradiance which gave three point seven times ten to the power of nine photons per second in the four hundred to six hundred nanometer interval. We did not use deuterium lamp or beta-light source data for the measurement of the spectral irradiance of sonoluminescence because of the big value of errors in both these cases. So sonoluminescence intensity is given in Figure one in relative units. The total light power of sonoluminescence is listed in Table one.

Spectra were collected with two nanometer increments in the two hundred twenty to five hundred nanometer interval as it is well-known that there are not any particular lines or bands in the region of the wavelengths higher than five hundred nanometers for the sonoluminescence spectra of distilled water. Ten measurements were acquired in each point and averaged. It was necessary around twenty minutes to get one spectrum. Separate spectra were smoothed by a method of successive iterations and averaged by four to ten values.

The noise level was measured and subtracted from the spectra. The signal-to-noise ratio depended on the sonoluminescence intensity and was deteriorated with the decrease of the wavelength. The lower value of signal-to-noise ratio was in the case of helium-saturated water approximately twenty at a maximum three hundred ten nanometers and approximately five at two hundred twenty nanometers. However, a typical value of the signal-to-noise ratio was much higher. For example, for argon-saturated water signal-to-noise ratio was more than one hundred at the maximum and approximately twenty at two hundred twenty nanometers.

The yield of hydrogen peroxide was measured by the potassium-iodine colorimetric procedure after suitable time of irradiation of water in the cell with the inlet and outlet ports locked. These experiments were made simultaneously with total sonoluminescence light power measurements. The initial rates of hydrogen peroxide formation were determined as the slopes of the yield time curves.

The number of photons emitted by the excited hydroxyl radical OH star in the two hundred seventy to three hundred fifty nanometer region was compared with the total quantity of hydroxyl radicals OH which were formed inside the individual cavitation bubble. The initial rates of hydroxyl radical formation @0 OH were calculated as wo OH equals two thousand times H two O two which follows from the balance equation OH plus OH forms H two O two. Thus, we assumed here that the reactions of radicals with hydrogen peroxide or others inside the bubble or in the solution after a bubble collapse are insignificant; at least they do not play a prevailing role in most cases. Actually, it is an overestimation, and this will be shown in the Discussion section. On the other hand, the number of OH star photons is evidently overestimated too because the bands of OH star species emission are superimposed in the two hundred seventy to three hundred fifty nanometer interval with the emission from other particles. Nevertheless, we guess that the OH star divided by OH or, similarly, OH star divided by two times H two O two ratio is an important parameter for studying the mechanism of sonoluminescence and sonochemistry, and the changes of it in the order of noble gases support this assumption.


## Results

The spectra of sonoluminescence from noble gas-saturated water were studied in the papers, but in the work the spectra were not investigated at the wavelengths below two hundred seventy nanometers and in the papers they were not corrected with the spectral response of the detector. So the spectra presented in Figure one have an essentially higher intensity at wavelengths less than three hundred ten nanometers than previous ones. Besides, the spectra of helium-saturated water had not yet been reported, although the attempt to measure it was made in the work; however, the emission was too weak to observe any bands or a continuum.

The peak position of the OH star radical at three hundred ten nanometers does not depend on the dissolved gas, but the emission from excited

H two O star molecule has maxima at two hundred sixty-two, two hundred sixty-eight, two hundred fifty, and two hundred forty-two nanometers for helium, argon, krypton, and xenon, respectively (Figure one). The intensity of this part of the spectra grows in the order prime xenon (Figure one).

The total light power of S L increases in the order prime krypton less than xenon (see Table one) that is in accordance with the previously published results on the sonoluminescence intensity of noble gas-saturated water. The measurements of both hydrogen peroxide and sonoluminescence yields in one work were carried out also by Prudhomme and Guilmart. Calculated from the paper, the ratio of SL intensity to the yield of H two O two grows in the order helium less than neon less than argon less than krypton less than xenon, which agrees with our data: this ratio and also the OH star divided by OH ratio increase with increasing atomic weight of the dissolved gases from zero point two six helium to six point four xenon (see Table one).


## Discussion

There are a few hypotheses explaining the mechanism of sonoluminescence and sonochemical reactions. In principle, they can be divided into two categories: thermal, when the origin of sonoluminescence and chemical-active particles is explained by the thermal heating of a cavitation bubble content, and electrical, due to electrical discharge inside the bubble or in the surrounding liquid. Electrical hypotheses were criticized and rejected, but Margulis proposed a new one, the essence of which is as follows.

The small size bubbles are breaking off from the bigger one that pulsates in a sound field. The neck is formed on the place of detachment, and the electrokinetic xi-potential can concentrate there because of the flow of a charged liquid around this neck. The value of the xi potential is excessively great, so the electrical discharge can occur inside the gas phase at the time of the bubble detachment.

Note that the value of the 5-potential decreases when the concentration of salt in the solution increases. Thus, following reference twenty-two the SL intensity must also decrease in salt solutions. However, experimental results show an opposite dependence: sonoluminescence increases with the growth of salt concentration in salt solutions.

It has been shown recently that the small additives of perfluorocarbon gases C F four and C two F six in the mixture of argon C F four and argon C two F six substantially suppress sonoluminescence. Authors assume that these results are consistent with thermal mechanisms of SL, because these gases have low values of the ratio of specific heats gamma equals c p divided by c as compared with noble gases. Thus, the lower the value of gamma, the lower cavitational temperature and the less the intensity of SL. On the other hand, C F four is known as an efficient gas for plasma chemistry and will support an electrical discharge. Thus, the results are in direct contradiction with electrical discharge hypotheses and support the thermal mechanism for sonochemistry and sonoluminescence.

It was found recently that the SL flash from the synchronously repeating stable SL, which originates from nonlinear motion of a single bubble, occurs in the final stage

Didenko and Pugach of its implosion. Note that the authors of the papers were working at the intensity of ultrasound that is higher than the threshold of instability of the bubble surface, i.e., at conditions where the bubble disruption and the detachment of tiny bubbles from the bigger one seem incredible.

The sonoluminescence spectra of hydrocarbons show no emission lines or bands of charged particles, which is also in disagreement with the electrical discharge hypotheses.

Nevertheless, there are no well-recognized hypotheses about the mechanism of sonoluminescence and sonochemistry, and the debates still continue. To our knowledge, the majority of experimental results can be explained by the thermal hypothesis and its variations. Next we shall try to explain the data obtained in this work with the help of this hypothesis.

Sonoluminescence as Blackbody Radiation. SL occurs at the compression of a cavitation bubble just before the minimum of its size is reached. The velocity of the bubble wall can exceed one hundred thirty meters per second or even around the speed of sound in the gas. The time of SL flash is less than fifty picoseconds, and the number of photons emitted from one flash is around one hundred five. The spectra of SL emitted by a single cavitation bubble have a maximum at approximately two hundred thirty nanometers. The authors of mentioned papers believe that S L is a blackbody radiation with temperature twenty-five thousand or sixteen thousand two hundred kelvin. The decrease of bulk solution temperature from twenty-two to ten degrees Celsius increases a blackbody temperature to fifty thousand kelvin.

Suppose that sonoluminescence is the equilibrium thermal radiation at twenty-five thousand kelvin. Let us estimate the number of photons emitted by a single bubble. The SL flash occurs at the bubble radius R S L approximately equals two point two times ten to the power of negative four centimeters. The density of the bubble content at its minimum size should be around liquid density. Thus, the number of particles inside the bubble N zero at R equals R S L is about N zero approximately equals ten to the power of twelve. The number of particles N i with the energy of epsilon i approximately equals five point four epsilon V, one equals two hundred thirty nanometers, maximum in the spectra, is, in accordance with the Boltzmann distribution, N i approximately equals N zero times exp of negative epsilon i over k T approximately equals seven times ten to the power of ten. The experimentally determined value of N i is equals ten to the power of five. So, at equilibrium temperature of twenty-five thousand kelvin the number of photons emitted by one cavitation bubble must be five orders larger than the experimental value. For N i to be equal to the calculated value, temperature inside the bubble has to be around four thousand to forty-five hundred kelvin. However, in this case according to Wein's rule, the maximum in the spectra has to be situated in the region of seven hundred twenty-five to six hundred forty-four nanometers. Thus, the temperature inside the bubble cannot be so high, twenty-five thousand kelvin or even fifty thousand kelvin, and it is probably around the values estimated in references twenty-eight and twenty-nine.

The calculations of temperature from the experimental data on the broadening of potassium lines or on the rovibrational distribution of the lines in the C two star band gave the values of three thousand three hundred sixty plus minus three hundred thirty and five thousand seventy-five plus minus one hundred fifty-six kelvin, respectively. The temperature inside the bubble is distributed irregularly: its maximum in the center can be five-fold higher than average one. For example, according to reference thirty-one, the liquid temperature around the bubble does not differ essentially from that in the bulk liquid; however, the temperature on the bubble-liquid frontier from the bubble side can be approximately one thousand nine hundred kelvin and in the bubble center


## Spectra of Water Sonoluminescence

At the average temperature inside the bubble of T equals five thousand K, the number of molecules with epsilon i equals ten electron V (the energy of the first stable excited state tilde C one B one of water molecule), N i, is approximately fourteen at T equals eight thousand K N i approximately equals one point seven times ten to the power of five. The number of molecules with epsilon i equals eight point three electron V (the energy of tilde B one A one state), N i, is approximately equals one thousand at T equals five thousand K and N i approximately equals four times ten to the power of five at T equals seven thousand K. Thus, the average temperature inside the bubble at the conditions of references six and seven is, probably, within the five thousand to eight thousand K limits.

The time of SL flash is very short, approximately ten to the negative ten seconds to the twenty-seventh power. Atoms and molecules can take part in ten to the third power collisions in this time. Consequently, the equilibrium can be achieved only for the translational degrees of freedom, partly for dissociation and electronic, rotational, and vibrational transitions. The ionization and ionic recombination processes are far from the equilibrium. Probably, more correctly, one should discuss the "effective" temperature inside the bubble. Hence, we shall mean the effective temperature inside the bubble in discussing the results obtained in this work.

The luminescent nature of SL has been repeatedly proved so the supposition that sonoluminescence has to be blackbody radiation needs additional argumentations. Probably, this conclusion has been made by the authors because they did not detect any lines or bands in the spectra. Actually, SL was obtained from the bubble, which contains air gases and water vapors. These spectra are broadened; the band from the excited hydroxyl radical is not prominent because of the luminescence of the products of the chemical reactions of nitrogen and oxygen atoms and molecules inside the cavitation bubble.

The results of recently published papers on the spectra of SL of organic liquids are in contradiction with the blackbody mechanism. Those spectra show a prominent emission from the excited carbon two radical. The SL spectra of dodecane were studied in the presence of helium, neon, and argon and in the mixture of helium and argon. The data showed that the ratio of the intensity of carbon two emission to the intensity of a continuum does not depend on the thermal conductivity of the dissolved gas. Besides, no bands or lines were detected in those spectra at wavelengths shorter than three hundred nanometers. Thus, one can conclude that the bands at less than two hundred seventy nanometers in the SL spectra of water saturated with noble gases are not the emission of the heated gas. Otherwise, they must be presented in the spectra of the reference. Thus, these bands originate from the emission of water molecules or some particles which contain a water molecule (or the product of its dissociation) with the atoms of noble gases. It is very difficult also to explain with the help of the blackbody mechanism of sonoluminescence the very short time of SL flash and the fact that it is over before the minimum size of a bubble is reached. Thus, the blackbody mechanism of SL is inconsistent with the experimental results.

Interpretation of Spectra. The compression of a cavitation bubble starts slowly, almost isothermally. Vapors are partly condensed, and the evolved heat of condensation is extracted by the thermal conductivity of a liquid. Next, the velocity of a bubble compression increases, and it shrinks almost adiabatically with the continuous growth of temperature and pressure. The kinetic energy of particles inside the bubble also increases. It can be converted into the energy of electronic excitation by means of inelastic collisions.

Water plus M goes to water excited plus M.

where M is the atom of a gas or a water molecule. As a result of reaction one, the singlet-excited water molecules are formed. The supposition on the formation of triplet-excited water molecules is doubtful as the singlet-triplet transitions have a low probability; in addition, they usually need more time greater than ten to the negative third seconds as compared with the singlet-singlet transitions.

equal ten to the negative twelfth to ten to the negative eighth seconds. A small energy of excitation approximately seven point five electron volts can lead to the first singlet-excited state of water molecule, A to the first power B one. This state is repulsive, and the water molecule dissociates into hydrogen atoms and hydroxyl radicals in a quiescent electronic state.

Water excited goes to hydrogen plus hydroxyl X.

At energies of excitation greater than eight point three electron volts, one less than one hundred and fifty nanometers, the B tilde to the first power A one excited state of water molecules is reached. This state is less repulsive, and the dissociation gives the electronic excited radicals.

Hydroxyl excited to two sigma plus: water excited A goes to hydrogen plus hydroxyl X.

Water excited B. Hydrogen plus hydroxyl.

Water X goes to hydrogen plus hydroxyl X.

The yield of water B molecules is less than ten percent, and ninety percent of them dissociate by processes three A, three B, and three C. If the energy transmitted by the collision one is as high as nine point nine electron volts, then water molecules excite on the stable singlet C tilde to the first power B one state. The formed water molecule H two O C tilde can lose the excess energy either through the H two O B tilde state followed by reactions three A to three C or by the light emission at C tilde to A tilde transition.

Sonoluminescence occurs at the final stage of a cavitation bubble compression, with the high pressure inside it. Thus, one can suppose the formation of excimer molecules like open parenthesis M-OH close parenthesis star, M two star, and open parenthesis M.H two O close parenthesis star.

The decomposition of the ArOH star excimer is accompanied by the emission at three hundred ten, three hundred sixteen, and three hundred eighteen nanometers and of ArHO star open parenthesis excimer close parenthesis at three hundred forty nanometers:

Ar plus O H star right arrow ArOH star open parenthesis A r e H O star close parenthesis right arrow right arrow Ar plus O H plus h nu (six)

Thus, these particles can contribute to the light emission of the spectra of water sonoluminescence.

The continuum of the spectra originates from the radiative stabilization of a quasimolecule formed by the reaction

where sharp denotes the vibrational excited complex molecule.

Consider the possible addition to the SL spectra of the excited atoms and molecules of noble gases. The M two star excimers radiate in broad-band emission with the maximum in the ultraviolet field. This maximum shifts to a short-wave region with the decrease in atomic weight of a gas. For example, the maximum is situated at one hundred seventy nanometers for xenon and at one hundred twenty-six nanometers for argon. The bands at one hundred ninety-five nanometers (argon), two hundred twenty nanometers (krypton), and three hundred nanometers (xenon) originate from the reaction of ion-electron recombination like right arrow X star star or X plus plus e minus right arrow X star open parenthesis cubed P one, two close parenthesis thirty-five Such prominent bands in the SL spectra of noble gas-saturated water were not discovered (see Figure one and references). This supports, in our mind, the opinion that electrical phenomena are not major in the mechanism of a cavitation light emission.

The continuum in the near-ultraviolet field with the maximum at two hundred ten nanometers (argon) or two hundred seventy nanometers open parenthesis krypton close parenthesis is formed by the transitions

X two star star equals X two star plus h nu (eight)

Note that the maximum of the emission shifts to a longer wave region with the increase in atomic weight of noble gas. Thus, it is impossible to explain the results of Figure one by reaction eight as we observed an opposite dependence: the maxima in the spectra are shifted to the short-wave field with the increase in atomic weight of noble gas (Figure one).

The lines of noble gas in the spectra of SL were not also discovered before. This can be a consequence of two causes. First, the excitation energy of noble gases is higher than that one of water; thus, the temperature inside the cavitation bubble is not high enough for the formation of excited molecules or atoms of noble gases. Second, water molecules quench effectively the excited states of noble gas atoms.

Thus, the continuum in the spectra is formed by fast transition open parenthesis approximately ten to the power of negative twelve seconds to the power of thirty-two close parenthesis C tilde one B one right arrow right arrow A tilde one B one (reaction four b) and by the recombination (seven). Note that the vibrational excited water molecules can also be formed by reaction one.

It is still not clear what kind of species emits the light at wavelengths below three hundred ten nanometers. Sehgal et al. believe that this emission occurs by the transition

H two O star open parenthesis cubed B one close parenthesis right arrow H two O open parenthesis one A one close parenthesis (nine)

In addition, they write that " ... The short wavelength cutoff at two hundred thirty-five to two hundred forty-five nanometers or one hundred thirteen to one hundred seventeen kilocalories per mole gives the heat of reaction H two O right arrow H plus O H (all in the ground state) at zero Kelvin in good agreement with the thermal value of one hundred nineteen kilocalories per mole". Probably, authors of that paper assumed that the emission originates by two-body collision with the radiative stabilization of the product:

H plus O H right arrow H two O star right arrow H two O plus h nu (ten)

Unfortunately, the details of this reaction are not described. Really, two-body collisions in the conditions of high pressure inside the bubble, when SL originates, have much lower probability than three-body collisions like seven. The formation of triplet-excited water molecule is doubtful. In addition, the excitation energy of the H two O star molecule is seven point one electron volts; consequently, the emission at the transition nine has to be at one greater than one hundred seventy-five nanometers seven point one electron volts, and the shift of the maximum to two hundred eighty nanometers is difficult to explain. Thus, the position of the emission maxima at one less than three hundred nanometers in SL spectra cannot be explained by reactions nine and ten.

The transition from the excited B o r C states of water molecule to the quiescent state has to be accompanied by the vacuum-ultraviolet emission as the excitation energy of these states is approximately eight point three and ten electron volts, respectively. Really, the maximum in the SL spectra of noble gas-saturated water is situated at two hundred sixty-two, two hundred sixty-eight, two hundred fifty, and two hundred forty-two nanometers for He, Ar, Kr, and Xe, respectively, and the intensity of those bands increases in the same order. One could assume that SL is blackbody radiation; then both these experimental observations can easily be explained by the increase of temperatures inside the cavitation bubble in the order from He to Xe followed by the decrease of thermal conductivity in the same order. However, SL is not a blackbody radiation, the band at one less than three hundred nanometers is not formed by the noble gas emission, and a water molecule dissociates at high temperature, giving the excited OH two-two plus radical which emits at three hundred ten nanometers.

Thus, it is impossible to explain the results obtained in this paper with the help of known data on the emission of excited water molecules or excited atoms of the inert gases. We propose that the bonds at less than three hundred nanometers in the spectra of water SL are due to the emission of excimer molecules like H two O star dot M.

It is well-known that noble gases can form complexes with water molecules and their stability increases in the order from argon to xenon. The pressures of dissociation of Ar, Kr, and Xe hydrates at zero degrees Celsius are one hundred five, fourteen point five, and one point four-five atmospheres, respectively. The increase of static pressure promotes the growth of clusters concentration. Thus, one can say that the clusters like m H two O r n M, where m, n equals one, two, three, etc., and M is the atom of a gas, can be formed after bubble collapse and cooling. On the other hand, at the process of bubble collapse, when temperature inside it is increasing, the formation of big clusters seems less probable. So we can only propose that the excimers and clusters like H two O star star Xe and H two O dot Xe can be formed at the conditions of a bubble collapse.

The dissociation energy D e of such van der Waals complexes is not high. For example, D c of Ar H two O molecule is around zero point zero two electron volts. Similar weak bounded complexes exist, and they are described in the literature.

The excimers are formed by three-body collisions:

H two O star plus two M goes to H two O star dot M plus M

This process takes place at short distances between H two O star and M, where the collisional potential is higher or around thermal energy, because only in this case a third particle can remove the excess kinetic energy of H two O and M. The quiescent state for these excimers can be bounded

H two O star star M goes to H two O M plus h v or unbounded

H two O star M goes to H two O plus M plus h v

The distance between H two O star and M will increase in the order of Ar-, Kr-, and Xe-containing excimers following the increase in atomic shell size. Thus, the energy difference between excited and quiescent states will increase, but the wavelength of emission will decrease in the same order, which was detected in the experiments. A similar relationship was revealed in the order of weakly bounded excimers KrXeF star, KrXeCl star, KrXeBr star, and KrXeI star.

Note that the formation of excimers like H two O star dot N two and H two O star dot O two inside the cavitation bubble is also possible as the corresponding clusters exist. Probably, the band discovered around two hundred thirty nanometers originates from these species.

Formed as a result of reaction one, the excited water molecule can react by processes three, four, and eleven or with the unexcited water molecules, the concentration of which inside the cavitation bubble is high enough. In the last case, the energy can transform very effectively, "resonant quenching." In addition, water molecules quench the excited states of hydroxyl radical.

O H excited state plus H two O reacts to form O H ground state plus H two O plus Q.

Thus, the total scheme, simplified of course, of chemical reactions inside the cavitation bubble, which lead to sonoluminescence, in the presence of noble gas can be presented as follows:


## Spectra of Water Sonoluminescence

It is necessary to include also in this scheme reactions five through eight and fourteen. It is seen from scheme fifteen that the rate of luminescence quenching of H two O excited and O H excited species increases with the increase of water molecules concentration. This diminishes the total sonoluminescence light emission and changes the spectra: the intensity of a short-wave part of the spectrum decreases more significantly as the "resonant quenching" is usually more effective. The difference in the spectra of water sonoluminescence at high and low frequency is explained by sonoluminescence quenching.

The proposed scheme may be seen strained. Actually, we did not find in the literature the experimental data on the formation and the emission of H two O excited molecules, although the vibrational excited H two O dot argon van der Waals molecules are described. On the other hand, this proposition can easily explain the observed phenomena.

Following the thermal theory of sonoluminescence and sonochemical reactions, the maximal temperature inside the bubble and, consequently, the yield of excited species must be at the stage of maximal compression, that is, at minimum radius. However, the experimental results show that sonoluminescence is over before minimum radius is reached. This fact cannot be explained by thermal conductivity of the bubble content, as the maximum temperature is not yet achieved, but it can be the consequence of the processes of luminescence quenching. The number of collisions per particle for the time equals ten to the power of negative ten seconds is around one thousand and three, and the concentration of excited species is small. The atoms of inert gas are not effective in the reactions of energy transformation, but it takes only a few collisions for water molecules in these processes. For larger molecules the energy transformation processes are more effective. For example, the sonoluminescence spectra of potassium lines in octanol solutions are much broader than in the water solution, and the lifetime of the excited state of potassium atoms is around zero point zero five picoseconds.

It has been shown recently that the time of sonoluminescence flash decreases from one hundred fifty to fifty picoseconds as the bulk temperature of water increases from ten to twenty two degrees Celsius. This result can be explained by the increase of the rate of sonoluminescence quenching as a consequence of the increase of water vapor concentration inside the bubble with the increase of bulk solution temperature. Actually, the lower the bulk solution temperature, the lower the vapor pressure inside the bubble and the lower the rate of sonoluminescence quenching. In this case the stationary state between the rates of excited species formation and the rates of sonoluminescence quenching is achieved later, closer to the minimal size of a bubble. In addition, the rate of sonoluminescence quenching is lower at bulk solution temperature of ten degrees Celsius, so sonoluminescence diminishes with time not as fast as in the case of the "more vaporous" bubble. Thus, the total sonoluminescence intensity is much higher and the time of sonoluminescence flush is longer at ten degrees Celsius.

Reactions of the Hydrogen Peroxide Formation. Next, we shall consider shortly the chemical reactions inside or outside the cavitation bubble, which produce or destroy hydrogen peroxide.

Hydrogen peroxide is formed by the recombination inside the bubble or in the liquid after the end of bubble compression:

O H plus O H forms H two O two.

The reaction

H plus O H forms H two O.

Seventeen.

can compete with the recombination sixteen as the ratio of the rate constants of the respective reactions k seventeen over k sixteen is approximately four point four four, where k sixteen and k seventeen are the rate constants of reactions sixteen and seventeen, respectively. Note that the excited hydroxyl radicals O H excited can also take part in these reactions. Formed hydrogen peroxide can be destroyed by high temperature inside the bubble.

H two O two forms O H plus O H.

Eighteen.

or by the radicals H and O H.

H plus H two O two forms H two O plus O H.

O H plus H two O two forms H two O plus H O two.

Hydroperoxide radical can recombine, giving hydrogen peroxide H O two plus H O two forms H two O two plus O two.

or react with hydrogen peroxide H O two plus H two O two forms H two O plus O two plus O H.

Twenty-two.

Reactions nineteen to twenty-two in the solution become observable at high enough concentrations of hydrogen peroxide and for a long time of ultrasound exposures. In this case, the yield time dependency deviates from the linear one. We neglected the reactions of hydrogen peroxide destruction in the solution as we were working for a short time of exposures on the linear part of yield time curves. Note also that we took into account only the concentration of O H radicals that avoided recombination.

Following reference forty-five, around eighty percent of original O H radicals recombine by process seventeen. So, the ratio of the total number of original O H radicals to the number of radicals avoiding recombination seventeen should be around five to one. If we assume that O H radicals are formed, basically, by reactions three a to four a, i.e., the number of original O H radicals corresponds to the number of photons emitted by O H excited radicals, then the ratio obtained in this paper of O H excited to O H is approximately five point six. This is the maximum value for that ratio, as we did not consider the processes of sonoluminescence quenching of O H excited radicals.

At high temperatures inside the bubble, the reaction of H atoms with H two O molecule can increase the yield of O H radicals:

H plus H two O forms O H plus H two.

Formation of O H radicals is the destruction of water molecules by reactions one to four. At higher temperatures, reaction twenty-three plays a dominant role and produces an additional quantity of O H radicals. There were considered twenty-one chemical reactions influencing the yield of O H radicals inside the cavitation bubble at the time of its implosion. Unfortunately, the mechanism of the excited species reactions inside the cavitation bubble was not considered in reference forty-seven.

formation of OH radicals is the destruction of water molecules by reactions 1-4. At higher temperatures reaction 23 plays a dominant role and produces an additional quantity of OH radicals.47 There were considered 21 chemical reactions influencing the yield of OH radicals inside the cavitation bubble at the time of its implosion. Unfortunately, the mechanism of the excited species reactions inside the cavitation bubble was not considered in ref 47.

Thus, the mechanism of formation and chemical reactions of excited particles and radicals is very complex, and it can change depending on the conditions inside the bubble at the time of its compression. We did not consider in detail all the possible processes as, first, the mechanism of reactions and the type of the species formed are not clear, and second, the calculation of temperature inside the bubble at high amplitude of its pulsation is complicated.

Effect of Noble Gas Properties. Since the time when it was first discovered by Prudhomme and Guilmart, a number of papers were devoted to the studies of the noble gas properties on the yield of hydrogen peroxide and sonoluminescence. A principal conclusion has been made by Hickling and was confirmed by others researchers, that the major reason of the increase of SL and the yield of hydrogen peroxide is the decrease of thermal conductivity of a gas in the order of noble gases helium, neon, argon, krypton, xenon. As a result of this, the temperature inside almost adiabatically collapsing cavitation bubble increases in the same order.

The solubility of a gas can also have an influence on SL and on the yield of hydrogen peroxide. Actually, the increase of a gas solubility in the order from helium to xenon is accompanied by the growth of the number of emitting light bubbles and, thus, by the increase of SL and the yield of hydrogen peroxide.

However, this cannot explain the changes in SL spectra and in the OH star over OH ratio in the order of noble gases. Following the scheme of equation fifteen, these changes can be the result of SL quenching as a consequence of different vapor/gas ratio inside the cavitation bubble filled by different noble gas. Actually, the increase of gas solubility from helium to xenon promotes the process of a gas diffusion into the bubble as it expands, but the diffusivity of noble gases decreases in the same direction and seems to offset the growth of the bubble. Studying SL from a single nonlinearly pulsating cavitation bubble, the authors found the variation of the SL intensity with time. This can be due to the processes of the gas diffusion inside and outside the bubble. In a cavitation field the processes of rectified diffusion are complicated by the translational motion and coagulation of bubbles. Thus, the effects of a gas solubility on the vapor/gas ratio inside the cavitation bubble need more detailed experimental and theoretical examinations.

The changes of thermal conductivity of gas can also change the vapor/gas ratio inside the bubble. In the stage of a bubble expansion the temperature of liquid-gas interface decreases because of the evaporation of water into the bubble. Thermal diffusivity of the gas contained inside the bubble corrects this deviation from the bulk solution temperature. So, the temperature on the bubble wall adjacent to the gas phase and the vapor pressure inside the bubble will be higher in the case of the gas with higher thermal diffusivity; that is, it will grow in the order from xenon to helium. However, the temperature drop on the bubble-liquid interface is small and becomes significant only at high enough temperatures of a bulk solution. Actually, thermal processes occur at the bubble growth in dynamics, when crispation appears on a bubble surface and the diffusion of a gas inside the bubble can influence the rate of evaporation. Thus,

Didenko and Pugach from this point of view we cannot make any definite conclusion about the vapor-gas ratio inside the bubble at the stage of its expansion.

Thermal conductivity of a gas plays a significant role in the vapor/gas ratio also at the time of the bubble collapse: the higher the thermal conductivity, the smaller the radius and the higher the pressure inside the bubble. Assume that the vapor pressure inside the bubble at the stage of its maximal size is equal for all noble gases, filling the bubble, then at the stage of the minimal bubble size the vapor pressure will increase in the order xenon, krypton, argon, helium-filled vapor-gas cavitation bubble.

Thus, the solubility and the thermal conductivity of noble gas can, in principle, influence the gas/vapor ratio inside the cavitation bubble. However, it is difficult to estimate the significance of these effects at this time.

The results obtained in this work can be simply explained by assuming that the temperature inside cavitation bubbles increases in the order helium, argon, krypton, xenon following the decrease in thermal conductivity. Thus, the yields of SL and hydrogen peroxide also increase in the same order.

The temperature inside the helium-containing bubble is not high enough to produce the large quantity of water molecules in the wacht state, and the A and B states are generally formed. The dissociation of these states is accompanied basically by OH radical formation in a quiescent electronic state (reactions two, three a, and three c). The number of water molecules in the B state is lower than in the A state so the ratio of OH star, OH is small, zero point twenty six.

The growth of temperature inside the bubble promotes the number of water molecules in B and wacht states. As a result, the ratio of OH star, OH and the short-wave part of the spectra of A less than two hundred seventy nanometers increase in the order helium, argon, krypton, xenon.


## Conclusions

Sonoluminescence originates from the thermal heating of the cavitation bubble content at the final stage of its compression. The unexpectedly high velocity of the SL decay cannot be explained by thermal losses. Besides that SL is over before the minimum size of a bubble is achieved, but following to thermal theory the temperature inside the bubble must be maximal at that moment. Thus, SL is not a blackbody radiation and is a form of luminescence. The concentration of excited particles inside the bubble is small, but the density of its content is high, so the processes of luminescence quenching can be very effective and they determine the SL time dependence.

The obtained experimental results can be easily explained by the decrease of thermal conductivity and, consequently, by the increase of temperature inside collapsing cavitation bubble in the order of noble gases from helium to xenon. Correspondingly, the number of water molecules excited on higher electronic states also increases. Thus, the SL intensity, the yield of hydrogen peroxide, and the OH star OH ratio increase in the same order.

It is difficult to estimate quantitatively the processes inside the bubble as the temperature calculations at high amplitude of the bubble pulsations are complicated. In addition, the conditions inside the collapsing cavitation bubble are very peculiar to use directly the results from other fields of physics and chemistry. In this paper an attempt to describe the mechanism of SL was made, which could explain qualitatively the main points of the observed phenomena.
