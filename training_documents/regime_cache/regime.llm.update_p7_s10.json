The generator of the perturbation should also satisfy the next assumption.\ni7n1 | ASSUMPTION four (Stability of smooth functions by the perturbation operator). The generator Script L tilde sub phys of the perturbation is such that Script S is stable by Script L tilde sub phys, and\nm9yn | Script L tilde sub phys star Script S subset Script S sub zero. Assumption four is easily seen to be satisfied for perturbations Script L tilde sub phys of the form F transposed nabla when F has components in Script S, which is assumed here and for the remainder of this work. A simple computation based on integrations by parts shows that Script L tilde sub phys star Script S subset Script S sub zero when Script L tilde sub phys one equals zero. Indeed, for varphi in Script S, using the definition of the\ncg8u | L squared left paren psi sub zero right paren, (two point nine)\n2hsv | integral from Script X Script L tilde sub phys star varphi psi sub zero equals integral from Script X varphi left paren Script L tilde sub phys one right paren psi sub zero equals zero. One function of particular interest in the range of Script L tilde sub phys star is the conjugate response function\n7s7l | (two point ten)\nuwdf | S equals Script L tilde sub phys star one, which we introduce here as it will be useful later. Note that the expression for S comes from the generator Script L tilde sub phys of the perturbation, and not the observable R. Let us emphasize that beyond the case of physical forcings F transposed nabla, Assumption four will be needed for more general operators in Section three.\njjgp | Assumptions one through four are natural for overdamped Langevin and Langevin dynamics, which we present in the next two sections.\ndf4g | Two point one point two. Overdamped Langevin dynamics. One typical dynamics used in molecular dynamics is overdamped Langevin dynamics, which evolves only the positions Q of the system.\nqc2j | Reference dynamics. Mathematically, the overdamped Langevin dynamics corresponds to the following S D E with nondegenerate noise:\nx3oh | beta squared d W t,\nfqvx | (two point eleven) d Q t equals negative gradient V left paren Q t right paren d t plus V\nviae | where beta is greater than zero is proportional to the inverse temperature, and V is a smooth potential. The generator associated with (two point eleven) is given by\np8u9 | (two point twelve) L sub zero equals negative gradient transposed V plus negative A,\n49ky | with L squared X-adjoint\np5wo | C h equals divergence V V plus B A.\n74rp | The dynamics (two point eleven) admits the Gibbs measure with density\noolg | forty four minus two zero negative BV of a, two Z equals one x by x e to the power of negative BV of I d Q less than positive infinity\n3ewf | as its unique invariant probability measure. It can indeed be checked that L sub zero V equals zero, so that yo is a stationary solution to the Fokker-Planck equation. Here and in the remainder of this work, we assume that e to the power of negative B V is an element of L one X. Note that the generator (two point twelve) is self-adjoint on the Hilbert space L squared zero, as L sub zero equals negative B to the power of negative one V star V.\n5iea | Nonequilibrium perturbation. The perturbed overdamped Langevin dynamics corresponding to (two point four) reads\n62l5 | (two point thirteen) d Q f equals negative gradient V of Q plus n F of Q d t plus V beta\nshub | It has generator C n equals L sub zero plus n e phys, where C phys equals F transposed V. Recall that F is assumed to be nongradient, so that in general there is no explicit expression for the invariant probability measure of (two point thirteen) when such a measure exists.\nzjn5 | Remark two point one. One of the only cases where a closed form for y is known is the one-dimensional case for overdamped Langevin dynamics, where the associated Fokker-Planck equation is directly solvable, as discussed for instance in, which generalizes the computations of Section two point five.\nw8ia | Conditions for assumptions to be satisfied. We now discuss the conditions under which Assumptions one through four are satisfied for the perturbed overdamped Langevin dynamics (two point thirteen), which correspond to standard results in the literature.\n4vej | If the space X is compact, then it is trivial to satisfy the Lyapunov condition (two point eight) by choosing K n equals one. In the case of unbounded spaces, a typical choice is K n equals one plus absolute value of Q, with the condition that there exist A greater than zero and B an element of R such that\n8ut1 | (two point fourteen) Q transposed V V of q is greater than or equal to A absolute value of q squared minus B.\n6o35 | Condition (two point fourteen) is satisfied for potentials V of Q that behave as absolute value of q to the power of k for k greater than or equal to two at infinity. This ensures that the dynamics returns to some compact region around the origin.\n8r63 | EXTENDING LINEAR RESPONSE WITH SYNTHETIC FORCINGS\nqze0 | Assumption one can be shown to hold using Lyapunov techniques and a minorization condition. It can thus be shown that the dynamics (two point thirteen) has a unique invariant probability measure with positive density with respect to the Lebesgue measure, and therefore that trajectorial ergodicity holds.\no3m2 | Assumptions two and three hold under some conditions on the potential V, which include (two point fourteen); see for a precise discussion.\n```",
