You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

sr40 | Dear Sir,
5zjj | On behalf of Convocation, I submit the petition attached hereto on matters that have been brought to the attention of the Board of Convocation from members of Convocation. The issues have the potential to threaten the harmony, morale and integrity of the university system and therefore deserve urgent attention.
f56l | The following are the major issues in the petition:
ar2z | (a) Wrongful withdrawal of the promotion of a senior member whereas other unmeritorious promotions have been allowed to stay;
yad0 | (b) Undue delay, seeming abuse of process and unfairness in the promotion of some senior members of the University;
3g38 | (c) Breach and selective application of the criteria for appointment and promotion of some senior members;
vtbo | (d) Unilateral appointment to positions that do not exist and without recourse to the Statutes and practices/convention in the University;
q8pa | (e) Unfair and wrongful interpretation and application of a committee's recommendation to override the Criteria for Appointments and Promotions of Senior Members;
uc9x | (f) Unexplained delays in the promotion of Clinicians at the School of Medical Sciences.
zy7o | Please find the details in the attached petition. It is our expectation that the petition would be given the attention and urgency it deserves to restore calm and defuse the simmering tension in the University.
kcar | We should be grateful to receive responses from the University Management within fourteen days to inform our next line of action.
00aw | UNIVERSITY OF CAPE COAST
351p | CONVOCATION OF UNIVERSITY OF CAPE COAST
zzcb | PETITION FROM THE BOARD OF CONVOCATION ON APPOINTMENTS, PROMOTIONS AND RELATED ISSUES
mxnx | INTRODUCTION
11k8 | This petition is anchored on the powers conferred on Convocation of the University of Cape Coast by statute. 39.2 (a and b) of the University of Cape Coast Statutes, 2016.
twwy | It is the outcome of the work of a four-member special committee constituted by the Board of Convocation to investigate and seek clarifications from University Management on individual petitions on promotion and related matters received by the Board.
fyp8 | The impetus to form the Committee came from a groundswell of complaints regarding promotions, appointments and interpretation of the University's policies. The following are some of the complaints:
z994 | a) Promotion of some faculty members delays unduly. The undue delays have created serious tension in the University and disaffection among many colleagues.
vvqn | b) Faculty members of the School of Medical Sciences of the College of Health and Allied Sciences seem to be suffering from promotion-related issues. Most of them, especially Clinicians, are demotivated to work beyond their core mandate. They are not putting in their maximum effort to continue to enhance teaching and especially research, and also perform their affiliate duties at the teaching hospitals as it used to be.
p6xg | c) Promotion of scholars who have contributed to the University's THE ranking and grooming of the Medical School to be number one in Ghana are, on the contrary, treated with disdain, particularly with regard to consideration of their promotion documents.
bppc | d) The established norm on appointment based on seniority and experience has not been adhered to recently.
ilnw | e) The criteria for appointments and promotions has been observed to be applied selectively.
f3rc | f) Misinterpretation of Statutes and policies by Management and Boards has become a commonplace in the University.
d7bx | g) There are communication lapses in promotion/appointment decisions
gx97 | APPROACH USED BY THE COMMITTEE
ppkp | The Special Committee consulted some key stakeholders in the University, including some members of Convocation and also relied on documents received from colleagues. Some of the stakeholders consulted included the Provost of the College of Health and Allied Sciences as well as the Dean, Vice-Dean and Faculty Officer of the School of Medical Sciences.
8br6 | Documents consulted by the Committee included the University of Cape Coast Statutes (the current Statutes and its predecessors, i.e. 2012, 2003); Report of the Prof. Yankson's Committee on Grievances of UTAG UCC and other documents.
de3k | ISSUES RAISED DURING THE INTERACTIONS
2kb3 | It was admitted that some individuals and Departments are the cause of delay in processing of promotion documents. The Faculty Members of the School of Medical Sciences, however, raised the following concerns regarding delays in processing of their promotion documents:
lqcx | 1. The time it takes to receive updates on assessment outcomes is too long; in some instances it has taken three to five years.
3h7w | 2. There are ambiguities in communication to applicants regarding assessment results. An example of such communication is; "Two reports received to submit two new assessors", even when the names of assessors have been re-submitted countless times.
th5p | 3. There are unexplained delays and lack of clarity on some decisions taken on the promotion of some colleagues at the Appointments and Promotions Board.
b7nk | 4. The requirement for acquisition of terminal degrees before some colleagues are considered for promotion to a higher rank is unfair and a demotivation to Clinicians in the School, particularly those with Fellowship qualifications who have contributed immensely to the University's achievements.
