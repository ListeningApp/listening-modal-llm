You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

me84 | The contours of PHLR as a distinct field are only beginning to emerge. Based on the existing scholarship in the field and the conceptual model we have described, table 1 shows a typology of the principal forms of PHLR studies. In this section, we describe the major methodological approaches relevant to studying each of the paths described.
o56m | Policymaking Studies
slz6 | Studies of policymaking processes are a mainstay of political science and sociology. They explore issues such as the determinants of legislative, administrative, and judicial lawmaking (Law 2005; McDougall 1997; Waters and Moore 1990); lawmaking processes (Rosenberg 1991); and stakeholders' use of law to achieve their goals (McCann 1994). Although in broad terms, the policy process does not vary by topic area, health policymaking has generated a substantial research literature focusing on how generic policymaking processes unfold in a health context. This literature treats policymaking processes as among the legal practices affecting the potential for law to promote health.
90k5 | Advocacy groups have traditionally been crucial instigators of health law, and researchers of "legal mobilization" have studied how advocates have integrated legislation and litigation into their strategies (Ashe et al. 2003; Mamudu and Glantz 2009). The relative advantages of litigation versus legislative approaches have been investigated empiri- cally and debated in public health law (PHL) scholarship ( Jacobson and Soliman 2002; Jacobson and Warner 1999; Parmet and Daynard 2000; Wagenaar 2007), as have the factors influencing legislative outcomes

893y | and the legislative process (Backstrom and Robins 1995; Corrigan et al. 2005). Of particular interest to PHLR are studies examining how re- search evidence influences policymakers (Cochrane Collaboration 2009; Innvaer et al. 2002; Jewell and Bero 2008; Lavis, Oxman, et al. 2008). Other work has looked at the behavior and strategies of policy actors, for example, how they use devices such as preemption and litigation to shift policy battles into forums where they have a greater chance of suc- cess (Jacobson and Wasserman 1999), how community organizations may be brought more effectively into the lawmaking or law enforce- ment process (Markell and Tyler 2008), and how consulting can be used to more effectively translate research knowledge for policymakers (Jacobson, Butterill, and Goering 2005). There has been growing inter- est in the question of how model laws are developed for public health purposes, and whether and under what circumstances model legislation is more likely than other proposals to be enacted (Hartsfield, Moulton, and McKie 2007).
favz | Both quantitative and qualitative methods may be appropriate for policymaking studies. Econometric analysis is useful for examining the extent to which various observable characteristics of a state or local government-such as the political party in control of the legislature and the health status of the population-predict the likelihood that a partic- ular kind of law will pass. For example, researchers have used multivariate regression to examine predictors of state legislative action on childhood obesity (Boehmer et al. 2008; Cawley and Liu 2008). Such research may make important contributions by identifying "friendly" venues for ex- perimentation with new public health law approaches and suggesting strategies for spreading successful policies to other jurisdictions.
7szx | For obtaining a rich understanding of the policymaking process, qual- itative methods are unmatched. Interview methods are commonly and effectively used to understand the factors that lead policymakers to take or fail to take particular actions. Researchers have, for instance, con- ducted interviews with state legislators and their staff to study those factors enabling and inhibiting the passage of obesity prevention laws (Dodson et al. 2009). Content analysis is another useful method of exploring political deliberations that occur "on the record," for exam- ple, legislative hearings and debate concerning particular public health issues or legislation, and the notice-and-comment process of adminis- trative agency rule making. Researchers have used content analysis to explore, for example, the use of evidence and argumentation in debates
hx9e | over workplace smoking legislation (Apollonio and Bero 2009; Bero et al. 2001). Although it may be difficult to generalize the results of qualitative studies across jurisdictions, the high-resolution picture of the policymaking environment that they provide can have great value in formulating strategies for advancing evidence-based public health law.
ywn2 | Mapping Studies
a63r | PHLR includes studies that gather purely legal data for empirical pur- poses: information about the prevalence and distribution of specific laws (Gostin et al. 1996; Hodge et al. 2008), what levels of government have relevant authority (Horlick, Beeler, and Linkins 2001), and variations in the characteristics of the law across jurisdictions and over time (CDC 1999; Chriqui et al. 2008; Shaw et al. 2007; Wells, Williams, and Fields 1989). Methods may include content analysis of legal texts (laws, regulations, court decisions, etc.), qualitative research designed to elicit information from officials and others who are knowledgeable about the state of the law, or a combination of the two approaches (Horlick, Beeler, and Linkins 2001). Although no independent/dependent variable rela- tionship is studied, these studies can be scientific-and therefore fall within the field of PHLR-if they involve the systematic collection and analysis of data using replicable methods.
dqvj | Mapping studies often contribute information that is useful in its own right-state and local policymakers are keen to know what other jurisdictions are doing and what they might consider borrowing or learning from policy experiments in other jurisdictions. Mapping stud- ies, however, are typically an early phase of larger projects designed to evaluate the magnitude and nature of the effects of laws on health. Prop- erly conducted, they provide for the reliable and valid measurement of the key explanatory variable(s) in such studies. Thus, a rigorously con- ducted mapping study follows a systematic review protocol. It specifies a definition of the type of law being investigated, perhaps with explicit inclusion and exclusion criteria; a search methodology that acknowl- edges the strengths and weaknesses of extant databases; and a coding scheme identifying the main features of the laws, such as the population covered and enforcement mechanisms specified (Tremper, Thomas, and Wagenaar 2010). They may also characterize laws according to some overall scale of stringency, scope, or strength through transparent and reproducible means. For example, a recent mapping study of state laws

3c47 | regulating sales of sugar-sweetened beverages in schools coded laws ac- cording to seven substantive features and eight process features and then grouped the laws into "strong," "moderate," and "weak" categories (Mello, Pomeranz, and Moran 2008). We stress that analysis of this kind, though essential to empirical legal research, does not exhaust legal scholarship on laws, eliminate the serious challenges often entailed in interpreting what the law "is," or replace serious discussion of what the law ought to be.
