First people made up various temperature scales like Celsius, where zero was the freezing point of water, and Fahrenheit, where zero is the freezing point of a mixture of water, ice, and ammonium chloride. But researchers discovered that nature had a more fundamental concept of zero temperature: the limit of infinite coolness! This happens as the temperature approaches negative two hundred seventy-three point one five degrees Celsius, or roughly negative four hundred fifty-nine point six seven degrees Fahrenheit. This discovery led Kelvin to propose a shifted version of Celsius where zero is absolute zero. This was originally called 'absolute Celsius', but now it is called the Kelvin scale. This is the scale of temperature I'll always use here. The size of the degrees is a somewhat arbitrary convention, but the zero is not: it's absolute zero.\n0w4e | THE HAGEDORN TEMPERATURE\n0nu4 | If a system has a countable infinity of states N equals one, two, three, etc. with energies E sub N, the Boltzmann distribution\n0x8p | P sub N equals the fraction with exp left parenthesis negative E sub N over k T right parenthesis in the numerator and the sum from N equals one to infinity exp left parenthesis negative E sub N over k T right parenthesis in the denominator is either:\na8ov | One, defined for all\n32hh | Zero less than T less than positive infinity. Two, undefined for all\n0ow0 | Zero less than T less than positive infinity. Three, defined for all zero less than T less than T sub H but not for T sub H less than T less than positive infinity, where T sub H is some temperature called the Hagedorn temperature.\ny0lw | We've been discussing systems with finitely many states, but many physical systems have a countable infinity of states. So let's think a bit about those. We can copy everything we've done so far, but we have to be careful. For thermal equilibrium to be possible at some temperature T, we need the Boltzmann distribution\n8a9n | P sub N equals the fraction with exp left parenthesis negative E sub N over k T right parenthesis in the numerator and the sum from N equals one to infinity exp left parenthesis negative E sub N over k T right parenthesis in the denominator to make sense. But it might not. Sometimes the sum fails to converge! This happens when the terms exp left parenthesis negative E sub N over k T right parenthesis don't go to zero fast enough as\nkyih | N approaches positive infinity. Let's investigate this issue. We'll assume that\nzvx5 | The sum from N equals one to infinity exp left parenthesis negative E sub N over k T right parenthesis converges for some T greater than zero. Then the energies E sub N must be bounded below: otherwise the terms exp left parenthesis negative E sub N over k T right parenthesis will get bigger and bigger. Furthermore for any E in the real numbers there can be at most finitely many E sub N less than E: otherwise we'd be adding up infinitely many terms greater than exp left parenthesis negative E over k T right parenthesis. As a result, we can reorder the states so their energies are nondecreasing:\naok4 | E sub one less than or equal to E sub two less than or equal to E sub three less than or equal to dot dot dot and\nomvu | E sub N approaches positive infinity. Reordering a sum can't change its convergence or value if fits gamma s a sum of nonnegative numbers, like the sum we have here. So we might as well assume we've listed the energies in nondecreasing order as above. Then there are two cases:\ne271 | One. The energies E sub N approach positive infinity so fast that the sum from N equals one to infinity exp left parenthesis negative E sub N over k T right parenthesis converges for all zero less than T less than positive infinity. Then our system can be in thermal equilibrium at any finite positive temperature. This is the nicest situation, and the one we typically expect.\nlmdg | Two. The energies E sub N approach positive infinity slowly enough that the sum from N equals one to infinity exp left parenthesis negative E sub N over k T right parenthesis converges when T is small enough, but not otherwise. In this case there is some temperature T sub H, called the Hagedorn temperature, such that our system can be in thermal equilibrium at positive temperatures T below T sub H, but not above\n5gqf | T sub H. In both cases, the sum from N equals one to infinity exp left parenthesis negative E sub N over k T right parenthesis diverges for all negative infinity less than or equal to T less than zero and T equals positive infinity. So, for a system with a countable infinity of states, if thermal equilibrium exists for some positive temperature, it cannot exist for negative or infinite temperatures.\nyg2b | The second case is weird and interesting. It's named after Rolf Hagedorn, who in nineteen sixty-four noticed that this was a possibility in nuclear physics. He considered a model of nuclear matter where the energies E sub N approach positive infinity in a roughly logarithmic way. As you heat it, its expected energy keeps increasing, but its temperature can never exceed T sub H. This model turned out to be incorrect, but it's interesting anyway.\nkftl | Now let's solve some puzzles on systems with a countable infinity of states. Some of these show up in quantum mechanics, but you don't need to know quantum mechanics to do these puzzles.\nwulb | Puzzle twenty-seven. Show that for a system with a countable infinity of states, if thermal equilibrium is possible for some negative temperature, it is impossible for positive or infinite temperatures.\n```",
