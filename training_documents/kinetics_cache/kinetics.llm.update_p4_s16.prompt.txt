You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

q5eu | We show the robustness of the inference in the cases of positive, negative, and non-feedbacks, respectively (Supple- mentary Figure S4-S6). To explore the robustness of the cell numbers to the inference, we select different sampled cell numbers (200, 300, 500, 1000, 5000) to synthesize data 50 times, and at each time, set 30 different initial points for optimization in each case of feedback forms. The optimiza- tion process is the same as the inference process of real data. The same process is used to explore the effects of stochastic losses of mRNA molecules (sensitivity), missing randomly at a certain probability (0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7 or 0.9) from suf- ficient samples (number = 2000). The results of inference robustness analysis are illustrated with two different distri- bution examples in the three cases of feedback forms (Sup- plementary Figure S4-S6).
a7ao | Inference evaluation
29a3 | To assess whether the observed data came from the distribu- tion generated via the parameters inferred by our method, we use goodness-of-fit statistics that obey chi-square distri- bution of large samples:
sb1e | <LATEX>\mathcal{X} ^ { 2 } = \sum _ { k = 0 } ^ { \infty } \frac { \left( O _ { k } - E _ { k } \right) ^ { 2 } } { E _ { k } } ,</LATEX> (17)
w2yn | where <LATEX>O _ { k }</LATEX> is the observed sample number whose mRNA number is <LATEX>k ,</LATEX> and <LATEX>E _ { k }</LATEX> is the expected sample number. Note that in some sequencing techniques, the cell samples of scRNA-seq data are not large enough, so it is needed to use the Monte Carlo method to generate the null distribution of chi-square goodness-of-fit test instead of the asymptotic distribution. For each gene, we first generate the same num- ber of samples as that in the observed data from the prob- ability of each point with the inferred parameters and then compute the <LATEX>\mathcal{X} _ { s i m } ^ { 2 }</LATEX> statistic according to Equation (17). After repeating the Monte Carlo simulation procedure for 1000 times, we judge whether the resulting inference is a good fit by comparing <LATEX>x _ { o b s } ^ { 2 }</LATEX> with the resulting 1000 <LATEX>\mathcal{X} _ { s i m } ^ { 2 } .</LATEX> The crite- rion that an inferred parameter is a good fit is that the <LATEX>x _ { o b s } ^ { 2 }</LATEX> is at least less than five percentage numbers of <LATEX>\mathcal{X} _ { s i m } ^ { 2 }</LATEX> (Supple- mentary Figure S7a).
ap6l | Data analysis
iest | scRNA-seq data processing. We utilize the processed scRNA-seq data for 10727 genes of transcriptomes from 224 individual mouse embryonic fibroblasts for each allele <LATEX>\left( C 5 7 \times C A S T \right.</LATEX> (16). In that paper, the quantification of gene transcription is based on the Smart-seq2 scRNA-seq libraries, and UMI counts is used to reduce the amplifica- tion noise. To ensure that the inference process is not hin-
cox8 | dered by low-quality elements of the data as far as pos- sible, we carry out a certain degree of quality control of the original data (from the file: SS3_cast_UMIs_concat.csv and SS3_c57_UMIs_concat.csv). We filter out the genes ex- pressed in less than 50 cells. Also, we filter out the cells ex- pressed in <2000 genes. In addition, we filter out the genes whose overall average expression levels are <2. After these manipulations on each allelic data (C57 × CAST), the genes that meet the conditions are combined to facilitate infer- ences from more adequate samples and give a single-cell ex- pression matrix composed of 2162 genes and 413 cells. This treatment is based on the assumption that the distributions of almost all genes for the CAST and c57 alleles have simi- lar shapes and that the transcriptional dynamic behavior is consistent between alleles for most genes, which is also sup- ported by previous studies (16,53). And, we removed the outlier data with the tail 5% of the distribution. In addi- tion, our method can be also applied to any high-quality non-allelic scRNA-seq data.
ppqi | Identification of promoter motif and TSS distribution. The recognition and coordinates of the promoter motifs (TATA box, Initiator, CCAAT box, GC box) are downloaded from 'the Select/Download Tool' of the EPD New database (54). In order to determine the TSS distribution of mouse embry- onic fibroblasts, MEFs FANTOM5 Cap Analysis of gene expression data is retrieved through the CAGEr R package (55). After normalization and TSS clustering, TSS distribu- tion is defined as 'sharp' if the promoter width is less than 15bp (this length is taken as the median of all genes), and as 'broad' otherwise.
