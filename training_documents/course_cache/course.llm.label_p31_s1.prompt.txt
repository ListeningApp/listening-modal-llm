You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

ym66 | 4. Foraging Niche concept and fitness of animals
l0a3 | · Fitness: Population size, reproductive and survivorship rates
u8nw | · Utilization and Response Curves: Bell-shaped, normal distribution, idealized
l2v9 | · Three Levels: Trophic (what-), Spatial (where-), Temporal (when) to eat
afbe | · According to Joseph Grinnel, an American ecologist, Ecological Niche is defined it as "The ultimate distributional unit of a species"
78r8 | · Grinnel implied that niches do not overlap, but are disjunct. Species display their fundamental niches; hence there is no apparent competition among them.
320g | . Charles S. Elton (1927), a British ecologist, went further by using a more functional view concept, and defined Ecological niche as: "The trophic position of a species in the biotic environment".
tp8g | . Elton viewed the niche as a simplistic subdivision within the traditional trophic grouping as herbivores, carnivores etc., i.e. the mere feeding habits or dietary trait of a species.
gxfd | . George Evelyn Hutchinson (1957), after 30 years, proposed the most comprehensive concept to date
s2v1 | "The n-dimensiona hypervolume or hyperspace of a species"
jkp9 | · The Hutchinsonian concept implies the total range of environmental variables to which a species must be adapted, and under which a species population lives and reproduces indefinitely.
z8tt | . The Hutchinsonian concept therefore involves both habitat and functional aspects
9g22 | · The environmental variables include physical, chemical and biotic parameters
41fx | · These variables can be viewed as a gradient along which species utilize with different intensities, and each gradient is considered as an n-dimensional space. Adding up all these forms the niche hyperspace
7um8 | . The niche can be viewed as an n-sided flexible ball that can take any form in an n-dimensional coordinate system and represents the responses of the species population to all environmental variables.
uow2 | . In multidimensional geometry with n-number of axes, the niche of an organism is graphically depicted, when all relevant environmental variables are included and these are independent of each other
iat7 | · Begon et al. (1986): "The limits, for all important environmental features, within which all individuals of a species can survive, grow and reproduce"
ywwr | . Krebs (1994): "The role or profession of an organism in the environment; its activities and relationships in the community"
0i6j | V A very broad definition comprising all biotic interactions (competition, mutualism etc)
87cq | . Ricklefs (1997): Formal Definition - "The ranges of many conditions and resource qualities within which the organism or species persists" (i.e. perceived as the multi-dimensional space)
0qs3 | v Informal Definition - "The ecological role of a species in the community"
z8f7 | · Polechová & Storch (2008): "Ecological niche indicates the position of a species within an ecosystem, describing both the range of conditions necessary for persistence of species, and its ecological role in the ecosystem
7w7j | . The diversity of definitions illustrates to what extent the niche is perceived as a species or community property: Is the niche created by the species itself, or by its surroundings?
51vd | . Or as a dynamic mutual interaction? Let us examine an example - The Beaver
baj1 | The Niche Concept - Dynamics
n1wo | . The Beaver (Castor Canadensis, C. fiber) creates dams by felling trees across fast-flowing rivers, hence creating a new environment of stagnant water in which they build their nests.
5bq3 | . Hence beavers create their own habitat which is conducive both for itself and for many other organisms - i.e. beavers impact their habitat by virtue of a specialised niche of dam building.
ezla | We can generalise that:
rsbu | . Eco- or Biotic Potential: The full genetic potential of a species population in all ecological matters (Note: Genotype limited; not necessarily expressed in the phenotype).
magd | · Fundamental Niche: Phenotype limited by environmental factors and physical constraints currently shaping the genotype; e.g. the temperature or food type range of an organism.
tb74 | · Realized Niche: Phenotype limited by biotic interactions = competition, predation, parasitism; e.g. the population growth of an organism after predators have reduced it.

ppqi | · If WPC is high then the population consists of mono/oligo-morph generalists (a)
oxou | · If BPC is high then the population consists of poly-morph specialists (b)
495n | (a) Intraspecific: Increased population density (L->H) increases competition among individuals for limited resources (food and space), forcing individuals to search for and adapt to other opportunities = increasing niche width.
awri | (b) Interspecific: Increased competition between species force these to reduce niche overlap or segregate niches by virtue of specialisation = decreasing niche width (narrow niches allow more dense packing of species in communities).
