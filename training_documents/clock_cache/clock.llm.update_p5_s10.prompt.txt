You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021.

b7cq | Deuterium Isotope Effects. Studies of the reaction of deuterated derivatives of 1 with MMO from M. capsulatus (Bath) failed to reveal any intermolecular isotope effect. Both individual and competitive reactions with the undeuterated and trideuterated derivatives yielded values of (KH/KD)obsd of approximately 1.0 and in good agreement with one another, considering the error limits. It is important to note that the ratio of undeuterated and tri- deuterated phenols observed in the competition experiment was 1.1. When combined with the ratio of 0.89 for the undeuterated and dideuterated alcohols la, this result shows that the overall rates of oxidation of the undeuterated and trideuterated substrates were equal. Thus, there was essentially no kinetic discrimination for substrates by the enzyme, and this behavior suggests that C-H bond breaking is not rate-limiting in the overall hydroxylation reaction. Such a result is consistent with some,15,43 but not all,44 previous studies of MMO hydroxylation reactions using deuterated substrates.
0b39 | Given that the overall oxidation rates of 1-do and 1-d3 were the same, the product distributions should be considered in more detail. If oxidation of each of the enantiomers of substrate 1 could have occurred at either the methyl group or the aromatic ring, and if rotation can occur in the active site, then a kinetic isotope effect should have been observed in the oxidations of the undeuterated and trideuterated probes, with substantially more phenol product being formed in the latter case. This result is clearly predicted from the intramolecular kinetic isotope effects that were found (vide infra). That such was not the case reinforces our speculation that products la and 1c arise mainly from different enantiomers of the probe.
qecd | In contrast to the lack of an intermolecular isotope effect, a significant intramolecular isotope effect of approximately 5.1 (statistically corrected) was observed in oxidations of both the mono- and dideuterated probes 1. In each case, the observed isotope effects are equal to the primary kinetic isotope effects (kH/kp) divided by a secondary kinetic isotope effect that results from the fact that in both cases an additional deuterium atom remains bound after oxidation of a C-H bond. The data do not permit an extraction of the secondary kinetic isotope effect, but it is clear that the (KH/KD)obsd ratio signals a substantial C-H bond stretching component in the transition state of the rate-limiting step in the oxidation reaction. The value of (KH/kp)obsd = 5.1 may be compared with the intramolecular isotope effect of 7.8 observed in the oxidation of probe 1 with P. oleovorans mono- oxygenase.25 Recently, a value of kH/kp = 4.2 ± 0.2 was reported for MMO from M. trichosporium OB3b with the substrates (S)- and (R)-[1-2H,1-3H]ethane, in good agreement with the present results.45 Cytochrome P-450 dependent enzymes oxidize a number of substrates with intramolecular isotope effects of 7-14.22 In- tramolecular isotope effects for hydrogen atom abstractions by the reactive tert-butoxy radical studied at temperatures in the vicinity of 25 ℃ range from 1.2 to 5.4, and isotope effects for hydrogen abstractions by less reactive peroxy radicals are greater.46
1o7p | Mechanistic Considerations: Formation of the Dioxygen-Ac- tivated Diiron Center. Scheme II outlines a reasonable working hypothesis for the catalytic mechanism of MMO. Substrate first binds to the complete system, which contains all three protein components. Addition of NADH then effects a two-electron reduction of the hydroxylase from the oxidized Fel"Fell to the fully reduced Fe"Fell form, bypassing the inactive47 Fe"FellI state.7.44 The fully reduced hydroxylase next reacts with dioxygen in a two-electron step to form a diiron(III) peroxide complex which, either itself or upon transformation via two more electron transfer steps at the diiron center, is sufficiently activated to attack the hydrocarbon substrate. The nature of this transformed species, if it exists, is currently unknown, but it could involve a high-valent iron oxo moiety (Scheme III), by analogy with that proposed for cytochrome P-450.17 The second iron atom in the MMO hy- droxylase active site would stabilize such a unit through redox charge delocalization, as shown in Scheme III, in much the same fashion that cytochrome P-450 is thought to facilitate the for- mation of a high-valent iron oxo species through oxidation of the porphyrin ring to a T-cation radical. Alternatively, the internal two-electron transfer step could produce an active site radical (R'), such as the hydroxyl radical or a ligand-based radical involving an amino acid residue, and an iron(IV) center that would again be stabilized by tautomerization and electron transfer involving the other iron atom (Scheme III). Although there is presently no direct evidence for such a radical species in the MMO hy- droxylase active site, the combination of a redox-active metal with a protein-derived radical to effect oxygen-activated redox transformations is known in the related iron enzyme ribonucleotide reductase, 48 in the heme peroxidase prostaglandin H synthase,49
cp13 | and in the copper enzyme galactose oxidase.50 A third possibility is that the diiron(III) peroxide unit itself might be sufficiently activated to carry out the hydroxylation reaction. As depicted in Scheme III, the peroxide ligand might perhaps be coordinated to the diiron(III) unit in an n2,n2 fashion, analogous to the binding mode thought to be important in dicopper enzymes that transport or activate dioxygen, for example, hemocyanin and tyrosinase.51,52 Other modes of peroxide binding to one or both iron atoms are possible, as indicated in Chart II. Several important model studies have provided spectroscopic evidence for the existence of diiron(III) peroxides;53,54 related species,55-57 including a high-valent iron oxo intermediate,58 have been implicated in hydroxylation and ep- oxidation reactions. None has yet been structurally characterized, however.
bgre | Once the activated iron center, whatever it may be, is dis- charged, product is released with concomitant formation of the diiron(III) form of the hydroxylase that enters another cycle in the catalysis (Scheme II). A peroxide shunt, analogous to that found in the P-450 enzyme, has been reported for the M. tri- chosporium OB3b MMO16 and confirmed by us in the present work. As indicated in Scheme II, the use of hydrogen peroxide permits hydroxylation reactions to occur in the absence of the coupling and reductase proteins. Addition of hydrogen peroxide to hydroxylase isolated from the M. capsulatus (Bath) organism, however, displays only 5-10% of the activity measured with the complete, three-protein system.59
