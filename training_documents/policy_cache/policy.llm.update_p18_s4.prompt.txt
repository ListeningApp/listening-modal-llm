You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

bfax | I feel like if I have my laptop with me, it affects how I can encounter my clients, I think that it prohibits good interaction which is crucial in those situations. That, like, then my focus is on what I write and what my fingers are doing and not on what the client says and what facial expressions and gestures they communicate with me. That is the reason I do not use it [laptop] at all. I find it easier to write one or two words in a notebook, and that does not take me away from the interaction. But the laptop in between cuts off the connection with the client. (H10)
f2y8 | An overall agreement was that the street-level workers chose to use IS and its features for the benefit of their clients. They stated, for example, that all the recordings made in the IS should be done for the client and neither for statistical purposes nor for the sake of the IS' operational logic. One crucial feature of the new IS, the structured form for recording, was considered beneficial for statistical purposes but not suitable for recording the individualized situations and needs of the clients. Instead of the structured recording, the street-level workers preferred to use the IS' free text feature, which, from their perspective, better allowed the clients' life situations and needs to be heard:
o7qm | Well, I think that the most important features are the ones with free text where the voice of the client is written, and what he or she talks about their lives within that particular moment. For example, one thing that has been seen problematic within our team is substance abuse. There is 'yes' and there is 'no'. It rarely is either or. If I click 'no', there will be no open space for text to be written, it is just 'no'. And then you must write it down somewhere else that the client has previously used intravenous drugs but has been clean for an year. Or something. That does not always serve its purpose. (H8)
d52l | The street-level workers felt that the IS could also encourage their clients to participate in the service processes to benefit their own wellbeing as well as to increase the transparency of the social services. Client participation was enhanced through a client portal called Maisa, where it was possible for the clients to message street-level workers and to see their own recordings and decisions. From the perspective of the street-level workers using the IS this meant that they needed to be aware of the data visibility and data security issues when making the recordings. In addition, a sensitive and respectful approach towards their clients was called after. Yet, often due to time restrictions, the street-level workers needed to choose ways of using the IS which contradicted the benefit of their clients. For example, individualized recordings were seen important for the clients but not often compatible with their colleagues' data needs as well as too time consuming to do.
qlbb | We work in Family Services unit [ ... ] I criticize that we must do it [the decision] to every family member. Because that takes an awful lot of time, then. [ ... ] I think it's clumsy, there are sometimes seven, even eight children in the family, it really is a terrible [laughs], terrible waste of time. But then again, I couldn't use the same decision text to everyone because all these children are individuals [ ... ] Easily, it
nhsg | feels like doing assembly line work, the child's own personality is not necessarily made visible and it feels wrong, I guess. But this is required, so shortcuts are needed. (H9)
hy0l | The street-level workers stated that the IS needs to be so reliable that their crucial everyday work could be carried out without the need to test the system with the clients. Also, when encountering problems with the technology, support should be provided immediately to ensure that the work tasks, such as decisions, can be done without delays. Reliable and trustworthy IS meant better cooperation and trust in their interaction with clients.
4jmz | Technical, organizational and institutional aspects (affected the implementation process)
b7cq | When it comes to the technical aspects, the street-level workers felt that the IS helped to govern their workload. They described, as a positive development, that the new IS notifies them when their own clients' recordings were incomplete, and that the IS enabled easy access to a holistic image of their workload, those work tasks that need attention as well as data and information of each client.
0b39 | On the other hand, the new IS was seen too complicated. The street-level workers' impression was that the IS had complicated their work practices and they hoped that it could operate on a more simplistic logic, meaning mainly that the IS entailed too many optional ways of completing the same functions. To reduce the complexity of the IS, the street-level workers hoped for example that they could modify the so-called "smart text" options and reduce the choices available in the structured recording function. An overall agreement among the street-level workers was that the terminology used both in the smart text and structured recording functions of the IS should derive from social services instead of healthcare services to reduce the complicatedness and confusion.
qecd | Making the multi-actor collaboration difficult both between the units of the social service organization and especially in multi-organizational settings, the operational logic of the IS, and thus the street-level workers' access to information is dependent on the organizational structure and work role. That is, the rights of using the IS depends on the street-level worker's work unit and their role in it instead of the client or even the individual worker using the IS. This became especially problematic when a street-level worker had multiple roles within the organization(s) and depending on the role at hand,
1o7p | the IS' view, functions and access to client information varied. Technically, changing the role in the IS was seen complicated, frustrating and time-consuming: "Yes, because that just takes time. Like if this was a Formula 1 car, its speed would drop [ ... ] It would be in pit stop." (H6). Although the operational logic of the IS such as access to clients' information depends on organizational structure and the street-level worker's role within the social services, neither the practices of the work nor the needs of their clients were limited to these. Together, the operational logic of the IS as built on the organizational structures and restrictions deriving from law were affecting the access of information and caused delays in everyday work:
cp13 | It doubles the amount of work, like, there [Child Protection unit] already is the information but you don't get to use it [in Family Services unit]. I think that the biggest issue for us is, that the Child Protection unit, that we cannot see their recordings [ ... ] And yes, this is based on the law but of course it disturbs our work a lot. And especially now, it feels like ... There is a new limit of 35 clients [for a one social worker] in Child Protection unit, and it means that many of their current clients will change over to us at the Family Services, and their whole background [data] is there and we do not have any prior information, we do not see any of it, and we still have to continue their work, like, start from the middle. (H9)
bgre | Along with the technical and organizational aspects, the Data Protection Act limits the use of IS in everyday work practices. Indeed, the Finnish law about the data protection, especially in social and healthcare services strongly guides the street-level workers' access to data. The IS' functions allow containing various data about the clients, yet the law restricts its use. Thus, the street-level workers needed to be well aware of which data they have access to, as well as what they can register and who else can access the registered data. Confusion about the rights to access data sometimes led to fear of mistakes. From the perspective of fluent everyday work, overcoming the organizational and role-related boundaries to access client's data can sometimes be well justified, but the law restricts the access. Quite naturally, the street-level workers did not want to risk breaking the law even if they needed the data.
