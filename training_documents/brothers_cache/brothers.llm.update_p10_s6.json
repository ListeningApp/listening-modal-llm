        "content": "bfax | The coming to power of Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed in Ethiopia in April twenty eighteen, at the cost of TPLF dominance over the government, initiated a new approach to formal bilateral relations between Addis Ababa and Asmara. Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed reached out to President Isaias Afwerki of Eritrea and asked for peace between the two brotherly peoples, reassuring him that Ethiopia would respect and implement the Algiers peace agreement and its border demarcation decision. There was no immediate response from Asmara, however. It was not until Ethiopia removed the two most prominent representatives of TPLF control of the Ethiopian 'system' - the army chief of staff Samora Yunis and intelligence head Getachew Assefa - that President Isaias Afwerki was convinced that a genuine shift of power had occurred within the EPRDF government coalition. Thereafter, on the symbolic Martyrs' Day of twenty June twenty eighteen, President Isaias Afwerki commented on the political changes in Ethiopia, stating that the 'end of the TPLF's shenanigans' made a peace process with Ethiopia possible. President Isaias Afwerki's statement underlines the thesis that the war was between the Tigrinya-speaking political elites, and had been converted into an inter-state war. The inter-state border subsequently cemented the schism between the borderlands people created by the war, until subaltern processes driven by the borderlands populations gradually reduced the physical and political division.\nf2y8 | After a brief period of talks, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed travelled to Asmara and met for the first time with President Isaias Afwerki. Together they signed a brief five-point 'Joint Declaration of Peace and Friendship between Eritrea and\no7qm | Ethiopia', stating: \"The state of war between Ethiopia and Eritrea has come to an end. A new era of peace and friendship has been opened'.\nd52l | Immediately after the signing of the friendship declaration in Addis Ababa in July twenty eighteen diplomatic relations and communication lines between the two countries were restored, and soon Ethiopian Airlines commenced regular flights between the two capital cities. Subsequently, on eleven September twenty eighteen, the military trenches were dismantled and President Isaias Afwerki and Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed opened the border crossings on the ground, and Eritreans and Ethiopians in thousands crossed into each other's countries to reconnect with friends and families on the other side who they had not seen for twenty years. Before this official rapprochement, however, there had been a gradual process over several years of people-to-people contact and reconciliation on the ground, ignoring and undermining the formal enmity between the two states and governments and the solidity of the inter-state border.\nqlbb | People-to-people reconciliation during conflict\nnhsg | People-to-people contact and reconciliation between Tigrinya-speakers in Eritrea and Ethiopia has been a continuous subaltern process since two thousand, primarily manifested by Eritreans fleeing their country and seeking refuge in Ethiopia. Over five hundred thousand Eritreans have crossed over to Tigray since the Eritrean political crackdown in September two thousand one, despite the official narrative portraying Ethiopia and Tigrayans as the enemy. Reportedly, and confirmed by all Ethiopian and Eritrean sources consulted over the last eighteen years of research, not one Eritrean refugee has reported harassment or vindictive incidents when seeking protection on the Ethiopian side of the border; all informants confirm they had been well received and offered hospitality by the borderland Tigrayans with whom they first came in contact. The informal and formal reception of Eritrean refugees in Tigray confirms the close affinity between the two peoples. Both Ethiopian and Tigrayan authorities have gone far beyond the requirements in the refugee convention to host and care for their Eritrean brethren.\nhy0l | The Eritrean-Ethiopian Afar regional state border in the south-east has always been much more porous than the Eritrea-Tigray border in the north-west; long stretches are without any military fortification. The Afar, a semi-nomadic pastoral people, are divided between Eritrea, Ethiopia and Djibouti. They consider themselves to be first and foremost Afaris, and hence do not regard state borders as\n4jmz | socially or culturally relevant to their own livelihoods. Consequently, the flow of people across the Afar Eritrea-Ethiopia border has been more prevalent since two thousand one; many Eritrean Afars have moved across to Ethiopia and settled there temporarily until the Eritrean political situation improves. Few Afars register as refugees in Ethiopia, as they are looked upon as integral members of the Ethiopian Afar communities. This can be seen, for instance, in the case that over twenty per cent of employees in the Afar regional state administration of Ethiopia, are allegedly Eritrean Afars.\nb7cq | Hosting refugees, however, is not in itself proof of mutual reconciliation between the peoples living in the two countries. For that to transpire, sustained two-way cross-border social interaction would need to take place.\n0b39 | As in any war or conflict zone, smuggling operations across no man's land were soon established. Early in my research I heard details of petty trade and movement of contraband, although it was impossible to verify the extent. Across the north-west Tigray-Eritrea border, informal small-scale livestock trade occurred on and off, when the villagers managed to avoid the Eritrean border guards. Similarly, the Afars have conducted traditional low-scale trade across their border, also in livestock and possibly some commodities shipped in across the Red Sea. As contraband will flow across any border regardless of the political context, such activities can not necessarily be regarded as instances of 'reconciliation'.\nqecd | The first concrete reconciliatory incidents involving a substantial number of people occurred during the annual Maryam Zion religious festival in Axum, a city in northern Ethiopia. Conducted around thirty November every year, the Maryam Zion festival attracts tens of thousands of Christian Orthodox pilgrims from across Ethiopia and Eritrea. Axum locals informed the research team that, in two thousand nine, Eritreans participating in the religious celebration, later returned to their home villages inside Eritrea. Then, in November two thousand fifteen, several hundred, mostly elderly, Eritreans reportedly flocked to Axum. Tigrayan friends and families there played host to them, before they returned to their home country. The common Christian Orthodox identity in the Eritrean-Ethiopian highlands runs deep, and transcends parochial, ethnic, and national identities, and is, as such, a convenient reconciliation medium.\n1o7p | Life in the 'buffer zone'\ncp13 | The Ethiopian borderlands have been backwaters since two thousand, missing out on the development elsewhere in the country. The border towns and districts have been slowly dying, as the young move to other Ethiopian cities or migrate abroad for\nbgre | better opportunities. As explained by an elderly farmer in the Irob district: 'We have failed them. Our community has failed them. Ethiopia has certainly failed them'.",
