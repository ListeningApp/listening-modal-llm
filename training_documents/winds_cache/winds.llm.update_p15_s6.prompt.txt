You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

nwfz | et al., 2006). The element of predictability of jellyfish strandings may provide beach management authorities to plan for and manage beach use and swimming activity when jellyfish swarms are brought close to shore by tides and onshore winds. This has previously been emphasised by Gershwin et al. (2014) who show how changes in wind patterns can be responsible for onshore transport of cubozoan jellyfish and can be used to predict when irukandji jellyfish stings are most likely to occur. Although our results show tide as a significant predictor of strandings, our results did not reveal wind or modelled current direction as significant predictors. It is possible that for the x2 analyses which relied on wind measurements from satellite made out to sea, we had an insufficient sample size to find an effect because the satellite did not provide any data during 23 of the 58 days over which the strandings occurred. For the logistic regression, we used wind measurements taken at a weather station on land to avoid missing values; however, these data are less relevant to where the jellyfish are located offshore before stranding, and thus, those winds will have less influence on the onshore transport of jellyfish. It is possible that direct measurements of wind and current related to jellyfish occurrence would yield better results than the satellite wind and modelled current data used here. Thus for the purposes of prediction and to be routinely applied, a method of more reliably obtaining current speed and direction and wind direction, from out over the ocean, west of the beach where the jellyfish are swarming, needs to be found. This could be in the form of moored weather stations and current metres. Another factor that could be important in confounding attempts to match stranding events to environmental conditions is that some scyphozoan jellyfish have been shown to exhibit swimming behaviour including prey searching and diel vertical migrations (Hays et al., 2011; Moriarty et al., 2012) which will influence the extent to which ocean conditions and currents will influence onshore directional movement of jellyfish. Moreover, recent novel research (Fossette et al., 2015) using jellyfish tagged with accelerometers has shown how jellyfish can actively orient themselves to swim with or against a tidal current and that this behaviour can act to both maintain swarms and avoid beach strandings.
nvfy | The observations of Marsh & Slack-Smith (2010) and those from our study suggest that C. mastigophora can be seasonally abundant in tropical north-western Australia. However, the observed strandings may
mror | represent a small fraction of those that have occurred due to the remoteness and sparse human population <LATEX>\left( < 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 \right)</LATEX> in this region. The areas where it has been observed to be washed up in large numbers are popular tourist areas and strandings in more remote areas are unlikely to be recorded, especially given our observa- tions of rapid disintegration of stranded jellyfish and their subsequent removal by large tidal ranges in the region. Any link between interannual variability in the timing and scale of observed swarms in relation to ocean climate variability is not evident. The swarm in 2012 coincided with an increase in both water temperature and chlorophyll-a, but it is not possible to say the swarm event is related to either as these are likely to be seasonal events. The large swarms in Broome in the latter months of 2006 and 2012 were during or at the end of El Niño conditions; however, other large swarms observed further south in April 2000 and 2013 were during La Niña conditions; the swarm in April 2007 was during neutral or slight El Niño conditions and the 2010 swarm was neutral but right on the transition between the strong 2009 El Niño and 2010 La Niña conditions.
zlxc | Economic and ecological significance of C. mastigophora swarms
k0bw | Large swarms, especially those that occur over protracted periods such as was the 2012 swarm, result in numerous stings on swimming beaches and also deter swimmers from beaches and from areas where tourism is of great economic importance (e.g., Cable Beach, Broome). Other significant impacts of the swarms have included blocking the water cooling intakes of the power station in Karratha in 1976 (Marsh & Slack-Smith, 2010) (see also ESM Table 1).
aq5a | C. mastigophora is an edible jellyfish species, and a fishery has been established in Indonesia (Java south coast) based on export to Japan (Omori & Nakano, 2001; Kitamura & Omori, 2010). To avoid confusion, it is worth noting here, that Rumpet (1991) provides an excellent description of another sea-east Asian fishery for "red" jellyfish, but it is unlikely that this is <LATEX>C .</LATEX> mastigophora. Rumpet's (1991) report from the South China Sea (Sarawak, Malaysia) almost certainly refers to Rhopilema esculentum Kishinouye 1891 based on the description of fisheries for this species and Rhopilema hispidum (Vanhöffen 1888) (white) else- where in the South China Sea (Vietnam) by Nishikawa
sc5y | et al. (2008). The economic feasibility of a fishery for <LATEX>C .</LATEX> mastigophora has not been evaluated in Australia and maybe worthy of examination especially if swarms continue to have detrimental economic impacts.
