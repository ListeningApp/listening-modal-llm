You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

pt13 | 266 brain(67). DIV13 primary neurons from 20S-FLAG transgenic mice were incubated with
rw3z | 267 unconjugated or PC-conjugated ApoE for 24 hours and then subjected to surface biotinylation.
voc3 | 268 We find that PC-ApoE, and not the unconjugated versions, modify neuroproteasome surface
huha | 269 localization with the rank order PC-ApoE4<Vehicle,PC-ApoE3<PC-ApoE2 (Fig 2D). We find
otjb | 270 no change in other membrane proteins such as GluN1, which has previously been shown not to
1rbe | 27 change in an ApoE isoform-dependent manner(68, 69). The lipoprotein-dependent effect on
z978 | 272 neuroproteasome localization requires ApoE, as the addition of just the liposomes without ApoE 273 does not modify neuroproteasome localization (Fig 2D). We find similar results in primary WT neurons, suggesting that the observed ApoE-isoform dependent effect on localization is not an artifact of the FLAG epitope tag on neuroproteasomes (Fig S2D).

tti3 | 277 FLAG-neuroproteasomes are a useful tool to measure the surface localization of
r4pa | 278 neuroproteasomes and we next took advantage of the epitope tag to test whether ApoE isoforms
ivgr | 279 modified the subcellular distribution and localization of neuroproteasomes in intact neurons. We
vobc | 280 used antibody feeding onto live neuronal cultures from the 20S-FLAG mice transduced with
3rdh | 281 AAVs to express Cre(70, 71). No staining was observed using secondary alone controls (Fig
lbvs | 282 S2E) or when feeding an antibody against intracellular protein MAP2 (Fig S2F). After live cell
2rt2 | 283 anti-FLAG antibody feeding, neurons were fixed, permeabilized, and stained for total
3ld6 | 284 intracellular MAP2 to label dendrites. Consistent with this approach being a robust measure of
1ac5 | 285 neuroproteasome localization (Fig S2G), we observed punctal neuroproteasome localization 286 when feeding anti-FLAG antibodies, of which more than 90% was within 2 um of the MAP2
oau9 | 287 signal. We observe significant overlap of surface FLAG signal with MAP2-positive protrusions that resemble dendritic spines (Fig 2E). We observe that PC-ApoE2 increases neuroproteasome surface localization by nearly twofold and that PC-ApoE4 reduces neuroproteasome surface

3ejg | 290 localization by nearly threefold compared to PC vehicle or PC-ApoE3 controls (Fig 2E). In total,
ehdq | 291 these data recapitulate the observations from the hApoE-KI mice and support our hypothesis that extracellular ApoE isoforms can influence neuroproteasome localization and function.

xrzh | 297 We next tested whether ApoE-dependent mislocalization of neuroproteasomes is observable in 298 postmortem patient tissues. For these analyses, we studied a cohort of 19 individuals (14
b5m5 | 299 ApoE3/3 and 5 ApoE4/4) from the Massachusetts General Hospital Brain Bank. The ApoE3/3
wu5k | 300 subgroup was subdivided into 5 negative diagnoses and 9 positive diagnoses for AD. Sex was
n462 | 301 evenly distributed in samples except for the ApoE4 cases which were all male. This design
7tg4 | 302 allows us to compare the effect of AD on neuroproteasome localization as well as the effect of
5kya | 303 ApoE genotype on neuroproteasome localization. We obtained material from the Brodmann Area
7muy | 305 (BA4 - primary motor area) and BA7 (parietal associative area). We analyzed these regions as a means of untangling how neuroproteasome localization changes in a limited survey of severely pathologically affected (BA7) versus less affected (BA4) regions of the brain. Tissue from BA7
3zl7 | 304
i0sj | 306
slsh | 307 contained severe tangle and amyloid pathology as well as neuronal loss whereas tissue from BA4
ji5o | 308 had moderate amyloid pathology but not tangle accumulation or neuronal loss. For simplicity,
4nlx | 309 we will refer to BA7 as tissue with severe pathology and BA4 as tissue with mild pathology. We
o3xz | 310 fractionated these samples to remove nuclei, mitochondria, and cytosol, enriching for plasma
84mq | 312 membranes and detergent-insoluble proteins. We monitored the success of our fractionation
56tt | 311
chel | using LLVY-based proteasome activity assays out of the supernatant of our washes and
asam | 313 continued washing our plasma membrane preparations until cytosolic proteasomes were undetectable (Fig 3A).

jlbs | 316 We then subjected plasma membrane/aggregate fractions to quantitative TMT proteomics
6aui | 317 analysis. TMT proteomics enables unbiased quantification of the proteome and the ability to
y7r5 | 318 make quantitative comparison across samples. We compensated for brain region and individual
nhpx | 319 variability in two ways: by first normalizing protein loading into the mass spectrometer and then
2yc2 | 320 normalizing the collected data against the total TMT signal per patient sample. This total TMT
eehg | 321 signal normalization provides the highest confidence metric for protein abundance normalization
ght4 | 322 across all samples. Given the number of samples, we combined three TMTpro 16-plex
sx29 | 323 experiments with a shared internal standard which enabled quantitation across TMT experiments.
j7hg | 324 We first performed a series of quality control checks to ensure that these data provided reliable
2c66 | 325 and reproducible measures. First, these data validate our plasma membrane enrichment protocol 326 - we find a significant enrichment for membrane-bound and membrane-associated proteins and a strong depletion of cytosolic proteins, including the 19S cap (Table S2). Second, consistent with previous global proteomic analysis from AD brains, we find a significant increase of C4b(72),
zzrc | 327

ghtz | 329 AnxA1(73), Gpnmb(74), and Tau (Mapt)(75) in AD brains compared to unaffected controls (Fig
72zw | 330 3B). Third, we also find a significant decrease in Vgf(76) and Slc30A3(77) consistent with 331 previous AD global proteomic datasets (Fig 3B). We expect to find aggregated proteins using 332 this protocol since our plasma membrane enrichment method would also isolate large aggregates 333 such as aggregated Tau in the AD brain.
9v2o | 334
fn2s | 335 After validating our approach, we next analyzed the effect of AD on neuroproteasome
rhn0 | 336 localization, measured by the relative quantity of 20S proteasome subunits in our quantitative
pg87 | 337 mass spectrometry dataset. First, in comparing AD samples to cognitively normal controls, we
4r9c | 338 find a striking reduction in nearly every 20S proteasome subunit in the plasma membrane
xbmu | 339 fraction from BA7 tissue (Fig 3B, Table S2). We next sought to determine whether ApoE
rp75 | 340 genotype influenced neuroproteasome localization in human tissue. Given the significant effect
62hx | 341 of AD on neuroproteasome localization, we constrained the analysis only to the effect of ApoE 342 genotype on neuroproteasome localization by comparing the ApoE4/4 AD cohort against the
n5mv | 343 ApoE3/3 AD cohort. We observe a clear trend of reduced 20S proteasome subunits in the
3lem | 344 membrane fraction in the ApoE4 genotype compared to ApoE3 genotype in the BA7 vulnerable 345 brain region (Fig 3C, Table S2).
jm94 | 346
v4s7 | 347 To validate our proteomics data, we monitored surface localization of neuroproteasomes by
j6ud | 348 immunoblot analysis. We controlled for sample loading by normalizing against Kv1.2, a protein
rlh2 | 349 whose expression has been reproducibly demonstrated as unchanged in the AD brain(78-80).
gwtt | 350 While this strategy is required for loading controls by immunoblot, these loading controls line up
gzru | 351 with the normalization strategy for mass spectrometry based on the total amount of TMT signal
