You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

ohh7 | GC analysis of hydroxylation reactions with 2 revealed only a single product, which was identified by comparison to an au- thentic standard as the alcohol 2a. No peaks that might arise from rearranged alcohol 2b or aromatic hydroxylation products were detected. A plot showing the rate of product formation is given in Figure S2.
vbni | Analysis of the extracts from reactions with trans-1,2-di- methylcyclopropane (3) revealed only one product, the concen- tration of which increased linearly with time over a 10-min period (Figure S1). It was identified as the unrearranged alcohol, trans-(2-methylcyclopropyl)methanol (3a), through comparison of its GC retention time with that of an authentic standard. No 4-penten-2-ol (3b) or 2-methylbut-3-en-1-ol (3c) was detected.
dgcw | The substrate bicyclo[2.1.0]pentane (4) afforded three products upon reaction with MMO (Figure S3), each of which had its parent ion at m/z 84 as determined by GC/MS analysis. No authentic standards were available for the expected products, but one product could be positively identified as endo-2-hydroxy- bicyclo[2.1.0]pentane (4a) by comparison of its mass spectrum with one published previously.2! The second major peak in the gas chromatogram was assigned as exo-2-hydroxybicyclo- [2.1.0]pentane (4b). Unfortunately no mass spectral data for this compound were available for comparison. The peak had ap- proximately the same intensity (~85%) in the total-ion chro- matogram of the reaction extracts as that of 4a. Its mass spectrum differed from those of 4a and 3-cyclopenten-1-ol (4c), for which mass spectral data are also available.39 Hydroxylation of 4 by cytochrome P-450 yielded only 4a and 4c.21,22 The failure of this enzyme to afford 4b was attributed to constraints at the active site. It may be that the active site of MMO is less discriminating, which could account for the formation of both 4a and 4b.
gvwz | The third product from reactions with 4 was present in only trace amounts and was assigned as 3-cyclopenten-1-ol (4c). It has been reported previously that 4a undergoes thermal rear- rangement to 4c.21,22 In particular, when 4a isolated from the hydroxylation of 4 by MMO was injected into the GC/MS, the ratio of 4c to 4a was found to be ~1:30. Compound 4b is expected to behave similarly. The intensity of the peak corresponding to 4c was also found to increase relative to those for 4a and 4b when the reactions were run at 45 ℃ for longer times (Figure S3). Increasing the injector and oven temperatures of the gas chro- matograph produced a similar effect. The ratio of 4c to 4a was 1:40, or including both 4a and 4b, 1:80, and increased with longer

qws8 | incubation times at 45 ℃ to about 1:15. It is therefore likely that a significant amount, if not all, of 4c obtained in these experiments is due to thermal rearrangement of 4a and 4b. The amount of 4c present in the enzymatic reactions is small enough that its presence could be solely the result of thermal rear- rangement of 4a and 4b.21
877u | Experiments were also carried out with 1 and the hydroxylase from M. trichosporium OB3b. In contrast to reactions with MMO from M. capsulatus (Bath), three products were observed. They were identified as unrearranged alcohol la, 2-(p-hydroxy- phenyl)methylcyclopropane (1c), and rearranged product 1b. The ratio of unrearranged to rearranged alcohol was found to be 32:1 in reactions performed with coupling protein and reductase from M. capsulatus (Bath) and 22:1 for reactions using hydrogen peroxide.

bfax | Analysis of Products Formed. In this work, four hydrocarbon substrates were employed as mechanistic probes in oxidations catalyzed by the MMO of M. capsulatus (Bath). In each case, if a hydrogen atom were abstracted from the probe, the resulting radical could either rebound to form the unrearranged product or ring open to afford the rearranged product (Scheme I). In no case was rearrangement observed. For trans-1,2-dimethylcyclo- propane (3) only a single product formed, corresponding to the unrearranged alcohol (3a, eq 2). No allylic alcohol was detected

From the known rate constant for rearrangement of the corresponding cyclopropylcarbinyl radical (Table I),23 and assuming that this rate constant is the same for substrate free in solution and bound to the enzyme (vide infra), we estimate that the rebound rate constant of a radical inter- mediate would have to be at least 4 × 1010 s-1 at 45 ℃. A similar analysis23,40-42 of the results for reactions with compounds 4, 1, and 2 raises the rebound rate constant limits to 3 × 1011, 4 x 1013, and 1 X 1013 s-1, respectively. The latter two values exceed the rate constant of decomposition of a transition state and are in- compatible with a discrete radical intermediate.

nhsg | openings have rate constants of 3 × 1011 s-1 and 5 × 1011 s-1, respectively, which places these reactions among the fastest re- ported radical rearrangements involving a bond-breaking step. With such a velocity, detectable amounts of ring-opened products are expected to be produced from these radicals even when the fastest possible trapping reactions compete. Therefore, the absence of ring-opened alcohols 1b and 2b suggests that probes 1 and 2 were converted directly to alcohols la and 2a without formation of radicals. On the other hand, a small amount of rearranged product 1b was observed in the studies of MMO from M. tri-
hy0l | chosporium OB3b. From the ratio of unrearranged to rearranged alcohol the rate constant for rebound was calculated to be 6-10 X 1012 s-1. The observed differences in the results for MMO from the two different sources will be discussed later.
4jmz | In the case of the chiral substrate probe 1, oxidation occurred not only at the methyl group but also at the phenyl ring to form 2-(p-hydroxyphenyl)methylcyclopropane (1c) (Table I).38 The fact that la and 1c are produced in equal quantities over the course of the reaction suggested that the two products might arise from different enantiomers of the probe. Preliminary studies with partially resolved 1 tend to confirm this possibility (unpublished results), but more data are required for the hydroxylation of both pure enantiomers before a definitive statement can be made.
