Undo, Redo, and Reset any changes that you have made. For instance, if you have filtered your workbook and want to revert to the original state, just click on the Reset button.\n95fm | Two. Share your work in the following way:\ni5qs | ° You can share the Current View, which includes filter conditions or parameter selections. Alternatively, you can share the Original View.\n26wo | ° Embed Code allows you to copy an automatically generated block of H T M L that you can use to embed the visualization on another web page. This code identifies the viewing attributes of your workbook, such as whether the toolbars are showing, the height and width of the workbook, and its title. For instance, if you want to embed the dashboard on your blog, you just need to copy the code. Then, in the management console of your blog, either insert the code directly, or create and then insert a snippet of H T M L. If you have the capabilities, you can utilize Tableau Public's JavaScript A P I to embed the visualization in a webpage and then allow users to interact with it through web objects that are native to the source page. That's beyond the scope of this chapter though.\nwl61 | Publishing Your Work\nzjvs | ° To share the workbook with others, you can copy the link as well as simply highlight and copy the text and then paste it into a new e-mail in the tool of your choice.\nifv4 | ° You also can share the workbook on Twitter or Facebook by clicking on either of the two buttons that open a pop-up on your browser and ask you to enter your credentials for the medium that you have selected, as shown in the following screenshot:\n9uf2 | When you share your work via Twitter or Facebook, the description that you enter in the workbook details will automatically be populated, as shown in following screenshot. You can always change the description and remove the via at Tableau string, but it's much more likely that people will find your tweet if you leave that tag:\nneut | Chapter Nine\n1mfk | Managing workbook details\ng6ns | The information that you provide about your work is important; it's the first part of the story that you're telling that people will take in. The workbook name is important, and so is the description and additional links.\n3jab | If you scroll down the page past the Share button, you will see the workbook title as well as a link that allows you to edit the workbook details, as shown in the following screenshot:\nozht | Now, perform the following steps:\nwalw | One. Make sure that the Title of the workbook says exactly what you want to appear on your profile.\n243h | Two. Add a Permalink. Though this isn't required, it's a good way to promote your blog.\nyup5 | Three. Enter a good description in the Description. This is the text that search engines will index. Also, if you want people to tweet your work, then you need to enter a description that's eighty-two characters or less, because the link that Tableau generates for your workbook will consist of sixty-two characters.\netg9 | Four. Toolbar Settings typically include control buttons as well as a link to your author profile. If you choose not to include those, then the H T M L generated to embed your work will be adjusted.\n6hid | Five. An additional setting that you can adjust is Show workbook sheets as tabs. If all the worksheets in your workbook are on your dashboard and you have hidden them, then you don't need to select this.\nzzuq | Publishing Your Work\njpjk | Six. Save your work by clicking on Save, as shown in the following screenshot:\nyf5l | Summary\n8255 | In this chapter, you learned how to save your work to the Web as well as how to manage your Tableau Public profile and workbook attributes to help you showcase and share your work effectively.\nqi7r | This chapter concludes our discussion of creating data stories in Tableau Public.
