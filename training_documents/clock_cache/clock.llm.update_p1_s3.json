        "content": "ti7f | Radical Clock Substrate Probes and Kinetic Isotope Effect Studies of the Hydroxylation of Hydrocarbons by Methane Monooxygenase\noksu | Abstract: Four mechanistic probes, trans-2-phenylmethylcyclopropane (one), two,two-diphenylmethylcyclopropane (two), trans-one,two- dimethylcyclopropane (three), and bicyclo[2.1.0]pentane (four), were used as substrates to investigate the possible formation of radical intermediates in the catalytic cycle of the methane monooxygenase system from Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath) in reactions conducted at forty-five degrees Celsius. Hydroxylation of one gave two products in equal amounts, the alcohol trans-(two-phenylcyclopropyl)methanol (one A) and the phenol trans-two-(para-hydroxyphenyl)methylcyclopropane (one C). The two different products are attributed to discrimination by the enzyme of the two enantiomers of probe one, one of which leads to hydroxylation of the aromatic ring and the other to formation of the primary alcohol. The absence of ring-opened product, one-phenylbut-three-en-one-ol (one B), is noteworthy and suggests that the hydroxylation reaction may not proceed through formation of the cyclopropylcarbinyl radical or cation. The former species rearranges to the three-butenyl radical with a rate constant of four times ten to the power of eleven per second at forty-five degrees Celsius, which would require a rebound rate constant for MMO from M. capsulatus (Bath) in excess of ten to the power of thirteen per second. The possibility of a stereoelectronic barrier to ring opening in the active site of the enzyme is addressed through a semiquantitative analysis of the rate constant with Marcus theory. Studies with the other radical clock probes support the notion that a significant component of the hydroxylation reaction pathway does not proceed through a radical intermediate. Compound two, the cyclopropylcarbinyl radical of which has a ring-opening rate constant of five times ten to the power of eleven per second, yields exclusively (two,two-diphenylcyclopropyl)methanol (two A); three, which has a rate constant of four point four times ten to the power of eight per second, affords only trans-(two-methylcyclopropyl)methanol (three A); and four, which has a rate constant of three times ten to the power of nine per second, gives mainly a mixture of endo- and exo-two-hydroxybicyclo[2.1.0]pentane (four A and four B). Kinetic isotope effect experiments were also carried out with derivatives of one, mono-, di-, and trideuterated at the methyl position. No intermolecular isotope effect, assessed by comparing the rate of conversion of the undeuterated and trideuterated probes, was observed, a result consistent with carbon-hydrogen bond breaking not being involved in the rate-determining step of the enzymatic reaction. Intramolecular kinetic isotope effects of K sub H over K sub D equals five point one five and five point zero three were obtained from studies of the mono- and dideuterated probes, respectively, which indicates that the hydroxylation reaction involves a substantial carbon-hydrogen bond stretching component. The MMO hydroxylase from Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b gave both unrearranged and a small amount, three to five percent, of rearranged products with one, the ratio of which corresponds to a rebound rate constant of six to nine times ten to the power of twelve per second at thirty degrees Celsius. These results are discussed in terms of several possible detailed mechanisms for the MMO hydroxylase reaction.\nwtow | Introduction\no22k | Methane monooxygenase is a protein system employed by methanotrophic bacteria to oxidize methane to methanol, a process that provides these organisms with their sole source of carbon and energy, as shown in the equation. The soluble methane monooxygenases from Methy-\nnwfz | C H sub four plus O sub two plus N A D H plus H plus yields C H sub three O H plus H sub two O plus N A D plus.\nnvfy | lococcus capsulatus (Bath) and Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b, two of the better studied systems, comprise three proteins. Included are a hydroxylase enzyme that binds substrate and dioxygen, a reductase that contains Fe two S two and FAD moieties and accepts electrons from NADH, and a coupling protein that regulates electron transfer between the reductase and the hydroxylase and also modulates the substrate specificity and redox potentials of the latter. Recently, much attention has been focused on the hydroxylase enzyme, which is capable of hydroxylating a wide variety of substrates, in addition to methane. EXAFS, EPR, MÃ¶ssbauer, ENDOR, and other physical studies have shown that the active site in this enzyme contains a dinuclear non-heme iron center in which the metals are probably each coordinated to a histidine and several carboxylate ligands and linked to one another by a monodentate oxygen atom, either from water, hydroxide, or monodentate carboxylate, as well as by a bidentate carboxylate bridge. The center resembles that in the crystallographically characterized R-two protein of ribonucleotide reductase.\nmror | to form a hydrocarbon radical that recombines with the coordinated hydroxyl radical before dissociating from the active site.\nzlxc | The catalytic mechanism of the MMO hydroxylase has frequently been compared to that of its widely studied heme analogue, cytochrome P-four hundred fifty. In P-four hundred fifty-catalyzed hydroxylations, it is postulated that a high-valent iron oxo, or ferryl, moiety is generated which abstracts a hydrogen atom from the substrate\nk0bw | Especially important in establishing the presence of radical intermediates in this mechanism were studies with substrate probes that, following hydrogen atom abstraction to form a radical, isomerize to form, ultimately, a rearranged alcohol product. This process is illustrated for a specific probe, trans-two-phenylmethylcyclopropane (one), in Scheme One. Attempts to employ this methodology in studies of the hydroxylation of one,one-dimethylcyclopropane with the MMO hydroxylase from M. trichosporium OB3b were consistent with radical formation, although cationic intermediates were also invoked. Other experimental evidence for the involvement of radical intermediates in the hydroxylation chemistry of MMO from the same organism has been reported.",
