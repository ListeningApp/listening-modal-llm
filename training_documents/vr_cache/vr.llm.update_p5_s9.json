The term \"presence\" has been used in VR research to refer to the subjective experience of being in a place or environment, even when one is physi- cally situated in another. The feeling of presence is influ- enced by the degree of immersion, defined as the extent to which the system generates sensory stimulation consistent with sensorimotor experience (e.g., images are updated as the head moves). Sense of presence has traditionally been linked to an individual's level of engagement and moti- vation. As such, high rates of presence and immersion reported within investigations of clinical uses of VR point to the ability of the technology to enhance engagement with clinical evaluation. However, it is currently difficult to create VR environments with a high level of realism, which can create a strong aversion to the experience.\n5z6q | VR could further increase engagement with clinical evalua- tion by adding elements of digital games to the assessments, a process known as \"gamification.\" Incorporating features of games, such as rewards and feedback, within VR may\nyeoh | Original article VR in mental health research and practice - Bell et al\nb8hf | engage individuals more fully in the evaluation process, limiting distractions that may compete for attention. Pollak et al reported that young participants (aged nine to seventeen) rated a VR attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) assessment significantly more enjoyable than a computerized test of attention. The affordances inherent within VR technology have the potential to increase engagement with clinical evaluation for all individuals across presenting disorders, potentially improving the reliability and validity of the assessments.\nhntf | Applications of VR for assessment in clinical research studies\n99fo | Owing to the ecological validity, immersive capabilities, and ease of standardized data collection as discussed above, the field has begun to explore the use of VR for the assess- ment of clinically relevant outcomes. To date, these have fallen into three main areas: social functioning, cognition, and symptomatology. Social functioning can be assessed using automatic data capture such as eye gaze, proximity to VR avatars, and recording of responses to simulated social situations. Across studies, individuals with mental health conditions known to impact social functioning differed from control participants on VR-recorded measures. Cognition was among the first outcomes to be assessed with early- stage VR programs, focusing on memory and executive function, commonly assessed using maze navigation and attention tasks. For example, response to a VR-adminis- tered continuous performance task assessed attention and response inhibition in children and teens with ADHD compared with controls. Finally, VR environments have also been used to elicit and assess symptoms, such as para- noid ideation in the general population, individuals at risk for psychosis, those with a first-episode psychosis, and individuals with long-standing persecutory delusions. Other symptoms such as auditory hallucinations, disor- dered eating, addiction, and phobia have also been studied using VR.\ny5r7 | Considerations and limitations\nlrry | Whereas VR offers exciting opportunities to advance multiple areas of mental health, it is important to remain cautiously optimistic. Mirroring broader issues within the field of digital mental health, the following are major areas where caution is needed.\nhvhm | Cost and access\n863b | Although VR has been around for several decades, only recently has the technology advanced to the point of commercial readiness. A major milestone occurred in twenty ten with the release of the Oculus Rift, a relatively affordable VR device directed at consumers. Prior to this, VR tech- nology mainly existed behind the closed doors of software companies and specialized research labs. Over the past decade, we have seen rapid technological advancement and proliferation of the marketplace, with various companies offering a range of devices suited to different consumers and budgets. Critical to VRs viability, twenty nineteen saw the release of the fully mobile HMD Oculus Quest. Mobile HMDs can be run without a cable connecting them to a computer, overcoming earlier problems with mobility and ease of use. It is now easier to imagine VR becoming commonplace in clinics, hospitals, and people's homes because it is easier to set up and more convenient to use. However, the cost of these devices is still prohibitive for many, with the most recent version of the Oculus Quest costing around four hundred U.S. dollars.\nfj24 | The biggest limiting factor to the implementation of VR into clinical practice at present is the lack of evidence-based VR programs that can be bought off the shelf and used by clini- cians and researchers. A number of labs around the world are developing their own software packages and testing them, but they are not yet commercially available. The few commercially available products developed by software companies have not been tested to show whether they are safe and effective. Additionally, because the technology is advancing so rapidly, hardware becomes outdated quickly and proprietary issues limit the availability of VR applica- tions across newer platforms. Consequently, we are yet to see VR have the same market penetration as smartphones, with only a small proportion of consumers currently owning these devices. Some clinicians have integrated VR into their practice, but again we are yet to see these treatments become widely available despite good evidence base for some approaches, particularly exposure therapy for anxiety disorders. In comparison, there has been a more steady increase in the use of VR within mental health research. The slow integration of VR into clinical care is due to many factors. These include a lack in infrastructure to support the technology within services, absence of training and stan- dardized evidence-based VR packages, the learning curve and costs associated with adopting new technologies, and more broadly, fears that technology may hinder engage-\nuz3c | Original article VR in mental health research and practice - Bell et al\nd5bi | ment or even replace mental health professionals' roles. For these reasons, it is imperative that new VR applications, and in fact any digital technology, are designed with consid- erations for the systems and context in which they will be implemented.\nba4l | Developing evidence base\nffx8 | Traditionally, medical research is painstakingly slow at developing new evidence. Research is costly, time consuming, and in many ways, inefficient. This is partic- ularly problematic in digital mental health, where research operates at a much slower pace compared with technology development. Therefore, research often lags behind in providing the evidence base necessary to justify the hype surrounding many technologies. As a result, the market- place is largely dominated by mental health technologies that lack the evidence to substantiate their claims. VR is no exception, with a booming market of HMDs, games, and applications ready for consumer use.\ns6su | In addition to the complexities in developing and validating new VR technologies, it is also difficult to maintain them. Updates to software and hardware require ongoing mainte- nance costs that are not afforded in the traditional funding model offered by research grants. Potential solutions are still unfolding; however, currently, it is rare for the tech- nologies and applications developed by researchers to be widely available for consumers and clinicians. They are also often developed in isolation, with collaboration across research centers lacking. Better partnerships across insti- tutions as well as with commercial companies may offer solutions to this problem, but until this time, clinicians and researchers may find themselves frustrated by the lack of readily available VR assessment tools.\ny219 | Technical requirements and issues\n06ht | Technology can be complex and unstable, with teams of experts required for effective development and maintenance. Anyone interested in developing new VR applications for research should be warned that considerable technical, design, and computational expertise is required. Enhancing ecological validity is a major offering of VR; however, the degree of immersion necessary to generate the sense of pres- ence is a matter of ongoing research. Features that affect this sense of immersion include the display parameters of the VR system (e.g., frame rate and resolution), design features (e.g., realism of visual objects), and multisensory",
