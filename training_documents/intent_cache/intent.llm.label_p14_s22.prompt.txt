You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

It includes using the guiding principles of IRM in combination with prom- inent systems theories to gain the collaboration of part- ners, parents, other family, and friends to serve the goals of therapy. It also involves understanding the structure, process, and interpersonal dynamics of group therapy.
z8f7 | Another fundamental skill involves knowing how to work collaboratively with supervisors, employers, and other professionals. It involves knowing how to commu- nicate with other professionals about clients both in the presence and in the absence of those clients. Additionally, it requires understanding the power dynamics and value systems that underlie supervisor and student, as well as employer and employee, relationships. Understanding and managing clients' difficult behavior is another category of necessary interpersonal skills required in many practice situations. It involves knowing how to respond effectively to behaviors that involve manipulation, excessive depen- dence, symptom focusing, resistance, emotional disengage- ment, denial, difficulty with rapport and trust, and hostility. Responding effectively helps limit the extent to which this behavior disrupts the goals and processes of therapy.
7w7j | Knowing how to resolve conflicts and empathic breaks (or rifts in understanding between client and therapist) is another fundamental skill set that can salvage a failing rela- tionship or repair minor threats to an otherwise functional relationship. Professional behavior and ethics encompass knowledge of how your own values are consistent or incon- sistent with the occupational therapy core values, ethical behavior and decision-making, behavioral self-awareness around clients, being reliable and dependable, uphold- ing confidentiality, and setting and managing professional boundaries. Therapist self-care incorporates knowing and managing your own emotional reactions to clients and being accountable to those reactions, a general capacity for self- reflection, an ability to manage your personal life and seek support when necessary, and the capacity to maintain per- spective regarding client outcomes. More information about all these skills, which comprise a therapist's interpersonal skill base, is provided in Chapters 8 through 16 (Fig. 3.7).
51vd | Therapeutic Mode Use
baj1 | The second interpersonal capacity that a therapist brings to the client-therapist relationship is her or his primary therapeutic mode or modes. A therapeutic mode is a spe- cific way of relating to a client. The IRM identifies six

5bq3 | encouraging, instructing, and problem-solving. Therapists naturally use therapeutic modes that are consistent with their fundamental interpersonal characteristics. For exam- ple, a therapist who tends to be more of a listener than a talker in everyday life and believes in the importance of understanding another person's perspective before mak- ing a suggestion would likely utilize empathizing as a pri- mary therapeutic mode in therapy. Therapists vary widely in terms of the range and flexibility with which they use modes in relating to clients. Some therapists relate to cli- ents in one or two primary ways, whereas others draw upon multiple therapeutic modes depending on the interper- sonal characteristics of the client and the situation at hand.
ezla | One of the goals in using the IRM is to become in- creasingly comfortable utilizing any of six of the modes flexibly and interchangeably depending on the client's needs. A therapeutic mode or set of modes define the therapist's general interpersonal style when interacting with a client. Therapists able to utilize all six of the modes flexibly and comfortably and to match those modes to the client and the situation are described as having a multi- modal interpersonal style.

A mode shift is a conscious change in one's way of relat- ing to a client. Mode shifts are frequently required in re- sponse to interpersonal events in therapy. For example, if a client perceives a therapist's attempts at problem-solving to be insensitive or off the mark, a therapist would be wise to switch from the problem-solving mode to an empathiz- ing mode so he or she can better understand the client's reaction and the root of the dilemma. An interpersonal reasoning process, described in the paragraph that fol- lows, can be utilized to guide the therapist in deciding when a mode shift might be required and determining which alternative mode to select. Because the interper- sonal aspects of occupational therapy practice are complex and require a therapist to have a highly adaptive therapeu- tic persona, the IRM recommends that therapists learn to draw upon all six of the therapeutic modes in a flexi- ble manner according to the interpersonal needs of each client and the unique demands of each clinical situation (Fig. 3.8).

vcu3 | Interpersonal Reasoning
hjzj | The third therapist interpersonal competence involves the capacity to engage in an interpersonal reasoning process when an interpersonal dilemma presents itself in therapy. Interpersonal reasoning is a stepwise process by which a therapist decides what to say, do, or express in reaction to the occurrence of an interpersonal dilemma in therapy. It includes developing a mental vigilance to- ward the interpersonal aspects of therapy in anticipation that a dilemma might occur and a means of reviewing and evaluating options for responding. A full description of the steps of interpersonal reasoning and examples of its application in practice are provided in Chapter 7.

6tbv | PRACTICAL APPLICATION 3.5
xb13 | In the case example at the beginning of this chapter, Rigel uses four of the six modes effectively to re- solve the earlier rift with Mr. Johnson that occurred in Chapter 1. He begins the session by remaining in the empathizing mode for a long period of time. He orients his body toward the client in a way that is not threatening, admits that he was not very useful to the client in the previous session, and openly tells the client on multiple occasions that he wants to better understand why he thinks and feels the way that he does. Additionally, Rigel shifts briefly into the collaborating mode early in the session when he suggests to Mr. Johnson that he will observe him doing "anything he wants." There is also a brief mo- ment in which Rigel shifts to the advocating mode in order to normalize Mr. Johnson's feelings of de- moralization and doubt. After a substantial amount of time is spent asking Mr. Johnson deepening questions and summarizing his understanding, Rigel shifts into the instructing mode in order to educate Mr. Johnson about the effects of neurore- habilitation efforts on stroke recovery.
cxqi | In summary, Rigel used interpersonal reasoning to make multiple mode shifts during the interaction that effectively promoted a more truthful and trust- ing communication with Mr. Johnson.
qfmx | engagement. The desired occupation is the task or activity the therapist and client have selected for therapy. Desired occupations may include a wide range of tasks and activ- ities, such as dressing oneself, driving, shopping, gross motor play, participating in a goal-setting group, complet- ing a craft activity, or engaging in a simulated or modified work task. The selection of the occupation and support for occupational engagement is primarily informed by other occupational therapy conceptual practice models such as the Biomechanical Model, the Sensory Integration Model, or the Model of Human Occupation (Kielhofner, 2008).
rut3 | The primary function of IRM is to enable the therapist to manage the interpersonal dynamic between the client and the therapist that also occurs as part of the therapy process. This interpersonal dynamic influences the occupational en- gagement and also serves as an arena in which the emotional

ap6l | Relationships Within the Model
iest | According to the IRM, the client and therapist relation- ship can be viewed at two levels or scales.
cox8 | The usual therapeutic relationship process that con- sists of the ongoing rapport and patterns of interaction between the client and therapist. This relationship is enduring, and it occurs outside of any unusual circum- stances or stressors (macro level).
ppqi | The therapeutic relationship process that is influenced by interpersonal events of therapy or the stressors or highlights that have the potential to challenge or enrich the relationship depending on how they are responded to and resolved (micro level).
oxou | The therapeutic relationship is a socially defined and personally interpreted interactive process between the therapist and a client. It is socially defined in that the ther- apist and the client are engaged in an interaction within publicly understood roles. The therapist is recognized as bringing a certain kind of expertise, ethical guidelines, and values into a relationship. The client is recognized as a person receiving service to address a particular need. The relationship is understood to exist for the sole purpose of achieving improvement in the client's situation. These parameters are given and provide an important definition of the relationship. Therapist and client are in a particular relationship that can be differentiated from other kinds of relationships such as friendships. At the same time, this relationship has a personal side. The client and therapist are human beings who encounter each other with the same potential range of thoughts and emotions that occur when any two people interact (Fig. 3.9).

d5bz | Sustaining the therapeutic relationship is an ongoing task that does not focus solely on interpersonal events. The therapeutic relationship process that occurs outside of the interpersonal events is the macro dimension of the inter- personal process of therapy.
ap5o | Responding to the immediate events that occur during therapy is the micro dimension. Responding to these in- terpersonal events of therapy requires that the therapist detects the occurrence of an event, reads the client's re- action to the event, and decides on an appropriate way to address the event with the client.
7zvf | Both the micro and macro scales of therapeutic inter- action play a critical role in the overall process of occu- pational therapy. Moreover, they are interrelated. That is, the nature of the therapeutic relationship has an influence on how the client interprets and how the therapist re- sponds to interpersonal events; and, in turn, interpersonal events and their resolution either enhance or detract from the therapeutic relationship.
mov9 | In some cases, the two scales of interaction are difficult to differentiate. For example, some therapy relationships last only one or two sessions. In these cases, a therapist must work to respond to a client and to interpersonal events with much more vigilance and self-control be- cause a more stable underlying therapeutic relationship does not yet exist. Moreover, the interpersonal events and their resolution during the therapy sessions are the major
