To want for oneself what belongs to others.\n1dtx | Some people, of course, are so willful that even if you tell them that you are not going to compromise with fixed biases, they will continue to battle. In such cases the teacher will disappoint their expectations by making himself out to be unsuitable to the student, borrowing from the Malamati techniques. Even then, the delinquent student may not be able to understand what is going on, and will put all kinds of fanciful interpretations on the matter. Saadi, in the Gulistan, has a tale about this.\n1i7w | TALE OF THE MUEZZIN\nlr11 | There was once a Muezzin who called the faithful to prayer with such an awful voice that the mosque trustee, a kindly man, offered him ten dinars to go to another town. Subsequently he came across the trustee and said, \"You offered me only ten dinars to go to another town, but where I am now they are offering twenty, but I still refuse to leave.\"\nngb1 | The trustee laughed and said, \"Hold out, and you will find that they will even go as high as fifty.\"\n1w6m | Five Action and Meaning\nszi9 | Real and Relative Generosity\nfv7i | UNGENEROUS MEN\nr0zc | ONE man heard of the plight of another while he was sitting among friends. He immediately felt moved, and handed out a sum of money to be given to the distressed one.\nntu2 | Another, who had not heard of any special case, went out when he had some money and looked for someone who was in need. He asked him about his needs, and fulfilled them.\nv0xj | Which of these was the really generous man?\nctvz | The answer is - neither\npht0 | Both were generous within conventional limits. They were doing what they had been taught to do.\nr6dj | These forms of generosity are sufficient only at the very beginnings of generosity.\na2rk | Beyond this is the stage for which these other forms are supposed to be the preparation.\n54w7 | Because people rarely rise above the preliminary stages, these shallow forms of generosity are assumed to be the height of generosity.\npvo7 | The real generosity is when a man does something generous when nobody knows about it; or when, other people knowing something about it, he refuses to gain any credit for his generosity, from the recipient or anyone else.\n0td6 | Real generosity is anonymous to the extent that a man should be prepared even to be considered ungenerous rather than explain it to others.\nsmzs | This kind of generosity, in goods, in work and in thought, is deliberately cultivated in the ranks of the Elect, and is practised by those who wish to enter their ranks, with no exceptions at all, and there is no relaxation of this exercise.\nqzby | Generosity is also marked by doing what one says one will do. Saadi teaches: \"when the generous promise, they perform.\"\ns073 | Not to be greedy is, paradoxically, the highest form of looking after one's true interests.\naqml | Greed harms you: generosity helps you.\n70vb | This is why it has been said: \"Greed is the mother of incapacity.\"\nep65 | Why do Sufis Excel\nqfr0 | Q: What stops people making progress, especially in great writings or producing teaching materials?\nbp1x | A: An eminent orientalist has recorded in print his difficulty in understanding how the Sufi classical author Saadi of Shiraz could have written two great Persian classics in three or four years.\n8pz0 | This may be a problem to the scholastic: but it describes his mind, not Saadi's.\nfntv | To the Sufi such perplexity marks a situation not dissimilar to that of the ingenuous person who says: \"I can't understand how that man with the thunderstick can bring down such a big metal bird from the sky.\"\naxt9 | This 'concealed savage' in man is not present, of course, only in the limited type of scholar. He is the savage which prevents everyone from making progress in any field.\nllsr | Correct teaching brings out human excellence.\nfrds | The teaching must, of course, work with the best part of the individual, must be directed to his or her real capacity.\nu1p6 | In the first chapter of his Gulistan, the \"Rose Garden\", Saadi declares:\ng0uj | How can anyone make a good sword from bad iron?\nafcr | From teaching, the useless one will not become useful.\nyrxz | The rain, whose nature does not change.\nya14 | Grows flowers in the garden, thorns in the marsh.\negxf | People who have fallacious objectives are like the barren soil. The flowers grow from soil which is composed of the right objectives.\nb7wj | The people whom you mention as not making progress are working from an unsuitable basis. \"If you insist on buying poor food, you must be prepared to dislike it at the serving.\"\nxond | Confusion as a Personal Problem\n7pz7 | Q: What can I do about my confusion and worthlessness?\nxzxd | A: People who ask that their confusion be removed should take note of these three points first:\nl5lj | One. They should satisfy themselves that I (or others) have offered to remove confusion, etc. Sufis have not. They therefore have to trace the source of the offer, if any, to remove confusions and apply to whoever has made the offer. If the 'offer' has in fact arisen within the mind of the applicant, he should recognize this.\nndp4 | Two. They should note that confusion, etc., may often be a protection. You may not like a fog, but if it is shielding you from a man-eating tiger, it is better to have it. In too many cases people should be giving thanks for their confusions, which are shields, rather than trying to remove them before they are able to face what lies behind.\nvsrv | Three. Plenty of people, and this is of course well recognized today, create and maintain their own confusion, even while imagining that they are trying to escape it.\nl3vt | The answer, therefore, to \"what can I do about my confusion?\" is, \"Find out what its cause is, and why it is there. Then decide if you want to do anything about it.\"\nh17n | Confusion comes of not paying attention to what should be attended to first. The problem of the confused, therefore, is that they should become aware of this, first using their wits to observe themselves, and think less about confusion. Remember the proverb: 'A sign is enough for the alert, but a thousand counsels are not enough for the negligent.'\nj0fe | As to feeling worthlessness, there are limits to this as there are to the reverse. Saadi has designed this poem, which I translate from Persian for you, to see that the problem is one of perspective:\n7dc7 | A drop which fell from a rain-cloud\n9mzu | Was disturbed by the extent of the sea:\nhtob | \"Who am I in the ocean's vastness? If it is, then indeed I am not I\"\nm9jh | While it saw itself with the eye of contempt a shell nurtured it in its bosom.\nc3s2 | The heavens so fostered things that it became a celebrated, a royal Pearl:\nxdsd | Becoming high from being low it knocked on the door of nothingness: Until Being came about.\ng57v | The Persian poetic convention is that a pearl is a transformed raindrop.\noq5g | Your confusion is because you are not getting what you want; and your sense of worthlessness is something which you feel you have and do not want. One of the Sufis has remarked, on this same double problem:\n9prj | \"You must strive to be patient both with what you want and what you do not want: for each of them will try you. Exercise both kinds of patience and deserve the human name.\"\nbw1d | FEELING YOUR OWN NOTHINGNESS\nljf0 | The Sufi saint Attar records the great ancient Bayazid as saying: \"You must feel your own nothingness.\"\nwceo | To perceive one's own nothingness is valuable. To indulge oneself emotionally by frightening oneself with it is shallow self-amusement - all the more attractive to many people because they can pretend to themselves that it is sincerity or piety. One has to get beyond this childish state.\nvwy5 | Being a 'Guru'",
