You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

d0ik | LRRK2 regulates the SV cycle by interacting with E-L system proteins that are also implicated in PD: auxilin, SYNJ1, and endophilin A. LRRK2 overactivity phosphorylates auxilin in its clathrin binding domain, making their interaction weaker. This leads to disruption of SV endocytosis (Nguyen & Krainc 2018). This was noted in patient iPSC- derived dopaminergic neurons, along with accumulation of oxidized dopamine, increased a- synuclein levels, and decreased Gcase1 activity (Nguyen & Krainc 2018).
0x0s | Hyperphosphorylation of endophilin A and synJ1 by LRRK2 significantly altered synaptic endocytosis (Islam et al. 2016; Matta et al. 2012; Pan et al. 2017). A recent study showed that LRRK2 can directly bind to clathrin-light chains through its GTPase domain, affecting Rac1-mediated endosomal dynamics (Schreij et al. 2015). LRRK2 also perturbs synaptic exocytosis through phosphorylation of N-ethylmaleimide-Sensitive Factor which upregulates SNARE disassembly (Belluzzi et al. 2016). Furthermore, LRRK2 is highly expressed in dorsal striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs), the postsynaptic compartment of nigrostriatal pathway. G2019S mutation of LRRK2 lead to abnormally high activity of MSNs and morphological perturbations during development (Matikainen-Ankney et al. 2016). Abnormal synaptogenesis and dopamine receptor activation in the developing MSNs mediated by dysfunctional protein kinase A was seen in LRRK2 R1441C mutation (Parisiadou et al. 2014). These defects can permanently modify the circuit structure and function, predisposing the individuals to both motor and non-motor dysfunctions of PD. LRRK2 mutation-mediated endocytosis defects were noted predominantly in these MSNs, along with nigral dopaminergic neurons and not in cortical or hippocampal neurons (Pan et al. 2017; Maas et al. 2017). This suggests a heightened vulnerability in the E-L system of nigrostriatal circuit for LRRK2 mutations.
4exe | Increased LRRK2 kinase activity mediated elevation of exocytosis may also be relevant for cell-to-cell transfer of misfolded a-synuclein (Bae et al. 2018; Schapansky et al. 2018; Lin et al. 2009). LRRK2 can selectively recruit to overloaded lysosomes and divert undegraded materials out of the kidney cells, along with secretion of a-synuclein from endosomes (Eguchi et al. 2018). Studies also demonstrate heightened uptake of a-synuclein fibrils through endocytosis in the presence of pathogenic LRRK2 (Bae et al. 2018). However, LRRK2's role in prion-like spreading of a-synuclein remains speculative, until confirmation that similar mechanisms exist in neurons.
0myz | Clinical description and diagnosis of PD has changed little since James Parkinson's characterization of the disease 200 years ago (Parkinson 2002). In the 1960s, identification of dopamine deficiency as the cause of motor abnormalities led to symptomatic relief for patients (Carlsson et al. 1957). Though some success has been noted with deep brain stimulation (Limousin et al. 1998), we are still relying on symptomatic relief. The last three decades of basic research have enriched our understanding of PD's cellular and molecular mechanisms, bringing tangible hope for disease modifying treatment strategies. Identification of risk genes and conceptual shifts in our understanding through genetic models point to the E-L system dysfunction as the key mediator of PD pathogenesis. Further strengthening this concept, PD pathogenesis appears to begin at synaptic terminals where endo and exocytotic machinery is most active and where a-synuclein and LRRK2 exert their

6d4s | effects through the E-L system and vice-versa. Studies so far suggest that altered flux through the E-L system in nigral dopaminergic neurons that have lesser threshold for degeneration is the key trigger for neurodegeneration. Moving forward, critical elucidation of the mechanisms behind sorting, trafficking, and recycling defects demands detailed studies of auxilin and other DNAJ family proteins, along with SYNJ1, endophilin A, and the retromer complex. Studying these genes will also provide crucial insights into less explored roles of synaptic autophagy, axonal transport, and clathrin-independent endocytosis in PD. Recent surveys of PD patients note preservation of cognitive functioning as a major unmet need. Further investigation of GBA mutations implicated in PD is a promising avenue considering GBA's known involvement in cognitive disorders like Dementia with Lewy Bodies. Along with GBA, studying ATP13A2 and other lysosomal genes will enrich our understanding of lysosomal dysfunction, potentially bringing us closer to repurposing drugs used in Lysosomal Storage Disorders for PD. Affirming ongoing clinical trials targeting autophagy, a-synuclein, and LRRK2, an enhanced understanding of E-L system-mediated pathogenesis will prove crucial in developing novel treatment strategies and diagnostic tools for PD.
