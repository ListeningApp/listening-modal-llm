You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

1pjs | Developing Versatile Leadership
o2kr | Leadership consists of opposing strengths, and most leaders have a natural tendency to overdevelop one at the expense of its counterpart. The resulting imbalance diminishes their effectiveness. But leaders who work to guard against such lopsidedness can increase their versatility and their impact.
v6sk | M odern conceptions of leadership suffer from a serious limitation. Although it is generally acknowledged that effective leaders must possess a number of sometimes seem- ingly contradictory qualities and skill sets, the idea that a strength taken to an extreme can be a weakness does not seem to have registered fully in the practice of management.1 The notion that inadequate performance results from underdoing any of the requisite skills - delegating, giving direction, com- municating, cooperating with peers and so forth - is well established and reflected in most formal systems designed to assess managers for selection or development. However, the idea that performance problems can just as easily spring from taking a given behavior to an extreme has received far less attention.
1wj6 | Perhaps the focus on overdoing hasn't been as sharp because its problematic aspects are not immediately obvious - after all, leaders often must go to extremes to meet tough challenges. It is difficult to draw the line, however, between making the serious effort required to get things done and going too far.2 A problem commonly seen in recently promoted senior executives, for example, is their difficulty in adjusting their skill sets to the requirements of their higher-level jobs. What had, in their previous posi- tions, been a seemingly inoffensive, even useful, tendency to get heavily involved in

8r5j | operational detail can become a big liability in their new roles, resulting in the misallocation of time and attention away from strategic considerations or getting in the way of direct reports' ability to do their jobs. Still, even in executive positions there are situations that require the individual to get deeply involved. For senior managers, then, effectiveness hinges on the ability to appropriately gear their leadership qualities and skills to the cir- cumstances at hand.
2taz | The lack of balance in leadership, which is linked to the idea of overdoing and is well known to individual managers, has also
o3ya | About the Research
r5il | The research reported here proceeded in two stages. The first stage was action research: We conducted comprehensive assessments of the leadership of individ- ual senior managers by interviewing scores of coworkers, past and present, and administering a battery of psycho- logical tests. We analyzed the data rigorously and interpreted it with each executive.' Patterns gradually emerged - forcefulness taken to an extreme, enabling leadership as the complement of forceful leadership, the tendency for executives to be lopsided one way or the other and so on." Robert Kaplan then developed a 360-degree survey to meas- ure versatility, or lack thereof, on force- ful and enabling leadership. Later a second major duality - strategic and operational leadership - emerged from our ongoing action research, and we added it to the survey. Above all, the sur- vey needed a way to capture overdoing, which is integral to imbalance. The cur- rent version of that scale is:
5gui | In the research we have done to date, using three samples of U.S. executives and evolving generations of the 360- degree survey, now called the Leadership Versatility Index, this duality-based way of assessing versatility has proved reli- able and valid."" The current pairs of sur-

tzt3 | vey items that measure versatility on each of the two dualities have good internal reliability, in the .90s for versatil- ity on the forceful/enabling duality and in the low .80s for versatility on the strategic/operational duality. In addition, ratings from superiors, peers and direct reports converge to a high degree. Indices of inter-rater reliability and inter- rater agreement easily exceed the mini- mum standard of .70 and generally reach the upper .80s within each rating group.
t8vv | We tested our hypothesis that versa- tility is central to effectiveness by corre- lating scores on a versatility index with ratings of overall effectiveness. The measure of effectiveness is a single item rated by coworkers on a 10-point scale, where 10 is outstanding and 5 is ade- quate, and our analyses indicate that this measure is reasonably reliable and valid." To arrive at an index of versatility we use the Pythagorean theorem to reduce the scores on opposing sides to a single number for each of the two dualities, forceful-enabling and strategic- operational.V
qvnu | In each of the three studies we have done - two on only forceful-enabling leadership and one on both dualities - there has been a sizable correlation between the versatility index and overall effectiveness, on average in the upper .50s. This was true for ratings of all coworkers taken together and for each group (superiors, peers and direct reports) taken separately. The correlations were

When pre- sented with two opposing approaches, people in general have a tendency to polarize, placing a high value on the approach in which they have greater faith and competence while overlooking or demeaning the value of the other. Despite their obvious intel- ligence, executives are no different. They may be too task-ori- ented and not sufficiently people-oriented, too tough and not responsive enough to people's needs, too big-picture-oriented with not enough emphasis on planning and follow-through. One strategically gifted individual, for example, called the practical

Furthermore, in the study of both dualities, the correlation between versatil- ity and effectiveness was about .60 in each case, and they each made their own contribution to predicting effectiveness, together explaining over half of the vari- ability. In other words, versatility in terms of these two dualities accounted for the majority of what it meant to be an effec- tive executive.
5746 | process of implementing plans "operational gruel." A senior manager who made a career of turning around troubled opera- tions spoke of strategy meetings as "spending fluff time." A naturally powerful leader expressed severe misgivings about "get- along/go-along" types. Another was too attached to the idea of being "nice" to his people and harbored resentment toward man- agers who lead with obvious personal power.
7toz | We have commonly seen imbalances like these when assessing executives in our consulting work on leadership. To address the imbalances, we have found it helpful to define leadership skills and qualities in terms of paired approaches that may look like opposites but together constitute a balanced whole.3 This view leads to the notion of leadership effectiveness as the ability to draw freely from two opposing sides as appropriate for a given situation, unencumbered by prejudice against or bias for either - in other words, the ability to be versatile. It became clear to us in our work that there are two overarching balances to be struck in that regard: the balance between forceful leadership and enabling leadership (the first to emerge and the one we have studied the most) and the balance between strategic leadership and operational leadership. That is not to say that no other major distinctions apply - that between general-management skills and technical/functional expertise, for instance - but the two highlighted here far exceed any others in importance.
j346 | Consulting the literature and relying on our firsthand expo- sure to executive leaders, we define forceful leadership on the basis of a leader's own intellect and energy - taking charge, tak- ing stands, having leadership presence, being decisive, setting challenging expectations for people, holding them accountable, making tough calls, asking probing questions and so on. We define enabling leadership as creating conditions for other people to be forces in their own right - empowering them, being recep- tive to where others stand on issues, being responsive to the needs of others, being understanding when others don't deliver, sharing the limelight and so on.
v8uq | We define strategic leadership as setting long-term direction, thinking broadly about the organization, seeking ways to grow the business, aligning people with the vision and strategy and the like. We define operational leadership as focusing on short-term results, getting involved in operational detail, being grounded in the realities of implementing strategy, using processes to keep people on track and so on.
x972 | The two balances seem to complement each other: The stra- tegic-operational duality describes what managers work on; the forceful-enabling duality describes how they go about it.
cwrw | These two essential pairs are tacitly understood, if not fully formulated, by most managers. Indeed, leadership experts have long made similar distinctions in the literature. Forceful and enabling, for example, are our terms (actually, the language that managers use) for a distinction that has been made repeatedly
4i0e | over the last 50 years - autocratic and participative, initiat- ing structure and consideration, "command and control" and employee-centered.4 Yet the models in common use today - called competency models - often consist of long, unmemo- rable lists of skills and personal qualities not generally grouped in pairwise fashion. Therefore, these models miss the chance to identify lopsidedness, in our view the most common impediment to developing effective leadership. Our position is based on the essentially two-sided nature of leadership: For every truth there is an equal and opposing truth, and leadership models are more useful for respecting that reality.
h2l3 | Identifying Lopsided Leadership
dfzb | For an assessment tool to diagnose lack of balance, or lopsided- ness, it must be able to measure overdoing, something that com- monly used performance-rating scales typically do not do. Rather, they reinforce the "more is better" view by attempting to measure either how often the manager engages in the behavior (for example, a five-point "extent" scale that ranges from "not at all" to "to a very great extent") or how well the manager performs a given task or behavior (for example, on a five-point scale that ranges from "ineffective" to "outstanding").5 Since it is assumed that higher ratings on these scales indicate proficiency or mas- tery, there is no distinction drawn between "very often" and "too often," nor any recognition of the possibility that a manager could possess too much of a desired quality.6
u6ty | What is needed, then, is a way of measuring leadership that allows for the possibility, in fact the reality, that sub-par mana- gerial performance can result not only from a deficiency of cer- tain skills and behaviors, but also from an excess of them as well. Aristotle made this deceptively simple truth central to his "Ethics."7 He thought of virtue, or efficacy, as the midpoint between excess and deficiency. To measure performance in accordance with this old and worthy idea, we need only employ a rating scale that allows raters to distinguish between too little, the right amount and too much.
awvu | We built such a scale into our Leadership Versatility Index,8 a 360-degree questionnaire that we have used for 10 years. In addi- tion to identifying deficiency and sufficiency, the assessment tool also captures an executive's tendency to take things to an extreme. The rating scale's ability to capture overdoing on a single dimen- sion like forceful leadership can in turn help identify an imbal- ance on a duality such as forceful/enabling.
on9b | Using an early version of the Leadership Versatility Index, we constructed two statistically sound scales, one to measure force- ful leadership and the other for enabling leadership (for example, "Makes tough calls" vs. "Compassionate," "Makes judgments" vs. "Shows appreciation," "Forces issues" vs. "Fosters harmony"). When we studied a sample of 107 U.S. executives by soliciting rat- ings from them and 1,036 of their coworkers - superiors, peers
a8ge | and direct reports - we found, as expected, a strong inverse rela- tionship between the two scales. That is, the more forceful man- agers are, the less enabling they are and vice versa.9 (See "About the Research.") Thus, many managers do not move freely between opposing modes; they show a bias in favor of one mode and a prejudice against its complement.
h27a | The Lopsided Leader One of the most common patterns in leader- ship is an overbalance toward being forceful and away from being enabling. There are many variations to this theme. Some individ- uals are aggressive to the point of being abrasive and abusive. Others take so much responsibility that they crowd out their own staff. Still others are so focused on having their own unit, an extension of themselves, perform exceptionally well that they do not cooperate with peers and even have contentious relationships with them. Although it is less common, the converse pattern also occurs with regularity - an overreliance on enabling behaviors and an underreliance on forceful ones. Some managers are such good listeners, facilitators and consensus builders that their peo- ple don't know what they stand for. Other managers are so
pdjh | The Virtues and Vices of Leadership Styles
xmgs | Taking one leadership approach to the extreme while giving its complement short shrift leads to imbalance and ineffectiveness. The versatile, and therefore effective, leader can draw upon the virtuous aspects of each approach to suit the circumstances at hand. Below is a partial list of the virtues and vices associated with each of leadership's dominant dualities - forceful/enabling and strategic/operational.
bd9h | respectful of other people and so afraid of imposing their ideas on them that they fail to assert themselves. Others have such great faith in people and their potential to develop that they are painfully slow to act on performance problems.
m047 | The Versatile Leader Versatility - which is the absence of imbal- ance - is also most usefully defined in terms of pairs of oppos- ing qualities and skills. Versatile leaders are able to continually adjust their behavior, deftly applying the right approach, to the right degree, for the circumstances at hand.10 These are people who can pivot readily from forcing a tough issue to fostering har- mony, from holding a blue-sky session to digging into an imme- diate problem. In that way, the virtues of each approach are maximized and its potential liabilities are avoided. (See "The Virtues and Vices of Leadership Styles.") It may be advantageous to be exceptionally directive or tough, for example, in a turn- around or crisis, but the same approach may be counterproduc- tive in the early stages of negotiating a strategic alliance. Unfortunately, versatility is in short supply. Our research revealed that not even one in five leaders qualifies as versatile.
gy8c | Because the two sets of leadership skills in a duality comprise opposite approaches, managers can experience tension between them or even see them as contradictory or incompatible. The challenge for the versatile leader is thus to meet what F. Scott Fitzgerald called "the test of a first-rate intelligence": to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function. That challenge is all the greater, given that most leaders will have to overcome their bias in favor of one of the ideas and against the other. This notion of versatility is not to be mistaken as moderation in all things. It simply denotes a wide and flexible range of behaviors, which can indeed include immoderate behavior when extreme circum- stances require it.
