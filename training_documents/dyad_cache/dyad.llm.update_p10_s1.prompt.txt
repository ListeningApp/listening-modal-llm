You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

By the rationale of Paul Nitze and his colleagues, "the date the Soviets possess an atomic stockpile of 200 bombs would be a critical date for the United States, for the delivery of 100 atomic bombs on targets in the United States would seriously damage this country."63 This would mean that the United States would not be able to deter the USSR from initiating limited conventional wars; therefore such wars were more likely to occur after 1954. 64
tfra | This conceptual framework involved the assumption that the USSR under Stalin totally controlled the actions of its satellites and, hence, a communist military challenge to the West would be initiated only by the Soviet Union. Consequently, as Gen. Matthew B. Ridgway had put it, "By 1949, we were completely committed to the theory that the next war involving the United States would be a global war. The concept of 'limited warfare' never entered our councils." This frame of mind explains specific intelligence mistakes, primarily the underestimation of the KPA's capabilities; insufficient intelligence collection about a possible
5lm9 | This combination of American judgmental errors played a similar role to that of Stalin's misperception of Hitler's intentions prior to Barbarossa. The variance between the two cases involved three elements. First, in the Soviet case, the mistake was Stalin's personally, while in the Korean case it involved all organizations and individuals who participated in the US intelligence and policymaking processes. Second, whereas on the eve of Barbarossa, the NKGB and RU had provided excellent information about the looming threat, on the eve of the Korean War, the US intelligence bodies almost completely failed in this task. Third, while the Soviets estimated quite correctly that the Red Army was not ready in 1941 for a war against the Wehrmacht, the Americans overestimated the military capabilities of the ROK and underestimated the force of the KPA. The result was that "there was the general feeling that if attacked from North Korea the ROK army would have no trouble in repelling the invaders."67
wp2c | Each of these failures had specific causes. The belief that the Communist block was highly monolithic relied on solid evidence concerning Stalin's iron rule at home and in Eastern Europe (with the exception of Tito's Yugoslavia). It paid less attention to the fact that Soviet control over its allies' actions in the Far East was lighter, although the CIA had noted the existence of sources of tension in the USSR-PRC relationship.6 Obviously, the fact that the American intelligence community had no high-quality source in the upper echelons of the administration in either the Soviet Union or the PRC and the fact that it lacked sufficiently experienced analysts for both states (not to mention North Korea) hampered its ability to correctly understand the context in which the decision to invade was made.
us5v | The mistaken estimation of the balance of forces between the North and South Korean armies was the product of insufficient information from independent American sources about the buildup of the KPA. At the same time, American analysts believed that the South Korean reports on the KPA exaggerated its capabilities in order to convince the USA to provide the ROK with tanks, artillery and aircraft, which Washington refused to deliver for fear that it would encourage Rhee to attack the North. When it came to estimating the military capabilities of the South Korean army, which was trained by the Americans, there was a natural tendency to overestimate its capabilities. Gen. William L. Roberts, in charge of the KMAG and the 4 training of the ROK Army, gave a typical example in an interview to Time magazine three weeks before the war, when he defined the South Korean army as the "best doggone shooting Army outside the United States." There were other, more sober estimates of the quality of this army but they were less heard.70
rs2m | Finally, the failure to provide any warning prior the invasion can be attributed to a number of factors. Fundamentally, it was the mindset in the administration that ruled out the possibility of a limited war, whether in Europe or Asia. The information about KPA deployment for war was scarce, and since it mostly
uz9y | came from South Korean sources it did not receive sufficient American attention. Such reports came, moreover, against the background of an ongoing low-intensity conflict along the 38th parallel and, in many cases, were analyzed in the context of this conflict rather than a general war. And, most important, repeated warnings, in 1949 and in April and May 1950, about an incoming invasion that did not materialize created a "cry-wolf" syndrome that eroded the value any future warning." This defect influenced not only the Americans but also the South Koreans. Thus, on May 10, the ROK minister of defense warned that according to intelligence reports, the invasion was imminent. Two days later he told reporters: "Threats of invasion make us nervous but we are getting used to it. We don't get hysterical or panicky any more."72
8ov0 | ii. Decision-making
mj9m | Since no specific intelligence warning was provided prior to the North Korean invasion, it was also not preceded by any significant discussion at the decision-making level. In this sense, the American failure of June 1950 constitutes a unique case. Prior to Barbarossa, Pearl Harbor, the Yom Kippur War and other cases in this category of events, there was sufficient intelligence about an upcoming attack available to at least trigger a discussion of the validity of the threat and how best to meet it. In June 1950, the hostile act was so unexpected that it only managed to provoke such a discussion after it started. 4
94h3 | On a flight from his home in Missouri to Washington, President Truman described his gut reaction to the news:
9jx1 | This was not the first occasion when the strong had attacked the weak. I recalled some earlier instances: Manchuria, Ethiopia, Austria. I remembered how each time that the democracies failed to act it had encouraged the aggressors to keep going ahead. Communism was acting in Korea just as Hitler, Mussolini, and the Japanese had acted ten, fifteen, and twenty years earlier. I felt certain that if South Korea was allowed to fall, Communist leaders would be emboldened to over-ride nations closer to our own shores. If the Communists were permitted to force their way into the Republic of Korea without opposition from the free world, no small nation would have the courage to resist threats and aggression by stronger Communist neighbors. 13
c3lz | Truman's advisers shared a similar mood. Upon arriving in Washington, Truman told secretary of defense Louis Johnson that he was going to "hit them hard." Johnson thanked him "in a voice broken with emotion." Acheson noted in his memoirs that by this stage, he believed that the attack had been instigated by the USSR "and that it would not be stopped by anything short of force."> Indeed, the discussions in the Blair House, which started immediately on Truman's return, reflected a high level of "intra-group solidarity" and "the finest spirit of harmony."" The decision to intervene in the war was taken shortly afterward without any objection.
