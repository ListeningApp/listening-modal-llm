You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

pn9j | Figure 13.5 Main dialog box for GLM univariate
1pmc | 13.5.5 Contrasts
5z6q | There are various dialog boxes that can be accessed from the main dialog box. If a covariate is selected, the post hoc tests are disabled because the tests that we used in the previous chapter are not designed for models that include covariates.
yeoh | However, comparisons can be done by clicking Contrasts ...
b8hf | to access the
hntf | Contrasts dialog box in Figure 13.6. You cannot enter codes to specify user- defined contrasts (but see SPSS Tip 13.1); instead you can select one of the standard contrasts that we met in Table 12.6. In this example, there was a control condition (coded as the first group), so a sensible set of contrasts would be simple contrasts comparing each experimental group to the control (this results in the same contrasts as dummy coding). Click the drop-down list ( None and select a type of contrast (in this case Simple) from this list. For simple contrasts you need to specify the reference category (i.e., the category against which all other groups are compared). By default the last category is used, which for our data is the 30-minute group. We need to change the reference category to be the control group, which is the first category (assuming that you coded control as 1). We make this change by selecting
99fo | @ First . Having selected a contrast, click Change
y5r7 | to register the
lrry | selection. Figure 13.6 shows the completed dialog box. Click Continue to return to the main dialog box.
hvhm | 13.5.6 Other options
863b | You can get a limited range of post hoc tests by clicking EM Means ... to access the Estimated Marginal Means dialog box (see Figure 13.7). To specify post hoc tests, drag the independent variable (in this case Dose) from the box labelled Estimated Marginal Means: Factor(s) and Factor Interactions to the box labelled Display Means for (or click Save ... ). Once a variable has been transferred, you'll be able to select Compare main effects to activate the drop-down list ( LSD(none) ) of post hoc tests. The default is to perform a Tukey LSD post hoc test which makes no adjustment for multiple tests (and which I don't recommend). The other options are a Bonferroni post hoc test (recommended) and a Šidák correction, which is like the Bonferroni correction but is less conservative and so should be selected if you are concerned about the loss of power associated with Bonferroni. For this example we'll use the Šidák correction just for variety (we have used Bonferroni in previous examples). As well as producing post hoc tests for the Dose variable, the options we've selected will create a table of estimated marginal means for this variable: these are the

uz3c | group means adjusted for the effect of the covariate. Click
d5bi | Clicking Options ... opens a dialog box containing the options described in Jane Superbrain Box 13.3. The most useful are (in my opinion) descriptive statistics, parameter estimates, residual plot and HC4 robust standard errors (see Figure 13.7).
ba4l | Figure 13.6 Options for standard contrasts in GLM univariate
ffx8 | There is no option for specifying planned contrasts like we used in the previous chapter (see Section 12.6.2). However, these contrasts can be done if we fit the model using the regression menu. Imagine you chose some planned contrasts as in Chapter 12, in which the first contrast compared the control group to all doses of puppy therapy, and the second contrast then compared the 30-and 15-minute groups (see Section 12.4). We saw in Sections 12.4 and 12.6.2 that we specify these contrasts with codes. For the first contrast we discovered that an appropriate set of codes was -2 for the control group and then 1 for both the 30-and 15-minute groups. For the second contrast the codes were 0 for the control group, -1 for the 15- minute group and 1 for the 30-minute group (see Table 12.4). To do these contrasts when a covariate is included in the model, enter these values as two dummy variables. In other words, add a column called Dummy1 in which every person in the control group has a value of -2 and all other participants have a value of 1. Add a second column called Dummy2, in which everyone in the control group has the value 0, everyone in the 15-minute group has the value -1 and those in the 30-minute group have a value of 1. The file Puppy Love Contrast.sav includes these dummy variables. Output 13.4
s6su | Run the analysis as described in Section 13.3. The model summary and ANOVA table for the model will be identical to Output 13.1 (because we've done the same thing as before; the only difference is how the model variance is subsequently broken down with the contrasts). The <LATEX>b</LATEX> b-values for the dummy variables will be different than before because we've specified different contrasts. Output 13.4 shows the model parameters. The first dummy variable compares the control group with the 15-and 30-minute groups. As such, it compares the adjusted mean of the control group (2.93) with the average of the adjusted means for the 15-and 30-minute groups <LATEX>\left( \left( 4 . 7 1 + 5 . 1 5 \right) / 2 = 4 . 9 3 \right) .</LATEX> The <LATEX>b</LATEX> b-value for the first dummy variable should reflect the difference between these values: <LATEX>4 . 9 3 \quad - \quad 2 . 9 3 = 2 .</LATEX> We discovered in a rather complex and boring bit of Section 12.4.2 that this value gets divided by the number of groups within the contrast (i.e., 3) and so will be <LATEX>2 / 3 = 0 . 6 7</LATEX> (as in Output 13.4).4 The associated t-statistic is significant <LATEX>\left( p = 0 . 0 1 0 \right) ,</LATEX> indicating that the control group was significantly different from the combined adjusted mean of the puppy therapy groups.
y219 | 4 The output contains the value 0.668 rather than 0.67. This difference is because we've rounded values to 2 decimal places in our caculations whereas SPSS retains all decimal places in its calculations.
06ht | The second dummy variable compares the 15-and 30-minute groups, and so the <LATEX>b</LATEX> b-value should reflect the difference between the adjusted means of these groups: <LATEX>5 . 1 5 \quad - \quad 4 . 7 1 = 0 . 4 4 .</LATEX> In Section 12.4.2 we discovered that this value gets divided by the number of groups within the contrast (i.e., 2) and so will be <LATEX>0 . 4 4 / 2 = 0 . 2 2</LATEX> (as in Output 13.4). The associated <LATEX>t</LATEX> t-statistic is not significant <LATEX>\left( p = 0 . 5 9 3 \right) ,</LATEX> indicating that the 30-minute group did not produce significantly higher happiness than the 15-minute group after adjusting for love of puppies.
v3r2 | The remaining options in this dialog box are as follows:
nv42 | · Descriptive statistics: This option produces a table of means and standard deviations for each group.
xags | · Estimates of effect size: This option produces the value of partial eta squared (partial n2) - see Section 13.10.
jc47 | . Observed power: This option provides an estimate of the probability that the statistical test could detect the difference between the observed group means (see Section 2.9.7). This measure is pointless because if the F-test is significant then the probability that the effect was detected will, of course, be high. Likewise, if group differences were small, the observed power would be low. Do power calculations before the experiment is conducted, not after (see Section 2.9.8).
ko3c | · Parameter estimates: This option produces a table of model parameters (b-values) and their tests of significance for the variables in the model (see Section 13.6.2).
xek3 | · Contrast coefficient matrix: This option produces matrices of
bbpr | the coding values used for any contrasts in the analysis, which is useful for checking which groups are being compared in which contrast.
5zyf | · Homogeneity tests: This option produces Levene's test of the homogeneity of variance assumption (see Section 9.3). You'll have seen by now that I think this test needs to be taken with a pinch of salt.
9own | . Spread vs. level plot: This option produces a chart that plots the mean of each group of a factor (x-axis) against the standard deviation of that group (y-axis). This plot is useful to check that there is no relationship between the mean and standard deviation. If a relationship exists then the data may need to be stabilized using a logarithmic transformation (see Chapter 6).
bqfb | · Residual plot: This option produces a matrix scatterplot of all combinations of pairs of the following variables: observed values of the outcome, predicted values from the model, standardized residuals from the model. These plots can be used to assess the assumption of homoscedasticity. In particular, the plot of the standardized residuals against the predicted values from the model can be interpreted in a similar way to the zpred vs. zresid plot that we have discussed before.
wwdt | · Heteroskedasticity tests: There are four tests for heteroscedasticity that you can select (two variants of the Breusch-Pagan test, White's test and an F-test). For the same reasons that I don't recommend Levene's test, I also don't recommend these (that is, because they are significance tests your decisions based on them will be confounded by your sample size).
mn1r | · Parameter estimates with robust standard errors: This produces one of 5 methods (HC0 to HC4) to estimate standard errors (and, therefore, confidence intervals) for the model parameters that are robust to heteroscedasticity. These methods are described clearly in Hayes and Cai (2007). In short, HC3 has been shown to outperform HC0 to HC2 (Long & Ervin, 2000) but HC4 outperforms HC3 in some circumstances (Cribari- Neto, 2004). Basically choose HC3 or HC4.

2zpk | 13.6 Interpreting ANCOVA 13.6.1 What happens when the covariate is excluded?
epu7 | Output 13.5 shows (for illustrative purposes) the ANOVA table for these data when the covariate is not included. It is clear from the significance value, which is greater than 0.05, that puppy therapy seems to have no significant effect on happiness. Note that the total amount of variation in happiness (SST) was 110.97 (Corrected Total), of which the therapy condition accounted for 16.84 units <LATEX>\left( \mathrm { S S } _ { \mathrm { M } } \right) ,</LATEX> while 94.12 were unexplained
7od1 | differ in their levels of happiness.
0bqy | 13.6.2 The main analysis
b780 | The format of the ANOVA table in Output 13.6 is largely the same as without the covariate, except that there is an additional row of information about the covariate (Puppy_love). Looking first at the significance values, the covariate significantly predicts the dependent variable <LATEX>\left( p = 0 . 0 3 5 , \right.</LATEX> which is less than 0.05). Therefore, the person's happiness is significantly influenced by their love of puppies. What's more interesting is that when the effect of love of puppies is removed, the effect of puppy therapy is significant <LATEX>\left( p = 0 . 0 2 7 , \right.</LATEX> which is less than 0.05). The amount of variation accounted for by puppy therapy has increased to 25.19 units and the unexplained variance <LATEX>\left( \mathrm { S S } _ { \mathrm { R } } \right)</LATEX> has been reduced to 79.05 units. Notice that <LATEX>\mathrm { S S } _ { \mathrm { T } }</LATEX> has not changed; all that has changed is how that total variation is partitioned.5
ccmb | 5 I am often asked what the Corrected Model represents in this table. It is the fit of the model overall (i.e., the model containing the intercept, Puppy_love and Dose). Note that the SS of 31.92, <LATEX>d f</LATEX> of 3, <LATEX>F</LATEX> of 3.5 and <LATEX>p</LATEX> of 0.03 are identical to the values in Output 13.1 (model 2), which tested the overall fit of this model when we ran the analysis as a regression.
ma93 | This example illustrates how covariates can help us to exert stricter experimental control by taking account of confounding variables to give us a 'purer' measure of effect of the experimental manipulation. Looking back at the group means from Table 13.1, you might think that the significant F-statistic reflects a difference between the control group and the two experimental groups - because the 15-and 30-minute groups have very similar means (4.88 and 4.85) whereas the control group mean is much lower at 3.22. However, we can't use these group means to interpret the effect because they have not been adjusted for the effect of the covariate. These original means tell us nothing about the group differences reflected by the significant F. Output 13.7 gives the adjusted values of the group means (which we calculated in Section 13.3), and we use these values for interpretation (this is why we selected Display Means for in Section 13.5.6). From these adjusted means you can see that happiness increased across
c6hh | the three doses. Output 13.7
