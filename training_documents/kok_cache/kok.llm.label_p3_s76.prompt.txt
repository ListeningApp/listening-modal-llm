You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

We demonstrate that our results help to identify common threads explaining seemingly contradictory findings among previous studies on

iwn5 | Plants of sunflower (Helianthus annuus, cv 'Sunspot') were grown in pots in a growth chamber (day : night temperature, 25 : 20℃; relative humidity, 70%; photon flux density, c. 500 umol <LATEX>m ^ { - 2 } s ^ { - 1 }</LATEX> at the soil level; photoperiod, 16 h, 06:00- 22:00 h) in Wageningen. Five seeds were sown and seedlings were thinned to one plant per 7 l pot. Initial amounts of soil nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) were 0.62, 0.83, and 1.04 g per pot, respectively. Nutrient solution was added two or three times per week based on the expected plant growth. Seeds were sown weekly for 4 wk, creating four replications. Mea- surements were conducted on the <LATEX>1 1 ^ { \text { th } }</LATEX> or <LATEX>1 2 ^ { \text { th } }</LATEX> fully expanded leaf counting from the bottom, using one plant per replication.
uooz | An open gas exchange system (Li-Cor 6800; Li-Cor Inc., Lin- coln, NE, USA) and an integrated fluorescence chamber head of <LATEX>6 c m ^ { 2 }</LATEX> were used for three sets of measurements, in which various <LATEX>O _ { 2 }</LATEX> or <LATEX>C O _ { 2 }</LATEX> concentrations or various temperatures were used to create different amounts of photorespiration (Table 1). The first set used five <LATEX>O _ { 2 }</LATEX> concentrations. Four cylinders containing differ- ent mixtures of <LATEX>O _ { 2 }</LATEX> and <LATEX>N _ { 2 }</LATEX> were used. Gas from the cylinder was supplied to the Li-Cor 6800 where CO2 was blended with <LATEX>O _ { 2 } .</LATEX> For the second set, five different ambient CO2 (Ca)

u15r | concentrations in the leaf chamber were used (Table 1). For the third set, four leaf temperatures were used (Table 1). A flow rate of 200 umol s-1 was used, and leaf-to-air vapour pressure differ- ence was maintained within 0.8-1.6 kPa, for all measurements.
lq35 | For a given <LATEX>O _ { 2 } ,</LATEX> <LATEX>C O _ { 2 }</LATEX> or temperature, a photosynthetic response curve to incident irradiance <LATEX>\left( A - I _ { \mathrm { i n c } } \right)</LATEX> was measured. Leaves were first acclimated under 80 umol m 2 s-1 until A reached a steady state, which took c. 45 min. Measurements were then undertaken using a sequence of 80, 70, 60, 50, 40, 30, 25, 20, 15, 10, and <LATEX>5 \text { \mumol } m ^ { - 2 } s ^ { - 1 } ,</LATEX> with 6 min for each step. For measurements in each of the first two sets, <LATEX>O _ { 2 }</LATEX> or CO2 concentra- tions were chosen randomly. Measurements of the temperature set were conducted after the <LATEX>O _ { 2 }</LATEX> and <LATEX>\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }</LATEX> sets to avoid possible after-effects of high temperature on leaves. For the same reason, the four temperatures were set up from low to high rather than randomly.
3g9w | After the measurements for <LATEX>A - I _ { \mathrm { i n c } }</LATEX> curves, <LATEX>A - C _ { i }</LATEX> curves were determined to provide extra data to estimate <LATEX>g _ { m } .</LATEX> Leaves were adapted to an <LATEX>I _ { \mathrm { i n c } }</LATEX> of <LATEX>1 0 0 \text { \mumol m } ^ { - 2 } s ^ { - 1 }</LATEX> at 25℃ and 21% <LATEX>O _ { 2 }</LATEX> until <LATEX>A</LATEX> became stable, and curves were measured using a <LATEX>C _ { a }</LATEX> sequence of 400, 200, 100, 75, 50, 400, 400, 550, 800 and 1500 umol <LATEX>\mathrm { m o l } ^ { - 1 } ,</LATEX> with 3 min per step. Apparent <LATEX>A - C _ { i }</LATEX> curves were also assessed with heat-killed leaves, which showed that <LATEX>C O _ { 2 }</LATEX> leakage was negligible during our measurement using the Li-Cor 6800.
d09o | For each step of either the <LATEX>A - I _ { i n c }</LATEX> or <LATEX>A - C ;</LATEX> curve, PSII photo- chemical operating efficiency <LATEX>\left( \Phi _ { 2 } \right)</LATEX> was determined by Chl fluo- rescence as <LATEX>\left( 1 - F _ { s } / F _ { m } { } ^ { \prime } \right) ,</LATEX> where <LATEX>F _ { s }</LATEX> is the steady-state fluorescence and <LATEX>F _ { \mathrm { m } } ^ { \prime }</LATEX> is the maximum fluorescence as revealed using the single flash of c. 8500 umol <LATEX>\mathrm { m } ^ { - 2 } s ^ { - 1 }</LATEX> for a duration of 1.0 s. We did not use the multiphase method to determine <LATEX>F _ { \mathrm { m } } { } ^ { \prime }</LATEX> because all measure- ments were undertaken at low irradiances.
ylhz | Leaf spots used for measurements were punched out, and <LATEX>\mathrm { l e a f }</LATEX> discs were measured for light absorption (STS-VIS miniature spectrometer; Ocean Optics, Dunedin, FL, USA), twice per disc, to represent average absorption at this spot. After measuring their areas, leaf discs were dried in a 70℃ oven for 24 h to determine dry matter. Each dry leaf disc was then ground into powder, and samples of 1-3 mg were analysed for N concentrations with an EA1108 CHN-O Element Analyzer (Fisons Instruments, Waltham, MA, USA) using the Dumas combustion method.
a3td | Data and modelling analyses
ex5k | All the leaf spots had a similar N content. The average leaf N was <LATEX>1 . 6 g m ^ { - 2 }</LATEX> and average leaf absorptance was 85%. Variation among replications was small, and replicate average values were used for analysis.

The regression slopes below and above <LATEX>I _ { \mathrm { a b s } , \mathrm { t } }</LATEX> were denoted as <LATEX>b _ { 1 }</LATEX> and <LATEX>b _ { 2 } ,</LATEX> respectively, and the <LATEX>b _ { 1 } : b _ { 2 }</LATEX> ratio was calcu- lated. The intercept of the regression after <LATEX>I _ { \mathrm { a b s } . }</LATEX> is the day respiration estimated by the Kok method. Here, the intercepts of regression lines before and after <LATEX>I _ { \mathrm { a b s } , \mathrm { t } }</LATEX> are denoted as <LATEX>r _ { \mathrm { d 1 } }</LATEX> and <LATEX>r _ { \mathrm { d 2 } } ,</LATEX> respectively. According to the original interpretation of the Kok effect (Fig. 1), <LATEX>r _ { d 1 }</LATEX> is equivalent to the respiration rate in the darkness,
m5ka | <LATEX>R _ { \mathrm { d k } } .</LATEX> To examine if the decrease of <LATEX>\Phi _ { 2 }</LATEX> with increasing <LATEX>I _ { a b s }</LATEX> could partly explain the Kok effect, plots of <LATEX>A</LATEX> vs <LATEX>I _ { \mathrm { a b s } }</LATEX> P2 were made. To be compared with the <LATEX>A - I _ { a b s }</LATEX> plots, data points were allocated according to <LATEX>I _ { \mathrm { a b s } , \mathrm { t } }</LATEX> identified earlier, and linear regression slopes both below and above <LATEX>I _ { \mathrm { a b s } , \mathrm { t } }</LATEX> were denoted as <LATEX>B _ { 1 }</LATEX> and <LATEX>B _ { 2 } ,</LATEX> respec- tively. Any decrease in the <LATEX>B _ { 1 } : B _ { 2 }</LATEX> ratio, relative to the <LATEX>b _ { 1 } : b _ { 2 }</LATEX> ratio, would suggest that the decrease of <LATEX>\Phi</LATEX> with increasing <LATEX>I _ { \mathrm { a b } }</LATEX> could partly explain the Kok effect. The intercept of the linear plot of <LATEX>A</LATEX> vs <LATEX>I _ { 2 b c } \Phi _ { 2 } / 4</LATEX> after the Kok break point is the day respira- tion estimated by the Yin method (Yin et al., 2009, 2011a).
