You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

xagm | Most film studies and media studies students are familiar with the formal codes of film language - editing, framing, camera movement, lighting, sound, etc. These formal aspects of cinema work together to make meaning in ways that are familiar, or conventional, to media consumers. Consequently, it makes sense to speak of the cinema as having its own 'language'. Paradoxically, media and film studies courses involve a process of helping students to recognise (and talk about) the codes and conventions that they already know. Most students know how to 'read' the conventional codes from which a cinematic text is constructed, which is why they can enjoy these texts prior to studying them. In similar fashion, most English- speaking children can understand and tell stories in English long before they have ever heard of a preposition, a pronoun, an epithet or a metaphor. To study film form without engaging in critical analysis of its messages and values is analogous to studying English grammar without ever studying English literature. The former is about understanding the structure of the language, the latter is about the various uses to which this language is deployed within social or political contexts.
iwn5 | No dichotomy between form and content need be presupposed. It is common to conceive of form as a container and content as something more substantial contained within it. This distinction is questionable, however, when we consider how the formal components work together as a 'meaning system' to create the whole pattern that is perceived. Subject matter and abstract ideas are an integral part

jfsr | of the total system of the text. They may influence our expectations or cue us to draw certain inferences. The subject matter and abstract ideas take on a meaning that is specific to the work. For example, a historical subject such as 'the Vietnam war' is not content-neutral but is placed in relationships with other elements. Platoon (1986) is a story about two regiments of American soldiers. It addresses moral questions about individual conscience versus group loyalty and patriotism; it questions the legitimacy of authority, racism, xenophobia and the American soldiers' experience of disillusionment. All of these issues are woven into the fabric of the film's formal codes of meaning. Apocalypse Now (1979) or The Deer Hunter (1978) may have the same subject matter, and yet be shaped quite differently by the film's formal construction and our perceptions of it.
u15r | Since films are human artifacts, film-makers cannot avoid relating their works to the social, political, historical and visual culture in which they are situated. Existing works, or aspects of existing works, influence the development of new ones. Traditions, popular forms, trends and styles develop through the imitation and repetition of certain elements. These common modes of representation become conventional or generic. The relationship between the artwork and the world in which it is situated is a reciprocal one. Conventions and genres may influence the artist's output, but likewise the artwork produced from this matrix of meaning becomes a part of the matrix that will influence other artists, and our perception of 'reality' itself.
lq35 | Cinematic texts do not give us direct access to the world. Although cinema generally attempts to imitate 'real life', it presents us with a constructed world, fabricated through a carefully selected set of representations. Students might be asked: what version of 'normality' is offered in the film? What threatens this normality? What oppositions are established? The answers to these questions shape our ways of thinking, and so our very perception of the world. Often it is unclear whether art imitates life, or life imitates art. Films may reflect or inject values, myths and ideologies. Students should be encouraged to interrogate the social functions of our stories and myths.
3g9w | Gendered film studies looks at cinematic codes and narratives not just as a language but as discourse. Ideas about discourse can be traced to the French philosopher Michel Foucault (1926-84). Foucault introduced the idea that language, far from being neutral, creates meaning by the ways in which it is used and, in particular, the ways that it is used to wield power. Discourse analysis allows students to recognise film language as a medium through which relationships of power between different groups are maintained, reinforced, exposed, subverted or re-negotiated. Such analysis encourages students to question how ideas are represented systematically. It also sheds light on the struggle over ideas represented by competing discourses.

a3td | STUDYING FEMINIST FILM THEORY
ex5k | This book will help teachers explore the various ways in which ideas about gender have been represented in the predominant Hollywood narrative tradition. This tradition represents a hegemonic system of meaning. The notion of hegemony can be traced to the Italian theorist Antonio Gramsci (1891-1937). Gramsci argued that control by one minority social/political group or ideological system over its rivals need not involve force, since people can just as easily be lulled into compliance by a powerful set of messages, to which they consent in the belief that they are 'better off'. The idea of hegemony allows for flexibility in ideas over time, although always with the same group in power. According to Gramsci, the dominant groups constantly adapt their messages in order to inject them with fresh appeal in order to maintain the consent of those they dominate. The major Hollywood studios have been described as hegemonic because of the power they exert through their overseas trade organisation, the MPAA (Motion Picture Association of America). No one literally coerces audiences to consume Hollywood films. However, in reality we have little choice since Hollywood dominates the market. Even if we may disagree with, say, the pro-American (perhaps even xenophobic) subtext of many Hollywood action films, we nevertheless feel that we are 'better off' consuming the box office hits than missing out on the hyped films that command public attention (and box office takings).
9d4o | Since the sexual revolution (and global visual media explosion] of the 1960s, sex is more than what we do in private to make babies. Sex is not just a biological fact; it is an idea, or set of ideas, about men, women, biology, the 'natural', the 'normal', the 'perverse', etc. It is a public concept, constructed and consumed in a proliferation of contexts. It is no longer just a biological category, but a constructed category of experience that functions within historical, political, religious and cultural contexts. This does not mean that there is no biological dimension to human sexuality. However, the biological dimension is open to multiple interpretations. This book examines the role of institutional practices and discourses in the formation of ideas about sexuality.
cjq2 | Feminism, strictly speaking, is a doctrine or movement that advocates equal rights for women. This is what the word denotes. Denotation is the 'common sense' definition or meaning of a word. Connotations, by contrast, are implicit or suggested meanings that are not a part of the literal meaning of a word.
5esx | . A father and son were in a car accident. The father died and the son was rushed to hospital. Upon seeing the boy, the surgeon proclaimed, 'I can't operate on this boy, he's my son!' Was the surgeon lying?
m5ka | If this riddle stumps students, then the point is clear - the word 'surgeon' must carry the secondary connotation 'male'. The solution, of course, is that the surgeon is the boy's mother. But often people get hung up trying to figure out how the boy could have two fathers because they automatically assume that surgeons are male.

xnth | Connotations are associations or ideas that are somehow conjured up by a word in the minds of people who interact with it, even when that word or sign bears no literal relationship to those ideas. For example, the word 'maiden' connotes modesty, but that is not part of the word's definition. Red roses conjure up ideas about romance, despite there being nothing in the definition of a red rose that automatically makes it 'romantic'. When you hear the word 'feminist', what comes to mind? It is rather strange that the word 'feminism' has become loaded with negative connotations.
vafm | You might begin discussing feminism by asking your students how many of them are comfortable being identified with the 'feminist' label. The opposite of feminism is male sexism. Sexism is discrimination on the basis of sex, especially the oppression of women by men. Sexism may also mean the oppression of men by women, though this use of the word is relatively uncommon. Being a feminist simply means being against male sexism. It seems rather odd, then, that the word has come to carry negative associations.
2zmw | As feminist Tom Digby has noted, while there are important differences between sexism and racism, I could not help wondering why, if antiracists aren't presumed to hate whites as a group, why should antisexists be presumed to hate men as a group?' [Digby 1998: 15). One has to wonder whether the demonising of 'feminism' is symptomatic of male sexism within academic and media institutions. If not, then how did feminism come to be so misrepresented? In assessing the claim that feminists hate men, Digby says:
bf9k | Considering the absence of supporting evidence or argument, it is hard to take the substance of the assertion that feminists hate men seriously; nonetheless, because it has been such a weapon of choice among anti-feminist polemicists, its rhetorical context is worth examining. (Digby 1998: 16)
otkr | Firstly, the idea that feminism is an exclusively female movement is a gross misrepresentation. Not all females are feminists and not all feminists are female. Some of the key feminists have been men. Nor is it true that all male sexism is perpetrated by men. Scores of women collude in the oppression of women by men. Many women have contributed to public perceptions that feminism is a marginal and unnecessary 'man-hating' doctrine. It is crucial to be clear from the start that, just as not all females are feminists, not all feminists are female. And just as not all males are sexist, not all sexists are male.
ibgs | Feminist film studies, or 'gendered film studies', is intended to explore the ways in which women (and men) are represented by visual media, and film in particular. When we speak of film as a medium of representation we mean that it does not merely record reality, but constructs an image of reality through the use of codes, myths, conventions and signs. Media re-presents information to its audience, who are encouraged to see its output as a 'window on the world'. This is misleading, as

pk06 | the process of representing information is highly selective.
7wn9 | Feminists argue that media representations of gender perpetuate and reinforce the values of patriarchal society. Men tend to be cast in strong, active roles while women are shown as passive and merely 'pretty'. Film, like any discursive medium, generates meaning on two levels. The explicit message or interpretation is that which is consciously intended. For example, John Singleton, in describing his film Boyz N the Hood (1991) said, 'My main message is that African American men need to take more responsibility for raising their children, especially boys.'
wcd0 | A film's implicit meanings are less stable, and may involve contested interpretations that go beyond the intention of the film-maker. For example, many critics and commentators see the film noir movies of the 1940s as evidence of a movement within American social history and culture. More specifically, they see film noir as a reflection of post-war feelings of disillusionment and despair. They describe the 'femme fatale' as a masculine construction of femininity at a time when the social place of women was being challenged by the women who had gone to work outside the home during the war. Similarly, the social ideology of the typical Western constructs a positive image of the white population as the custodians of 'progress' and 'civility' while representing the indigenous Native American culture as 'savage' or 'primitive'. These meanings are not literally written into the script, but they can be read out of its subtext. The subtext refers to the unstated message conveyed through the form of a book, film or picture.
caos | Sexuality has to do with anatomical differences between women and men. Most of us are born with a determined set of reproductive organs (penis and testes, or ovaries and vagina), although a fraction of the population are born with both male and female genitalia. In any case, whether male, female or inter-sex, an individual's sex is a given. It is something with which we are born. Sexuality may, however, be changed through surgical procedures. Gender, by contrast, refers to those socially constructed ideas about 'boys' and 'girls', and the ways in which society perceives the differences between the sexes. We could almost say that 'sex' refers to what's between our legs while 'gender' refers to what is between our ears. Gender refers to the set of beliefs about characteristically 'masculine' and 'feminine' behaviours, traits, mannerisms and attitudes.
qrvy | Gendered film studies looks at the social purpose(s) of our stories and myths. Ideas and images of 'the masculine' or 'the feminine' are social constructions, and so we must attend to them as such, and ask who is creating these images. Whom do they benefit? Language is not a neutral medium of communication. Discourse/ language is the medium through which social power relations between different groups are reinforced or re-negotiated. We need to ask what kind of world the film constructs and whose values and ideas are being expressed through it. Do the film's representations challenge or affirm our own experiences of the world? Do

yeoh | they construct a world of appearances that does not reflect our experiences? What purpose do the film's representations serve? Whose interests are best served by it? The key here is to remember that films (and other media) do not merely record the world as it is. They construct an image of the world, a mediated version of the world.
b8hf | Following theorists such as Sarah Gilligan, it should be fairly clear that women have historically functioned within mainstream cinema as the following:
