You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use

History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

77jl | overuse of technology has on both the parent and child's ability to develop emo- tional bonds. The addition of screens into our already busy lives can add further strain on important face-to-face connection time between parents and their chil- dren.
a9ul | While use of technology is more and more of a social requirement at even very young ages, for many parents it is also a needed crutch, often due to financial necessity. If all the adults in the home need to work, screen time can become the babysitter or give the parents the break that they need just to make dinner or main- tain the bare basics of their home. Even though we are ostensibly more connected than ever through our phones, tablets and other devices, studies have shown32 that, in adults in the US aged 19 to 32, higher social media use can lead to feeling more socially isolated and emotionally disconnected than people with lower social media use. I also see how emotionally overwhelming it can be when the absence of face-to-face contact enables a certain boldness or even meanness from people that they would not necessarily enact in person. Online attacks and rejections of others can cause a great deal of loss and psychological injury. As in all levels, there can be damage and trauma at the local culture and communities level, but there can, of course, also be healing. When someone grows up in a home or town where no one really looks and feels like they do, finding an online community where their voice and experiences are received, honored and even celebrated can be deeply healing to their sense of self and connection.
9jxp | School culture is another important aspect to this level, since most children spend the majority of their waking hours in the classroom, cafeterias and school- yard. I once had a client who joked that you should never trust anyone who said they liked their junior high school experience. I later learned that this comment was the sarcastic mask in front of some very painful and traumatic events she experi- enced in early adolescence. Now in her 40s, this woman had lasting scars from the social hierarchies and mean girl culture at her junior high school. She had experi- enced overt social rejection and repeated emotional and verbal cruelty from her peers. Coupled with the highly competitive academic culture of her school, the
ejzi | educational and social pressures became too unbearable and thus she attempted to take her life at age 13.
lgbb | While I was writing this book, my father sent me a newspaper article in which he was interviewed about the sexual assault he experienced from his high school principal over 40 years earlier. In the article, he is quoted as relating the alco- holism, drug addiction and mental illness of his adult life as having its origin in the profound shame he experienced from being sexually assaulted at school. When I spoke to him about it, he also added that the years of corporal punishment and the Catholic school culture of overt disapproval further reinforced and solidified his shame. His traumas at this level had a lasting effect on his ability to bond with me as my parent. When I was eight years old, my father went into rehab, but his sobri- ety did not initially improve our relationship as much as both of us might have anticipated. Although the alcoholism and drug addiction were treated, his trauma, shame and deep-rooted feeling of unworthiness to be loved-even from his own child-remained for decades. My father had a strong desire to be available to me, but the absence of healing from his high school traumas and the ensuing shame left him, in many ways, incapable of bonding, connecting and responding in the nurturing, present and attuned ways that both of us wanted.
hdy5 | How safe we feel on the streets of our neighborhood, whether we have to lock our front door or not, how welcome and embraced we feel from the communities that we encounter and whether the leaders of our various communities are benev- olent or unkind are all factors that I see as impacting our sense of safety, security and ability to explore. Traumas that arise from bullying, community violence or school shootings should not be underestimated. But although many different types of attachment traumas can happen at this level, it is also a level that can offer need- ed healing and attachment repair. The homes of friends, spiritual communities, substance abuse support groups, sports and dance teams or online communities can become our safe havens where we are freer to be ourselves, are understood and are seen and loved for who we are.
rlsz | Social Level
wf16 | The next outer dimension in this nested model refers to the larger societal struc- tures and systems that we live in, such as our economic, legal, medical and polit- ical systems, as well as our religious institutions. It is at the social level that prej- udice and oppression are institutionalized through the laws and power structures that either favor or discriminate against people based on age, race, sex, class, phys- ical ability, sexual orientation and relationship orientation (including monogamy and polyamory). Who is considered legally legitimate or not at a societal level, who has access to health care and education, whether or not you have rights to your children or whether or not you are subject to the institutionalization of birth prac- tices that can interfere with parent-child bonding are all factors that can be trauma- tizing and attachment-compromising. Additionally, whether or not we are a part of a legally protected class has massive implications for how safe and secure we feel in the world. The sociologist Johan Galtung refers to this as structural violence.33 Distinguished from physical violence (yet often intertwined), structural violence refers to a type of violence that is often invisible yet intricately built into social structures. People's lives are complicated, confined or even lost because of hetero- sexism, classism, racism, ableism and sexism. Structural violence may be less obvious and direct than physical violence, but it is just as impactful and harmful. It creates a disparity between a person's potential reality-the life they could conceiv- ably live-compared to the limited reality that they find themselves in.
syuf | Societal issues including homophobia, racism, sexism and mononormativity do not exist solely at the societal level. They influence and play out in very real and impactful ways, including the neighborhoods and homes we live in, which schools we have access to and what funding they receive, how we approach or avoid others and how we are treated by teachers, taxi drivers or clerks at the grocery store. A black man is likely to have a very different experience of how safe and secure he feels when walking past a police officer than a white woman in the same scenario. In a time when mass shootings are rampant in the US and amid the current polit- ical climate, a person of color who practices Islam will likely feel very differently
n8b1 | walking into a mosque than a white Catholic person walking into a church. These societal experiences can then trickle all the way down to the self level, where social- level issues become internalized as forms of shame or self-loathing, again hin- dering one's ability to bond, attach and connect. Studies have shown that children with socioeconomic risks are more likely to develop disorganized attachment34 and that children are at an increased risk of disorganized attachment when they are in non-maternal care for more than 60 hours a week, due to parental work hours.35
