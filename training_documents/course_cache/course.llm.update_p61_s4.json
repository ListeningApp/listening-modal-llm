Habitat and time - species uses the same habitat at different times or different habitats at the same time\n351p | Four. Habitat and habitat - species overlapping in horizontal habitat often differ in vertical habitat or vice versa\nzzcb | Five. Food type and food type - species may eat similar-sized foods but different species or types, or vice versa\nmxnx | Differential Niche Overlap and Complementarity two\n11k8 | Seasonal temporal variation in habitat and dietary overlap among granivorous birds in an Arizonian grassland (spatio-temporal dietary niche segregation):\ntwwy | Rainy Season (food plenty): Birds specialize on a seed type across overlapping habitat types\nfyp8 | Dry Season (food scarce): Birds specialize on separate habitats foraging on many seed types\nz994 | Differential Niche Overlap and Complementarity three\nvvqn | Differential Niche Overlap between four hypothetical species (A, B, C, D)\np6xg | Horizontal niche dimension considered alone: Species C is apparently in trouble facing diffuse competition from both B and D - coexistence doubtful.\nbppc | Vertical niche dimension considered alone: Species C subject to heavy niche overlap with A, and moderate overlap from B - coexistence doubtful.\nilnw | Both Niche dimensions considered simultaneously\nf3rc | Resulting Niche Space\nd7bx | A, B, C versus D disjunct\ngx97 | A versus B disjunct\nppkp | A and C abutting\n8br6 | Only little overlap between species B and C\nde3k | Differential Niche Overlap and Complementarity four\n2kb3 | Foraging Techniques of five sympatric Bird Species in Oak Forest\nlqcx | The time spent on three foraging tactics for each species monitored: One. Hovering, Two. Gleaning, Three. Hawking\n3h7w | All five species adopt all strategies, but to a variable degree.\nth5p | Gleaners: Parus inornatus (tit), Vermivora celata (warbler).\nb7nk | Hover-Gleaners: Vireo gilvus, V. huttoni (shrike-warblers).\ncbb5 | Glean-Hover-Hawker: Polioptila caerulea (gnatcatcher)\n5qcf | Differences in foraging techniques may reduce direct interference and also resource exploitation as each method is best designed for a particular prey type in a particular microhabitat\n8u2c | Hovering\nc1e3 | Equilateral Triangle\n7pez | Hawking\nqs5t | Differential Niche Overlap and Complementarity five\nen4s | Differential Niche Overlap and Complementarity six\ncsb5 | Spatial Foraging Niche Separation of two water boatmen bugs (Heteroptera)\ni096 | Perch positions monitored quantitatively over time:\ntlzt | Species a prefers near bottom fifty-five percent, and least at water surface five percent\n6iyf | Species b prefers middle of water fifty-eight percent, and least at water surface seven percent\no1nk | In this way they separate foraging depth and reduces competition\nmnaf | Community Wide Niche Partitioning one\n0yxe | Nine squirrel species in African rainforest:\nerre | Three Habitat types:\n835g | Dense growth one species, Flooded forest one species\nx3l9 | Mature and Disturbed Forest seven species \nd2fj | Trophic specialization one species \ngeyi | Bark scraping on tree trunks\n2181 | Frugivores separate spatially six species :\n9ubl | Ground three species and Arboreal three species\no8pj | In each of the two vertical guilds, the three species separate on fruit size and hardness both of which is related to jaw musculature which again is related to mere body size (Hutchinson's Body Size Ratio Rule)\n27b9 | Community Wide Niche Partitioning two\n09xa | Nineteen species of Coral Reef Fish at Great Barrier Reef, Australia:\nyi97 | Segregation into four main trophic levels in which size and body shape vary:\n4zj7 | Generalists typical fish shape, vary in size following Hutchinson's Rule\n3wgh | Hard corals six Small typical shape and extra deep body, two large deep body\nuvo3 | Soft and Hard corals four species three Large, one Small all typical shape\nyjbv | Other invertebrates three species Large typical shape and deep body\nl6it | Niche Overlap, Partitioning and Coexistence\nh8x1 | Summarizing Flow Chart showing the various ways that ecologically similar species may segregate or differentiate the overlap of their foraging niches Birds\n6qtq | Summary: Differential Niche Overlap and Complementarity\nwm3n | One. Differential Niche Overlap comprises three major dimensions:\n1anr | Spatial: Horizontal (habitat types) and vertical (altitude, vegetation strata)\n600w | Temporal: Time of day and night, seasonal variation (dry and wet, summer and winter)\n60w7 | Trophic: Generalist or Specialist dietary trait, foraging techniques/ strategies\n1a5g | Two. Niche Differentiation, Complementarity and Coexistence often interrelated:\n0oof | Niche dimensionality one to Niche differentiation one to Complementarity one\np930 | High niche differentiation predisposes Complementarity to Coexistence\nxhc7 | High overlap in some niche dimensions tolerated by otherwise low overlaps\n6a60 | Summary: Differential Niche Overlap and Complementarity\ndfgj | Three. Community wide niche partitioning limits similarity and increase coexistence:\n6ptp | High overlap in vertical and horizontal space leads to low trophic overlap\nqjlj | High dietary overlap leads to low, abutting, disjunct and spatial niches\nkva7 | High dietary and spatial overlap leads to low overlap in temporal niche\nssp0 | Four. Coexistence facilitated by limiting similarity and hence niche overlap:\n108o | Spatial separation: vertical-horizontal habitat ranges, territoriality\nd2za | Resource partitioning: Diet and foraging techniques diverging\nr38m | Morphological divergence: Body size, feeding apparatus (teeth, claws, beaks)\nqq0z | ABCS three hundred forty-nine: Objectives of Lecture six - Niche Partitioning and Species Richness\nrgva | One. An Introduction to modeling of species richness using niche partitioning:\nmlcd | What pertinent factors within the niche concept theory predicts diversity?\n2qe7 | How are these factors interrelated and what are the dynamics among them?\nlpzf | Two. An Overview of various models to explain species numbers in space and time:\n24rz | Are they mathematical stochastic or deterministic models?\n091m | Graphically explained models to support the notational equations?\nsot6 | How does the models explain the links between niche dimensionality and how many species than can be 'packed' into a natural system or community?\nd6sf | Three. A Comparison of various models to explain species numbers on islands:\n7haq | The species-area models explained - islands and mainland islands\nubwu | The island biogeography model: immigration, emigration, speciation, extinction\nucme | Four. An Account of the theories behind speciation and extinction processes:\nqnl5 | What drives speciation in relation to niche overlap and competition?\nwdx9 | What drives extinction in relation to niche overlap and competition?\nn1xr | Ds equals P one plus CÃ£, where Du\nohpj | Based on MacArthur's model, communities diversity is shaped in three potentially interacting ways:\nry5f | One. Resource base: How big is N in the niche hypervolume. Areas with more available resource have larger Dr and C components (niche space) and can therefore contain more species.\n31wg | Two. Niche width or degree of specialization of component species. Narrow niches can be packed tighter and thus contain more species.\ncelk | Three. Niche overlap between species. Greater species overlap leads to greater diversity even if two communities are similar in both areas.\n3mf9 | Four. Niche curve shape also counts, in thick-tailed (leptokurtic) curves more species can be packed on the same resource gradient than thin-tailed (platykurtic) curves seventy-three\nz2rd | Niche Partitioning and Species Richness two\nvqld | Forest Succession and Increased Bird Diversity (Species Richness):\n```",
