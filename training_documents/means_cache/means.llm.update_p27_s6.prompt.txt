You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

his3 | This example illustrates how covariates can help us to exert stricter experimental control by taking account of confounding variables to give us a 'purer' measure of effect of the experimental manipulation. Looking back at the group means from Table 13.1, you might think that the significant F-statistic reflects a difference between the control group and the two experimental groups - because the 15-and 30-minute groups have very similar means (4.88 and 4.85) whereas the control group mean is much lower at 3.22. However, we can't use these group means to interpret the effect because they have not been adjusted for the effect of the covariate. These original means tell us nothing about the group differences reflected by the significant F. Output 13.7 gives the adjusted values of the group means (which we calculated in Section 13.3), and we use these values for interpretation (this is why we selected Display Means for in Section 13.5.6). From these adjusted means you can see that happiness increased across
m50z | the three doses. Output 13.7
me84 | Output 13.8 shows the parameter estimates selected in the Options dialog box and their bootstrapped confidence intervals and p-values (bottom table). These estimates result from Dose being coded using two dummy coding variables. The dummy variables are coded with the last category (the category coded with the highest value in the data editor, in this case the 30-minute group) as the reference category. This reference category (labelled Dose=3 in the output) is coded with a 0 for both dummy variables (see Section 12.2 for a reminder of how dummy coding works). Dose=2, therefore, represents the difference between the group coded as 2 (15 minutes) and the reference category (30 minutes), and <LATEX>\mathrm { D o s e } = 1</LATEX> represents the difference between the group coded as 1 (control) and the reference category (30 minutes). The b-values represent the differences between the adjusted means in Output 13.7 and the significances of the <LATEX>t</LATEX> t-tests tell us whether these adjusted group means differ significantly. The <LATEX>b</LATEX> for <LATEX>\mathrm { D o s e } = 1</LATEX> in Output 13.8 is the difference between the adjusted means for the control group and the 30-minute group, <LATEX>2 . 9 2 6 \quad - \quad 5 . 1 5 1 = - \quad 2 . 2 2 5 ,</LATEX> and the <LATEX>b</LATEX> for <LATEX>D o s e = 2</LATEX> is the difference between the adjusted means for the 15-minute group and the 30-minute group,
o56m | <LATEX>4 . 7 1 2 \quad - \quad 5 . 1 5 1 = - \quad 0 . 4 3 9 .</LATEX> The degrees of freedom for the t-test of the b-values are <LATEX>N \quad - \quad k \quad - \quad 1</LATEX> (see Section 9.2.5), in which <LATEX>N</LATEX> is the total sample size (in this case 30) and <LATEX>k</LATEX> is the number of predictors (in this case 3, the two dummy variables and the covariate). For these data, <LATEX>d f = 3 0 \quad - \quad 3 \quad - \quad 1 = 2 6 .</LATEX> Based on the bootstrapped significance and confidence intervals (remember you'll get different values than me because of how bootstrapping works), we could conclude that the 30-minute group differs significantly from the control group, <LATEX>p = 0 . 0 2 1</LATEX> (Dose=1 in the table), but not from the 15-minute group, <LATEX>p = 0 . 5 5 8 ,</LATEX> <LATEX>\left( D o s e = 2 \right.</LATEX> in the table).
slz6 | The final thing to note is the value of <LATEX>b</LATEX> for the covariate (0.416), which is the same as in Output 13.2 (when we ran the analysis through the regression menu). This value tells us that if love of puppies increases by one unit, then the person's happiness should increase by just under half a unit (although there is nothing to suggest a causal link between the two); because the coefficient is positive we
90k5 | know that as love of puppies increases so does happiness. A negative coefficient would mean the opposite: as one increases, the other decreases.
9m8s | Output 13.9 repeats the parameter estimates from Output 13.8 but with standard errors, p-values and confidence intervals robust to heteroscedasticity (the HC4 estimates that we asked for). We can interpret the effects for Dose in the same way as for the regular and Bootstrap <LATEX>p</LATEX> p-values and confidence intervals. For the effect of puppy love, the HC4 robust confidence interval and <LATEX>p</LATEX> p-value supports the conclusion from the non-robust model: the <LATEX>p</LATEX> p-value is 0.038, which is less than 0.05, and the confidence interval does not contain zero (0.025, 0.807). However, the bootstrap confidence interval (Output 13.8) contradicts this conclusion because it contains zero <LATEX>\left( - 0 . 0 2 3 , 0 . 6 9 8 \right)</LATEX> and has a <LATEX>p = 0 . 0 5 2</LATEX> (again, we're reminded of how daft it is to have a threshold that yields such opposing conclusions from such small differences in a value).
