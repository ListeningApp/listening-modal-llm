Linearization of the Gravitational Acceleration\nyfum | Consider the gravitational acceleration on the chaser, due to the two primaries:\nppx4 | G sub M of R sub C equals negative Mu R sub C over R sub C cubed, G sub E of R sub C plus R sub EM equals negative one minus Mu R sub C plus R sub EM over the norm of R sub C plus R sub EM cubed. These terms can be linearized by means of a Taylor expansion to the first order around the target position. For the lunar gravitational acceleration term we have:\nqf11 | G sub M of R sub C approximately equals G sub M of R plus the partial derivative of G sub M of Q with respect to Q evaluated at Q equals R times R sub C minus R equals negative Mu R over R cubed minus Mu over R cubed times the identity matrix minus three times R R transpose over R squared, rho, whereas for the Earth gravitational acceleration term:\n",
