        "content": "ccpt | Twenty-five\n0fpw | Moreover, M satisfies the saturation condition absolute value of M of T comma X equals one almost everywhere.\ndqn8 | Remark thirteen. From twenty-five, we can say that, for lower values of zeta, the magnetic nonlocal damping vanishes and the classical switching continues forever. In other words, the magnetization precesses several times around the effective field direction before it reaches equilibrium.\ncop0 | Four. Concluding Remarks\nlhkq | In this paper, we have considered nonlocal damping in magnetization dynamics. The model consists of a generalized LLG equation that contains a term characterizing nonlocal damping expressed in terms of delta partial with respect to T M in the effective field. The long time behaviour of the solutions is characterized and the sensitivity of the model to nonlocal damping parameter\n82ju | Journal of Applied Mathematics\ny2qo | is discussed. The results obtained can be applied without difficulty to the case of effective field with anisotropy and demagnetizing fields. Note that the model considered in this paper neglects the additional damping due to transversal spin currents whose form is M cross O comma M. In this case the LLG equation takes the following form.\n1piq | M minus M cross M equals negative one plus X squared M\n7fqw | times the amplitude of A M plus delta O comma M plus zeta M cross O comma M.\nrhaz | Interestingly, the additional damping cannot be written in terms of the free energy, and therefore it cannot be derived from the functional derivative of the free energy with respect to the local magnetization. This new term can significantly change the domain-wall structure in ferromagnetic materials. It would be interesting to consider this problem from both the theoretical and the numerical points of view. In particular, global existence of weak solutions will require more detailed studies.\nwak1 | We finally mention that an important progress was done to design schemes constructing the weak solutions to the general LLG equation. Several schemes were proposed and their convergence to weak solutions was proved. A significant step forward in the convergence theory of numerical schemes has been done recently. This will be helpful to give a strategy for efficient computer implementation which may reflect the true nature of the augmentation of the LLG model considered in this paper.\nwtfz | Conflict of Interests\nqy1i | The authors declare that there is no conflict of interests regarding the publication of this paper.",
