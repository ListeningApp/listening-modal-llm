You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

y4mj | Person-Centered Antecedents
vpgq | Although a large number of person-centered character- istics could be considered in a predictive model of voice, practical and statistical concerns limit any single study to a manageable subset of those characteristics (Cohen, 1990). Therefore, in our study, we chose to focus on one person-centered characteristic from each category sug- gested by Van Dyne et al. (1995; i.e., affective characteris- tics and individual differences). Building on past voice research, we chose satisfaction as our affective construct because it is the key antecedent in existing models of voice. Extending past research, we included global self- esteem. Global self-esteem was chosen because of its im- portance in predicting behavior that is somewhat risky to the self.
ousl | Satisfaction With the Group
m4ju | Job satisfaction is defined as a pleasurable emotional state resulting from positive cognitive appraisal of one's job or job experiences (Locke, 1976). To date, satisfaction has been the primary antecedent included in models of voice behavior. Researchers typically use Hirschman's (1970) framework and describe voice as a response to dissatisfaction in the context of overall satisfaction or prior satisfaction. Some studies report no relationship be- tween satisfaction and voice (Saunders et al., 1992), and others report a weak but positive relationship (Farrell & Rusbult, 1992; Rusbult et al., 1988; Withey & Cooper, 1989). However, job satisfaction is complex and multidi- mensional (Locke, 1976) and the use of overall job satis- faction may be problematic because it confounds sources of satisfaction. Overall job satisfaction scores based on measures containing multiple components (e.g., work it- self, pay, promotion opportunities, recognition, benefits,

xagm | working conditions) are ambiguous and can lead to weak or inconsistent empirical findings. For example, an indi- vidual would be characterized as having moderate overall job satisfaction if he or she reported high levels of satis- faction with some things (e.g., work itself, pay, and pro- motion opportunities) and low levels of satisfaction with others (e.g., recognition, benefits, and working condi- tions). Another individual would also be characterized as having moderate job satisfaction if he or she reported moderate levels of satisfaction for everything. Although these two people would have equal overall scores on a measure of job satisfaction, they most likely have different thoughts and feelings regarding their work experience. To the extent that these differences lead to different behav- iors, the use of overall job satisfaction may be problematic (Wanous & Lawler, 1972).
iwn5 | We suggest that satisfaction with a specific aspect of the work situation rather than overall job satisfaction may be a better predictor of voice behavior. In most organiza- tions, the most proximal work-related source of affect for employees is their group. When employees must interact with others in their work group to perform their jobs, their affective response to this interdependence can be a major source of low and/or high satisfaction (Hackman, 1992). Consistent with social exchange theory (Blau, 1964), we would expect those who are satisfied with their group to be more highly motivated, to invest effort in developing new ideas, and to take the time to communicate these ideas to others in the group. From this perspective, speaking up with constructive recommendations can be viewed as a reciprocal response based on high levels of satisfaction with the group.
uooz | Satisfaction with the group should also relate to voice because those who experience positive affective states are likely to be proactive in taking steps to maintain their good feelings (Carlson, Charlin, & Miller, 1988; George, 1996). According to Locke (1976), "job satisfaction re- sults from the perception that one's job fulfills or allows the fulfillment of one's important job values" (p. 1307). Values are relatively stable and enduring individual beliefs that have pervasive and fundamental effects on behavior (Rokeach, 1973; Schwartz & Bilsky, 1987). Combining the general importance of values and their specific rele- vance to satisfaction, it is reasonable to expect that indi- viduals who are satisfied with their work group should be more attached to the group and more dependent on the group to maintain feelings of satisfaction and to fulfill their values. The implication is that individuals who are highly satisfied with their group should be more likely to engage in proactive behavior (e.g., voice) in the interest of group viability.
pxbq | Of course, it is possible that those who are highly satis- fied with their group may have fewer issues about which to offer voice and, therefore, may be less likely to engage
jfsr | in voice. However, we suggest that individuals who are highly satisfied with their group should be more vigilant and more likely to offer suggestions regarding issues that might detract from the group's long-term viability than individuals who are dissatisfied. Highly satisfied individu- als should also be more willing to invest the time and effort required to deal with these issues (i.e., formulating and presenting ideas and suggestions for change ). Individ- uals who are highly dissatisfied with their group (perhaps due to an awareness of many problems and issues ), on the other hand, should be more likely to express themselves by complaining (e.g., "I am very unhappy with this group because of all the back stabbing"). Complaints are ex- pressions of discontent or dissatisfaction, and unlike voice, do not include or imply suggestions for change or improvement (Kowalski, 1996). Thus, even though highly satisfied individuals may have fewer issues about which to offer voice than dissatisfied individuals, we believe those who are satisfied are more likely to offer construc- tive ideas and suggestions for change. Stated as a hypothesis,
u15r | Hypothesis 1. Satisfaction with the group will be positively related to voice such that those who are more satisfied with their group will engage in more voice than individuals who are less satisfied with their group.
lq35 | Global Self-Esteem
3g9w | Self-esteem is an important predictor of attitudes and behavior in work and nonwork contexts (Brockner, 1988; Wells & Marwell, 1976). Global self-esteem is the degree of positive self-worth that an individual ascribes to him- or herself (Brockner, 1988). It indicates the degree to which individuals believe they are capable, significant, successful, and worthy (Coopersmith, 1981, p. 5) and is often thought of in terms of self-confidence and general- ized self-competence (Tharenou, 1979). Research dem- onstrates that those with high self-esteem conform less (see, e.g., Wells & Marwell, 1976) and exhibit more initia- tive and assertiveness than those with low self-esteem (Crandall, 1973).
d09o | By definition, voice behavior requires proactive and assertive nonconformance. Behavior that is change-ori- ented and challenging is risky because organizations often view dissent and other nonconforming behaviors nega- tively (Nemeth & Staw, 1989). In addition, pressure to conform, particularly in work groups, can be substantial because speaking up and engaging in voice can threaten cohesiveness and result in sanctions against those who express divergent opinions (Asch, 1956; Festinger, 1957; Hackman, 1992; Nemeth, 1986). Accordingly, traits such as self-esteem should be important predictors of voice behavior, particularly in the context of work groups. For

a3td | VOICE IN WORK GROUPS
ex5k | example, Staw and Boettger (1990) speculated that self- esteem and willingness to stand up to authority would be important personality determinants of task revision (proactive and innovative behavior that is not specified by the job). Similarly, Van Dyne et al. (1995) included global self-esteem as an important antecedent of voice in their proposed model. This is consistent with Near and Miceli (1985) and Miceli and Near (1992), who sug- gested, in their work on whistle-blowing, that low self- esteem individuals may withdraw from involvement in controversial situations and also that high self-esteem in- dividuals might be more likely to get involved in attempts to reform the situation (Near & Miceli, 1987). Although whistle-blowing is different from voice in that it focuses on alerting others to wrongdoing, it is similar to voice in that it requires initiative and nonconformance. On the ba- sis of this reasoning, we expect that group members with high self-esteem will be more proactive in engaging their environments and will be less influenced by conformity pressures than individuals with low self-esteem. Thus,
9d4o | Hypothesis 2. Global self-esteem will be positively related to voice such that individuals with high levels of global self-esteem will engage in more voice than individuals with low levels of global self-esteem.
cjq2 | Situational Antecedents
5esx | Although the discussion so far has focused on person- centered antecedents of voice, it is likely that situational factors also influence voice. Situations provide direct stimuli as well as the context for interpreting other stimuli and therefore have the potential to influence behavioral responses directly and indirectly (Hackman, 1992). Al- though a large number of situational variables could be considered in a comprehensive model of voice, the litera- ture on small groups suggests two factors that should be particularly important for predicting voice. These situa- tional factors are group size and the extent to which groups are self- versus traditionally managed.
m5ka | Group Size
byu8 | Past research demonstrates strong relationships be- tween group size and member involvement (Hackman & Vidmar, 1970; Thomas & Fink, 1963) and conformity behavior (Asch, 1956). Diffusion of responsibility tends to be positively related to the number of members in a group (Latane, 1981). In larger groups, it is difficult to identify individual members' relative contributions and therefore individuals feel less responsible for group-level outcomes. Individual members, in essence, feel more anonymous. The result is that members of large groups become less involved in group matters relative to members of smaller groups. In addition, conformity pressure in-
76b0 | 857
zxz6 | creases with group size (Gerard, Wilhelmy, & Conolley, 1968), making it less likely that individual members will speak up and express challenging or change-oriented ideas. Because voice is proactive, discretionary, and chal- lenging, it should be especially susceptible to the diffusion of responsibility and conformity pressures of large groups. Members of large groups should feel less involved and be less willing to engage in challenging behavior (e.g., voice) than members of small groups. Accordingly, we expected
xnth | Hypothesis 3. Group size will be negatively related to voice such that individuals in smaller groups will engage in more voice than individuals in larger groups.
vafm | Style of Management: Self- Versus Traditional Management
2zmw | Self-managed work groups are self-regulating. They perform a complete task, encourage differential member contributions based on skills and abilities, and exercise discretion over work methods and task schedules (Cum- mings, 1978). The amount of autonomy and discretion delegated to a work group influences each member's sense of involvement and responsibility (Walton & Hackman, 1986). In self-managed groups, therefore, members are likely to take "personal responsibility" and feel "person- ally accountable" for outcomes (Hackman, 1986, p. 93). Employees in self-managed groups are also linked to- gether by high levels of task interdependence and shared responsibility for group performance. Consequently, member jobs are more complex and individuals are more broadly involved in group decision making than those who work in traditional groups that function under control systems based on a hierarchy (Kemp, Wall, Clegg, & Cordery, 1983; Pearce & Ravlin, 1987; Wall, Kemp, Jack- son, & Clegg, 1986). Although research on self-managed groups is inconsistent and does not demonstrate higher overall effectiveness (Polley & Van Dyne, 1994), research has shown that self-managed groups have higher job com- plexity and that individuals in complex jobs exhibit more voice (Van Dyne, Graham, & Dienesch, 1994). On the basis of these findings, we suggest that members of self- managed work groups will be especially proactive in ex- pressing their opinions, making innovative suggestions, and developing recommendations for change. Specifically, we hypothesized
bf9k | Hypothesis 4. Individuals in self-managed groups will en- gage in more voice relative to individuals in traditionally managed groups.
otkr | Person X Situation Interactions
ibgs | Although many researchers have argued (see, e.g., Ekehammer, 1974; Schneider, 1983) that "individual be-

pk06 | havior in organizations is best conceptualized as the result of interactive processes that depend on the simultaneous interplay of differences between situations and differences between individuals" (Hattrup & Jackson, 1996, p. 507), few have actually pursued this approach. Instead, re- searchers have tended to focus on either personal or situa- tional predictors. This is certainly the case in voice re- search where researchers have focused almost exclusively on individual affect ( satisfaction) and have rarely consid- ered situational factors or the interaction between person- centered characteristics and situational characteristics. Considering person-situation interactions allows identi- fication of systematic relationships that occur when the behavior of different types of individuals varies based on the situation. In the next two sections, we draw upon and extend behavior plasticity theory (Brockner, 1988) to specify the nature of Person X Situation interactions on voice behavior.
7wn9 | Self-Esteem and Behavior Plasticity
wcd0 | Research on self-esteem as a main effect has yielded weak and inconsistent results. To address this issue, Brockner (1988) developed behavior plasticity theory. This theory proposes that self-esteem moderates the rela- tionship between situational factors and individual behav- ior such that those with low self-esteem are more respon- sive to external cues (situational factors) than those with high self-esteem. Brockner gave three reasons for this relationship. First, low self-esteem individuals are less certain of their own beliefs and behaviors and are more influenced by their environments. Second, because low self-esteem individuals are dependent on others for posi- tive feedback, they respond to others by conforming in an attempt to gain approval. Finally, low self-esteem indi- viduals are especially sensitive to negative feedback. They tend to overgeneralize, apply the feedback broadly, and change their behavior in a variety of situations. In con- trast, those with high self-esteem are less influenced by situational factors and are more likely to exhibit behav- ioral autonomy.
