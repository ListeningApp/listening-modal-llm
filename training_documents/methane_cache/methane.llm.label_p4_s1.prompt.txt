You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

wcd0 | Figure 5. Metal centers in the pMMO crystal structures. The locations of the dicopper, monocopper, and zinc/copper sites are shown as cyan and gray spheres within a protomer of M. capsulatus (Bath) pMMO (left). In the spmoB protein, two transmembrane helices (gray) linking the periplasmic N- and C-terminal cupredoxin domains of pmoB (magenta) are replaced with a GKLGGG linker connecting residue 172 to residue 265. The structure of spmoB has not been determined. The M. capsulatus (Bath) pMMO structure contains dicopper, monocopper, and zinc sites (top right, PDB accession code 3RGB). In the Methylocystis sp. strain Rockwell pMMO structure (bottom right), the dicopper site is modeled with a single copper ion and a solvent molecule, and the zinc/copper site is occupied by copper (PDB accession code 4PHZ). Soaking the crystals in zinc reveals a fourth ligand to this site, Glu201 (PDB accession code 4PI2). Solvent ligands are shown as red spheres.
caos | subunit from Nitrosocaldus yellowstonii AMO, indicating conservation of this site over the broad pMMO/AMO superfamily. However, in this structure, the copper ion is involved in a crystal lattice contact, and the N-terminal histidine ligand is disordered.34 In the M. capsulatus (Bath) pmoB subunit, an additional copper ion is present at the interface of the two cupredoxin domains, coordinated by His48 and His72 (Figure 5). The His48 ligand is not conserved in other pMMO sequences, and the site is not observed in the other pMMO structures. 24-26
qrvy | Several lines of evidence suggest that the crystallographically modeled dicopper center is the active site of pMMO. First, the ligands to the dicopper center are conserved in almost all methanotroph pmoB sequences as well as in homologous subunits from all members of the pMMO/AMO superfamily.34 The only exceptions are a few pmoB sequences from methane- oxidizing Verrucomicrobia.36,37 These sequences are evolutio- narily distant, and it is possible that their extreme growth environments (pH 0.8-5, 22-88 ℃) require a different type of active site." Second, metal loading of apo membrane-bound pMMO only results in methane oxidation after addition of 2-3 copper equivalents per 100 kDa aßy pMMO protomer, consistent with an active site requiring more than one copper 26,38 Third and most important, a recombinant soluble fragment of the M. capsulatus (Bath) pmoB subunit (spmoB, Figure 5) can oxidize methane to methanol in the presence of copper, and this activity is abolished upon mutagenesis of two or all three of the ligands to the dicopper site. 8,39 Consistent with this model, mutagenesis of the ligand equivalent to His139 in a homologous Mycobacterium NBB4 hydrocarbon mono- oxygenase (HMO) that oxidizes C2-C4 alkanes reduces activity significantly. However, in that enzyme, ~20% residual activity is retained,40 perhaps due to copper binding by the other ligands, as has been observed for spmoB.39

1pmc | Both Cul and Cu" are routinely detected in pMMO by X-ray absorption spectroscopy,33 and all samples of pMMO exhibit an electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopic signal attributable to a type 2 Cu" site.39,41,42 Correlation of EPR signals with specific crystallographic copper sites in M. capsulatus (Bath) pMMO has been facilitated by comparative analysis of pMMO and the spmoB proteins.3 EPR and metal analysis using pMMO and spmoB variants that disrupt the monocopper (H48N,H72A), dicopper (H33,137,139A), or both copper (H48N_H33,72,137,139A) sites indicate the presence of a valence localized, mixed valence Cu'Cu" center at the dicopper site and a Cu' ion at the monocopper site. The location of the Cu" is proposed to be valence scrambled between the two copper binding sites with one copper coordinated by His137 and His139, and one coordinated by His33 and the N-terminal amino group. No water or hydroxide ligands to the Cu" ion are detected.
5z6q | An additional metal binding site is present in the pmoC subunit of pMMO. This site can bind zinc or copper, and the metal ion is coordinated by residues Asp156, His160, and His173 (M. capsulatus (Bath) numbering) (Figure 5).23-26 Recent metal binding studies using pMMOs from M. capsulatus (Bath) and Methylocystis sp. str. Rockwell suggest that zinc binding at this site partially inhibits activity, perhaps by interfering with proton transfer, and that this site is likely unoccupied by metal ions in vivo.20 Interestingly, a structure of Methylocystis sp. str. Rockwell pMMO soaked in zinc reveals a fourth ligand to this site, Glu201 (Glu 228 using M. capsulatus (Bath) numbering) (Figure 5), which derives from a loop region of pmoC that is disordered in all previous structures. This region spanning pmoC residues 200-223 (Methylocystis sp. str. Rockwell numbering) contains many strictly invariant residues, including Glu211, Phe213, His218, Phe221, and Val222 (Glu238, Phe240, His245, Phe248, and Val249 using M.

The potential importance of this pmoC region is underscored by mutagenesis studies of the Mycobacterium NBB4 HMO in which individual mutations in the residues corresponding to ligands Asp156, His160, and His173 (M. capsulatus (Bath) numbering) completely abro- gated hydrocarbon oxidation activity.40 Replacement of the residue equivalent to Asp166 (M. capsulatus (Bath) numbering) also abolished activity, which is interesting because this residue is located on a flexible loop that points away from the metal binding site in the pMMO structures.

y5r7 | Soluble MMO. In most studies, the activity of sMMO has been determined by measuring the epoxidation of propylene. This assay was preferred historically because the product, propylene oxide, is not further oxidized by methanotroph cells and extracts.43 For M. capsulatus (Bath) sMMO, the turnover number for methane is in the range of 0.2-1.0 s 1 at 45 ℃ and that for propylene is ~0.7 s-1 (Table 2).44,45 The Km values for

d5bi | Cavities 2 and 3 are linked, but are only connected with cavity 1, which is next to the diiron active site, when MMOB is bound to MMOH.54,55 A number of crystal structures with bound xenon, halogenated alkanes, and product alcohols have been obtained (Table 1). The substrate analogues dibromomethane, iodoethane, and xenon bind in cavities 2 and 3.56 Along with methanol and ethanol, the product analogues 2-bromoethanol, 3-chloropropanol, and 3-bromobutenol bind in cavities 1-3 and can bridge the diiron center, replacing a bound water molecule (Figure 6B).34,57 These structures are consistent with optical, resonance Raman, magnetic circular dichroism, electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR), and EPR spectroscopic data showing that substrates and products can affect the diiron site. ,58-62 However, recent time-resolved resonance Raman data indicate that the product alcohol does not bind directly to the diiron center.º Access to the active site cavity (cavity 1) from cavities 2 and 3 is mediated by conformational changes in two residues, Leu110 and Phe188, which form a gate.3, 53,54 The functional relevance of this chain of cavities to the catalytic cycle remains controversial, however.

y219 | Particulate MMO. Because of difficulties isolating stable and active purified samples of pMMO, the enzyme kinetics have not been investigated thoroughly. Assays are further complicated by the use of different reductants, including NADH and duroquinol for isolated membranes, duroquinol for purified pMMO,8 and formate for whole cells.48 For isolated M. capsulatus (Bath) membranes, of which pMMO is the main component (such preparations are referred to as membrane- bound pMMO and can sometimes be crystallized upon solubilization without further purification25), methane oxida- tion activities are in the range of 25-130 nmol min-1 mg , depending on the preparation and reductant.20 Assuming that these samples are 80% pMMO, a turnover number in the range of 3-16 min-1 can be estimated (Table 2). For propylene, membrane-bound pMMO activities are 16-123 nmol min-1 mg , giving an estimated turnover number of 2-15 min-1. For purified M. capsulatus (Bath) pMMO, specific activities of 17-160 nmol min-1 mg 1 for propylene have been reported,10 corresponding to turnover numbers of 0.17-16 min-1. Lower activities of 2-23 nmol min-1 mg 1 have been obtained for membrane-bound pMMO samples from M. trichosporium OB3b, Methylocystis sp. str. M, and Methylocystis sp. str. Rockwell, with very little activity after solubilization and purification.9,26 The whole cell M. trichosporium OB3b pMMO Vmax is 82-300 nmol min-1 mg 1 total protein (measured by methane consumption),60 which corresponds to a turnover number of 30-150 min-1, assuming 20% of the total protein is pMMO.67 Similar Vmax values were measured by propylene epoxidation for whole cells of M. capsulatus (Bath) pMMO.12,67,68 Thus, preserving pMMO activity upon removal from the membranes remains an important issue. Apparent pMMO Km values for methane have been reported in the range of 1-62 MM.66,69,70 Notably, some methanotrophs, including Methylocystis sp. strain SC2, can produce a high affinity pMMO with a much lower apparent Km for methane.70 The molecular basis for this enhanced methane affinity is not known.
06ht | pMMO has a much narrower substrate range than sMMO and can oxidize only C1-C5 n-alkanes and terminal alkenes to 2-alcohols and 1,2-epoxides.48,71-73 Analysis of the pMMO structures reveals a cavity at the proposed dicopper active site as well as a second cavity extending to the zinc binding site.19,74 However, the functional relevance of these cavities remains unclear due to the moderate resolution of the pMMO structures and the lack of structures in the presence of substrates and products or analogues thereof. A hydrophobic pocket the size of pentane in the pmoA subunit has also been identified computationally75 but is not near any of crystallo- graphically observed metal binding sites. The narrow substrate specificity of pMMO and its ability to selectively orient substrates to produce (R)-alcohols72,76 suggests that a fairly restricted cavity must be present at the active site. Site-directed mutagenesis studies of the Mycobacterium NBB4 HMO suggest that residue Ala 151, which is equivalent to pmoC Asp166 in M. capsulatus (Bath) pMMO, is important for determining substrate specificity.40 This residue lies at the interface of pmoB and pmoC, about 8 Å from the dicopper center, and could modulate the sizes of the aforementioned cavities. Notably, AMO has a much broader substrate specificity,6 but there are no crystal structures of AMO, and the molecular basis for this difference remains unclear.
