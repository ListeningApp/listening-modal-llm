After learning how to write SQL to help create a fraud detection system for a client, she pursued information management and data analytics as a vocation. While working for a multinational manufacturing company, she was asked to evaluate Tableau Desktop and Tableau Server; consequently, her team became one of the first to implement the suite of tools for their enterprise.\ntocx | Ashley's career with Tableau's products has included work as a consultant, trainer, and a professional services practice director. She is a frequent contributor to the San Francisco and Phoenix Tableau User Groups.\n07f7 | A native of Highlands, North Carolina and Atlanta, Georgia, Ashley is a proud alumna of Rabun Gap-Nacoochee School. She also studied German and Chemistry at Mount Holyoke College before graduating from Emory. Ashley's roots go back to south Georgia; she grew up listening to the stories of her large extended family, which inspired her to spend her career helping other people learn how to tell their own stories using a variety of media. Currently, she lives in the Pacific Northwest with her family, where they enjoy skiing, the beauty of God's great creation, and practicing permaculture on their ten acre farm.\n3cv9 | Acknowledgments\nxa2i | About the Author\nxj8o | Matt Floyd has worked in the software industry since two thousand and has held career roles from project management to technical writing and business intelligence analysis.

Since then, he has been a technical writer, implementation engineer, consultant, developer, and analyst in B I projects. His passion for Tableau stems from his fascination of discovery through data and the art, science, and power of data visualization.

Tableau Public, which is their free tool that allows anyone to publish interactive visualizations in the cloud, is a tremendous step toward democratizing data by providing tools to data journalists, bloggers, and hobbyists that previously would have been available only through corporate I T departments.\na3i4 | When we initially started off this project, our goal was to describe the features of Tableau Public so that you can create your own stories with data and then share them with the community. We also wanted to provide examples of how members of the online community have used Tableau Public to draw attention to important issues of our time. In the intervening months, many things have transpired: in addition to the important features in Tableau version nine point x, the online community has multiplied in size, about five hundred thousand people a day use Tableau Public, as of this writing, and the Tableau Foundation was established. Its mission is to use data to make a tangible difference in the world through the involvement of data volunteers and by granting software licenses to non-profit organizations that are dedicated to improving public health and the lives of underprivileged populations around the world.\nheua | Tableau Public is only as good as the people using it, and as we progressed on our own journeys with Tableau Public, we became engrossed in the data stories and dialogue that people have created and curated, particularly those of the Tableau foundation volunteers and others that have the express purpose of using data for good. We have attempted to provide guidelines for you on how to craft a compelling, rich story with data that enlightens others. Our examples focus on variations of the World Bank indicators, and by the end of this book, we have crafted an example dashboard that focuses on an issue that impacts everyone.\ng2u7 | Preface\n5l9k | Users only need to download the Tableau Public client.
