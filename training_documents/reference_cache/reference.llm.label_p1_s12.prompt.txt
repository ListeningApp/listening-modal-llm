You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

o2kr | 13 Information Intermediation and Reference Services
v6sk | Editor's Introduction
1wj6 | Chapter 13: Information Intermediation and Reference Services examines the changing role of reference services as information users and intermediators engage with a plethora of information in both physical and virtual formats. Reference services lecturer and coeditor of two reference books, Johanna Tunon uses her expertise to summarize reference services, highlighting it as an essential component of information services. Tunon explores the impact of new technologies on reference services and the changing methods of informa- tion intermediation and instruction, as well as strategies for addressing the decentralized and distributed roles of today's reference librarians.
936l | The chapter begins with a history of reference services before the internet, clarifies what is and what is not considered reference services, and examines the "new normal" as reference services and information intermediation now predominantly take place online. Information seekers today are using new technologies that change the way librarians approach reference services, and Tunon provides the reader with a toolbox for navigating this changing landscape and for effectively responding to today's often complex questions.
06yq | Reference services require the flexibility to deal with "rapid political, health, climate, and work-related changes," and information professionals will need to constantly improve their skill sets, reference platforms, and information-retrieval tools. Information professionals today need to prepare for changing user behaviors, help engage patrons with new information tools and resources, and partner with other organizations to maximize both programming and services. Tunon guides the reader through this essential role of information services and provides the resources they need to engage with diverse users and even more diverse information needs.
dpv6 | The advent of the internet and Reference 2.0 services have changed the role of reference librarians in the last quarter century from passive purveyors of information to information intermediators and facilitators who help patrons access information in a myriad number of old and new ways. This chapter examines the changing roles of reference services and information intermediation in the twenty-first century. After completing this chapter, the reader should have an understanding of:

t8vv | Reference Services Before the Internet
qvnu | Up until about 150 years ago, information professionals primarily focused on the acquisition and organization of library holdings, and libraries were premised on providing a shared and enclosed location where books, journals, and other types of information could be accessed and used (see also Chapter 2: History of Libraries, Information, and Communities). In his 1876 paper "Personal Relations Between Libraries and Readers," Samuel Swett Green1 introduced the concept of reference services as information intermediation through the process of helping users resolve a particular query, interest, task, or problem.
kggw | The pre-internet reference model provided librarian-centric reference services2 at a reference desk staffed by professional librarians who conducted reference interviews to better understand the information needs of users. Reference questions ranged from ready reference questions about discrete facts, data, or information and verification of bibliographic information to directional, procedural, technical, subject, and specialized research questions. Reference librarians were typically supported by a physical reference collection of encyclopedias, dictionaries, atlases, thesauri, handbooks, direc- tories, government documents, print indexes, and more that were housed nearby for ready access. Pre-internet roles ranged from answering various types of questions, providing library instruction on how to use library resources, and offering readers' advisory services. These roles remain essential for serving information users today and helping them meet their information needs.3 However, as reference services adapt to new trends in how information users seek information, so too must the competencies of reference services be defined, as is demonstrated in Textbox 13.1.
xrd1 | TEXTBOX 13.1
5746 | Key Competencies for Reference Services
7toz | The seven competencies identified by the Reference and User Services Association (RUSA):
j346 | · Access relevant and accurate information;
v8uq | · Evaluate, collect, retrieve, and synthesize information;
x972 | · Consult, mediate, and guide the use of knowledge and information;
cwrw | · Develop expertise in information literacy including textual, digital, visual, numerical, and spatial literacies;
4i0e | · Promote and demonstrate the value of library services;
h2l3 | · Assess and respond to diversity in user needs, user communities, and user preferences; and
dfzb | · Investigate, analyze, and plan to develop future services.
u6ty | Reference Services for the Twenty-First Century
awvu | Reference services in the twenty-first century continue to focus on "providing assistance by using expertise in response to an information need."4 This 2021 Reference User and Services Association (RUSA) definition puts the focus squarely on information providers who help users address informa- tion needs by helping them locate and access needed resources. Contact with an information interme- diator or library staff person can entail everything from the knowledge and use of information sources to providing recommendations, interpretations, or instruction related to those information queries.

xmgs | This is noteworthy because a reference transaction is defined as "knowledge, use, commendation, interpretation, or instruction in the use of one or more information sources"5 rather than in terms of the amount of time or the duration of a reference transaction.
bd9h | Reference work has traditionally been conducted at a reference desk, but big reference desks have fallen out of favor in recent years.6 One alternative has been the use of a single integrated service point for circulation, technology, and reference services staffed primarily by well-trained paraprofessionals. Another popular approach uses tiered reference ser- Check This Out vices, with paraprofessionals and student workers7 who answer routine questions (e.g., about holdings, policies, printing issues, directions to the bathroom, and more) and professional librarians who are con- tacted for more difficult questions.
m047 | Reference help is provided to a diverse range of users, from LBGTQ+ individuals and seniors with technology questions about their smart devices to members of various minority groups and individuals who are unsheltered. Less traditional methods of providing reference help are also exemplified by the Jails and Reentry Services (JARS)8 program offered by reference librarians at the San Francisco Public Library. These librarians (with the help of library students and interns) use the old-fashioned postal mail to serve individuals who are incarcerated.
gy8c | Reference work does not include two areas of public service, however, as defined in RUSA's updated 2021 definition.9 The first area not considered reference work is the formal provision of programs and workshops because the information being provided to users is offered in anticipation of a possible information need rather than in response to user questions about specific information needed (see also Chapter 5: Information Needs). The second area of public service not included is formal library instruction (see also Chapter 18: Teaching Users: Information and Technology Literacy Instruction). Even though RUSA does clearly recognize library instruction as an important and integral part of the continuum of reference services offered to users, formal instruction is not considered a reference service per se because it is initiated in response to requests by instructors or teachers rather than in response to identified information needs of students. It should be noted, however, that RUSA does count asynchronous aids (such as LibGuides,10 subject guides, and FAQs) as providing types of reference work because these research aids respond to users' on-demand11 requests for assistance.
y4mj | Tools used for reference services have expanded and continue to evolve in a number of ways. First of all, as online databases, library catalogs, and websites evolved, the line between traditional reference tools (like bibliographies, encyclopedias, dictionaries, and atlases) on one hand and online sources on the other has become less distinguishable with the result that information sources are becoming less place bound.12 Subscriptions to reference resources (e.g., JSTOR, NewsBank, and Web of Science) and free government databases (e.g., ERIC, PubMed, and EDGAR) have become common- place, whereas print reference tools (such as Reader's Guide to Periodical Literature and Books in Print) have become increasingly obsolete (see also Chapter 3: The Transformative Information Landscape).
vpgq | Other changes have been accelerating as well. For example, reference tools traditionally provided in print reference resources and housed in libraries are now readily available in bundled digital collec- tions (like CREDO Reference, Gale eBooks, and Oxford Reference). The digitization of millions of print books in mass digital collections (such as Google Books, Internet Archive, and the HathiTrust Digital Library) provides 24/7 direct access to scholarly resources-saving mass amounts of shelving space. The creation of a staggering amount of new web and digitized content13 over the last two decades has resulted in the rise of massive online repositories, such as the Digital Public Library of America (DPLA).14 Additionally, library access to print reference resources came to a complete halt when most

wzno | 66 Although the line distinguishing reference tools from other types of on- line resources has become increasingly blurred, digital reference sources can still be defined as tools routinely used to locate discrete pieces of information that can usually be retrieved online.
xagm | Recommending and interpreting print and online information sources continues to play a pivotal role in reference work in the twenty-first century, but intermediators of all types need to understand the information ecosystems with which they work so they are better able to help users locate needed information.17 Information professionals use this knowledge to develop and maintain subject guides, pathfinders, LibGuides, and more. These types of aids, for example, were instrumental in providing information on demand about COVID-19 when the pandemic first struck.18 Similarly, school librarians and media specialists developed Bitmoji virtual libraries as a fun and visual method of optimizing dis- covery tools to aid their students in locating needed information for class assignments when school libraries were closed.19
iwn5 | Virtual Reference Tools
uooz | The pace of technological change in the last quarter century has increasingly diversified and decentralized the ways that information services are offered; and this Check This Out has only accelerated since the COVID-19 pandemic. To learn more about how libraries adapted their reference services in response to the pandemic, check out Appendix 13.1 COVID-19 Impact on Reference Services in Part IV: Chapter 13 of the Online Supplement. Reference help that was first only provided in person and then by phone can now also be delivered via email, chat, text,20 social media, and more. Additionally, ac- cess to information has become easier with the use of personal devices and software solutions such as smartphones and tablets, cloud computing, and app technologies. Users and information intermediators can also access a variety of new reference tools, including algorithm-based search engines, database search features, and citation tools to help answer questions (see also Chapter 17: Accessing Informa- tion Anywhere and Anytime: Access Services).
pxbq | Because information is more accessible to the public, digital reference sources no longer neces- sarily require information intermediation.21 Powerful online tools like search engines (e.g., Google, Bing, Yahoo!, Swisscows, DuckDuckGo, and WolframAlpha) provide easy access to everything from web- based images and books to maps, videos, patents, and even computational knowledge. As a result, ready reference questions, such as the resale value of a full-size 2015 Ford F-150 pickup truck in the Kelley Blue Book22 or content for a fifth-grader's class project on California missions, can now be easily obtained 24/7 online. These new tools assist patrons and information professionals alike by also providing Check This Out value by finding answers to more complex questions.23 However, this has also resulted in a self-service society where people with internet access routinely conduct their own unmediated online searches.24
