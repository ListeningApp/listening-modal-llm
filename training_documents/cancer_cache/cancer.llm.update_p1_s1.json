In this regard, three-D cellular models can be presented as a step forward in biomedical research, allowing for mimicking tissue complexity more accurately than traditional two-D models, while also contributing to reducing the use of animal models. In cancer research, three-D models have the potential to replicate the tumor microenvironment, which is a key modulator of cancer cell behavior and drug response. These features make cancer three-D models prime tools for the preclinical study of anti-tumoral drugs, especially considering that there is still a need to develop effective anti-cancer drugs with high selectivity, minimal toxicity, and reduced side effects. Metallodrugs, especially transition-metal-based complexes, have been extensively studied for their therapeutic potential in cancer therapy due to their distinctive properties; however, despite the benefits of three-D models, their application in metallodrug testing is currently limited. Thus, this article reviews some of the most common types of three-D models in cancer research, as well as the application of three-D models in metallodrug preclinical studies.\n51vd | One. Introduction\nbaj1 | Animals as models of human anatomy, physiology, and disease pathology have been a key tool for scholars for millennia, allowing for an understanding of the human body and disease without risking human lives. Even though animal models are fundamental tools in modern biomedical research for proving scientific significance, their use is being reduced and, when possible, replaced as a result of animal ethics. An ethical framework has been implemented to reduce animal usage as well as the suffering caused while doing research. Additionally, projects involving animal models must be evaluated in order to determine if the costs outweigh the benefits. Besides the ethical concerns, scientific issues also need to be considered, particularly in the biological evaluation of novel drugs, as the genetic differences between animal models, namely mice, and humans, may lead to results without strongly supported translational significance.\nn1wo | Therefore, in vitro models such as two-dimensional cell cultures arose in the twentieth century as possible alternatives for the biological studies of normal gene function, disease states, therapeutic strategies, etc. Due to their simplicity and affordability, two-D monolayer cultures are considered extremely appealing for laboratory use. However, these cultures lack the three-dimensionality of tissues and organs, leading to alternate tissue architecture, cell differentiation, cellular communication, and biochemical signaling in comparison with what is found in vivo. Nonetheless, these models are still useful for a variety of cell growth and functional studies and for the production of biological therapeutics.\n5bq3 | Three-dimensional models can be presented as a step further in biomedical research, allowing for a higher throughput and mimicking of human characteristics than animal models, while maintaining more accurate tissue signaling than two-D models. These cell models are capable of better simulating tissue complexity, namely cell morphology, cell differentiation, gene expression, interactions between the cells and the extracellular matrix, concentration gradients, tissue stiffness, and drug response. Furthermore, three-D culture models may also allow for a reduction in animal models used while still recapitulating the in vivo microenvironment, which is missing in more simple in vitro models. These more advanced culture systems can be applied to several areas of fundamental and translational research, for instance, stem cell biology, toxicology, and developmental biology.\nezla | Two. three-D Models in Cancer Research\nrsbu | Cancer occurs when cells accumulate genetic errors, proliferating out of control and possibly spreading to other areas of the body, forming metastasis. Regarding data from twenty twenty, it is estimated that there were around nineteen point three million new cases of cancer worldwide and that nearly ten million people died from cancer, making it the second leading cause of death around the globe. Besides the major impact that cancer has on people's lives, it also represents a notorious economic impact on the whole of society. In twenty twenty, it is estimated that the United States of America spent around one hundred ninety-four billion Euros on cancer care. Additionally, in Europe (twenty-seven countries of the European Union, Iceland, Norway, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom), the overall cost of cancer was one hundred ninety-nine billion Euros in twenty eighteen. Cancer prevention, diagnosis, and treatment are one of the twenty-first century's most important public health concerns, as demonstrated, for instance, by the EU's \"Europe's Beating Cancer Plan\", launched in twenty twenty-one, and the USA's \"Cancer Moonshot\", launched in twenty sixteen, which aim to address, among others, a better understanding of cancer biology and the development of better therapies and diagnostic methods.\nmagd | Cancer cells exist in a complex cellular environment, the tumor microenvironment, which is a key modulator of cancer cell behavior. Tumors are not only composed of cancer cells, which possess several genetic mutations that affect proper cellular functioning, but also of other cells that are present or recruited to the tumor's microenvironment, such as fibroblasts, immune cells, and endothelial cells. Moreover, the tumor's microenvironment is also composed of non-cellular components, including growth factors, extracellular matrix, cytokines, and chemokines, which act as modulators of cancer development. The molecular communication established between the aberrant and normal cells, as well as the interactions with the extracellular matrix, modulates the overall tumorigenicity. Because of these interactions, several molecules that affect crucial cellular events, such as proliferation, angiogenesis, migration, and tissue remodeling, among others, are released, creating an environment that favors cancer progression. Furthermore, transmembrane cell adhesion molecules sense and transmit information regarding extracellular matrix alterations, activating signaling pathways and regulating cancer cell behavior.\ntb74 | The complexity of the tumor's microenvironment and the interactions established with cancer cells are the main reasons two-D models fail to accurately replicate the in vivo tissue. Even though two-D monolayer cell cultures have allowed for breakthrough discoveries in fundamental cancer biology, these are grown in simple and unrealistic conditions, where the cells are attached to rigid surfaces and lack three-dimensionality. The cells grown in a two-D culture become deformed in the out-of-plane axis and are not mechanically or physically restrained, which may lead to cell behavior changes. The application of these models in anti-cancer drug development hinders the efficiency of the process, leading to erroneous results. This happens because drug optimization is based on conditions not found in vivo, considering that two-D models are unable to accurately mimic the microenvironment of the tumor. Using these simple models for drug screening results in numerous drugs that do not reach the market and, consequently, pharmaceutical companies' investment losses.\n8l69 | Considering the three-D models' capacity to more accurately replicate the tumor microenvironment, the interest in applying these for drug development has increased over the years. Moreover, the introduction of three-D models in drug development may also allow for a reduction in animal models, addressing some ethical concerns. However, these should not be seen as the only correct tool for cancer research, but as a support approach to be used alongside two-D models before in vivo testing in animal models.\n1jyv | Three.
