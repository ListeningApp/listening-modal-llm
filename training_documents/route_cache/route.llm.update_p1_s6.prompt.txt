You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).

Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021.

8mp0 | 1-lodobuta-1,3-diynes in Copper-Catalyzed Azide-Alkyne Cycloaddition: A One-Step Route to 4-Ethynyl-5-iodo-1,2,3-triazoles
xjyk | Supporting Information
mt0f | INTRODUCTION ■
awab | During recent years 1,2,3-triazoles have been holding a leadership in different areas of fundamental and applied research. The fields of 1,2,3-triazole application are described in numerous recent reviews. The main trends are bioorthog- onal chemistry,""" organic synthesis,34 creation of new ligands and complexes5-7 and using the latter as catalysts, construction of functionalized macromolecules and polymeric materials,9-13 modified nanoparticles, 4 sensors, blocks for energetic materials, the use in medicinal chemistry for the search of new biologically active compounds, and as approved medicines 17-22
ixcc | Such a broad application of triazoles is a result of not only their functionality but also their synthetic accessibility." Among the synthetic approaches toward 1,2,3-triazoles, four general directions could be stressed: metal-catalyzed alkyne- azide cycloaddition (AAC) including mostly Cu-catalyzed <LATEX>\left( \text { CuAAC } \right) ^ { 2 4 , 2 5 }</LATEX> and Ru-catalyzed (RuAAC),2, strain-pro- moted alkyne-azide cycloaddition (SPAAC),28-30 organo- catalytic synthesis of triazoles from azides and nonalkyne C3 synthones51 using enamine-mediated5 or enolate-mediated 31 routes, and azide/alkyne/metal-free approaches.34,35 Among these methodologies, CuAAC, discovered by Sharpless, Fokin,30 and Meldal37 groups independently in 2002, remains number one for the synthesis of 1,4-disubstituted 1,2,3- triazoles due to high regioselectivity, efficiency, and tolerance in the presence of many functional groups.
8p6h | Since the discovery, CuAAC has been also expanded for the regioselective synthesis of 5-iodo(bromo)-1,4-disubstituted 1,2,3-triazoles starting from iodo(bromo) alkynes38-47 (Scheme 1A) and 1-substituted 4-ethynyl-1,2,3-triazoles from either terminal diacetylenes48-54 or trialkylsilylbuta-1,3-diynes with a one-pot desylilation55-57 (Scheme 1D).
pmgl | Taking into account that both a halogen atom, especially iodine, and a triple bond are useful functional groups
90no | responsible for special properties and possibility of further chemical modification, other methods for the synthesis of 5- iodo- and 4-ethynyltriazoles have been elaborated. CuAAC in the presence of electrophilic iodine species generated in situ and amine ligands58-63 has been investigated for the synthesis

qb7o | of 5-iodotriazoles (Scheme 1B) and was employed for the preparation of bioactive triazole derivatives.64-68 An approach based on direct C5 lithiation of 1,4-substituted triazoles with subsequent halogenation was also proposed for obtaining of some 5-iodo derivatives (Scheme 1C).39,64,69-71 An alternative way for the synthesis of 4-ethynyltriazoles reported earlier used the reaction of 1,2,3-triazoles-4-carbaldehydes with the Bestmann-Ohira reagent (Scheme 1E).72
oae5 | While some methodologies are presently available for the preparation of 5-iodo- and 4-ethynyl-1,2,3-triazoles, among 1,2,3-triazoles having both halogen and ethynyl moieties, the only example of a 5-chloro derivative accessible through a multistep synthetic sequence has been reported73 and 4- ethynyl-5-iodo-1,2,3-triazoles still remain unknown.
s0fl | We decided to study CuAAC of 1-iodobuta-1,3-diynes with organic azides as a one-step synthetic approach to 4-ethynyl-5-
43ia | iodo-1,2,3-triazoles (Scheme 1F), taking into account that routes B and C being applied to the terminal buta-1,3-diynes and 4-ethynyl-1,2,3-triazoles, respectively, could be compli- cated with side reactions such as iodination of the second triple bond by electrophilic iodine species or acetylene-allene isomerization induced by strong bases. In the present work, we report the scope and limitation of this methodology along with the synthetic utility of 4-ethynyl-5-iodo-1,2,3-triazoles as versatile synthetic intermediates.
3g2y | RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
gc7v | It is of first importance that starting 1-iodobuta-1,3-diynes 7a- j are synthetically available compounds and can be synthesized either by iodination of terminal buta-1,3-diynes using different iodination agents or from TMS-protected buta-1,3-diynes
