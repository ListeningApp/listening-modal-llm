You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

ex5k | We can take this a step further and look at followership during cultural clashes. When a culture that advocates free speech and a free press produces a political cartoon that is viewed as insulting by another culture, how does followership play out? What drives followers in the offended group to start rioting and harming members of the free speech culture? What makes the followers in the free speech culture surprised by this retaliation, but not retaliate in return?
9d4o | Leader(ship)
cjq2 | Traditionally, we have viewed the world from a leadership-centric vantage point. We have assumed that all other factors, including followership, are secondary to leadership. When followers have been surveyed, it was to determine their views of the leaders. But what if we turned all this around? What if we put followership center stage and asked all the same questions, but only in reference to the follow- ers instead of leaders? For example, when we talk about leader-follower distance, we always talk about the follower's distance from the leader, but we should also talk about the leader's distance from the follower. Likewise, what are the interactions between leaders and followers from the follower's point of view? We tend to think of leaders as the proactive "cause" and followership as the reac- tive "effect." But what if the opposite were true? Are leadership attitudes, behav- ior, and performance more a result of followership than the other way around? For example, do sheep produce a particular style of leadership, regardless of the leader's personality or predisposition? Is it this turn of events that leads to a par- ticular outcome?
5esx | I'm reminded of the psychology cartoon depicting two dogs in a park talking to each other. One says to the other, "Humans are hard to train, but once you break them in, they are pretty predictable. I've finally taught mine so that when I bark, he drops whatever he's doing and prepares my meal. When I feel like getting some exercise, I scratch the floor to signal him to get on his jacket and to walk alongside of me to keep me company. And when I need a massage, I just sit down next to him and he starts rubbing me. He's learned these things so well that I don't even have to say anything anymore." We tend to believe that the leaders are in charge, directing and shaping followership behavior. Yet maybe leaders are malleable products of cumulative followership actions.

zxz6 | We might also reframe the interaction effects between followers and leaders. For example, when we talk about charismatic leadership, we can ask, What style of follower would a charismatic leader attract? However, we should also ask, What style of leader would a yes-person attract? What is the psychological and emotional dynamic between them? These possible interactions between different followership and leadership styles, and the complexity therein, would be fertile areas for research, complementing Kellerman's and Lipman-Blumen's work on bad leaders.5 This topic also ties in to the aforementioned world events and culture areas.
xnth | Follower Qualities
vafm | The question that still sticks in my head after twenty-plus years is, In our society, why does anyone want to be a follower, when all the perks and all the attention go to leaders? Although I identified seven paths to followership in my book The Power of Followership, we still have a long way to go to understand it more fully. For example, college applications ask for examples of leadership, but not of followership. It would be an unusual kid who would take the risk to extol follow- ership qualities and the even more unusual admissions officer who would reward it.
2zmw | So from where do followership attitudes, styles, and aspirations come? What's the role of parenting, early childhood experience, school, religion, sports partici- pation, the media, or important role models on followership development? Con- sider peer pressure in middle school, for example. Most of the serious social issues students may face-alcohol and drug experimentation, gangs, sex, fear of social ostracism-are peer-pressure driven. Schools treat peer pressure as a leadership issue when actually it's a followership issue. They believe that if they teach leader- ship skills, they will alleviate the negative effects of peer pressure. A better approach may be to teach better followership skills. Kids need to learn how to protect themselves from leaders who encourage them to engage in either self- destructive or socially destructive behavior, as well as learn how to support posi- tive leaders.
bf9k | But peer pressure and toxic leaders are not just a middle school problem. Many of the world events mentioned earlier involve peer pressure and toxic leaders. We need to learn what life events produce followers who can think for themselves; exercise their own independent, critical judgment; and act in the best interests
otkr | The Art of Followership
ibgs | of the organization or the society, even if doing so means going against the leader or the group.
colo | Role of the Follower
d6r4 | One of the questions that I ask executives is, "If you could have an ideal mix of the five followership styles in your organization, what percentage of each style would you prefer?" I'm surprised at how many say they would like all yes-people. Their reasons are that (1) yes-people are "doers" who are willing to do the grunt work and who get the job done with little fuss; (2) yes-people have limited aspira- tions and will neither pressure the leader for promotions nor quit for better jobs elsewhere; and (3) yes-people are loyal and dependable.
9mrz | Other executives say they would prefer the following mix. Start with a sprin- kling of alienated because they keep the leader honest. Add a small group of star followers who would lead the charge, but avoid adding too many because they can get demanding, and they think for themselves too much. Then split the remaining majority among pragmatics who serve as an institutionalized, status quo base and yes-people who will get the job done.
pk06 | It is the rare executive who wants all star followers. Most executives fear that they can neither keep star followers challenged by the job nor satisfied with their role in the organization. They believe that star followers will grow bored and dis- illusioned, seeking greener pastures and leading to high turnover. My own experi- ence is that organizations with more star followers perform better because the star followers need not depend on the leader for direction or motivation. This reduces the transaction costs that hinder organizational success.
7wn9 | Pondering the roles of followers results in intriguing research questions. What assumptions do leaders make about the various followership styles? Are those assump- tions accurate, or are they dysfunctional stereotypes? Is the common leader preference for loyal doers justified or problematic? Is there an ideal mix of followership styles, or is the search for such a mix a quixotic quest? Is the ideal mix dependent on the context or situation? Do certain mixes attract certain types of leaders? Do certain leaders reshape the mix to suit their own preference? If we prefer a certain mix, say all star followers, can people move from one followership style to another, such as from yes-person to star follower? If so, how does that happen? Rethinking the role of followers can help the field move forward.

pn9j | Language of Followership
1pmc | If I had a dollar for every time someone said to me, "You need to come up with a word other than 'follower' because it's socially unacceptable," I would be much wealthier today. "If you had a sexier, easier term," they say, "then you'd be able to sell this concept much more easily." My response is always "I would be glad to do that as soon as we get rid of the word 'leader.' Once you're ready to do that, then we can talk."
5z6q | My rigid stance actually stems from the point that these people are making- that language does make a difference. Language has an effect. If we stop using "follower" (as some businesses, such as Wal-Mart, have done, using words like "associate" in its place), can we really continue to use the word "leader"? Does "leader-associate" have the same dialectical relationship as "leader-follower"? I think not. Instead, it masks the underlying beliefs that the leaders have about their "associates" with a more democratic sheen.
yeoh | Language is important not only in terms of the words we use but also in terms of the script that they suggest. The words "leader" and "follower" bring to mind a common script in which the leader is in charge, saying, "You do this, and you do that." Meanwhile, followers are imagined as inferior beings in need of the leader's direction, motivation, and protection. We need to rethink this outdated script. What societal purpose does it serve? Is it still functional in today's world? What personal purpose does it serve for the people who promulgate it or for the people who actually follow it? We need to ask ourselves whether we need a new script. Can we start to reframe the entire conversation in a new way? If so, what does the new script sound like? What words and imagery do we use to suggest either a more accurate or a more desirable relationship between followers and leaders?
b8hf | Courageous Conscience
hntf | Related to the issue of peer pressure discussed earlier is the responsibility that followers have to keep leaders and peers ethically and legally in check. Instead of viewing followers as the "good soldiers" who carry out commands dutifully, we need to view followers as the primary defenders against toxic leaders or dysfunc- tional organizations. The buck stops more with followers than leaders. In fact, they are often in a better position to see the day-to-day events or leader decisions that lead to disastrous consequences. However, our current script of followership does not include this responsibility in the role description. For the most part, society
99fo | The Art of Followership
y5r7 | neither prepares nor expects followers to exercise what I label as the "courageous conscience."
lrry | The ability to make ethical and legal judgments, to take proactive steps to pro- mote ethical and legal activities, and then to stand up against unethical and illegal decisions and actions, is a crucial aspect of followership. Followers cannot abdi- cate their courageous conscience by outsourcing it to the leader. Rather, followers need to learn how to blow the whistle effectively, how to combat groupthink, how to avoid the dispersion of responsibility so often found in groups, and how to advance institutional integrity.
hvhm | How do we make this happen? How do we help people be successful when they have to stand up? The answer has at least three parts: (1) teaching people that the followership role includes the courageous conscience, thus not only legitimating this responsibility but also mandating it; (2) helping followers find the personal courage to stand up, and providing the societal supports that encourage people to exercise their courageous conscience; and (3) preparing followers so that when they do stand up, they are successful.
863b | If all followers actively used their courageous conscience, we would likely have fewer toxic leaders who steer the organization down the path of organizational corruption or societal damage. This could go a long way in limiting the fallout of the world events I discussed earlier. To this end, I would like someone to develop an entire curriculum that brings the ethical, legal, and social science tools together to equip every person with a strong, active courageous conscience.
fj24 | CONCLUSION
uz3c | The field of followership is still in its infancy. It is rare that people get a chance to build and shape a new area of inquiry. This twenty-five-year journey has been a wonderful experience for me: when I started, I only wanted to put my stake in the ground, and now many people have joined the journey, taking it in new direc- tions. I am confident that fellow travelers will generate their own ways to rethink the followership field and create novel research agendas. Collectively, we can grow the followership field so that it makes powerful contributions to society and to the individuals who make up society.
