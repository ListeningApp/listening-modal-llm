You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

v3r2 | Implementation science: What is it and why should I care?
nv42 | ABSTRACT
xags | Centuries of experience make it clear that establishing the effectiveness of a clinical innovation is not sufficient to guarantee its uptake into routine use. The relatively new field of implementation science has developed to enhance the uptake of evidence-based practices and thereby increase their public health impact.
jc47 | Implementation science shares many characteristics, and the rigorous approach, of clinical research. However, it is distinct in that it attends to factors in addition to the effectiveness of the clinical innovation itself, to include identifying and addressing barriers and facilitators to the uptake of evidence-based clinical innova- tions.
ko3c | This article reviews the definition, history, and scope of implementation science, and places the field within the broader enterprise of biomedical research. It also provides an overview of this Special Issue of Psychiatry Research, which introduces the principles and methods of implementation science to mental health researchers.
xek3 | 1. Why worry about implementation?
bbpr | The title of this article poses two questions. Let us answer the second question first, beginning with a story:
5zyf | It was, by all estimations, a successful research effort. We had mounted a randomized, controlled clinical trial across eleven sites in the US Department of Veterans Affairs (USVA), testing an organization of care called the Collaborative Chronic Care Model (CCM) for bipolar disorder versus treatment as usual (Bauer et al., 2006a). Over three years of follow-up, the CCM showed significant positive impact on weeks in mood episode, mental health quality of life, social role function, and satisfac- tion with care-all at no increased cost to the healthcare system (Bauer et al., 2006b). In parallel, a two-year, four-site randomized controlled clinical trial of the bipolar CCM in the Group Health Co- operative of Puget Sound (now Kaiser Permanente), showed very similar outcomes at minimal cost, compared to treatment as usual (Simon et al., 2006). Both studies were published in the same year in mainstream psychiatric journals that are read and respected by mental health re- searchers, clinicians, and administrators. The CCM for bipolar disorders began to be endorsed by national clinical practice guidelines in the USVA and in Canada (Yatham et al., 2006), and the bipolar CCM was listed on the US Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's prestigious National Registry of Evidence-Based Programs and Practices.
9own | A worthwhile innovation in care? It was a no-brainer: improved outcome at little to no cost.
bqfb | And yet, within a year of the end of the studies, none of the 15 sites had incorporated the CCM into their usual work flow. The clinicians who had participated in the CCM went back to their usual duties, and the in- dividuals with bipolar disorder went back to receiving their usual form of care. For all practical purposes, bipolar CCMs ceased to exist at these sites. Perhaps ironically, the only vestige of the CCM that remained one year after the study was that a group of patients at one of the sites continued to meet on their own to hold self-management skills groups (www.lifegoalscc.com), which were part of the CCM intervention.
wwdt | Everything went right. What went wrong?
mn1r | The experience in the story is not unique, as many clinical trialists have discovered. Succinctly put: Establishing effectiveness of an in- novation does not guarantee its uptake into routine usage. Classic stu- dies indicate that it takes 17-20 years to get clinical innovations into practice; moreover, fewer than 50% of clinical innovations ever make it into general usage (Mosteller, 1981; Balas and Boren, 2000; Grant et al., 2003; Morris et al., 2011). Chalmers and Glasziou (2009) estimate that 80% of medical research dollars do not make a public health impact for various reasons. If only half of clinical innovations ever make it to general use, society's return on investment for each medical research
5vqw | dollar is diminished even further. Funders are beginning to take note (Health Economics Research Group, 2008; Selby and Slutsky, 2014; Ginsburg and Phillips, 2018).
meyw | Perhaps this lack of uptake of clinical innovations (among which we consider interventions, assessment and treatment technologies, and new organizations of care) is because the rapid pace of modern bio- medical research has outstripped society's absorptive capacity. On the contrary: the problem is centuries old. For instance, the first observa- tion that citrus cures scurvy in the British Navy occurred in 1601, with the first randomized controlled trial of citrus to treat scurvy conducted in 1747. Yet the British Navy did not adopt routine use of citrus to prevent scurvy until 1795, and the British merchant marine not until 1865 (Mosteller, 1981).
2e62 | Additional instances of the lag between evidence and widespread usage are provided by Colditz and Emmons (2018). They contrast the slow uptake of the smallpox vaccine, penicillin, and insulin to the much more rapid uptake of anti-retroviral treatments for HIV/AIDS, making the point that contextual factors, not treatment effectiveness, play a dominating role in whether and how quickly a clinical innovation will become widely used. Similarly, Ferlie and coworkers studied non- adoption of eight hospital-based or primary care-based innovations in the UK. Their analysis demonstrated that, while strength of evidence contributed to the adoption of some clinical innovations, a more com- prehensive explanation for non-adoption needed to also include con- textual issues, such as the professional disciplines of the intended re- cipients. (Ferlie et al., 2005)
75y3 | Thus, the problem of non-uptake of effective clinical innovations is longstanding and persistent-and likely the rule rather than the ex- ception. Moreover, the clues to this problem lie beyond simply the clinical innovation itself, and include contextual and factors related to use or non-use of the clinical innovation.
s2g2 | 2. Implementation challenges in the biomedical research enterprise
q1q2 | The process of biomedical research can be conceptualized as a pi- peline from concept development to public health impact (Curran et al., 2012) (Fig. 1). Those of us who came into research several decades ago worked from a simplistic model which assumed that developing evi- dence that a clinical innovation was efficacious was sufficient to gen- erate public health impact (Fig. 1, upper panel).
cb7r | In the late 1990s researchers became aware of the need for studies, particularly clinical trials, which moved out of the rarified environment of the academic medical center into venues more typical of those in which the clinical innovation would be used. Thus, the focus of clinical research broadened beyond solely internal validity (which prioritizes isolating treatment effects from all extraneous influences in order to determine whether an innovation has an impact), to also include con- siderations of external validity (which prioritizes the relevance and transferability of innovation effects from highly controlled experi- mental conditions into conditions under which the eventual end-user of the innovation typically works).
68xu | Accordingly, a variety of types of clinical trials that prioritize ex- ternal validity developed under the general concept of "practice-based research" (Westfall et al., 2007). Such trial designs are based on a variety of overlapping concepts-e.g., effectiveness studies, practical clinical trials, pragmatic clinical trials, comparative effectiveness trials, large simple clinical trials-but all have in common prioritizing eva- luation of clinical innovations in environments in which the innovation will potentially be used. The biomedical research pipeline can thus be amended (Fig. 1, middle panel) to illustrate an "efficacy-effectiveness" continuum (Wells, 1999; Bauer et al., 2001), in which trials differ based on whether they seek primarily to favor study efficacy (internal va- lidity, i.e., isolating and maximizing potential treatment impact) versus effectiveness (external validity, i.e., generalizability to the practice settings in which the clinical innovation will be used).
