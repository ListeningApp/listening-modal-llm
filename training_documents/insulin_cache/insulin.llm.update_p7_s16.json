Glucagon-like peptide one, which has an insulin-enhancing effect, modulates incentive motivation for both food and money. Of course, this effect is not solely attributable to insulin, since GLP one has direct effects on DA neurons. Furthermore, food intake, elevating insulin levels among other factors, has been shown to reduce susceptibility to\n7zvf | non-food rewards and choices in the delay discounting task related to fluctuating blood glucose levels.\nmov9 | To conclude, human data provide clear evidence that central insulin modulates the activity and the connectivity of DA-pathways affecting reward behaviour.\nks7m | Three. Impaired insulin signalling and the dopaminergic circuitry\nw1w1 | Changes in diet are known to modulate both insulin and DA signaling in mesolimbic pathways. Chronic food restriction reduces circulating insulin levels and baseline DA levels in the mesolimbic circuitry leading to higher reward sensitivity and stronger DA release in response to refeeding. In contrast, high fat diet-induced obesity is associated with hyperinsulinemia but lower baseline and amphetamine-induced DA levels in the NAc compared to healthy normal weight controls. Interestingly, in diet-induced obesity a chow meal is no longer able to induce a DA-response in the NAc, but a high fat diet meal is required to trigger this DA response. So while both food restriction and obesity are associated with reduced baseline DA levels in the striatum, there is a bidirectional effect on insulin-dependent DA release. These observations have sparked attention to the role of insulin in mediating these effects.\nh8gv | Several rodent models have been leveraged to investigate the effects of changed insulin transmission on midbrain DA neurons and their primary projection regions. These models differ in their availability of insulin, the induction of downstream insulin signalling pathways upon binding of insulin to its receptor, receptor availability, and specificity of the intervention.\nkwkp | Three point one. The impact of insulin deficiency on DA signalling in rodents\nyj0m | Insulin deficiency and its impact on DA signalling are typically studied in a.) rodent models with damaged pancreatic beta cells due to the administration of beta cytotoxics such as streptozotin or alloxan, b.) hereditary models prone to type one diabetes, or c.) rodents after prolonged fasting. Among these models, the streptozotocin-model is most frequently used and involves repeated administration of low doses of streptozotocin resulting in partial damage to the pancreatic islets. This causes chronic inflammation, insulin deficiency and hyperglycaemia, which mimic the pathology of type one diabetes mellitus in humans. An alternative protocol is a single, high-dose administration of streptozotocin, which destroys beta cells completely and does not exhibit human type one diabetes features such as pancreatic insulitis. However, all of these models except for prolonged fasting are generally associated with hyperglycaemia, which directly affects neuronal signaling and insulin receptor sensitivity. Therefore, insulin replacement cannot fully restore function in these models. Moreover, there is growing evidence, that the effect of the beta cytotoxics is not solely attributable to the destruction of beta-cells since a direct ICV application of small doses of alloxan and streptozocin induced changes in the brain DA signalling comparable to the peripheral administration.\newfp | Insulin receptor knockout models allow the direct investigation of insulin downstream signalling. Beyond general IR knockout models, targeted knockdown of IR in neurons, astrocytes, or in TH-expressing or DAT-expressing neurons have been leveraged to unravel the action of insulin in the central nervous system and particularly the DA circuitry. Moreover, customized inactivation of IR has also been investigated by administering antibodies into specific brain locations.\noczy | Insulin resistance secondary to obesity and metabolic dysregulation is typically investigated after high fat diet, or in rodent strains genetically prone to obesity or diabetes mellitus type two such as the Goto-Kakizaki rat or the spontaneously diabetic Torii and the Wistar rats. High fat diet has a clear impact on insulin signaling in DA pathways as evidenced by reduced phosphorylation of AKT in\n2ttg | striatal and nigral brain slices. Nonetheless, it is essential to note that both high fat diet and obesity result in a number of metabolic and inflammatory changes that can additionally affect DA signaling. Furthermore, high fat diet regimes differ in their duration and composition (e.g. fifty percent of daily kcal requirements from fat vs. sixty percent from fat; saturated vs. unsaturated fat) leading to heterogeneous findings and making it challenging to attribute findings solely to insulin changes.\nhis3 | Three point two. The impact of insulin resistance in the dopaminergic midbrain\nm50z | Three point two point one. Insulin resistance changes TH-activity\nme84 | In the VTA, both lack of insulin due to streptozotocin-induced destruction of pancreatic beta cells as well as impaired IR signalling due to knock-out or inhibition in TH-containing neurons reduce the expression of TH messenger RNA indicating reduced DA synthesis. Similarly, TH activity in terminal fields of DA neurons is suppressed in diabetic rodents after high fat diet and genetic models of diabetes.\no56m | Three point two point two. Insulin resistance affects DA-turnover\nslz6 | Food restriction for twenty-four to thirty-six hours leading to reduced insulin levels has been demonstrated to diminish DAT messenger RNA amounts in the VTA and SN, indicating decreased DA turnover. Moreover, insulin fails to increase the firing frequency of DA neurons if the insulin receptor is inactivated and neuronal IR knockout mice show increased levels of monoamine oxidase A and B leading to increased DA and other monoamines degradation in these areas. In situations of transient or prolonged hyperinsulinemia, insulin loses its ability to induce long-term depression of excitatory synapses onto VTA DA neurons. Notably, seven days of high fat diet were sufficient to induce insulin resistance in the VTA as demonstrated by reduced AKT phosphorylation in the VTA upon intracerebroventricular injection of insulin.\n90k5 | Collectively, insulin deficiency and insulin resistance reduce DA synthesis, DA reuptake, depression of excitatory inputs on DA neurons, and the firing frequency of DA neurons in the VTA.\n9m8s | Three point three.
