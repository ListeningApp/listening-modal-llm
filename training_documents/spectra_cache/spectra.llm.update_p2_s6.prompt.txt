You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

ob1z | The number of photons emitted by the excited hydroxyl radical OH* in the 270-350 nm region was compared with the total quantity of hydroxyl radicals OH which were formed inside the individual cavitation bubble. The initial rates of hydroxyl radical formation @0(OH) were calculated as wo(OH) = 2000(H2O2) which follows from the balance equation OH + OH - H2O2. Thus, we assumed here that the reactions of radicals with hydrogen peroxide or others inside the bubble or in the solution after a bubble collapse are insignificant; at least they do not play a prevailing role in most cases. Actually, it is an overestimation, and this will be shown in the Discussion section. On the other hand, the number of OH* photons is evidently overestimated too because the bands of OH* species emission are superimposed in the 270-350 nm interval with the emission from other particles. Nevertheless, we guess that the OH*/OH (or, similarly, OH*/2[H2O2]) ratio is an important parameter for studying the mechanism of sonoluminescence and sonochemistry, and the changes of it in the order of noble gases (see below) support this assumption.
m4cb | Results
m61y | The spectra of sonoluminescence from noble gas-saturated water were studied in the papers, 13,15,16 but in the work13 the spectra were not investigated at the wavelengths below 270 nm and in the papers15,16 they were not corrected with the spectral response of the detector. So the spectra presented in Figure 1 have an essentially higher intensity at Â < 310 nm than previous ones.13,15,16 Besides, the spectra of He-saturated water had not yet been reported, although the attempt to measure it was made in the work;15 however, the emission was too weak to observe any bands or a continuum.
u2ob | The peak position of the OH* radical at 310 nm13,15 does not depend on the dissolved gas, but the emission from excited
2gnm | H2O* molecule15,16 has maxima at 262, 268, 250, and 242 nm for He, Ar, Kr, and Xe, respectively (Figure 1). The intensity

xaqt | The total light power of <LATEX>\mathrm { S L }</LATEX> increases in the order <LATEX>^ { \prime }</LATEX> <LATEX>< K r < X e</LATEX> (see Table 1) that is in accordance with the previously published results on the sonoluminescence intensity of noble gas-saturated water.19,20 The measurements of both hydrogen peroxide and sonoluminescence yields in one work were carried out also by Prudhomme and Guilmart.19 Calculated from the paper,19 the ratio of <LATEX>S L</LATEX> intensity/the yield of <LATEX>H _ { 2 } O _ { 2 }</LATEX> grows in the order <LATEX>\mathrm { H e } < \mathrm { N e } < \mathrm { A r } < \mathrm { K r } < \mathrm { X e } ,</LATEX> which agrees with our data: this ratio and also the <LATEX>\mathrm { O H } ^ { * } / \mathrm { O H }</LATEX> ratio increase with increasing atomic weight of the dissolved gases from 0.26 (helium) to 6.4 (xenon) (see Table 1).
5rcb | Discussion
524j | There are a few hypotheses explaining the mechanism of sonoluminescence and sonochemical reactions. In principle, they can be divided into two categories: thermal, when the origin of sonoluminescence and chemical-active particles is explained by the thermal heating of a cavitation bubble content, and electrical, due to electrical discharge inside the bubble or in the surrounding liquid (see reviews1-4). Electrical hypotheses were criticized and rejected,21 but Margulis22 proposed a new one, the essence of which is as follows.
xd3m | The small size bubbles are breaking off from the bigger one that pulsates in a sound field. The neck is formed on the place of detachment, and the electrokinetic <LATEX>\xi</LATEX> -potential can concentrate there because of the flow of a charged liquid around this neck. The value of the <LATEX>\xi</LATEX> potential is excessively great,22 so the electrical discharge can occur inside the gas phase at the time of the bubble detachment.
8qb6 | Note that the value of the <LATEX>5</LATEX> &-potential decreases when the concentration of salt in the solution increases.23 Thus, following ref 22 the <LATEX>\mathrm { S L }</LATEX> intensity must also decrease in salt solutions. However, experimental results show an opposite dependence: sonoluminescence increases with the growth of salt concentra- tion in salt solutions.24,25
wkbn | It has been shown recently26 that the small additives of perfluorocarbon gases <LATEX>C F _ { 4 }</LATEX> and <LATEX>C _ { 2 } F _ { 6 }</LATEX> in the mixture of <LATEX>\mathrm { A r / C F } _ { 4 }</LATEX> and <LATEX>\mathrm { A r } / C _ { 2 } F _ { 6 }</LATEX> substantially suppress sonoluminescence. Au- thors26 assume that these results are consistent with thermal mechanisms of SL, because these gases have low values of the ratio of specific heats <LATEX>\gamma = c _ { p } / c</LATEX> as compared with noble gases. Thus, the lower the value of <LATEX>\gamma ,</LATEX> the lower cavitational tempera- ture and the less the intensity of SL. On the other hand, <LATEX>C F 4</LATEX> is known as an efficient gas for plasma chemistry and will support an electrical discharge. Thus, the results26 are in direct contradiction with electrical discharge hypotheses and support the thermal mechanism for sonochemistry and sonolumines- cence.
ftfg | It was found recently7a,11,27 that the SL flash from the synchronously repeating stable <LATEX>S L ,</LATEX> which originates from nonlinear motion of a single bubble, occurs in the final stage

w8r5 | of its implosion. Note that the authors of the papers7a,11,27 were working at the intensity of ultrasound that is higher than the threshold of instability of the bubble surface, i.e., at conditions where the bubble disruption and the detachment of tiny bubbles from the bigger one seem incredible.7a
ybik | The sonoluminescence spectra of hydrocarbons show no emission lines or bands of charged particles,14 which is also in disagreement with the electrical discharge hypotheses.
