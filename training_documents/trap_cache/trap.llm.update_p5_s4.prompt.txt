You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).

y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

h8gv | implications. Most of the empirical material focuses on comparisons between MI and HI countries in the twenty-first century. Where data are available, we include some comparisons with past experiences of earlier graduates to HI, especially to show that earlier graduates did not face the same challenges and cleavages as those facing today's MI countries.
kwkp | II. THE INSTITUTIONAL CHALLENGES OF TODAY'S MIDDLE-INCOME TRAP
yj0m | The upgrading reforms required to move out of middle-income status are difficult and complex, especially compared to reforms that, while generating real distributional tensions, can be implemented by fiat by small groups of insulated technocrats (for example, devaluation, rais- ing interest rates, or trade liberalization). Because of their complexities, implementing upgrading reforms requires institutions to coordinate, to monitor and reconcile the interests of multiple actors, and to help provide specialized information. Such institutions operate at multiple levels, ranging from overall sectoral coordinating institutes and public- private consultative councils, to judicial offices for effective contract enforcement and patent protection, to agencies specializing in areas such as innovation financing, testing and standards, R and D promo- tion, and vocational training. Creating such institutions is difficult be- cause they require both (horizontal) coordination among state agencies, among firms, and between public and private actors (as in Peter Evans's concept of embedded autonomy), 17 and (vertical) coordination of nu- merous providers, such as highly trained researchers, judges, teachers, curriculum developers, and test engineers, each of whom plays impor- tant roles in long implementation chains.
ewfp | This section focuses on two such institution-intensive reform areas essential to increasing productivity: education (human capital) and in- vestment in R and D. These are, for good reason, usually at the top of the policy priorities identified by economic studies of the MI trap.18 The scatterplots of Figures 1 and 2 show both the wide gap between HI and MI countries and that large MI countries fall below the levels expected at their income. Most important, these policy areas also illustrate the huge institutional hurdles facing countries seeking to exit MI limbo. Our goal in this section is not to attempt to identify a short list of reforms that
oczy | might solve the MI trap (other scholars have recommended a host of policy prescriptions), but rather to show the major institution building necessary to get out of it. For brevity, we concentrate on education and R and D, but the framework applies to a range of other policy areas, including legal and financial systems, which are similarly institution intensive.
2ttg | Moreover, the challenges are greater now than they were in the twentieth century, when countries graduated to HI with lower levels of education and R and D. In education, for example, the average years of school in the adult population was 8 for countries that graduated to HI in the 1960s and 1970s (Europe, Anglo settler countries, and Japan), and 8.4 for countries that graduated in the 1980s and 1990s. The av- erage in our nine large countries in MI limbo was already 8.8 years by 2010, while the average for all advanced countries in 2010 had risen to 11 years.19
his3 | The empirical analysis concentrates on large upper-MI countries of Latin America (Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, Colombia, and Peru), Southeast Asia (Thailand and Malaysia), South Africa, and Turkey.20 One reason for this is that the median time in MI status for these nine countries is sixty years and counting, well beyond the average noted in the introduction of forty-two years for earlier industrializers. Excluding China (considered below), these nine countries account for two-thirds of all the people living in MI countries.
m50z | Further, given extensive heterogeneity among the fifty-three coun- tries listed as middle income in 2014, we think analyses of the dynamics of more homogeneous subsets of MI countries is likely to yield better insights. Among the subsets, we exclude smaller MI countries (under twenty million inhabitants) that depend more on their larger regional trading partners and have advantages, as discussed below, in overcom- ing the divisions of MI politics. Another subset, postsocialist transition economies, entered MI with much stronger educational institutions and lower inequality and informality, and the institutional challenges they face are related more to transitions to capitalism. Last, MI countries heavily dependent on oil exports face challenges of overcoming the distinctive perils of the resource curse. Enormous heterogeneity not-

o56m | withstanding, our quantitative analysis often includes all MI countries, and many of our arguments could travel, in revised form, to other MI countries. Of course, even among our nine large MI countries there are major differences, to which we return in Section V.
slz6 | EDUCATION
90k5 | Despite steady progress over recent decades in increasing access and spending, educational achievement in MI countries continues to lag. Conversely, countries where education levels have historically exceeded the norm for their income levels have been some of the fastest growing in East Asia and the ones most likely to escape the MI trap.21 Several measures give a clear picture of gaps in educational quality and perfor- mance: Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) scores, proportion of the labor force with tertiary education, and number of technical workers in R and D activities (see Table 1). The gaps show both the problem of low human capital and the enormous challenge to overcoming the MI trap.22
