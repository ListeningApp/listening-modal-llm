You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

9g22 | At <LATEX>p H = 5 ,</LATEX> the ET2-PT channel dominates over the entire range of potentials considered (Figure 6c). The concentration of <LATEX>\widetilde { \mathrm { R u } } ^ { \mathrm { I I I } } - O \mathrm { H } _ { 2 }</LATEX> at this <LATEX>p H</LATEX> is much smaller, virtually eliminating the contribution from the ET1 channel. The EPT1 channel is also not accessible because the mole fraction of <LATEX>\mathrm { R u } ^ { \mathrm { I I I } } - \mathrm { O H } ^ { - } \cdots .</LATEX> H3O+ <LATEX>\left( O x \cdots H _ { 3 } O ^ { + } \right.</LATEX> is negligible at this pH. Moreover, ET2 is much faster than EPT2 due to its smaller reorganization energy. For these reasons, the ET2-PT channel is dominant at
41fx | <LATEX>p H = 5 .</LATEX> <LATEX>P ^ { H } = S</LATEX> <LATEX>p H = 1 , 3 ,</LATEX> 5, the two major competing channels are the ET1 and ET2 channels, corresponding to PCET via the PTET and ETPT mechanisms, respectively. Both the ET1 and ET2 rate constants are pH-independent. The ET1 channel dominates at <LATEX>p H = 1</LATEX> and 3, whereas the ET2-PT channel dominates at <LATEX>p H = 5 .</LATEX> This interpretation is supported by the experimentally measured maximum rate constants and corresponding electronic coupling <LATEX>H _ { a b } ,</LATEX> which are similar at <LATEX>p H = 1</LATEX> and 3 but significantly different at <LATEX>p H = 5</LATEX> (see Figure 5a, where the maximum value is similar for the red and blue curves but different for the magenta curve). This experimental observation is consistent with the same dominant channel at <LATEX>p H = 1</LATEX> and 3 but a different dominant channel at <LATEX>p H = 5 .</LATEX> The weak <LATEX>p H</LATEX> dependence observed experimentally arises from the intrinsic difference between the rate constants of the ET1 and ET2-PT channels due to their distinct electronic coupling and the change of their relative contributions with <LATEX>p H</LATEX> due to the changes in the mole fractions of <LATEX>\mathrm { R u } ^ { \mathrm { I I I } } - \mathrm { O H } ^ { - }</LATEX> and
7um8 | <LATEX>\mathrm { R u } ^ { \mathrm { I I I } } - O \mathrm { H } _ { 2 } .</LATEX> This analysis also provides insights into the change of apparent reorganization energy at <LATEX>\mathrm { p H } = 1 ,</LATEX> 3, and 5. The apparent reorganization energy is extracted as the driving force when <LATEX>k _ { \text { app } } = \frac { 1 } { 2 } k _ { \text { max,app } }</LATEX> At <LATEX>p H = 3</LATEX> and 5, the <LATEX>k \left( E \right)</LATEX> curve is shifted toward lower potential compared to the curve at <LATEX>p H =</LATEX> 1, leading to larger apparent reorganization energies for <LATEX>p H = 3</LATEX> and 5 compared to <LATEX>\mathrm { p H } = 1 .</LATEX> These observations could be interpreted to suggest the same mechanism at <LATEX>p H = 3</LATEX> and 5 and a different mechanism at <LATEX>p H = 1 .</LATEX> However, our general model suggests an alternative interpretation. The dominant channel is the same at <LATEX>p H = 1</LATEX> and <LATEX>p H = 3 ,</LATEX> and the curve shift for <LATEX>p H = 3</LATEX> leading to a higher apparent reorganization energy <LATEX>\begin{array}{} \text { is due to } \\ \text { \left(positive } \end{array}</LATEX> the negligible mole fraction of <LATEX>\mathrm { R u } ^ { \mathrm { H I } } - O \mathrm { H } _ { 2 }</LATEX> at high potentials and the increased mole fraction of <LATEX>R u ^ { \mathrm { I I I } }</LATEX> <LATEX>- O H _ { 2 }</LATEX> at lower potentials. At <LATEX>p H = 5 ,</LATEX> the ET2-PT channel dominates, and the difference in reduction potential for ET2 compared to ET1 leads to the curve shift. It is somewhat fortuitous that the apparent reorganization energy is nearly the same at <LATEX>p H = 3</LATEX> and 5.
uow2 | Finally, we designed new experiments to test the model prediction of <LATEX>k _ { \max , \mathrm { a p p } }</LATEX> at higher <LATEX>p H .</LATEX> Figure 7a shows the structures of the catalyst when anchored to a metal oxide electrode. In the previous study, phosphonate anchor groups (top) were used. These anchors are unstable at <LATEX>p H > 5 ,</LATEX> thus prohibiting electrochemical PCET kinetics measurement at higher <LATEX>p H .</LATEX> Here, we prepared a new Ru-based water catalyst with siloxane anchor groups (bottom in Figure 7a). Detailed synthetic procedures and characterizations are provided in the SI. The siloxane anchor is stable over a much wider pH range of 0.5-12, allowing us to quantify the pH dependence over the
iat7 | entire pH range. Similar to the previously studied catalyst, when anchored on the ITO surface, this new <LATEX>R u ^ { I I }</LATEX> catalyst also has an MLCT absorption band centered around 495 nm. When a positive potential sufficient to oxidize the ruthenium center from <LATEX>\mathrm { R u } ^ { \mathrm { I I } }</LATEX> to <LATEX>\mathrm { R u } ^ { \mathrm { I I I } }</LATEX> is applied to the film, this feature is attenuated, indicating oxidation of the ruthenium center (Figure 7b).
