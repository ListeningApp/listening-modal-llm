Upstream regulators of maximum life span We used ingenuity pathway analysis to identify potential upstream regulators of the genes cognate to the top five hundred positively and top five hundred negatively life span-related CpGs. The top-ranked candidate regulators of both gene lists included SOX2-OCT4-NANOG pluripotency factors FDR equals five point seven times ten to the negative four life span negative, FDR equals five point seven times ten to the negative four life span positive, which\nixcc | enrichment terms that are significant after adjustment for multiple comparisons hypergeometric FDR is less than zero point zero one and contain at least five significant genes. The top three significant terms per column EWAS and enrichment database are shown. E Ingenuity potential upstream regulator analysis of the differentially methylated genes related to mammalian maximum life span. Only significant FDR is less than zero point zero five regulators are represented in the bar plot. F Venn diagram of three gene lists. Gene list one is the top six hundred forty-six genes adjacent to one thousand life span-related CpGs five hundred positive and five hundred negative. Gene lists two and three are based on CpGs that are differentially methylated nominal Wald test P is less than zero point zero zero five, up to five hundred positive and five hundred negatively related CpGs after OSKM overexpression in murine kidney five hundred eighty-three genes and skin six hundred eighty-six genes. We observed significant overlap between the gene lists nominal. Fisher's exact P equals nine point nine times ten to the negative thirty for skin and life span; P equals forty-five times ten to the negative twenty-five for kidney and life span. G Transcriptional factor motif enrichment analysis of life span modules and life span-related CpGs. The enrichment results for LifespanAdjWeight negative were not significant. The overlap is assessed by a hypergeometric test for the CpGs within the motifs based on the human hg nineteen genome.\n8p6h | play critical roles in cellular reprogramming. We performed a control analysis that ruled out potential confounding by sequence conservation fig. S twenty-five. Upstream regulators also included several candidates related to development: sonic hedgehog SHH, life span-negative equals one point three times ten to the negative four POU4F2, life span-negative equals three point three times ten to the negative seven and ASCLI, life span-negative FDR equals one point six times ten to the negative three Fig. five E. These\npmgl | findings suggest that expression of life span-related genes might be regulated to some extent by pluripotency factors. This prompted us to investigate whether expression of any of the life span-related genes identified above are altered by transient expression of pluripotency inducing factors Yamanaka factors OSKM in a mouse model. Indeed, this analysis revealed that transient expression of OSKM altered the expression of one hundred ninety of six hundred forty-seven life span-related genes in skin and one hundred sixty-two life span-related genes in the kidney nominal Fisher's exact P equals nine point nine times ten to the negative thirty for skin and life span; P equals four point five times ten to the negative twenty-five for kidney and life span Fig. five F and fig. S thirty-two. Genomic positions that are known to be bound by pluripotency factors in at least one human or murine cell type according to chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing ChIP-seq data from the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements ENCODE consortium are located near CpGs that are associated with maximum species life spans: NANOG-binding sites are enriched for CpGs that are positively correlated with life span FDR equals zero point zero zero two and to CpGs underlying the midnightblue module FDR equals zero point zero zero zero six, which has high methylation levels in long-lived species Fig. five G. OCT4 POU5F1 FDR equals zero point zero two, and cMYC FDR equals zero point zero zero three binding sites are enriched with CpGs in the green-yellow module, which has low methylation levels in long-lived species Fig. five G. The ChIP-seq binding location analysis also implicates other noteworthy factors such as POLII, CTCF, RAD twenty-one, YY one, and TAF one, which show the strongest enrichment for negatively life span-related CpGs Fig. five G.",
