You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

dgcw | 2. Sample descriptions
gvwz | Four basaltic eucrites (Juvinas, Camel Donga, Stannern, and Agoult) with an anomalous basaltic achondrite, Ibitira, were stud- ied in this paper. Of the five, three (Juvinas, Camel Donga, and Stannern) are breccias, and the other two (Agoult and Ibitira) are unbrecciated granulites. Brief descriptions of the meteorites are given in the following subsections. The details are summarized in Table 1.
sk5m | 2.1. Juvinas
qws8 | Juvinas is known to have fallen in France in 1821. It is com- posed of various igneous clasts, a porous matrix, and recrystal- lized areas (Metzler et al., 1995). According to the metamorphic classification of basaltic eucrites proposed by Takeda and Graham (1991), the chemically equilibrated pyroxenes in Juvinas indicate a thermal metamorphic grade of 5 (1: pristine, 6: most metamor- phosed). Various chronologies of Juvinas exhibit large variations, reflecting its extremely complicated metamorphic history (Table 1). The 207 Pb-206Pb age of its zircons has been reported at ~4560 Ma (Bukovanska and Ireland, 1993) and 4545 ± 15 Ma (Zhou et al., 2013). These values are consistent with the 182Hf-182W isochron age of <LATEX>4 5 4 6 \pm 3 M a</LATEX> for the whole rock and its silicate fractions (anchored by the D'Orbigny angrite; Touboul et al., 2015). Con- versely, the 207 Pb-206Pb isochron of the Juvinas silicates indicates a significantly younger age of <LATEX>4 3 2 0 \pm 1 . 7 M a</LATEX> Lugmair, 1996). Its 40 Ar-39 Ar age was disturbed much <LATEX>l a t e r \quad a t \sim 4 . 0 \quad G a \left( K a - \right.</LATEX> neoka et al., 1995).
877u | 2.2. Camel Donga
rzhj | Camel Donga was found in Western Australia in 1984. This me- teorite is a severely metamorphosed polymict breccia (Warren et al., 2017; Ono et al., 2018). Its highly equilibrated pyroxene indi- cates severe thermal metamorphism (Palme et al., 1988; Metzler et al., 1995). A unique characteristic of Camel Donga is its anoma- lously high abundances of secondary metallic Fe (up to 2 wt%), which is thought to be the result of decomposition of initial Fe sulfides and silicates during post-crystallization reheating (Palme et al., 1988; Warren et al., 2017). Mineralogical and chronological studies of Camel Donga also indicate its complicated metamor- phism (Table 1). The Al-Mg short-lived radiometric system in this

f2y8 | eucrite recorded early crystallization at 4564.31 +0.98/-3.48 Ma (Hublet et al., 2017). Its zircon 207 Pb/206Pb age is <LATEX>4 5 3 1 \pm 1 0 \mathrm { M a }</LATEX> (Zhou et al., 2013), resolvably younger than those of the other basaltic eucrites with mean values of 4555 Ma (Misawa et al., 2005; Zhou et al., 2013; lizuka et al., 2015). Its oxide 207 Pb-206 Pb age has been determined to be <LATEX>4 5 1 5 . 4 3 \pm 0 . 4 2 M a</LATEX> (lizuka et al., 2019), slightly younger than its zircon age. Meanwhile, its plagio- clase recorded a significantly younger <LATEX>4 0 ^ { 3 9 } A r ^ { 3 9 } A r</LATEX> age of 3750 Ma (Kennedy et al., 2013; Iizuka et al., 2019).
o7qm | 2.3. Stannern
d52l | Stannern is a monomict brecciated eucrite that fell in the Czech Lands in 1801. Compared to Juvinas and Camel Donga, its pyrox- ene chemistry and textural properties exhibit weak thermal effects, suggesting a metamorphic grade of 4 (Takeda and Graham, 1991; Metzler et al., 1995). Chronological studies of Stannern have re- vealed an old crystallization age of <LATEX>4 5 6 4 \pm 2 M a</LATEX> (Hf-W isochron age; Touboul et al., 2015) and multiple later metamorphic events. Its slightly younger zircon 207 Pb-206Pb age has been reported at 4550 ± 10 Ma (Ireland and Bukovanská, 1992). The U-Pb and K-Ar systems in its silicates were severely disturbed (Tera et al., 1997; Kennedy et al., 2019).
