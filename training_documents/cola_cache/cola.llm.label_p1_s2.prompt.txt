You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

8r5j | ABSTRACT
2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

o2kr | CARBONATED BEVERAGES AFFECT LEVELS OF ANDROGEN RECEPTOR AND TESTOSTERONE SECRETION IN MICE
v6sk | Objectives. This work aimed to study the influences of carbonated beverages (CBs) on the testis growth and the expression levels of androgen receptor (AR) of mice.
1wj6 | Methods. Two experimental groups of 30 mice each PEP-1 and PEP-2 drank 50% and 100% Pepsi-Cola, respectively for 15 days. Other 2 experimental groups of 30 mice each COC-1 and COC-2 drank 50% and 100% Coca- Cola, respectively for 15 days. The control group (CG) of 30 mice drank water. Bilateral testes were harvested aseptically on days 0, 5, 7, 10, 13 and 15. Real-time PCR and Western blot were implemented to detect levels of androgen receptor (AR) mRNA and protein in testis tissues.
936l | Results. Testes masses of PEP-2, COC-1 and COC-2 were greater than those of PEP-1 and CG (P < 0.05). On day 15, testis longitudinal diameter (TLD) of CBs-treated mice was increased as compared to CG. TLD, testes transverse diameters (TTD) and AR proteins levels of PEP-2 and COC-2 were increased in comparison with CG (P<0.05). Serum testosterone concentrations of PEP-2 were higher than that of COC-1 and CG (P < 0.05). Levels of AR mRNAs of four CBs-treated mice were increased by 60.18%, 67.26%, 65.93% and 78.76%.
06yq | Conclusions. A high concentration of Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola could raise TLD and TDD, enhance testosterone secretion, and increase serum EGF concentrations.

8r5j | INTRODUCTION
2taz | Coca-Cola (Coke) and Pepsi-Cola are two main carbonated beverages (CBs) drunk by numerous consumers over the world. CBs consumption may lead to obesity, cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes mellitus (1). CBs increased weight body of rats after consuming over one year (2). Epidemiologic studies evaluated the association between caffeine and fertility (3), which indicated that health damage effects of CBs on adolescents and children
o3ya | GENERAL ENDOCRINOLOGY
r5il | were serious. Previous studies also suggested that CBs affected fertility (4). Massive consumption of coffee or caffeine increased testosterone production (5). Coca-Cola could induce incidence of malignant mammary tumors in Sprague-Dawley rat (6). However, many reports were questionnaire and prospective investigations based on the local populations in a region. Some reports even showed the opposite (7). So far there has been little documentation regarding correlation between CBs consumption and reproduction function and fertility in humans and animals (8). CBs have been associated with alterations in estradiol and other hormones which may affect ovulation, the length of the follicular or luteal phase (9). The exact mechanisms that carbonated beverages affected the fertility are undetermined. Comparative experimental studies are scanty (6, 10).
5gui | Our preliminary study showed that administration of Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola for 25 days could decrease ovaries mass, reduce the ovarian cortex thickness, as well as affect follicles development (11). Besides, cola and Pepsi-Cola could inhibit burn repair and physics strength of the healed tissues of the burned rabbits (12). Therefore, drinking carbonated beverages may threaten reproductive success (13).
82qc | Androgens play an important role in sexual differentiation and secondary characteristics formation of the male mammals. Androgen exerts its physiological functions by combining its specific androgen receptor (AR) in target tissues (14). Testosterone, a crucial androgen, has an important role on forming puberty and maintain normal male libido. Currently, it remains undetermined whether long-term intake of CBs influences the synthesis and secretion of testosterone (15).
ls7d | The present study aimed to investigate the effects of carbonated beverages (CBs, including Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola) on the testis development and expression levels of androgen receptor (AR) of mice, and also to

t8vv | provide scientific bases for the rational consumption of CBs, and prevent prostate dysfunction and cancer.
qvnu | MATERIALS AND METHODS
kggw | Animals
xrd1 | 150 non-copulating male mice (Mus musculus), body weight of 20.84 ± 2.45g, were bought from Lanzhou University [License No. SCXK (Gansu) 2005- 0007]. They were allocated into 5 groups: Pepsi-Cola 1 (PEP-1), Pepsi-Cola 2 (PEP-2), Coca-Cola 1 (COC-1), Coca-Cola 2 (COC-2) and the control group (CG, n=30). Mice were raised in mice cages that were equipped with automatic water dispensers under the same conditions kept at 30% to 50% humidity and 22℃-24℃. Water was provided ad libitum. Mice were freely fed with daily ration feeds (Lanzhou Taihua Feed Co., China). Each mouse was weighed every day. The experiment was begun after an adaptation period of 7 days.
5746 | Animal treatments and sample collection
7toz | Pure Pepsi-Cola and Coca-Cola were purchased from the monopolized store; 50% Pepsi-Cola (Coca-Cola) was prepared by releasing one liter (1 L) of pure Coca- Cola (Pepsi-Cola) with 1 liter of tap water (1:1 v/v). Mice in PEP-1 and PEP-2 drank freely 50% and pure (100%) Pepsi-Cola, respectively for consecutive 15 days. Animals in COC-1 and COC-2 drank freely 50% and pure (100%) Coca-Cola, respectively for consecutive 15 days. Mice in the control group (CG) drank freely tap water. Bilateral testes were aseptically collected from each mouse on days 0, 5, 7, 10 and 15, respectively. Blood was harvested from the jugular vein of each mouse killed by neck dislocation. Serum was isolated from blood by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 10 min, and then stored at -20℃ until analysis. Animal treatment was permitted by the Experiment Animal Care and Use Committee of Gansu province, China.
j346 | Measurements of testis mass, testis longitudinal and transverse diameter
v8uq | The mass of each testis was measured using an electronic balance. The average was determined on the basis of both left and right values. The extraneous tissues and fats on the testis surface were removed using sterile scissors. The testis longitudinal diameter (TLD) and testis transverse diameter (TTD) of each testis were accurately measured with a vernier caliper.
x972 | Measurements of serum testosterone and epidermal growth factor (EGF)
cwrw | The contents of serum testosterone and EGF
4i0e | were measured using the mice ELISA kit (Shanghai Qiaodu Biological Technology Co., Ltd, Shanghai, China), as per instruction manual (Qiaodu biotechnology corporation, Shanghai, China). The detection level was 0.40pg/mL. Each assay was done in triplicate.
h2l3 | Determination of expression levels of AR mRNA
dfzb | Total RNAs were extracted from the testis samples (16), then reversely transcribed into cDNA with the superscriptTM first strand synthesis system for RT- PCR (Invitrogen, Beijing, China).
u6ty | Appropriate primers of the androgen receptor (AR, GenBank No: X59592.1) were designed and synthesized by Sangon Biotech Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Only those primers showing dimmer-free reactions were used for further analysis.
awvu | The sequences of androgen receptor primers (Gene ID: NM_013476.4) were forward primer: 5'- aagagacgaggaggcaggata-3' and reverse primer: 5'- gccgggaggtgctatgttag-3' (17, 18); mouse beta- actin (NM_007393) forward primer sequence: 5'-gtatgcctctggtcgtacca-3' and Reverse primer primer sequence: 5'-ttgctgacaggatgcagaag-3'; mouse glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH, NM_008084.2) forward primer sequence: 5'- cttcaacagcgacactcactct-3' and reverse primer sequence: 5'- ccaccaccctgttgctgta-3'. The expression level of androgen receptor mRNA was determined using qRT- PCR. The level of every group was assessed by the 2- AACT method and normalized to beta-actin of CG on day 0. Each sample was executed in triplicate.
on9b | Western blot analysis of androgen receptor protein in testes
a8ge | Western blot was performed so as to evaluate the expression levels of androgen receptor (AR) protein in testis tissues after Pepsi-Cola and Coca-Cola treatment. Summarily, the polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (PVDF) were incubated with Anti-AR antibody (Sigma, diluted 1:500) and ß-actin (1:1000, ab8227, USA) polyclonal antibodies at 4 ℃ overnight, before being exposed to the appropriate secondary antibody (1:2000) for 1 h. Monoclonal antibody (1:10 k) of mouse anti-ß-actin was used as a control. The integrated optical densities (OD) of image bands were determined using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Expression of AR protein was measured as grey value ratio between target band and ß-actin band. The negative control was set without primary antibody.

bd9h | The testes weights of PEP-2, COC-1 and COC- 2 were significantly increased on day 15 (P<0.05) as compared to PEP-1 and CG (Table 1). The outcomes demonstrated a high dose of Pepsi-Cola or Coca-Cola could promote testis growth and development.
m047 | Data in Table 2 showed that TLD values of four experimental groups were elevated as compared to CG on days 10 and 15. TLDs of COC-2 and PEP-2 were significantly greater than that of CG. On day 15, TTD values of COC-2 and PEP-2 were also larger than that of CG, COC-1 and PEP-1 groups. The results indicated that higher doses of Pepsi-Cola and Coca-Cola could enhance the testis longitudinal and transverse diameter, and then they promoted testis growth of mice.

On day 15, AR proteins levels of PEP-2 and COC-2 mice were increased as compared to CG (P<0.05). A high concentration of Pepsi-Cola and Coca-Cola could accelerate expressions of AR protein in the testes of mice.
ki8m | DISCUSSION
km8w | Currently, carbonated beverages (CBs), are daily consumed by many people worldwide (3, 19). CBs have been a deleterious key factor along with their consumption increase. The overweight, obesity, diabetes and endocrine disorders are associated with massive consumption of CBs (2, 20). CBs harmfully affect reproduction functions (21, 22). A survey of 2500 men indicated that the sperms

These findings demonstrated high doses of Coca- Cola and Pepsi-Cola could enhance EGF activity and testosterone secretion. These are in agreement with our previous study in rabbits (12). However, the effects have to be deeply studied. Its mechanisms also have to be further explained in other mammals in the future (5).
