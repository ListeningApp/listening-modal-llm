For these subjects, the instructions for the retrospective time course measure made no mention of the clip.\ncox8 | Results and discussion. Subjects generated a variety of words to describe their emotions. The percentage of subjects in each condition who reported happiness or its synonyms (i.e., glad, happy, joy, overjoyed, \"feel rejoiced\") and sadness or its synonyms (i.e., depressed, despair, sad, saddened, sadness, sorrow) is shown in Table Two. A chi-square test on the happiness data revealed an effect of condition, chi squared left parenthesis two, N equals one hundred sixteen right parenthesis equals fifty-five point nine seven, Cram√©r's\nppqi | MIXED EMOTIONS\noxou | P less than point zero zero one point six. To examine the nature of this effect, we conducted a pair of follow-up Fisher's exact tests which yielded P values but no test statistic. We corrected for familywise error rate in all follow-up tests in this study and Studies Five and Six by setting alpha to point zero two five. These tests indicated that people who watched the bittersweet clip were more likely to report happiness than those who watched the control clip, phi equals point seven one, P less than zero zero one or neither clip, phi equals point six five, P less than point zero zero one. There was also an effect of condition on sadness, chi squared left parenthesis two, N equals one hundred sixteen right parenthesis equals fifty-seven point three eight, Cramer's V equals point seven zero, P less than point zero zero one. Fisher's exact tests revealed that people who watched the bittersweet clip were less likely to report sadness than those who watched the control clip, phi equals negative point two nine, P equals point zero two but more likely to report sadness than those who watched neither clip, phi equals point six two,\n495n | P less than point zero zero one. To meet criteria for reporting mixed emotions, subjects in this study and Studies Five and Six had to report feeling happiness (or one of its synonyms) and sadness (or one of its synonyms). To meet criteria for experiencing simultaneously mixed emotions, subjects had to meet criteria for experiencing mixed emotions and report\nawri | that one of the figures in which happiness and sadness overlapped (i.e., Figure Six C or Six D) best captured the time course of their emotions. The percentage of subjects in each group who reported mixed emotions and simultaneously mixed emotions is shown in Table Three. Chi-square tests revealed an effect of condition on reports of mixed emotions and simultaneously mixed emotions, chi squared left parenthesis two, N equals one hundred sixteen right parenthesis equals thirty point five six and twenty-one point six one, Cramer's V equals point five one and point four three, respectively, both P less than point zero zero one. Follow-up Fisher's exact tests revealed that subjects who watched the bittersweet clip were more likely than those who watched the control clip to report mixed emotions, phi equals point four five, P less than point zero zero one and simultaneously mixed emotions, phi equals point three seven, P equals point zero zero two. Subjects who watched the bittersweet clip were also more likely to report mixed than those who watched the control clip, phi equals point four eight, P less than point zero zero one or neither clip\nbl28 | phi equals point four zero, P less than point zero zero one. The results of Study Four indicate that simply asking people in bittersweet situations how they feel is sufficient to elicit reports of\nd5bz | mixed emotions; it is not necessary to ask them whether they feel happy and sad. These findings are inconsistent with the reactive measurement hypothesis, which holds that people in bittersweet situations will report mixed emotions only when they are asked whether they feel happy and whether they feel sad. These data thereby provide additional evidence that people can feel happy and sad at the same time and that positivity and negativity are separable in experience.\nap5o | Study Five: Demand Characteristics Revisited\n7zvf | Like Study One's evidence against the vacillation hypothesis, Study Four's evidence against the reactive measurement hypothesis may have been a result of demand characteristics. That is, subjects who watched the bittersweet clip may have reported mixed emotions only because they thought we expected them to do so. To address this alternative interpretation, we conducted a study similar to Study Two in which we told some subjects that our hypothesis was that people could not feel happy and sad at the same time. In addition, we asked subjects to write about emotions rather than list them. None of the subjects in Study Four who watched neither clip reported sadness, and only six percent reported happiness, so we dropped that condition from Study Five.\nmov9 | Method. Subjects were ninety-four University of Colorado, Boulder, undergraduates (forty-eight women; fifty-one percent).\n```",
