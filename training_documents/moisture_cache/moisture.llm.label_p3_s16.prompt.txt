Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

8r5j | ABSTRACT
2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

ylhz | and within the conductor. The water penetration test is applied after a length of cable has been subjected to the bending test. A 50 mm wide ring is removed from the center of the length including layers external to the insulation screen or, alternatively, the conductor. A tube at least 10 mm in diameter is placed vertically over the exposed ring and sealed to the surface of the oversheath. Normally tap water is used to fill the tube. A period of five minutes is allowed for filling. The height of the water in the tube is 1000 mm above the center of the cable. The water is allowed to stand for 24 hours. The sample is then subjected to 10 heating cycles. The conductor is heated until it reaches a temperature not less than 5° C or more than 15° C above the maximum rated temperature of the insulation in normal operation. The heating cycle is 8 hours on and 16 hours off.
a3td | A working group of CIGRE Study Committee 21 is preparing recommendations on tests for

9d4o | high voltage cables with synthetic insulation and laminated protective coverings as moisture barriers. These tests will supplement those of IEC 840, First Edition, 1988. The recommendations are to be published in the Electra journal in 1991 after amendments are made.
cjq2 | IEEE/ICC Task Group 6-23 Activities
5esx | of the Insulated Conductors Committee (ICC) of the IEEE has undertaken, and is nearing completion, the preparation of an IEEE standard entitled "Guide on the Design, Testing and Application of Moisture Impervious, Solid Dielectric, 5 - 35 kv, Power Cable Using Metal/Plastic Laminates". The IEEE Standards Board has established Project No. P-1142 as the official identification for this endeavor. The task group is composed of representatives from utilities, industries, cable manufacturers, distributors and material suppliers. This task group was originally established to develop a guide on the use of metal/plastic laminates as , moisture barriers in all types of cable. The scope was subsequently narrowed to encompass only medium voltage power cables.
m5ka | Task Group 6-23
byu8 | As presently constituted, the guide includes sections on moisture barrier cable designs, metal/plastic laminates used for moisture barriers, cable performance and testing criteria and installation guidelines. Also included is a complete bibliography of technical papers, patents and specifications applicable to cables designed to preclude the effects of moisture.
76b0 | Presently, the task group has under consideration such matters as testing for the effects of moisture on insulation materials both by direct and indirect means. Direct means involve techniques for measuring the moisture content of the insulation. Indirect means involve electrical tests, such as dielectric strength and impulse, in order to determine if there has been a deterioration in insulation performance. Likewise, further consideration is being given to means for measuring the integrity of the moisture barrier. Another task is to resolve differences between proposed test methods for determining the overall performance of the cable in blocking the longitudinal movement of moisture. Draft No. 6 of this guide will soon be balloted by the voting members of the ICC.
zxz6 | ICEA Activities on Strand Filling
xnth | A more recent technological advance in the development of water impervious power cables has been the use of strand filling materials to block the longitudinal flow of moisture in the conductors. Working Group 610 of the Insulated Cable Engineers Association (ICEA) was established in June 1985 with three priorities for developing tests for cable with filled conductors. The first was to prepare a guide on testing for resistance to water penetration. The second was to develop tests for compatibility of the filler compound with adjacent cable materials (conductor screen) . The third was to consider requirements for connectability testing of sealed conductors.

bf9k | Conductors" was published in September 1989.14 The test procedure for qualification calls for two cable samples, 2 m long (7.5ft). One is heated to 90C for one hour and the other is cooled to 0℃ for an hour. After conditioning, the samples are bent around a mandrel for three reverse bends. A 1 m (3ft.) sample is attached to a pressurized water system and subjected to 35 kPa (5 psi) for one hour. For a production test one sample is subjected to pressure for 15 minutes without conditioning, but after being subjected to three reverse bends. Thus, the guide consists of both a qualification test and a production test.
otkr | The second priority of the ICEA working group was to develop a guide for establishing the compatibility of the filler compound used to seal the conductor. 15 The criteria for compatibility is the effect the filler has on the volume resistivity stability of the semiconducting compound used as the conductor screen. The working group has reviewed six test procedures and two have been completely tested and evaluated. A third procedure is presently under test. Variation in testing methodologies are being defined.
ibgs | The work on the third priority, connect- ability, has been discontinued. The ICEA charter does not permit it to deal with accessories. However, extensive work by several organizations has indicated that connectability of strand filled conductors will not be changed versus unsealed conductors. Connectability is considered feasible with standard commercial connectors. 16, 17
colo | De-Facto Standards - French Specifications
d6r4 | Watertight, medium voltage, synthetic insulated cable has been in use by Electricite de France (EdF) since 1978. Longitudinal water tightness is provided by a hygroscopic powder laid inside longitudinal grooves of the semiconducting insulation screen. Radial water tightness is obtained via an aluminum screen which is adhesively bonded to a polyvinyl chloride (PVC) oversheath. The
9mrz | A cable meets EdF Standard HN 33-S-23. complete body of standards has been developed to cover accessories (HN 33-M-03) , 24 kV plug- in terminations (HN 52-S-61) single core terminations (HN 68-S-06) , joints (HN 68-S-07 and HN 68-S-08) , and connectors (HN 68-S-04) . The connectors developed for the aluminum screen do not require stripping of the sheath. Thus, a complete technology package has been developed for the watertight cable design.
pk06 | Specific tests for water tightness are included in the HN 33-S-23 specification. The longitudinal water tightness test is carried out after three bending cycles. A 10 mm wide ring is cut out of the oversheath in the middle of a 3 m long sample. The area around the ring is enclosed in a small tank that is sealed to the oversheath. The tank is filled with water and a water head of 800 mm is maintained over the sealed area. The sample is subjected to a 24 hour period at ambient temperature without current. Then 10 thermal cycles are applied bringing the conductor to 100° C for 4 hours, followed by a 4 hour cooling period. No water leakage is permitted from the sample ends.
7wn9 | 146
wcd0 | For radial water tightness an immersion withstand test is used. A sample at least 10 m long is immersed in water with the ends exposed. A voltage at twice the operating voltage of the cable is applied. A current is applied to bring the temperature of the conductor to 100° C in parts of the cable not immersed in water. Thermal cycling of 8 hours on and 16 hours off for 200 thermal cycles or 5,000 hours is required without electrical breakdown of the insulation.
caos | The cable standard also contains tests for checking the compatibility of the cable components and a metallic shield corrosion test is under consideration.
qrvy | APPLICATIONS OF MOISTURE IMPERVIOUS CABLE
pn9j | The need for a compact and low cost single conductor medium voltage cable for underground distribution led to a moisture barrier construction in Sweden. The cable consists of an aluminum conductor, a triple extruded XLPE insulation system, a semi- conductive paper tape to provide a thermal expansion layer, a longitudinally formed copolymer coated aluminum that acts as both moisture barrier and shield, and a jacket of cross-linked polyethylene. The aluminum is 0.30 mm (0.012 in) thick. The coating on the aluminum is bonded to the cable jacket. It has been reported that more than 3000 km of this cable has been in use since 1974 with no failures attributed to water treeing 18.
1pmc | A medium voltage cable with synthetic insulation and an aluminum moisture barrier was developed by EdF and introduced into their power system in 1978.19 The cable meets EdF standard HN 33-S-23. It has an oversheath of relatively thick 2mm (0.12 in) polyvinyl chloride jacket (PVC) to facilitate direct burial. Radial water tightness is achieved via an aluminum screen which is bonded to the PVC oversheath. The sealing of the overlap is facilitated with a hot melt adhesive. Longitudinal water tightness is provided by hydroscopic powder. Thermal expansion is handled by grooves in the strippable extruded semiconducting screen. The field experience with this cable has been excellent. At the end of 1986 a total of 31,000 km of HN 33-S-23 cable had been installed. As shown in Table III the mean national fault rate for all causes and all cables types combined has steadily decreased as more and more moisture barrier cable has been installed. The technology is fully developed and includes connectors for the moisture barrier (which do not require the jacket to be stripped) , accessories, terminations, joints and installation practices.20
5z6q | The use of aluminum as a radial moisture barrier on high voltage able is increasing. Recently a cable of this type was installed in Bavaria.21 The construction has been altered due to the fact that water ingress can impair the dielectric strength of the cross-linked polyethylene insulation. The screen still consists of copper wires. A material capable of swelling is included in the zone of the screen to limit the axial penetration of water. The sheath

hntf | polyethylene jacket. Polyethylene was chosen because of its better mechanical properties over PVC.
99fo | Over 4000 km (2500 miles) of on-core moisture barrier cable has been installed in the United State by a large, east coast utility. Much of this cable is 1000 kcmil aluminum, 35 kV with XLPE insulation. Recently, a test program was initiated to check the condition and performance of this cable. Cable manufactured near the start of the program was obtained and its AC breakdown and lighting impulse breakdown strength was compared to field aged samples and newly manufactured cable samples. The data indicate that there was no significant deterioration of the cable electrical properties after seven years of service. A thorough microscopic wafer examination of the field samples showed no electrochemical treeing.22
y5r7 | CONCLUSIONS
lrry | The common sense approach to treeing is to keep moisture away from the cable di- electric. Moisture impervious cable is designed to do this. The use of such cable makes good economic sense as well. Cables are capital goods and their value as an investment must be optimized. The use of moisture impervious designs is justified when the life cycle costs associated with installation, outages, repairs, and premature replacement of cable are considered.
hvhm | The concept of moisture impervious cable is emerging. Moisture impervious cable is defined as cable designed to block both the longitudinal and radial ingress of moisture into the cable. A plastic coated metallic tape provides the radial moisture barrier. In the case of under-jacket designs, the longitudinal transmission of moisture is blocked by 1) bonding the tape to the jacket and sealing the overlap, 2) using water swell- able tape or powders in the interface between the moisture barrier and core, and 3) strand filling the conductor.

Water-swellable, non-woven tapes are functional as cushion (thermal expansion). layers and longitudinal water blocks. Plastic coated aluminum and copper tapes meet the needs for a radial metallic moisture barrier having excellent adhesion to polyethylene, chlorinated polyethylene or polyvinyl chloride jackets and excellent bond stability during thermal loading, temperature cycling, water aging, and exposure to elevated temperatures. Hot melt adhesives have been developed which are effective in sealing the overlap of the metallic moisture barrier and which meet all needs for adhesion and bond stability.
uz3c | Two designs for under-jacket moisture impervious cable are in use or under development. One under-jacket design retains the wire neutrals while the other design uses the moisture barrier as both a radial water block and shield. Plastic coated aluminum is recommended when wire neutrals are required. The coated aluminum can be applied smooth and is longitudinally folded over the neutrals.

ba4l | It is then bonded to the cable jacket and sealed at the overlap to form the moisture barrier. A plastic coated copper is recommended for the combination moisture barrier and shield. The copper can be applied smooth or corrugated. The use of corrugated shields is on the increase especially for larger diameter cable.
ffx8 | Standardization activities for moisture impervious cable are in progress globally. The International Electrotechnical Commission is defining water blocking tests. CIGRE is preparing recommendations for high voltage cables with laminated coverings. The Insulated Conductors Committee of the IEEE is preparing a guide on medium voltage cable using metal/plastic laminates as moisture barriers: The Insulated Conductors Engineers Association (ICEA) has issued a guide for

A full complement of standards and tests have been developed by Electricite De France for use in their system. Those standardization activities are taking place during development of the technology for moisture impervious cable. The users are able to participate in the development of this technology and use the guides and standards to prepare their own specifications. The most widespread use of medium voltage watertight cable has been by Electricite De France with over 31,000 km (21,000 miles) of three phase network installed between 1976 and 1986. Experience has been excellent. The mean national fault rate has steadily decreased as more and more watertight cable is placed in service.
