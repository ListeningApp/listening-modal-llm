You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

jkp9 | The AKT pathway has a critical role in diverse biological processes including cell proliferation, differentiation, and metabolism (Chen et al., 2001; Scherer et al., 2021). On the one hand, it leads to the assembly of mTORC1, which is critical for regulating mitochondrial metabolism as well as lipid, fatty acid and protein synthesis (Sarbassov et al., 2005; Saxton and Sabatini, 2017; Wullschleger et al., 2006). On the other hand, the AKT signalling pathway inhibits the activity of the Forkhead box O (FoxO) transcription factor, which regulates glucose and lipid metabolism (Accili and Arden, 2004; Barthel et al., 2005). However, the exact role of FoxO in the brain is still unclear. IRS 1/2 in addition to or possibly competing with Shc can also activate the MAPK pathway, which plays a key role in many biological processes like cell prolifera- tion, differentiation, development, transformation, and apoptosis (W. Zhang and Liu, 2002). Both Shc and IRS activate Grb2/Sos complexes, which, in turn, lead to the activation of Ras-Raf-MEK-ERC-cascade and further downstream substrates regulating cell growth-related gene expression (Siddle, 2011) and cell proliferation (Burotto et al., 2014). The relevance of IRS and Shc for activation of the Ras pathways may differ between cell lines and tissues (Pruett et al., 1995; Takahashi et al., 1997) as well as during different stages in brain development and function.
z8tt | Very recently, a co-receptor called "inceptor" was discovered in the pancreas that is involved in the degradation of insulin receptors on ß- cells through clathrin-mediated endocytosis (Ansarullah et al., 2021). The inhibition of this co-receptor has been shown to be associated with higher insulin secretion and a lower peripheral glucose level, hence providing an interesting target for diabetes treatment. Whether this regulatory co-receptor has a relevant role in the brain is an area of current research.
9g22 | 2.2. Insulin action in the dopaminergic midbrain
41fx | For a very long time, hypothalamic nuclei have been considered the only central target of insulin to assure homeostatic control, which was assumed to be segregated from hedonic (food) reward seeking. How- ever, a wave of fundamental studies has clearly shown that homeostatic
7um8 | information is integrated into the DA midbrain since a) different neuron populations from the lateral hypothalamus and the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus project to the VTA inducing or inhibiting DA release in the VTA and its projection sites depending on the homeostatic state (Nieh et al., 2015; Qu et al., 2019; Reichenbach et al., 2022; Rossi et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2022) and b) multiple metabolic hormones (including insulin) and nutrients also directly acts in the DA midbrain. Insulin receptors are co-expressed on DA neurons in the midbrain (Fig- lewicz et al., 2003) (see Appendix, Table 1). And indeed, key regulators of the intracellular insulin-signaling pathway such as IRS-2 and PI3K/AKT have been identified to play a critical role in DA signalling in VTA neurons (Lute et al., 2008; Pardini et al., 2006b).
uow2 | 2.2.1. Insulin increases DAT expression and function
iat7 | Particularly, the PI3K/AKT pathway regulates DA clearance by modulating DAT expression and function (Carvelli et al., 2002). Acute application of insulin to the VTA in vitro reduced somatodendritic DA levels in fast-scan voltammetry through increased DAT clearance in a concentration-dependent manner by activating PI3K and mTOR signal- ling pathways (Figlewicz et al., 2007; Mebel et al., 2012). In line with this, increased DAT mRNA levels were detected in the VTA after chronic insulin application (Figlewicz et al., 1994). In turn, suppression of PI3K signalling, selective DAT inhibition with GBR12909 as well as DAT-knockout inhibited the DA-suppressing effect of insulin (Mebel et al., 2012; Williams et al., 2007).
ywwr | 2.2.2. Insulin modulates tyrosine hydrolase (TH) activity - the rate-limiting enzyme in catecholamine synthesis
0i6j | Selective knockout of insulin receptors in TH-expressing neurons reduced the expression of TH-mRNA (Könner et al., 2011). Moreover, the acute application of insulin on VTA slices directly increases the firing rate of SN/VTA neurons in patch clamp recordings potentially through PI3K-signalling pathways (Könner et al., 2011). However, the exact signalling pathways are still unclear.
87cq | 2.2.3. Insulin modulates the excitatory and inhibitory inputs on DA neurons
0qs3 | The VTA receives excitatory glutamatergic input from the prefrontal cortex, lateral dorsal tegmentum, pedunculopontine nucleus (PPTg), and lateral hypothalamus (Watabe-Uchida et al., 2012). Insulin administration in the VTA decreases the excitatory inputs on DA neurons and induces long-term depression (LTD) via AKT/mTOR signalling and endocannabinoid mediated presynaptic suppression of glutamate release (Labouèbe et al., 2013a), while the inhibitory GABA-ergic inputs remain unchanged (Labouèbe et al., 2013b). This effect could be driven by PPTg inputs to the VTA, as phasic DA release in the NAc evoked by stimulating PPTg inputs to the VTA is suppressed by intra-VTA insulin (Naef et al., 2019). This appears in contrast to the facilitating effects of insulin on the firing rate of VTA dopamine neurons. The spontaneous firing frequency was not different between control and insulin-receptor lacking DA neurons, suggesting that basal endogenous insulin signalling does not influence the firing of DA neurons. However, bath application of insulin increased the firing rate of DA neurons (Könner et al., 2011). This may occur via intrinsic mechanisms or through reduced inhibition of D2-receptors. It is possible that insulin has a differential impact on tonic and phasic DA release of VTA neurons: Higher firing frequency might increase tonic DA release in low concentrations in the NAc. And the insulin-mediated suppression of excitatory inputs could decrease the ability to produce phasic bursts, which are particularly relevant for the reward-seeking behaviour (Floresco et al., 2003; Tsai et al., 2009). However, these are only speculations and need to be systematically investigated in future studies.
z8f7 | To summarise the available data, insulin in the VTA reduces extra- cellular somatodendritic DA concentrations through increased DA re- uptake, reduces LTD of excitatory inputs, and decreases PPTg-evoked DA release in the NAc.
