You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

pbea | Not only can habitus be transformed by new experiences, it can also be "controlled through awakening of consciousness and socio-analysis" (Bourdieu and Wacquant 1992, p. 116).
ccpt | 6.1 Capital
0fpw | Capital is anything that has been designated to have value in a particular social field. Capital is context specific, transferable, and convertible (Bourdieu 1993a). Bourdieu (1986) identifies three primary forms as, economic capital, cultural capital and social capital. Economic capital can be directly converted into money social capital can be defined as connections or networks that can be converted into economic capital. Bourdieu defines cultural capital as background, knowledge, dispositions, and skills. Cultural capital has three distinct forms: embodied, objectified and institutionalized (Bourdieu 1986). Embodied cultural capital consists of dispositions and competen- cies. Objectified cultural capital consists of physical possessions, such as books and works of art. Institutionalized cultural capital consists of institutional recognition, in the form of academic qualifications of the cultural capital held by an individual.
dqn8 | Bourdieu (1986) used cultural capital to explain differences in educational outcomes between children of different classes. According to Bourdieu, children from upper class households inherit a substantially different cultural capital than do those from poor working-class households. Schools reward the cultural capital of the upper classes at the same time they devalue or misrecognize that of the poor working classes. Cultural capital allows those well endowed to benefit from education in ways those without cannot.
cop0 | Bourdieu (1986) defines social capital as "the aggregate of the actual or potential resources which are linked to possession of a durable network of more or less insti- tutionalized relationships of mutual acquaintance and recognition" (p. 248). The amount of social capital will depend on the size of the network and the capital (economic and cultural) members of the network possess. This network is the product of investment strategies.
lhkq | 6.2 Field
82ju | Bourdieu and Wacquant (1992) describes fields as microcosms in which the social agents (individuals or social institutions) interact and struggle with each other in accordance with field-specific rules and hierarchies. The struggle within the fields is for control of resources (economic, cultural and social capital). Bourdieu (1998) describes a social field as,
y2qo | A structured social space, a field of forces, a force field. It contains people who dominate and people who are dominated. Constant, permanent relationships of inequality operate inside this space, which at the same time becomes a space in which various actors struggle for
1piq | the transformation or preservation of the field. All the individuals in this universe bring to the competition all the (relative) power at their disposal. It is this power that defines their position in the field and, as a result, their strategies. (p. 40-41).
7fqw | Therefore, a society can be viewed as a system of interconnected fields; each field has its own characteristics, hierarchies and laws of functioning (Bourdieu 1990a). Although fields are autonomous, they are embedded and influenced by other fields. For example, the educational leadership field may also be influenced by the political and the economic fields. According to Bourdieu, society can be thought of as one large field; within the field, there is a struggle skewed in favor of those with economic, social and cultural capital (Bourdieu 1991; Bourdieu and Wacquant 1992). In each field the social space is stratified. Capital determines the dominant and the dominated social agents.
rhaz | One can only determine what constitutes a field by studying empirical work; however, Bourdieu cautions researchers about the complexity of the relationships between fields (Bourdieu and Wacquant 1992). Bourdieu and Wacquant (1992) suggest three necessary and interconnected steps that could be used to study a field. The first step analyzes the positions of the field vis-à-vis the field of power. The second step maps out the objective structures of relations between the positions occupied by the social agents (individuals or institutions) who compete for power in the field. And, the last step analyzes the habitus of social agents. Bourdieu studied many fields including, education, art, television, journalism, religion, housing construction, and literature (Bourdieu and Wacquant 1992).
wak1 | In sum, we see Bourdieu's (1977b, 1984, 1986, 1990a) concepts of habitus, field and social capital as critically important to understanding the relationships the indi- vidual has with schools and society. Bourdieu's theories extend and enhance socio- logical perspectives on schools as societal institutions and leaders as agents within these institutions (Fayol 1949; Simon 1958), yet few scholars have explicitly applied Bourdieu's theories to schools and school leadership.
wtfz | 7 The Interconnectedness of the Thinking Tools
qy1i | The formulation "(Habitus x Capital) + Field = Practice" helps us to see how the thinking tools are interconnected (Bourdieu 1984). The equation can present the rela- tionship between the tools: practice is the result of relations between one's habitus (dispositions) and the quantity and quality of one's capital within the current field. Bourdieu uses the thinking tools to understand social practice, and particularly to uncover the inequalities in particular social spaces. The thinking tools cannot be examined in isolation from one another. Bourdieu and Wacquant (1992) empha- size, "Such notions as habitus, field, and capital can be defined, but only within the theoretical system they constitute, not in isolation." (p. 96).
1k9e | The value of capital hinges on the existence of a field or game that allows the possessors to wield power; thus "capital does not exist and function except in relation

uodj | to a field" (Bourdieu and Wacquant 1992, p. 101). Therefore, any strategies of social agents in the field depend on the quantity and quality of capital they possess. While most social agents play the game to increase or conserve their capital, others play to transform the existing rules of the game (Bourdieu and Wacquant 1992). Bourdieu and Wacquant (1992) argue that "in order to construct the field, one must identify the forms of specific capital that operate within it, and to construct the forms of specific capital one must know the specific logic of the field" (p. 108).
k16v | Habitus can be seen as the theoretical bridge between capital and field because it explains why within a particular field social agents' actions or decisions are based on the types and quantity of capital they possess (Bourdieu and Wacquant 1992). Therefore, as we work with Bourdieu to understand educational leadership, we must examine the relationships that exist between the thinking tools in the context of schooling.
b2lm | 8 Extant Scholarship on Bourdieu and Leadership
ti7f | In an introductory essay for a special issue on Bourdieu in the International Journal of Leadership in Education, Lingard and Christie (2003) present the case for using Bourdieu's theoretical framework to examine the work of school principals. The special issue sought to explore how Bourdieu's conceptual frameworks and method- ological approaches might be applied in educational leadership research. Lingard and Christie (2003) articulate substantively how Bourdieu enhances the educational lead- ership field with attention to relationships between individuals and social structures within the context of schooling. They argue that Bourdieu's theoretical approach will "enable us to move beyond trait, situational and transformational leadership theories, emphasizing instead the recursive relationship between agency (individual leader habitus) and structure (field) in the broader social context" (p. 319).
