        "content": "u5ug | Barite and silica, which form close to the seafloor at much lower temperatures than anhydrite, may also have been important in forming an initial cap on the permeable units, promoting lateral flow of fluids and allowing subseafloor temperatures to reach the point of anhydrite precipitation (greater than one hundred fifty degrees Celsius). Early cooling of the fluids and mixing near the seafloor was likely, given the highly permeable volcaniclastic cover. The style of hydrothermal upflow also plays an important role in the nature of the seafloor mineralization. Jamieson et al. showed a high proportion of seawater mixing in chimneys with predominant dendritic barite; similar diffuse venting is likely responsible for the formation of porous beehive-like structures and unusual bulbous chimneys observed at Tinakula. This style of venting, which has been inferred for the origin of layered barite-sulfide mounds in the East Diamante caldera and at Clark seamount, may be common where seafloor venting occurs through permeable volcaniclastic substrates. Diffuse discharge over a large area is also consistent with the bottom-hugging plume signal originally detected at Tinakula.\n\ni9k5 | The Tinakula SMS deposit is the first documented example of a modern SMS deposit developed mainly in bimodal-mafic volcaniclastic rocks. The particular mineralization and alteration styles recognized here are a direct result of the volcanic\n\n20z2 | Eight hundred ninety-three\n\n4cgs | setting, which is dominated by a permeable substrate rather than the coherent lava flows typical of mid-ocean ridges. Morphologies of the volcanic cones at Tinakula and the volcaniclastic facies successions are consistent with extensive Strombolian-type eruptions, forming a row of cinder cones along a north-south trending fissure. The eruptions likely occurred over days to months, while geothermal activity at Tinakula may have lasted thousands of years. The massive sulfide mineralization may not be closely related temporally to formation of the cinder cones, but instead the hydrothermal systems most likely exploited the same structural corridor. Lateral fluid flow and semiconformable alteration at Tinakula are similar to those described in a class of ancient VMS deposits hosted by volcaniclastic rocks, such as the Sturgeon Lake VMS district. In ancient VMS deposits of this type, semiconformable alteration is commonly observed at depths of several hundred meters below the paleoseafloor, associated with subseafloor deposition of massive sulfide. What is unusual at Tinakula is that hydrothermal fluids affected such a large area so close to the seafloor: approximately one hundred fifty thousand square meters at the seafloor and possibly three times as large below the seafloor. The shallow alteration and anhydrite likely acted as an insulating layer for hydrothermal circulation and mineralization at depth, as seen in ancient VMS deposits.",
