It's actually more like zero point five zero three five eight times the mass of a helium. This makes its thermal wavelength a bit smaller than our estimate in the last paragraph, which boosts its entropy. It's nice that such subtleties, ultimately due to nuclear physics, are showing up here.\n28e7 | By the way, all our calculations have been for the most common isotopes of hydrogen and helium: hydrogen whose nucleus consists of a single proton, and helium whose nucleus consists of two protons and two neutrons. Other isotopes have significantly different mass, and this changes the entropy values significantly.\nye9e | THE ENTROPY OF HYDROGEN: EXPERIMENT\ndyie | The entropy of hydrogen at standard temperature and pressure has been measured to be one hundred thirty point six eight joules per kelvin per mole.\n75gl | One bit of unknown information per molecule corresponds to about five point seven six three one joules per kelvin of entropy per mole.\nwu5u | Thus, each molecule of hydrogen at standard temperature and pressure has about one hundred thirty point six eight approximately twenty-two point six seven five five point seven six three one\nw7ga | bits of unknown information.\nl7xq | Okay, let's compare our theoretical prediction to experiment.\ncqbg | The experimental figure for the entropy of hydrogen at standard temperature and pressure is one hundred thirty point six eight joules per kelvin per mole, which translates into twenty-two point six seven five bits per molecule. This is larger than our theoretical prediction of twenty-one point eight four eight bits per molecule by about three point eight percent.\nhr2e | That's not bad. We can say we solved our original problem fairly well. But the percentage error here is about four times worse than it was for calculation for helium. Why is it worse?\nzsya | I haven't studied this, but I can imagine two reasons. First, remember that quantum effects kick in when V over N A cubed ceases to be large. This quantity is a bit smaller for hydrogen than for helium. Remember, for helium it was two hundred seventy-nine thousand six hundred sixty-three at standard temperature and pressure, while for hydrogen it's one hundred thirteen thousand nine hundred seventy-one. But that's still very large, so I imagine quantum effects are still quite tiny.\n7dof | Second, hydrogen molecules are not chemically inert like helium atoms, and they're larger, and diatomic rather than monatomic. So I'd expect them to interact more, making the ideal gas approximation worse. This feels like a more plausible explanation for the three point eight percent discrepancy.\nykie | WHERE DID WE GO?\n3hj2 | The mystery: why does each molecule of hydrogen have approximately twenty-three bits of entropy at standard temperature and pressure? V\noy25 | The goal: derive and understand the formula for the entropy of a classical ideal monatomic gas:\nti3v | negative W N of M plus three over two Log M plus negative Log k T plus Y\nufwv | including the mysterious constant Y:\nm0qi | Two M over N squared\ny63m | Y equals two over twelve plus two\n12af | The subgoal: compute the entropy of a single classical particle in a one-dimensional box:\nnznk | S equals k times Log L plus negative Log k T plus negative Log twelve\ntd48 | plus two times Log twenty-two plus one half\n0tv0 | The sub-subgoal: explain entropy from the ground up, and compute the entropy of a classical harmonic oscillator:\n1pei | S equals k Log of plus one times Log of k T\nat1e | We're done! Or at least we reached our stated goal. But there is a lot more to say about entropy. In a way we've scarcely scratched the surface. For more on the mathematics of entropy, I recommend these books:\nzpsj | The second one has an intense focus on our friend the box of gas. And for the principle of maximum entropy, I again recommend this insightful and opinionated text:\nb75r | THE FIRST LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS\nbuot | Suppose a system has some measure space X of states with functions called energy E of X to R and volume V of X to R.\npb5c | Consider probability distributions on X maximizing the Gibbs entropy S subject to constraints on E and V.\nh0uy | Then as we vary E and V we have d of E equals T d S minus P d of V\nkqxy | where T is called temperature and P is called pressure.\n3572 | I said we were done. But what kind of course on entropy doesn't cover the three laws of thermodynamics? I talked a bit about the Third Law, but I haven't even mentioned the other two yet.\nmj6d | Here's why: this wasn't a course on thermodynamics. In 'classical thermodynamics' there's a tradition of taking concepts such as energy, work and heat as primitive, and treating the laws of thermodynamics as axioms. I've instead been explaining a bit of 'classical statistical mechanics', where we start with probability theory and attempt to derive classical thermodynamics. In this approach the laws of thermodynamics are not fundamental. They actually look a bit odd: they become results that hold under various conditions, so each one becomes a collection of theorems and conjectures.\nosru | I'll state versions of the three laws of thermodynamics in the language we've developed here. But please be aware that my versions are idiosyncratic and will make some people raise their eyebrows. I'm afraid you'll have to go elsewhere, like Reif's book, to learn these laws in their traditional form!\n7cej | We've been maximizing entropy subject to a constraint on the expected value of one quantity. What if we do two or more? Everything works the same way, but the fundamental relation between temperature, energy and entropy, d of E equals T d S, gets one extra term for each constraint. The resulting equation is a version of the 'First Law of Thermodynamics'.\n9v21 | I'll explain the case with one extra constraint. Suppose we've got a measure space X whose points are states of some system. Choose two functions on it. They could be anything, but let's call them energy and volume and write them as E of X to R and V of X to R. These terms are favored because thermodynamics arose in part from the study of steam engines, where you've got a cylinder of steam with some energy and some volume. For any probability distribution p of X to zero comma zero, we can write down a formula for its Shannon entropy\nt3ut | H equals negative p of x Log p of x d x\nblsg | and also the expected values\n```",
