You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

mjt8 | 624 staining of sections from hTau-KI mice stereotactically injected with iBEp and contralaterally
htcn | 625 injected with vehicle control. After stereotactic injections, animals were allowed to recover for
86d4 | 626 72 hours and then brains were perfused, sectioned, and stained for ThioS. We find a strong 627 increase in ThioS staining from the CA1 region of hippocampi exposed to iBEp relative to
z7qp | 628 vehicle controls (Fig 6D). ThioS+ inclusions appear as flame-like inclusions in both the CA1
6t1g | 629 pyramidal layer and the granule cell layer of the Dentate Gyrus (Fig 6D, E, S6F-J).
cpls | 630 Neuroproteasome inhibition-induced flame-like ThioS+ aggregates co-localize with both
m50n | 631 phosphorylated Tau (AT8) and total Tau (DA9) (Fig 6F, G, S6K) in single Z-plane images from
eztf | 632 neurons in the CA1 and DG of hippocampus. We conclude that some neuroproteasome-induced
bwsu | 633 aggregates we observe are indeed composed of Tau. In addition to these large ThioS+ inclusions, 634 we also observe some thread-like ThioS+ inclusions in the hippocampal neuropil as well as
oqod | 635 widely distributed thin ThioS+ inclusions that appear dispersely throughout the iBEp-injected
tey0 | 637 hippocampus (Fig 6G, S6L, M). The ThioS+ inclusions formed following neuroproteasome
ghiv | 636
o5ts | 638 inhibition appear to resemble neurofibrillary tangle (NFT)-like and neuropil thread-like
hd7d | inclusions observed in various Tauopathies including AD (8, 17, 54, 120). While we find it
ehux | 639 highly surprising that ThioS+ Tau inclusions appear just 72 hours after neuroproteasome
poxj | 640 inhibition, these data support our overall conclusion that neuroproteasome inhibition induces the aggregation of endogenous Tau.
2xvb | 641
m1hx | 642 De novo protein synthesis is required for neuroproteasome-dependent induction of
9psh | 643 endogenous Tau aggregates
aiqv | 644
4klz | 645 Neuroproteasomes are 20S complexes and do not have the machinery to recognize ubiquitin or 646 unfold substrates(3, 4). Instead, neuroproteasomes co- or peri-translationally degrade newly synthesized and unfolded substrates rather than substrates which are fully folded(4). We 648 therefore tested whether new protein synthesis was required for the neuroproteasome-dependent
xz5d | 647
erwx | 649 formation of endogenous Tau aggregates. We incubated primary neuronal cultures with either
ie7i | 650 iBEp or Epoxomicin and then co-incubated these cultures with cycloheximide, which blocks
aksw | 651 translation elongation. Here, we reproduce iBEp-induced Tau aggregation and find that
0fsl | 652 cycloheximide blocks this iBEp-mediated increase in both WT primary neurons (Fig 7A) and in 653 hTau-KI primary neurons (Fig 7B). Cycloheximide also blocks the effect of SulfoMG on the 654 formation of endogenous insoluble Tau inclusions, consistent with our observations using iBEp
0m3g | 655 (Fig 7C). Next, we tested whether inhibition of protein synthesis blocks the accumulation of
9sp0 | 656 sarkosyl-insoluble Tau in vivo in hTau-KI mice. We stereotactically co-injected cycloheximide 657 and iBEp together contralateral to iBEp alone into the hippocampus. We find a dramatic
nbpk | 658 decrease in sarkosyl-insoluble Tau in the hippocampus from mice co-injected with iBEp and
xs3r | 659 cycloheximide compared to those injected with iBEp alone (Fig 7D, S7A). Next, co-injection of
ffuj | 660 cycloheximide with iBEp completely eliminated AT8 staining compared to contralateral
h7f6 | 661 injection of iBEp alone (Fig 7E). Finally, similar to what we observed with sarkosyl-insoluble
t74k | 662 Tau and AT8 staining, we also observe a complete return to baseline of ThioS+ staining in
qdn7 | 663 hippocampi co-injected with iBEp and cycloheximide relative to those injected with iBEp alone (Fig 7F).
dib4 | 664 665 666 There are many mechanisms which could explain our observation that new protein synthesis is required for the formation of neuroproteasome inhibition-induced endogenous Tau aggregates.
yvqj | 667
vz2f | 668 We interpret our data and argue that neuroproteasome inhibition induces the accumulation of
wyu0 | 669 newly synthesized protein(s) important for Tau accumulation. The most straightforward
s8xw | 670 candidate protein would be Tau itself. To determine specifically if we observed more newly
afv1 | 671 synthesized Tau protein following neuroproteasome inhibition, we took advantage of proximity
fwf1 | 672 ligation assays (PLA) coupled with puromycylation to visualize newly synthesized Tau
3wck | 673 protein(121, 122). Briefly, we used specific monoclonal N-terminal antibodies against Tau and
jq2u | 674 specific antibodies against puromycin. Each antibody is recognized by secondary antibodies
9zf9 | 675 tethered to oligonucleotides that can ligate and amplify in situ. When antibodies against Tau and
clwo | 676 Puromycin are proximal to each other, this permits the oligonucleotide ligation which can be
aki1 | 677 detected by a fluorescent signal under hybridizing conditions (Fig 7G). A positive PLA signal
vf5h | 678 therefore indicates the presence of newly synthesized Tau. We incubated Puromycin in primary
l51p | 679 neuronal cultures for only 10 minutes, which allows us to visualize a defined short snapshot of
s9zz | 680 newly synthesized Tau. We observe no signal in neurons either not treated with puromycin or in
x97k | 681 neurons where we block protein synthesis using cycloheximide or anisomycin during
qwix | 682 puromycylation, validating our approach (Fig S7B, C). We observe a striking ~3.5-fold increase
6lnq | 683 in Puro-PLA-Tau signal in iBEp-treated neurons relative to DMSO controls (Fig 7H). We then 684 analyzed the size distribution of diameters of the newly synthesized Tau puncta (Fig 7I). After 685 accounting for and normalizing against the increase in puncta number seen in iBEp-treated
nxb1 | 686 neurons, we observe an increase in the size distribution of PLA puncta from iBEp treated
kwpw | 687 neurons. We find that iBEp treated neurons contain an over twofold increase in newly 688 synthesized Tau puncta greater than 24nm in diameter (Fig 7I). We interpret this to mean that 689 there are larger inclusions of newly synthesized Tau which form following neuroproteasome
usfa | 690 inhibition, consistent with our observations that neuroproteasome inhibition induces Tau
dnjr | 69 aggregation.
qser | 692
8gam | 693 Discussion
z4db | 694
lw7l | 695 We conclude that neuroproteasome localization is differentially regulated by ApoE isoforms, 696 which is critically important because reduced neuroproteasome function induces the aggregation of endogenous Tau. The relevance for neuroproteasomes in many aspects of the cell biology of
2exi | 697
16py | 698 neurons, as well as pathophysiology of neurodegeneration, will be critical to explore in the
m4ov | 699 future. The cell-impermeable neuroproteasome-specific inhibitors we have developed and the
9uqd | 700 tools we have built to visualize and purify neuroproteasomes will enable the broad study of 701 neuroproteasomes in various aspects of neuronal physiology and pathophysiology.
8szx | 702
iwdc | 703 The mechanisms by which ApoE interacts with and influences neuroproteasome localization 704 remain unexplored. ApoE is found as a lipoprotein and the classic role for ApoE is a cholesterol
4vks | 705 carrier(123). While we demonstrate only lipidated ApoE can influence neuroproteasome
uyaf | 706 localization, we do not understand whether the lipids transported by ApoE are involved in
d1qh | 707 regulating neuroproteasomes or if the lipoproteins are more efficiently able to interact with the 708 neuroproteasome complex. Neuroproteasome levels change in ApoE3/3 AD carriers relative to
nyqt | 709 controls, which likely suggests that other mechanisms besides ApoE are at play in controlling
7odd | 710 neuroproteasome localization. It is therefore an open and important task to define the milieu of
0le2 | 711 molecular and cell biological factors that can influence neuroproteasome localization. Detailed
5dw0 | 712 characterization of such mechanisms may help understand whether and how neuroproteasomes
i4yq | 713 contribute to the large diversity of phenotypes in Tauopathies and neurodegenerative disease.
fj3g | 714
zuua | 715 Along these lines, ApoE has large effects on both amyloid deposition and Tau aggregation based on neuropathological data (124). Future work will determine whether and how neuroproteasomes
elwn | 716 can impinge on the amyloid pathway, if at all.
jnqv | 717
unp3 | 718 In the broadest sense, we find that neuroproteasome localization and function is a determinant
v8vk | 719 for the proteostatic capacity of neurons to defend against protein aggregation. A major
sr40 | 720 conclusion of our work is that neuroproteasome-specific inhibition induces the formation of
5zjj | 721 endogenous Tau inclusions, suggesting the neuroproteasome is a pivotal mechanism in
f56l | 722 determining Tau aggregate formation. This function is notably distinct from the canonical role of
ar2z | 723 proteasomes in protein clearance. Sarkosyl-insoluble Tau aggregates formed by neuroproteasome 724 inhibition in neurons are endogenous, without a need for pathogenic mutations. We suggest that 725 this may be important for Tau aggregation observed in a high percentage of sporadic AD patients
yad0 | 726 who do not have genetic lesions in the MAPT locus. It will likely be important to determine how
3g38 | 727 neuroproteasome inhibition-induced endogenous Tau aggregates compare to other types of misfolded Tau.
vtbo | 728
q8pa | 729
uc9x | 730 One of the key observations we make is that new protein synthesis is necessary for
zy7o | 731 neuroproteasome-inhibition induced Tau aggregation. Taken together with the dramatic increase
kcar | 732 in newly synthesized Tau protein following neuroproteasome inhibition, we propose two models 733 to explain our observations (Fig S7D): one, that neuroproteasomes degrade newly synthesized
00aw | 734 Tau, or two, that neuroproteasomes indirectly regulate the translation machinery itself. The latter
351p | 735 is unlikely because only ~500 proteins increase after neuroproteasome inhibition, which suggests
zzcb | 736 some degree of specificity of what is regulated by neuroproteasomes. Based on the small number
mxnx | 737 of neuroproteasome substrates (4) and even smaller number of proteins which we identify in this 738 study which become insoluble, we suggest that the model that neuroproteasomes degrade Tau to
11k8 | 739 be the most likely option. While further experiments are needed to determine which is accurate,
twwy | 740 our observation that newly synthesized and endogenous Tau forms aggregates following
fyp8 | 741 neuroproteasome inhibition is likely to be an important finding for the field. Indeed, if newly
z994 | 742 synthesized Tau is a neuroproteasome substrate, future analysis would determine if Tau
vvqn | 743 mutations or Tau seeding would perturb the balance of protein synthesis and degradation. This
p6xg | 744
bppc | would be an important cautionary consideration for using these common models to study
ilnw | 745 neuroproteasome-dependent Tau aggregation.
f3rc | 746
d7bx | 747 As a concluding note, our findings increase the urgency to understand fundamental aspects of
gx97 | 748 neuroproteasome biology. For example, revealing the genetic and cell biological elements which
ppkp | 749 control neuroproteasome localization and trafficking are likely to be critical to reveal how ApoE
8br6 | 750 exerts an effect on neuroproteasome localization. The majority of the other components
de3k | 751 identified are involved in synaptic vesicle recycling and membrane trafficking (NSF, COPI,
2kb3 | 752 Vps35 and Sorl1, AP2 and AP3). We believe this reflects the underlying cellular mechanisms for 753 regulating localization of these complexes to the plasma membrane, a subject for future study.
lqcx | 754 Understanding these, as well as related mechanisms like how newly synthesized proteins are
3h7w | 755
th5p | degraded by neuroproteasomes, are likely to open up therapeutic avenues that can impinge on
b7nk | 756 neuroproteasome biology to boost neuroproteasome dependent-proteostasis and delay or prevent protein aggregation.
