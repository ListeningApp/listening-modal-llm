You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

m3cp | THE MIDDLE-INCOME TRAP More Politics than Economics
mq4s | I. INTRODUCTION
95el | SI INCE the mid-2000s, economists in both academia and develop- ment multilaterals have drawn increasing attention to the middle- income (MI) trap, especially in Southeast Asia and Latin America.1 Their writings have been valuable in identifying and defining the trap, in exploring its proximate sources (especially productivity slowdowns), in recommending policy remedies (such as improvements in human capital), and in highlighting the importance of broad political coali- tions to implement such remedies. Why then-if experts and leaders are aware of the weaknesses of their economies, if they can identify the policies required to improve productivity, and if they recognize the need for broad support and engagement-has it been so difficult to move forward? In probing this question, we find that the existing analyses simply do not explain precisely why there is a trap. We propose that one answer to the puzzle is to get at how today's middle-income econo- mies are different from their predecessors. And yet, as Shekhar Aiyar and colleagues conclude in their survey of the debate, "there is virtu- ally no theory about why and how middle-income economies may be
a0a5 | different."2 In our view, the absence of such a theory reflects the neglect of the political economy bases of the middle-income trap. To address this considerable gap, we argue for a deeper appreciation of the chal- lenges inherent in upgrading3 policies, of the institutions required to address these challenges, and, most critically, of the political obstacles to developing such institutions.
gocl | Among those writing about the middle-income trap, most agree on defining it as an extensive period of middle-income limbo, especially in contrast to earlier developers. Jesus Felipe, Arnelyn Abdon, and Ustav Kumar label countries stuck in the MI trap as those remaining in the income range of $2,000-$7,500 for over twenty-eight years or within a range of $7,500-$11,500 for more than fourteen years, or in middle income for a total of forty-two years (the median number of years ear- lier developers spent in middle income).4 We use these basic criteria to identify countries in the MI trap. Others find growth slowdowns since 1960 to be more frequent in middle-income than in low- or high- income countries.5 Of 101 middle-income economies in 1960, only 13 had graduated to high income (HI) by 2008.6 Today's middle-income countries are caught in a developmental nutcracker, "unable to compete with low-income (LI), low-wage economies in manufactured exports and unable to compete with advanced economies in high-skill innova- tions."7 There is also agreement that the trap reflects a slowdown in productivity growth as economies exhaust the gains from moving into middle-income status.8
ob1z | The emphasis on the need for productivity growth translates into broad agreement among economists on many of the policies needed to get out of the MI trap. These include more and better education (espe- cially higher and technical), greater savings and better investment, bet- ter infrastructure, and more innovation and R and D.9 Views diverge on whether targeted industrial policies should be added to the mix,10 but
m4cb | this debate does not detract from the consensus on the list of policies above. Nor is there disagreement on the need for institutional strength- ening, especially better administrative capacity to deliver public services and economic regulation.
m61y | Most studies of the MI trap-often drawing on the experiences of latecomers such as Finland, Ireland, Singapore, and South Korea- recognize the need for some minimal political requisites for enacting necessary policies, although that is rarely their primary focus.11 These requisites include political will, long time horizons on the part of politi- cal leaders, broad societal consensus, business-government collabora- tion, and some degree of inclusive politics.12
u2ob | Beyond these areas of agreement, the scholarship on the MI trap suf- fers from serious gaps. One is the lack of systematic attention to the difficulties inherent in the prescribed policies. Measures designed to improve local technological capacities, such as vocational training, R and D, or standards and testing, are in crucial ways much more chal- lenging than many of the earlier investment-driven growth policies focused largely on the accumulation and mobilization of capital that helped countries move out of low-income to middle-income status.13 Subsequent upgrading of policies to get beyond MI and move closer to technological frontiers takes more time to implement, requires the participation of more actors (for example, teachers or trainers), and demands more technical and site-specific information. These features, in other words, necessitate more sophisticated institutional arrange- ments.14 In addition, as we discuss below, graduating to HI is more dif- ficult in the twenty-first century than it was in the past century.
2gnm | Most central to this article is the lack of scholarly attention to insti- tutional origins. Few ask what would motivate key actors to coordinate. Why would self-interested political and economic elites expend scarce resources to construct the complex institutions required to implement initiatives in areas such as technical education and R and D? Which groups are most likely to take the lead in demanding upgrading and related institutions? Who are the likely coalition partners? That is, are politics-reflected in relations among key societal actors-in MI coun- tries in fact less amenable to building the consensus economists advo- cate than were politics in other stages or trajectories of development?
emgw | Our answer to this last question is affirmative. The conditions that facilitated or accompanied the earlier ascension to MI status, such as
xaqt | foreign investment, low-skilled and low-paid work, inequality, and in- formality, over time generated cleavages that impeded subsequent up- grading policies and building the institutions necessary to implement them. What makes exiting the trap difficult is the institution-intensive nature of the required policy solutions combined with weak societal demand for such institutions.
5rcb | The main political obstacle to institution building is the fragmen- tation of social groups and the resulting absence of strong upgrading coalitions. Growth trajectories on the way to MI status fractured the groups, especially business and labor, which are the core potential con- stituencies for a coalition that could take the big leap. Broadly put, big business is split between foreign and domestic firms, labor is divided between formal and informal sectors, and societies overall are riven by high inequality. These cleavages splinter interests and make coalition building more difficult.
524j | These arguments reflect an expansion of our comparative lens be- yond the small number of developmental states that successfully made the leap from middle-income to high-income status-especially coun- tries like Finland, Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan-to those countries that have not made the leap. Much of the scholarship on the successes concentrated on the institutions of developmental states such as their professionalized, Weberian bureaucracies, "pilot" agencies, and close business-government collaboration. But this scholarship is limited by the range of institutions it addresses and, most critically, by a neglect of coalitional underpinnings.15 Focusing on the countries that have not made the leap alerts us to the underlying structural obstacles to form- ing the broad coalitions needed for institution building. As such, the implications of our arguments go beyond the study of the MI trap to ad- dress the shortcomings of what has become an apolitical institutionalist hegemony in development studies and practice.16
xd3m | The article proceeds as follows: Section II examines the significant institutional challenges facing MI countries through the examples of hu- man capital and investment in R and D. Section III turns to the sociopo- litical obstacles to addressing these and other institutional challenges by exploring social cleavages, especially those created by inequality, foreign direct investment (FDI), and informality. Section IV illustrates the frac- tious interests of groups in MI politics in the crucial case of education reform. Section V then broadens the comparative analysis and includes China as well. Section VI concludes with some practical and theoretical
