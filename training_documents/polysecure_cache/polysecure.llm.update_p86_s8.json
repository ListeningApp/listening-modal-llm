We can easily fall into default patterns and ruts in our relationships. Remembering the importance of stepping out of our day-to-day cycles, focusing on some novelty, play and adventure can revivify and strengthen our connections with partners.\ntm0v | Questions to Consider\nyusn | . What are the routines my partners and I already have that are meaningful to\n5cww | me and support me in feeling safe and secure together?\nvgpr | . What rituals have we participated in or what relationship rites of passage have we gone through that have brought us closer?\nxrda | . How do I like to be celebrated or to celebrate others?\nu0fl | . Are there any daily or regular routines that would support me in feeling more secure with my partners?\n1qe2 | . Are there any relationship rites of passage or rituals that could further deepen our bond?\nof19 | . What do you and your partners each need to reconnect with each other after being apart?\nl0xs | . Are there ways of checking in or saying goodbye before going on a date with another person that would create more safety and security? How do you want to connect or be approached afterwards?\nyrtf | Things to Try and to Experiment With\n9foe | . Create bedtime or waking rituals with your partners, whether or not you live together. Make sure to also support and allow space for your nesting partners to create their own bedtime and waking rituals with other partners.\nmind | . Celebrate birthdays, anniversaries and accomplishments with your partners. When it comes to birthdays, communicate ahead of time about what your hopes and desires are for your birthday and be careful about expecting your partner to be with you on their birthday just because that's what you would prefer. Give your partners the autonomy to spend their birthday however and with whomever they would like. It's not your day to claim.\nzn89 | . Grieve losses and transitions together.\nb264 | . Create holiday rituals that honor the relationship, whether or not they are on the actual day of the holiday.\njv66 | . Create standing dates and dedicate time to regular activities together. Be transparent with partners about any standing dates you already have with other partners or any standing dates that you are looking to create. Also, be\n5507 | transparent with your partners about specific activities or terms of endearment that are designated just for certain relationships. Some polyamorous people believe that you should never have certain things or places that only belong to one relationship, while other people have few qualms about this. I take the middle path on this issue because I don't know if it is completely realistic to abolish all expressions of \"what's ours\" from a relationship (some forms of couple identity can be very healthy in polyamory) and I've also seen the powerful healing effect that can happen when people are allowed to ask for something they want to stay within a certain relationship. As long as it's transparent and understood to everyone involved what things belong to a certain relationship and why, it can work well. It is additionally important that all relationships have the freedom to be able to organically create their own version of the things or activities that are theirs. It's key that requests are reasonable (e.g., we like to listen to this specific podcast together or please call only me \"sugar puff\" rather than limits such as you can't go to Mexico with anyone else or you can only do this sexual position with me). Allocating certain things to relationships can be workable, but definitely tread carefully and transparently, because these waters can become dangerous and hierarchical very quickly.\n74me | . Create pet names and special terms of endearment for each other. It's OK to ask that some names or terms of endearment are only shared with each other. But again, be reasonable and very conscious and inclusive of as many partners as possible when setting up such agreements.\nexc2 | . Have a commitment ceremony with your partner. Currently in the United States, people can only get legally married to one person at a time, but there is nothing that stops you from having commitment ceremonies with other partners. You can create your own ceremony that you conduct together, you can have friends, family members, mentors or other partners officiate a ceremony for you, or you can find an officiant friendly to nonmonogamy to help you co-create and perform a ceremony that is meaningful to you and your\n8y62 | partners.\n4fig | . Step out of your routines and rituals. Set aside a day that is unscheduled to spend together, whether at home or doing something out in the world that you normally don't do together.\nsksb | T: TURNING TOWARDS AFTER CONFLICT\nop72 | In any relationship, ruptures are inevitable. Relationships are not static but an ongoing flow of harmony to disharmony, rupture and repair, connection, disconnection and back into connection again. We are all different from each other and so we are all eventually going to slip up, make mistakes, say things that we wish we could take back or forget things that are important to our partners. Even if we wanted to be, we can't be perfectly present and attentive to our partners all the time, every time. What matters is not that we have ruptures, but how we repair them. When there is conflict and disagreement or when attunement and connection have been lost, it is how we repair and find our way back to our partners that builds secure attachment and relational resilience. Conflicts left unrepaired can leave lasting effects on our sense of trust, safety and security. In terms of attachment styles, people functioning from a secure style are more likely to use constructive and mutually beneficial problem-solving strategies than people who are more anxiously attached. They are also more likely to accommodate their partners than people who are avoidantly attached, demonstrating their joint concern for their own interests and their partner's interests as well as for enhancing the relationship.\nim7i | The Gottman Institute has conducted decades of research on couples and found that the main difference between happy couples and unhappy couples is not that happy couples don't have arguments or make mistakes, but that they are better and faster at doing the repair work when breaches have occurred. Couples that are described as the masters of relationships, versus what the Gottman Institute names the disasters of relationships, still experience episodes of yelling, being mean to each other, defensiveness, being critical or shutting down, but these couples are also willing to admit responsibility for their part in the conflict so they can\nrmuk | begin the process of healing their bond. The masters of relationships are able to learn from what went wrong and see that repairing the relationship is more important than the problem itself. The Gottman Institute also found that how skillful someone's repair attempt was did not necessarily predict how effective the repair was. Repairs didn't have to be perfectly executed as much as they had to be genuine. I often tell couples and multiple-partner relationships that you can have all the communication techniques and conflict resolution skills in the world, but they do nothing if you still have an attitude of wanting to either be right or prove your partner wrong. I still recommend acquiring more communication and conflict resolution skills, but even without these, the right attitude-one of repair responsibility, humility and openness-goes far.\nkadj | The Gottman Institute also found that resilience after conflict was related to how much a couple was making regular \"deposits into their emotional bank account.\" Repair attempts are much more successful when there is a pre-existing relationship culture of understanding each other, expressing gratitude and regularly doing nice things for each other, which supports the relationship in being better able to withstand the inevitable storms. Relationships that are regularly distant or disrespectful have much less success with their repair attempts, no matter how beautiful the attempt is. If you are already doing the HEAR of the HEARTS of secure functioning, you will find that conflict may still arise, but the repair work goes much more smoothly and even brings you closer together in the end.\n5kvy | Questions to Consider\n8wop | .
