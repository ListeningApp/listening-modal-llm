As potential targets for new gas-to-liquid methane bioconversion processes, methane monooxygenases have attracted intense attention in recent years. There are two distinct types of methane monooxygenase, a soluble, cytoplasmic methane monooxygenase and a membrane-bound, particulate methane monooxygenase. Both oxidize methane at metal centers within a complex, multisubunit scaffold, but the structures, active sites, and chemical mechanisms are completely different. This Current Topic review article focuses on the overall architectures, active site structures, substrate reactivities, protein-protein interactions, and chemical mechanisms of both methane monooxygenases, with an emphasis on fundamental aspects. In addition, recent advances, including new details of interactions between the soluble methane monooxygenase components, characterization of soluble methane monooxygenase intermediates, and progress toward understanding the particulate methane monooxygenase metal centers are highlighted. The work summarized here provides a guide for those interested in exploiting methane monooxygenases for biotechnological applications.\n3g2y | Aerobic methane oxidation in nature is carried out by methanotrophic bacteria, organisms that can use methane as their sole source of carbon and energy. Despite the extremely strong C-H bond in methane, these bacteria are capable of oxidizing methane to methanol under ambient conditions using metalloenzymes called methane monooxygenases. Understanding the biochemistry of methane monooxygenases is critical to their applications in bioremediation and to the development of biological processes for conversion of natural gas to liquid fuels and chemicals. Moreover, detailed characterization of methane monooxygenase active sites may lead to new biomimetic catalysts. A range of alkane-oxidizing enzymes exist in the environment, but only the two types of methane monooxygenase, soluble methane monooxygenase and particulate methane monooxygenase, as well as the close particulate methane monooxygenase homologue ammonia monooxygenase, can oxidize methane. Although soluble methane monooxygenase and particulate methane monooxygenase perform the same chemical reaction, their structures, cofactor requirements, and mechanisms are completely different.\ngc7v | Soluble methane monooxygenase requires three protein components for activity: a hydroxylase, a reductase, and a regulatory protein. The hydroxylase is responsible for methane oxidation and is composed of alpha, beta, and gamma subunits encoded by the mmoX, mmoY, and mmoZ genes, respectively. The regulatory protein and reductase are encoded by the mmoB and mmoC genes. The particulate methane monooxygenase hydroxylase consists of the pmoB, pmoA, and pmoC subunits, encoded by the pmoCAB operon. No regulatory protein has been identified for particulate methane monooxygenase, and the identity of its native reductase remains unclear. Most methanotrophs express only particulate methane monooxygenase. A few species express only soluble methane monooxygenase, and a subset contains genes for both particulate methane monooxygenase and soluble methane monooxygenase. In this subset, soluble methane monooxygenase expression occurs when copper levels in the growth medium are below one micromolar, and particulate methane monooxygenase expression is predominant at copper levels\nwqfv | Current Topic\nj30a | above five micromolar. This \"copper switch\" parallels the metal cofactor requirements of the methane monooxygenases: soluble methane monooxygenase has a catalytic diiron center, and particulate methane monooxygenase utilizes a copper active site. The mechanism of the copper switch is still unknown, but recent work suggests that the copper-chelating natural product methanobactin, genes encoded by the methanobactin operon, and mmoD, a gene product of unknown function encoded by the soluble methane monooxygenase operon, could play a role. A transcriptional activator, mmoR, and a GroEL-like chaperone protein, mmoG, are required for soluble methane monooxygenase expression.\n7bdk | Studies of both methane monooxygenases over the past quarter century have provided much insight into their structure and function. This Current Topic summarizes work addressing the architecture, active sites, substrate reactivities, protein-protein interactions, and chemical mechanisms of both systems, with emphasis on fundamental aspects that must be considered if methane monooxygenases are to be exploited in new gas-to-liquid methane bioconversion processes. In addition, recent advances that have not been reviewed previously are highlighted. A more comprehensive review is available elsewhere.\nfim0 | Enzyme Architecture\nojro | Soluble methane monooxygenase. To date there are twenty-eight crystal structures of the hydroxylase, primarily from Methylococcus capsulatus Bath, one structure of the hydroxylase-regulatory protein complex, two NMR structures of the regulatory protein, and two NMR structures of the reductase. The first crystal structure of the hydroxylase was determined in nineteen ninety-three, and a resolution of one point seven Ã… has been achieved. The alpha, beta, and gamma\nl6t9 | subunits are arranged as an alpha two beta two gamma two dimer composed mainly of alpha helices except for two beta hairpins in the beta and gamma subunits. The dimer interface involves interactions between the alpha and beta subunits, and a canyon region formed by\n41fx | the alpha and beta subunits in each alpha-beta-gamma protomer provides the docking surface for the reductase and regulatory protein. The regulatory protein, which has no cofactors, consists of seven beta strands arranged in two beta sheets and three alpha helices. The reductase consists of two mixed alpha-beta domains: an FAD- and NADH-binding domain provides electrons to a two iron two sulfur ferredoxin domain for transfer to the hydroxylase active site.\n```",
