You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

ilrs | Complex modules can be constructed from simpler modules by simply defining a new class whose slots will contain the member modules and the intermediate state variables between those modules. The fprop method for the class simply calls the fprop methods of the member modules, with the appropriate intermediate state variables or external input and outputs as arguments. Although the algorithms are easily generalizable to any network of such modules, including those whose influence graph has cycles, we will limit the discussion to the case of directed acyclic graphs (feed-forward networks).
0a03 | Computing derivatives in a multimodule system is just as simple. A "backward propagation" method, called bprop, for each module class can be defined for that purpose. The bprop method of a module takes the same arguments as the fprop method. All the derivatives in the system can be computed by calling the bprop method on all the modules in reverse order compared to the forward propagation phase. The state variables are assumed to contain slots for storing the gradients computed during the backward pass, in addition to storage for the states computed in the forward pass. The backward pass effectively computes the partial derivatives of the loss E with respect to all the state variables and all the parameters in the system. There is an interesting duality property between the forward and backward functions of certain modules. For example, a sum of several variables in the forward direction is trans- formed into a simple fan-out (replication) in the backward
auae | direction. Conversely, a fan-out in the forward direction is transformed into a sum in the backward direction. The software environment used to obtain the results described in this paper, called SN3.1, uses the above concepts. It is based on a home-grown object-oriented dialect of Lisp with a compiler to C.
5b6y | The fact that derivatives can be computed by propagation in the reverse graph is easy to understand intuitively. The best way to justify it theoretically is through the use of Lagrange functions [21], [22]. The same formalism can be used to extend the procedures to networks with recurrent connections.
1y10 | B. Special Modules
6mnx | NN's and many other standard pattern recognition tech- niques can be formulated in terms of multimodular systems trained with gradient-based learning. Commonly used mod- ules include matrix multiplications and sigmoidal modules, the combination of which can be used to build conven- tional NN's. Other modules include convolutional layers, subsampling layers, RBF layers, and "softmax" layers [65]. Loss functions are also represented as modules whose single output produces the value of the loss. Commonly used modules have simple bprop methods. In general, the bprop method of a function F is a multiplication by the Jacobian of F. Here are a few commonly used examples. The bprop method of a fanout (a "Y" connection) is a sum, and vice versa. The bprop method of a multipli- cation by a coefficient is a multiplication by the same coefficient. The bprop method of a multiplication by a matrix is a multiplication by the transpose of that matrix. The bprop method of an addition with a constant is the identity.
tynp | Interestingly, certain nondifferentiable modules can be inserted in a multimodule system without adverse effect. An interesting example of that is the multiplexer module. It has two (or more) regular inputs, one switching input, and one output. The module selects one of its inputs, depending upon the (discrete) value of the switching input, and copies it on its output. While this module is not differentiable with respect to the switching input, it is differentiable with respect to the regular inputs. Therefore the overall function of a system that includes such modules will be differentiable with respect to its parameters as long as the switching input does not depend upon the parameters. For example, the switching input can be an external input.
ob0u | Another interesting case is the min module. This module has two (or more) inputs and one output. The output of the module is the minimum of the inputs. The function of this module is differentiable everywhere, except on the switching surface which is a set of measure zero. Interestingly, this function is continuous and reasonably regular, and that is sufficient to ensure the convergence of a gradient-based learning algorithm.
50o1 | The object-oriented implementation of the multimodule idea can easily be extended to include a bbprop method that propagates Gauss-Newton approximations of the sec- ond derivatives. This leads to a direct generalization for
cw76 | modular systems of the second-derivative back propagation (22) given in Appendix C.
lkk5 | The multiplexer module is a special case of a much more general situation, described at length in Section IX, where the architecture of the system changes dynamically with the input data. Multiplexer modules can be used to dynamically rewire (or reconfigure) the architecture of the system for each new input pattern.
