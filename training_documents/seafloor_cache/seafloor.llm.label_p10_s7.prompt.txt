You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

colo | Oxygen and hydrogen isotope analyses were performed on 14 samples of monomineralic clays (<2 um), free from Fe and Mn oxides as determined by XRD. The analyses were car- ried out by the Queen's Facility for Isotope Research (Queen's University, Ontario, Canada). Oxygen was extracted from
d6r4 | 5-mg samples at 550° to 600℃ using the BrF5 technique of Clayton and Mayeda (1963). Samples were analyzed via dual inlet on a Thermo-Finnigan DeltaPlus XP isotope ratio mass spectrometer (IRMS). For hydrogen isotope measurements, samples were weighed into silver capsules, degassed for 1 h at 100℃, and then crushed and loaded into a zero blank autos- ampler. Hydrogen isotope compositions were measured using a Finnigan thermos-combustion elemental analyzer (EA) coupled to a Thermo-Finnigan DeltaPlus XP continuous-flow IRMS. All values are expressed in the conventional ò notation as per mil (%0) deviation from V-SMOW (Vienna-Standard Mean Ocean Water), with analytical precision and accuracy for 8180 values of ±0.1%% (lo) and for OD of ±3%% (lo) and ±1.5%% (lo), respectively.
9mrz | Sulfur isotope measurements were conducted on 57 hand- picked mineral separates, including anhydrite, gypsum, barite, chalcopyrite, and sphalerite, at the Westfälische Wil- helms-Universität Münster, Germany (described in detail by Wienkenjohann, 2015). For 35 pure monomineralic samples (as defined optically), the sulfur isotope composition was determined directly without prior chemical treatment, using a Carlo Erba EA interfaced to a ThermoFinnigan Delta Plus mass spectrometer (EA-IRMS). Repeat analyses showed a precision of better than ±0.3%% (lo), and standard measure- ments (IAEA-S1, S2, S3, NBS127, Ag2S-lab) gave an accu- racy of better than ±0.2%% (lo). For 22 samples of intergrown sulfide-sulfate mineral assemblages, a mineral-specific, wet- chemical pretreatment protocol was applied, yielding four different sulfur phases. Briefly, anhydrite and gypsum were dissolved using a 10% NaCl-solution for 24 h, and dissolved sulfate was precipitated as BaSO4 using standard procedures (e.g., Dogramaci et al., 2001). BaSO4 precipitates were then converted into silver sulfide using Thode solution (a mixture of HI, HCl, and H3PO2; Thode and Monster, 1961). Sphal- erite sulfur was liberated as hydrogen sulfide (acid volatile sulfide [AVS]) with HCl (25%) for 1 h at 85℃. Subsequently, disulfides such as chalcopyrite and pyrite were extracted using chromous-chloride solution (chromium-reducible sul- fide [CRS] fraction, cf. Canfield et al., 1986). Each time, resulting hydrogen sulfide was precipitated first as zinc sul- fide (using zinc acetate) and ultimately as silver sulfide (using silver nitrate) as described in Canfield et al. (1986) and Rice et al. (1993). Following the quantitative removal of all sulfide minerals using acidic (HCl) CrCl2 solution (cf. Canfield et al., 1986), acid-insoluble sulfate (barite) was liberated as hydrogen sulfide, following Thode and Monster (1961), and ultimately precipitated as silver sulfide. All silver sulfide precipitates, representing water-soluble sulfates (WSS) such as anhydrite and gypsum (Ag2Swss), acid-insoluble sulfates (AISs) such as barite (Ag2SAIS), AVSs (i.e., sphalerite), and CRSs (i.e., chal- copyrite and pyrite), were subjected to fluorination IRMS, following the procedure outlined by Ono et al. (2006), using a ThermoScientific Mat 253 mass spectrometer. Results are reported in the standard delta notation as per mil difference relative to Vienna-Canyon Diablo Troilite (V-CDT). Precision and accuracy were better than ±0.03%% (lo).
pk06 | The 226Ra/Ba dating of hydrothermal barite from 23 sulfide- sulfate samples was carried out following the methods of Jamieson et al. (2013), modified after Ditchburn et al. (2004). Samples were crushed and powdered, with one split used to

wcd0 | determine Ba concentrations by INAA (described above) and another split used to determine 226Ra activity via gamma spec- trometry at the Elemental Tracer Laboratory at the University of Ottawa. The daughter product of 226Ra is 222Rn, with a half- life of 3.8 d. A daughter isotope from the decay of 222Rn, 214Pb, was measured as a proxy to avoid peak overlap with 235U. Prior to measurements, the sample tubes were sealed for 21 d to prevent the escape of 222Rn gas and obtain secular equilib- rium between 226Ra and 214Pb. Measurements were made using an XLB-GWL-SV digital gamma spectrometer (DSPec, Ortec®) containing a high-purity germanium crystal, 54.7 x 66.2 mm, with an active well depth of 40 mm. Counting times ranged from 2 to 12 h, depending on the activity of 226Ra in each sample. Spectral signatures were calibrated using IAEA- 312 reference material and analyzed using a custom program developed and provided by Peter Appleby (University of Liv- erpool) to correct for background, detector efficiency, sample volumes, and matrix effects. Ages were determined relative to a zero-age end member selected from one of the actively venting chimneys and assumed to represent the initial 226Ra/ Ba ratio (1,022 ± 68 Bq/kg.wt %; sample GMA13-024). All ages are considered minimum values, as incorporation of young barite in the samples cannot be ruled out (e.g., Ditch- burn and de Ronde, 2017).
caos | Drill Sites
qrvy | Shallow seafloor drilling was focused along the main NS- trending fissure (sites A-E), targeting areas with accumula- tions of chimneys and mounds and spatially associated with buried circular structures that may be manifestations of the cinder cones, with an additional site to the west of this structure (site F) (Fig. 2). Three subseafloor rock types were encountered in most drill holes, in order of increasing depth: (1) unconsolidated volcaniclastic sediment (cover sequence), (2) mineralized intervals consisting of mixed chimney talus, and (3) intensely clay altered volcaniclastic material (footwall sequence). In addition, several drill holes intersected intervals of oxidized ferruginous mud associated with rounded to sub- rounded chimney fragments, interpreted to be paleoseafloor horizons.
pn9j | Site A
1pmc | Site A is a local topographic high at the northern end of the row of craters. It rises ~10 m above background sediments over an area of ~100 x 80 m (Figs. 2, 5A). Chimneys and mounds are distributed around what may be a buried crater, partially covered by volcaniclastic material. The volcaniclas- tic cover sequence (up to 13.8 m thick) is underlain by 0.7 to 2.6 m of chimney talus, followed by intensely clay altered monomictic lapillistone that is crudely bedded with both matrix-supported and clast-supported intervals, extending to the bottom of the drill holes. The northernmost drill hole, TKAD001, is located next to an active chimney complex and reaches a depth of 22.3 m below seafloor (b.s.f .; App. Fig. A2). The upper ~14 m consists of variably altered volcaniclastic cover material with three discrete oxidized intervals, followed by altered lapillistone. The upper part of the clay-altered lapil- listone sequence is unconsolidated to poorly consolidated, with increasing cementation by anhydrite downhole, and is cut by a few anhydrite veins (2-5 mm wide). Disseminated
5z6q | 867
yeoh | sulfides (pyrite, sphalerite, and minor chalcopyrite, galena, covellite, and bornite) occur with anhydrite that has been partly hydrated to gypsum, both in the cement and in the vein fill. To the south of this drill hole, TKAD015 and TKAD027 were drilled in close proximity (~3 m apart) to a maximum depth of 7.3 m b.s.f., next to a partially buried chimney com- plex. The volcaniclastic cover is <1 m thick and contains frag- ments of chimney material, likely sourced by mass wasting from nearby (unknown) chimneys (App. Figs. A3, A4). The mineralized interval is a ~1.5- to 2.6-m-thick layer of chim- ney talus. As in TKAD001, intensely clay altered and poorly sorted lapillistone occurs below the chimney talus in both drill holes. TKAD028, located ~20 m east of TKAD015/027, intersected 0.5 m of volcaniclastic cover material, followed at depth by a narrow (0.7 m) sulfide interval dominated by barite and sphalerite at the top and becoming pyrite rich downhole (App. Fig. A5). This mineralized interval appears to correlate between the drill holes. The clay-altered lapillistone at the bottom of the hole is similar but better sorted than that found in TKAD015/027. Approximately 30 m to the east, TKAD029 encountered only the variably altered volcaniclastic cover material to a depth of 7.8 m b.s.f. (App. Fig. A6). This drill hole is located at the edge of the low-relief cinder cone where the volcaniclastic cover is thickest.
b8hf | Site B is another crater-like feature (70 x 80 m) on a cone at the north end of the row of cinder cones (Figs. 2, 5B). Chimneys and mounds occur along the crater walls and on the outer flanks of the cone and are variably covered by vol- caniclastic material. Here, massive sulfide chimneys occur on top of chimney talus. At the western edge of the crater, TKAD016 intersected thin (0.2 m) volcaniclastic cover, fol- lowed by a layer of pyritic chimney talus ~0.4 m thick and then poorly sorted and crudely bedded monomict, matrix- supported, and intensely clay altered lapillistone (App. Fig. A7). The upper part of the lapillistone is cemented mainly by gypsum with a few large crystals up to 7 mm long; the lower part is mostly unconsolidated with patchy anhydrite cement that has been partially hydrated to gypsum, a few crosscutting veinlets of anhydrite, weak silicification, and disseminated sul- fide minerals (pyrite with minor sphalerite near the top and minor to trace chalcopyrite near the bottom). At the southern wall of the crater, TKAD026 intersected massive sphalerite- barite chimney material to a depth of 1.4 m b.s.f. (App. Fig. A8). The substrate of lapillistone contains minor patchy barite cement in the upper part and anhydrite cement in the lower part, with gray-white clay alteration that generally decreases downhole. At the center of the crater, the mineralized inter- val of chimney talus is thicker (up to ~3.9 m) in TKAD013, cemented by anhydrite-rich and clay-altered mud and fine- grained sulfide minerals (App. Fig. A9). This interval was not recovered in TKAD025 (located ~3.6 m away) owing to poor drilling conditions (App. Fig. A10). In the center of the cra- ter, intensely clay altered lapilli with minor disseminated sul- fides occur to ~4 m b.s.f., below which is a chaotic mixture of matrix-supported volcanic and chimney fragments. The volca- nic clasts are polymict (altered and unaltered), subangular to angular, and variably infilled by late-stage silica. Several short intervals within the lapilli units contain gypsum crystals up to
hntf | 868
99fo | 3 cm long. On the upper rim of the volcanic cone in the east, a thin (0.6 m) cover of unconsolidated volcaniclastic material is directly underlain by altered monomict lapillistone, with increasing sulfate cement and decreasing alteration intensity downhole to a depth of 7.4 m b.s.f. (see TKAD012, App. Fig. A11). At this site, there are fewer disseminated sulfides com- pared to the other drill holes and decreasing sphalerite abun- dance downhole.
y5r7 | Site C is a large volcanic cinder cone, rising to ~70 m above the seafloor and with a diameter of ~120 x 90 m (Figs. 2, 5C, D). Chimney complexes and mounds occur on the flank of this cone in the vicinity of a circular slump feature. TKAD032 intercepted unconsolidated volcaniclastic cover material to 1.8 m, followed by intensely altered volcaniclastic breccia to 6.9 m b.s.f. (App. Fig. A12). The altered sequence consists of monomict lapillistone with subrounded to subangular vesic- ular clasts but variable clay alteration. The uppermost lapil- listone is matrix supported with variable sulfate cement and veins and disseminated pyrite, sphalerite, and chalcopyrite (decreasing downhole). Several horizons are clast supported (up to 60% clasts), with angular monomict clasts, and appear to be autobreccias. One gypsum-rich interval occurs at 6.4 to 6.6 m b.s.f. TKAD033 was drilled at the edge of a small crater or collapse feature near the summit of the cone. The recov- ered rock types are similar to those in TKAD032, with a tran- sition between the volcaniclastic cover and the clay-altered footwall occurring at 1.1 m b.s.f. (App. Fig. A13). Variable alteration intensity gives this rock a polymict appearance.
