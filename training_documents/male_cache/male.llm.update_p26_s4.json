        "content": "4uhb | b) Spermiation: The last stage of sperm maturation and release is called spermiation and is the process of non-motile spermatozoa leaving the Sertoli cell and being deposited into the lumen of the seminiferous tubules. It has been suggested that phagocytosis of residual bodies, representing the remnants of spermatid cytoplasm, by Sertoli cells may trigger the spermatogonia to initiate a new cycle of spermatogenesis.\nepyi | c) The Cycle of Spermatogenesis: In man, the entire sequence of spermatogenesis from spermatogonia to spermatozoa takes about sixty-four days. The individual resting spermatogonia do not wait until one wave of spermatogenesis is complete before initiating a new sequence, nor do they initiate the process of spermatogenesis at random. The starting of a new generation of germ cells is connected in a definite manner with the development of the preceding generation.\ny51p | These groupings of cells are known as stages in the cycle of the seminiferous epithelium. There are six stages in humans-stages one through six constitute one cycle. Groups of adjacent resting spermatogonia initiate a new cycle about every sixteen plus one days. When the primary spermatocytes of one cycle enter prophase, a second cycle is activated. A third cycle begins at about the time the spermatids from the first cycle appear. By the time these spermatids mature into spermatozoa, a fourth cycle begins. Around the circumference of any single seminiferous tubule, and throughout the testis, several of these cycles may be in the process simultaneously.\nx95m | Approximately four cycles of the epithelium are required for a type Ap spermatogonia to mature to the spermatozoon. Thus, one cycle of seminiferous epithelium lasts sixteen days, and the entire process of spermatogenesis is estimated at sixty-four days.\nyfum | Nine) MATURE SPERM ANATOMY AND MOTILITY\nppx4 | Spermatozoa have a very precise and limited function-to carry genetic material from the male to the oocyte. In order to do this, sperm must pass through the vagina, cervix, uterus, and oviduct, and then penetrate the oocyte and its surrounding vestments. Mammalian sperm are therefore highly specialized cells lacking ribosomes, nucleoli, rough endoplasmic reticulum, and Golgi apparatus; they do not synthesize R N A or protein, and do not secrete. The cellular organelles that are retained in spermatozoa are modified and arranged to allow for its primary function-forward progression (motility) to bring the packet of D N A to the oocyte.\nqf11 | Ten) Sperm Anatomy and Motility\n8oqt | a) Head - The genetic material transported by the spermatozoa is located in the nucleus of the head region. The nuclear chromatin is densely packed and homogeneous. Sperm nuclei contain either the X or Y chromosome. It is therefore the male gamete that determines the sex of the offspring. The head region also contains the acrosome, which covers a large portion of the nucleus like a cap. The acrosome contains hydrolytic enzymes that, upon release (the acrosome reaction), function in the penetration of the cumulus and zona pellucida surrounding the egg and facilitate fertilization. The absence of the acrosome is termed \"round-headed sperm\" or globozoospermia.\n6zah | b) Neck - also called the connecting piece. At the base of the nucleus is the proximal centriole, followed by an atypical distal centriole and the axoneme, which are all located in the connecting piece.\n4v5o | c) Midpiece - contains the mitochondria, which is the main machinery for trapping, conserving, and supplying the energy needed for motility. Also, the beginning of the axoneme, which makes up the flagellum.\nha9e | d) Principal Piece and End Piece - The flagellum of the tail of the spermatozoon. It is surrounded by a dense fibrous sheath.\nxrnt | Eleven) Sperm Motility Characteristics",
