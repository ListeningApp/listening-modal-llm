You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

mbsp | Such a large architecture can be trained very efficiently, but doing so requires the use of a few techniques that are described in the appendixes. Appendix A describes details such as the particular sigmoid used and the weight ini- tialization. Appendixes B and C describe the minimization procedure used, which is a stochastic version of a diagonal approximation to the Levenberg-Marquardt procedure.
zynb | III. RESULTS AND COMPARISON WITH OTHER METHODS
8h0u | While recognizing individual digits is only one of many problems involved in designing a practical recognition system, it is an excellent benchmark for comparing shape recognition methods. Though many existing methods com- bine a hand-crafted feature extractor and a trainable clas- sifier, this study concentrates on adaptive methods that operate directly on size-normalized images.
b09f | A. Database: The Modified NIST Set
zutp | The database used to train and test the systems described in this paper was constructed from the NIST's Special Database 3 and Special Database 1 containing binary im- ages of handwritten digits. NIST originally designated SD-3 as their training set and SD-1 as their test set. However, SD-3 is much cleaner and easier to recognize than SD-1. The reason for this can be found on the fact that SD- 3 was collected among Census Bureau employees, while SD-1 was collected among high-school students. Drawing sensible conclusions from learning experiments requires that the result be independent of the choice of training set and test among the complete set of samples. Therefore it was necessary to build a new database by mixing NIST's datasets.
qgmy | SD-1 contains 58 527 digit images written by 500 dif- ferent writers. In contrast to SD-3, where blocks of data from each writer appeared in sequence, the data in SD-1 is scrambled. Writer identities for SD-1 are available and we used this information to unscramble the writers. We then split SD-1 in two: characters written by the first 250 writers went into our new training set. The remaining 250 writers were placed in our test set. Thus we had two sets with nearly 30 000 examples each. The new training set was completed with enough examples from SD-3, starting at pattern #0, to make a full set of 60 000 training patterns. Similarly, the new test set was completed with SD-3 examples starting at pattern #35 000 to make a full set with 60 000 test patterns. In the experiments described here, we only used a subset of 10 000 test images (5,000 from SD-1 and 5,000 from SD-3), but we used the full 60 000 training samples. The resulting database was called the modified NIST, or MNIST, dataset.
40wi | The original black and white (bilevel) images were size normalized to fit in a 20×20 pixel box while preserving their aspect ratio. The resulting images contain grey levels as result of the antialiasing (image interpolation) technique used by the normalization algorithm. Three versions of the database were used. In the first version, the images were centered in a 28×28 image by computing the center of mass of the pixels and translating the image so as to position this point at the center of the 28x28 field. In some instances, this 28x28 field was extended to 32x32 with background pixels. This version of the database will be referred to as the regular database. In the second version of the database, the character images were deslanted and cropped down to 20×20 pixels images. The deslanting computes the second moments of inertia of the pixels (counting a foreground pixel as one and a background pixel as zero) and shears the image by horizontally shifting the lines so that the principal axis is vertical. This version of the database will be referred to as the deslanted database. In the third version of the database, used in some early experiments, the images were reduced to 16×16 pixels.1 Fig. 4 shows examples randomly picked from the test set.
a418 | B. Results
e9lu | Several versions of LeNet-5 were trained on the regu- lar MNIST database. Twenty iterations through the entire training data were performed for each session. The values of the global learning rate n [see (21) in Appendix C for a definition] was decreased using the following schedule: 0.0005 for the first two passes; 0.0002 for the next three; 0.0001 for the next three; 0.000 05 for the next 4; and 0.000 01 thereafter. Before each iteration, the diagonal
a278 | Hessian approximation was reevaluated on 500 samples, as described in Appendix C, and was kept fixed during the entire iteration. The parameter į was set to 0.02. The resulting effective learning rates during the first pass varied between approximately 7x10-5 and 0.016 over the set of parameters. The test error rate stabilizes after around ten passes through the training set at 0.95%. The error rate on the training set reaches 0.35% after 19 passes. Many authors have reported observing the common phenomenon of overtraining when training NN's or other adaptive algorithms on various tasks. When overtraining occurs, the training error keeps decreasing over time but the test error goes through a minimum and starts increasing after a certain number of iterations. While this phenomenon is very common, it was not observed in our case as the learning curves in Fig. 5 show. A possible reason is that the learning rate was kept relatively large. The effect of this is that the weights never settle down in the local minimum but keep oscillating randomly. Because of those fluctuations, the average cost will be lower in a broader minimum. Therefore, stochastic gradient will have a similar effect as a regularization term that favors broader minima. Broader minima correspond to solutions with large entropy of the parameter distribution, which is beneficial to the generalization error.
ffto | The influence of the training set size was measured by training the network with 15 000, 30 000, and 60 000 examples. The resulting training error and test error are shown in Fig. 6. It is clear that, even with specialized architectures such as LeNet-5, more training data would improve the accuracy.
ak21 | To verify this hypothesis, we artificially generated more training examples by randomly distorting the original train- ing images. The increased training set was composed of the 60 000 original patterns plus 540 000 instances of dis- torted patterns with randomly picked distortion parameters.
i7n1 | The distortions were combinations of the following planar affine transformations: horizontal and vertical translations; scaling; squeezing (simultaneous horizontal compression and vertical elongation, or the reverse); and horizontal shearing. Fig. 7 shows examples of distorted patterns used for training. When distorted data were used for training, the test error rate dropped to 0.8% (from 0.95% without deformation). The same training parameters were used as without deformations. The total length of the training session was left unchanged (20 passes of 60 000 patterns each). It is interesting to note that the network effectively sees each individual sample only twice over the course of these 20 passes.
