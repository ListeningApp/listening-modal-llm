You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

s2g2 | Physical Factors
q1q2 | Any animal that is to be an effective pollinator must have the ability to passively pick up pollen as its body moves past the anthers of a flower that it visits and carry that pollen to another flower. Normally this will be aided by the animal being a good physical fit in terms of size and shape, so that in alighting on the flower surface, or when inserting its tongue or beak of appropriate length, some specific part of its body touches the anther. Additionally pollen pickup and car- riage will be aided if the animal has appropriate sur- face structures; pollen adheres well to feathers, fur, and hairy or scaly surfaces in insects but does not get transported well on shiny or waxy surfaces (and may even be damaged by certain surface secretions). Hence a small shiny beetle taking some nectar by crawling into the lower surface of a large tubular corolla where the anthers are in the corolla roof may well be a regu- lar visitor to that flower but is unlikely to be an effec- tive mover of its pollen; in effect, it is acting as a "cheat" as far as the flower is concerned and may be termed an illegitimate visitor.
cb7r | Behavioral Factors
68xu | Different animals land on and forage at flowers in very different fashions. There are many aspects of behavior that will affect whether a given animal is going to be a good pollinator. Pollinators will seldom have a com- plete perception of all the aspects of plant presentation mentioned above, but they will respond to at least some of them in ways that are useful to the plant:
hd35 | 1. Their choices of places and times to visit, and ex- actly which flowers to visit, will be critical. Visits occurring before dehiscence (the splitting of the anthers to reveal the pollen) or after pollen deple- tion are normally of no value to the flower in ful- filling its male role, and visits before or after the stigma is receptive to incoming pollen are of no value to the flower in its female role.
2zpk | 2. Their handling of the flowers affect their pollen pickup and deposition characteristics; ideally they should receive pollen at a specific site on their bodies, and one that is also a good site for subse- quent deposition of that pollen onto a stigma.
epu7 | 3. Their handling time per flower affects how many flowers are visited in a given time.
7od1 | 4. Their speed and directionality of movement be- tween plants affect pollen dispersal.
0bqy | 5. They should not be too efficient at grooming off the pollen, or indeed at eating it.
b780 | 6. Their flower constancy, that is, the likelihood that they will move to another flower of the same spe- cies, is perhaps most critical. If they innately or by learning prefer a particular flower phenotype, their high constancy will usually ensure that they move neatly and sequentially among conspecific flowers, not wasting pollen by depositing it in the wrong species. Constancy to a flower (considered in detail in chapter 11) gives economies to the vis- itor also; it may minimize travel distances, han- dling times, and learning effort and maximize pol- len packing.
ccmb | Behavioral factors such as these are often the key to being a good pollinator and of course are affected by the animals' abilities to learn as they become more ex- perienced as foragers. The ability to form a search im- age or to respond consistently to other cues, associat- ing particular signals with the presence of food, hones their foraging ability and can cement their relation- ships with particular flowers. Hence later chapters of this book, in considering particular groups of animals that visit flowers, include careful consideration of their sensory and learning capacities.
ma93 | Physiological Factors
c6hh | Animals have differing physiological strategies and constraints, and these too can affect their energetic needs and thence their flower-visiting patterns, as will be discussed in chapter 10. Most animals (including nearly all invertebrates, and therefore many of the in- sect flower visitors) lack elaborate internal physiologi- cal regulatory systems, and their thermal balance and water balance are strongly influenced by environmen- tal conditions. They cannot function if they are too hot or too cold or are short of water, and must forage in times and places that provide suitable microclimates, using the sun's radiation to warm up by basking, or shady places to cool down again, and seeking (usually) sites that are relatively humid. However, birds and bats are physiologically more sophisticated and can regu-
y7ea | late their body temperature and water balance more precisely; they generate heat internally through their own metabolism (endothermy) and regulate their own body fluids with efficient skin exchanges, respiratory controls, and excretory organs. They can in principle forage at almost any time and in any habitat, though they may still conserve their own energy by picking more equable sites.
nav4 | The distinction does not lie exactly between the vulnerable invertebrates and the highly regulated birds and mammals, however. It is now clear that a rather small proportion of insects can also show endothermy, at least some of the time when they need to warm up in the absence of solar inputs (chapter 10); this applies especially to most bees, a few hoverflies, some large moths, and some beetles, occurring more sporadically in other groups. It is perhaps no coincidence that endo- thermic abilities in insects are most common in the flower-visiting groups, which have access to ready fuel supplies in the form of nectar but which may also need to compete for that nectar in the cool of early mornings or at dusk.
gem8 | Given the list of factors that can turn a visitor into a good pollinator, two obvious points should emerge:
e8nr | 1. A great many of the animals that go to flowers for a short drink of nectar may be rather poor at pollinat- ing that flower. Those with a poor physical fit, those that cheat, and those with little or no flower constancy are likely to be especially ineffective.
k78w | 2. Of all the visitors, bees are likely to be especially good as pollinators. They rely solely on flowers for food, both as adults and as larvae, and so must visit more flowers than any other animals. Their sizes, hairy surfaces, and variably long tongues, their excellent learning abilities, communication systems and floral constancy, and their endothermic capacities all equip them to visit flowers efficiently (from their own per- spective) and effectively (from the plant's point of view). Although they are sometimes described as pol- len wasters (because they, or rather their offspring back at the nest, eat so much of the pollen that they pick up), they are by far the most important pollinators in most ecosystems, and they do achieve high pollen export from visited flowers (Harder and Wilson 1997); plants have adapted over evolutionary time to make
g9du | best use of them by providing more than enough pol- len to cater for their needs and ensure that sufficient pollen still commonly reaches other flowers.
f682 | 5. Costs, Benefits, and Conflicts in Animal Pollination
li1k | Plants with hermaphrodite flowers benefit greatly be- cause a single animal visit can allow both pickup of pollen and its deposition on a stigma, fulfilling both the male and female functions of that flower at the same time. Animals benefit greatly by finding easily acquired foods, both sugary (nectar) and often also proteinaceous (pollen). Pollination by animals may therefore be a mutualism, of benefit to both partici- pants, but it is not altruistic; for the animals, pollina- tion of the flowers they forage at is almost always just an irrelevant by-product. In fact the plant and animal have a conflict of interest, often with adaptation and counteradaptation going on from both sides through evolutionary time to try and get a bigger share of the benefits. So the situations that we see now are the end products of the long and sometimes quite duplicitous associations of flowers with animals.
