You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

936l | ABSTRACT
06yq | Objectives The WHO currently recommends stool testing using GeneXpert MTB/Rif (Xpert) for the diagnosis of paediatric tuberculosis (TB). The simple one-step (SOS) stool method enables processing for Xpert testing at the primary healthcare (PHC) level. We modelled the impact and cost-effectiveness of implementing the SOS stool method at PHC for the diagnosis of paediatric TB in Ethiopia and Indonesia, compared with the standard of care.
dpv6 | Setting All children (age <15 years) presenting with presumptive TB at primary healthcare or hospital level in Ethiopia and Indonesia.
8r5j | Primary outcome Cost-effectiveness estimated as incremental costs compared with incremental disability- adjusted life-years (DALYs) saved.
2taz | Methods Decision tree modelling was used to represent pathways of patient care and referral. We based model parameters on ongoing studies and surveillance, systematic literature review, and expert opinion. We estimated costs using data available publicly and obtained through in-country expert consultations. Health outcomes were based on modelled mortality and discounted life- years lost.
o3ya | Results The intervention increased the sensitivity of TB diagnosis by 19-25% in both countries leading to a 14- 20% relative reduction in mortality. Under the intervention, fewer children seeking care at PHC were referred (or self-referred) to higher levels of care; the number of children initiating anti-TB treatment (ATT) increased by 18-25%; and more children (85%) initiated ATT at PHC level. Costs increased under the intervention compared with a base case using smear microscopy in the standard of care resulting in incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of US$132 and US$94 per DALY averted in Ethiopia and Indonesia, respectively. At a cost-effectiveness threshold of 0.5xgross domestic product per capita, the projected probability of the intervention being cost-effective in Ethiopia and Indonesia was 87% and 96%, respectively. The intervention remained cost-effective under sensitivity analyses.
r5il | Conclusions The addition of the SOS stool method to national algorithms for diagnosing TB in children is likely to be cost-effective in both Ethiopia and Indonesia.

ls7d | STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF THIS STUDY
tzt3 | => The first study to evaluate the impact and cost- effectiveness of including the simple one-step method to the existing national algorithms for diag- nosing tuberculosis (TB) in children.
t8vv | => The evaluation used a systematic literature review to inform model parameters.

5746 | BACKGROUND
7toz | It was estimated that in 2018, around 1.1 million children below 15 years of age fell ill from tuberculosis (TB). In the same year, 250 000 children died of TB, mostly because TB was not diagnosed or was diagnosed too late. It is estimated that 55% of TB cases are missed, particularly in the youngest age group.2 TB in children presents with nonspe- cific signs and symptoms, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacilli are usually not detected.2 Partly, this is because the main specimen used for diagnosing pulmonary TB is sputum, which is challenging to obtain, especially from young children. Therefore, (semi-)invasive methods such as nasogastric aspiration and sputum induction are often required. These methods are painful and stressful for chil- dren and caregivers and sometimes require hospitalisation. Moreover, not all primary healthcare (PHC) facilities in TB endemic areas, where parents with children usually first seek care, have facilities and qualified saff to perform these procedures. Alternative, non-invasive specimens, such as stool, can

cwrw | Since January 2020, WHO recommends Xpert testing of stool specimens as a primary diagnostic test for TB in children with signs and symptoms of pulmonary TB.5 This recommendation has the potential to improve bacterio- logical confirmation of TB in children, and is increasingly being adopted by national TB programmes, for example, Ethiopia.6 However, to make the test fit for use at the PHC level, a simple, non-hazardous and cheap method to process stool for Xpert testing was needed. Several centrifuge-free methods have been proposed,7-10 but all need additional equipment and/or consumables which may not be (easily) available in peripheral lower-level public health facilities. Therefore, we developed a simple one-step (SOS) stool processing method for Xpert testing. This method can be applied in any laboratory with an Xpert machine, as it does not require additional equip- ment or consumables than those delivered routinely with the Xpert cartridges." Limited preliminary data suggest that Xpert Ultra on stool samples processed using the SOS stool method has higher sensitivity compared with other stool processing methods. Available systematic reviews on the diagnostic accuracy of stool testing have reported sensitivity of 50-67%.3412 The variation in sensitivity esti- mates may be explained by a variation in studies included, and thus, variation in study populations, stool processing methods and reference standards (sputum culture412 or a combination of sputum culture and sputum Xpert3) included in each review. This method has the potential to significantly impact the number of children receiving a bacteriological confirmation of TB, including rifampicin resistance profile. Consequently, more paediatric TB patients can be diagnosed at lower levels of the health- care system, with a reduced time to diagnosis because no referrals to higher levels of healthcare are needed as well as reduced costs for both the healthcare system and families.
4i0e | However, evidence on the impact and cost-effectiveness of the SOS Xpert stool processing method is needed to inform implementation and scale-up in routine health- care systems. Therefore, we modelled the potential impact and cost-effectiveness of bringing this test to the lower healthcare level where children present first, focusing on Ethiopia and Indonesia. Specifically, we aimed to estimate the impact of implementing the Xpert stool test for the diagnosis of pulmonary TB among chil- dren at the PHC level on rates of bacteriological confir- mation of TB and mortality among children, the costs to the healthcare provider, and the incremental cost- effectiveness of the approach. Ethiopia and Indonesia are currently among the 30 high TB burden countries in the world.13 The incidence of TB was estimated to be 301 (276-328) per 100 000 population with 824 000 (755 000-897 000) people falling ill with TB in 2020 in Indo- nesia. In Ethiopia, the incidence of TB was estimated to be 132 (92-178) per 100 000 population with 151 000 (106 000-205 000) people falling ill with TB in 2020. While TB

awvu | METHODS Conceptual approach
on9b | We developed a conceptual model of care pathways for children (age <15 years) with presumptive TB presenting at either PHC facilities or hospitals, referral (including self-referral) between these levels, and clinical and bacte- riological assessment and reassessment (see figure 1). This description of stages in patient care was based on national TB guidelines and local knowledge, and were broad enough to capture pathways in both Ethiopia and Indonesia, and incorporate the standard of care (SOC) as well as the intervention.
a8ge | We defined patients with presumptive TB, following clinical guidelines in both settings, as children with signs or symptoms suggestive of pulmonary TB (at least one) such as persistent cough, unexplained fever and/or night sweats, poor weight gain or weight loss, reduced playful- ness or malaise, history of contact with a TB patient, or enlarged lymph nodes in the neck (Ethiopia only).
h27a | Under the SOC, national guidelines in both countries recommend the use of GeneXpert for the diagnosis of paediatric TB.614 However, in both countries, sputum smear microscopy (SSM) is allowed for diagnosis if the PHC has no access to GeneXpert. Despite this recom- mendation, in both countries, most PHC units do not have access to a GeneXpert machine, and therefore use SSM for the diagnosis of paediatric TB. For the diagnosis of paediatric TB, in the primary (base-case) analyses, we assumed that SSM was the bacteriological test used at PHC in SOC in both Ethiopia and Indonesia. In the sensitivity analyses, we considered alternate scenarios with Xpert used for bacteriological testing for sputum in SOC.
pdjh | The intervention was modelled as implementing the simple stool Xpert testing method at PHC and hospital level. Thus, considering spontaneous sputum expecto- ration to be limiting in obtaining a test result under SOC, we conceptualised the intervention as increasing the frac- tion of children with a bacteriological test result at both the primary and higher healthcare level.
xmgs | We assumed that children with a negative bacteriolog- ical test under the intervention would receive clinical assessments for TB while only a small proportion would get clinical assessments under SOC. A clinical diagnosis can be made based on TB-suggestive signs or symptoms, chest X-ray results and tuberculin skin test (Indonesia only) or contact history with a TB patient. Indonesian referral centres that do not have access to chest X-rays and/ or TB skin tests use a score chart for clinical diagnosis.
bd9h | Systematic review data on the sensitivity of stool-based diagnostics for identifying TB in children, indicate sensi- tivity of 50-67%3 4 12 in children with bacteriologically confirmed TB, but very poor sensitivity (2-6%) in clini- cally diagnosed TB.34 We, therefore, assumed that stool

The decision tree shows children with presumptive TB presenting at either PHC facilities or hospitals where they undergo clinical evaluation with or without bacteriological testing. All children diagnosed with TB are considered for anti-TB treatment. Children with a negative bacteriological test or those not initially diagnosed with TB after clinical assessment only can be reassessed clinically. Coloured boxes depict the potential of referral to a higher-level facility and referrals (indicated by grey lines) from PHC to hospital for further assessment can occur for children without a diagnosis of TB.

The accuracy of Xpert testing on stool using the SOS method was modelled based on a system- atic review4 which reported pooled sensitivity and speci- ficity of stool Xpert of 57.1% (95% CI 51.5-62.7%) and 98.1% (95% CI 97.5-98.6%), respectively, compared with culture on a respiratory sample as the reference standard. The intervention was to reduce mortality through higher sensitivity for detecting TB, and to reduce referrals and reassessments.
vpgq | Modelling approach
ousl | The pathway of care shown in figure 1 was coded into a decision tree using the HEdtree package in R. 15 16 15 16 Referral endpoints from PHC level were modelled by adding an identical hospital care pathway to follow the three paths for referral from PHC level. All care outcomes were extended to either death or survival. The probability of children following different pathways through the tree was assumed to depend on: true TB status and age (0-4 years or 5-14 years). Mortality risk from TB by age group and anti-TB treatment (ATT) status was modelled using a published approach, using case-fatality ratios based on systematic review data.18 We neglected mortality in chil- dren who were truly negative for TB. We did not model drug-resistant TB or HIV status.

km8w | Literature review and parameterisation
wzno | To inform the parameters needed in the decision tree model (figure 1, parameters noted as such in table 1), we followed a three-step data collection process. First, we reviewed data from ongoing studies in Ethiopia11 and Indonesia (Kaswandani et al Xpert MTB/RIF testing on stools using simple preprocessing methods to diagnose childhood pulmonary tuberculosis in Indonesia. 2019). Second, we systematically searched peer-reviewed litera- ture for parameters not available from country study data. In brief, initially, systematic reviews on TB in children were sought by a search of PubMed including the terms 'systematic review', 'meta-analysis', 'tuberculosis' and 'children' on 19 June 2020. Subsequently, we constructed pooled estimates from primary literature, published from 2010 to present, about TB diagnostic testing in infants and children, including healthcare seeking and health- care cascade with a focus on Ethiopia and Indonesia. For this, a systematic search strategy was developed by an information specialist combining free-text and thesaurus searching. Except for searches specifically addressing
