It is also valuable to study whether the control proteins, RNA, or empty vectors are toxic to the dopamine neurons. As mentioned, substantia nigra dopamine neurons are particularly vulnerable to stress and therefore can be easily damaged. Although AAV vectors produce a minimal immune response in the brain, the extent of the cellular antiviral defence response in substantia nigra dopamine neurons after AAV vector injections is not known and not well studied. Innate immune responses triggered by pattern recognition receptors in relation to AAV capsids or by DNA are not known; for example, there have been no studies conducted on the relationship of Toll-like receptors and AAV vectors. However, an important study was performed in which the authors observed that AAV9 mediated the overexpression of GFP, a protein from jellyfish, which resulted in an astrocyte-mediated immune response when injected to the nonhuman primate brain, as opposed to AAV carrying a non-foreign protein, which did not end in a toxic response. Additionally, while increasing the titer of an AAV will naturally increase the amount of positive cells and protein expressed, it can also lead to neurodegeneration. In a study in which AAV8 carrying GFP was injected into the substantia nigra of rats, the high dose used caused a forty-one percent loss of dopamine neurons compared to the non-injected side, however the lower dose showed no neurotoxicity. When a chimeric AAV1/2-GFP was used at the same titer as AAV1/2 carrying A53T alpha-syn, it also caused neuron death in the substantia nigra of rats, but when the titer was lowered to one to three or one to ten, no toxicity was observed with GFP. A recent study compared the titers of AAV-x-syn and AAV-GFP and demonstrated that, at a titer of two times ten to the fourteenth gc per mL and higher, GFP resulted in approximately a sixty-two percent loss of TH positive cells in the substantia nigra. These studies clearly demonstrate that overexpression-induced dopamine neurodegeneration is not specific to alpha-syn and careful testing and caution need to be taken with regard to how much virus is used in the control condition, particularly with neurodegeneration studies. And indeed, it has been previously reported that AAV5-eGFP can cause a significant lesion to the dopamine system as the corresponding AAV5-x-syn vector. In addition, immune responses to non-self proteins need to be taken into consideration. We have found that not only the overexpression of GFP via AAV but also the overexpression of RNA that did not translate to any protein, led to degeneration of dopamine neurons in Parkinson's disease models. Neuronal loss after AAV-mediated transduction is most likely caused by the increased sensitivity of dopamine substantia nigra neurons to stress, due to their properties, and the results clearly suggest that it is not only protein overexpression that can be detrimental but also RNA overexpression. Indeed, excessive RNA and or protein synthesis after AAV-mediated transduction of nigral dopamine neurons can impair proteosome and autophagy pathways, promote formation of stress granules, activate endoplasmic reticulum, and unfolded protein response pathways, collectively leading to synaptic dysfunctions and impaired neuronal activity. The results described above suggest that such overloading of substantia nigra dopamine neurons with either RNA or protein can be caused by the overexpression of WT, mutant alpha-syn, GFP, untranslated RNA, or perhaps by any non-specific sequence. Therefore, intranigral injections of AAV vectors for dopamine neuron transduction may not be the best method in neurodegeneration studies.\n```",
