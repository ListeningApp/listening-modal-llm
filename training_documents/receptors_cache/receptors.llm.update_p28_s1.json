        "content": "jai3 | CXCR four, best-studied for its role in metastasis and modulation of the tumor microenvironment, has also been found to regulate cell survival in ovarian cancer. Blockade of CXCR four with a small peptide antagonist was not only found to inhibit metastasis but induced ovarian cancer cell death by weakening DNA damage checkpoints and leading to mitotic catastrophe. The CXCR four CXCL twelve signaling axis has also been shown to protect hematopoietic stem cells from oxidative stress injury by reducing mitochondrial reactive oxidative species and subsequent genotoxic stress.\np57i | Chronic stress is another mechanism that has been linked to development of numerous pathological conditions including cardiovascular disease, inflammation, immunosuppression, and tumorigenesis, due in part to the persistent release of stress hormones and catecholamines. Intriguingly, the chronic activation of Gas-coupled beta two-adrenoreceptors by beta-adrenergic catecholamines has been found to trigger DNA damage, which may underlie some of these effects. Specifically, recruitment and activation of beta-arrestin-one by activated beta two-adrenoreceptors was found to facilitate the AKT-mediated activation of MDM two. Concomitant with the function of beta-arrestin-one as a molecular scaffold facilitating the binding of MDM two to P fifty-three, this molecular mechanism altogether leads to the suppression of P fifty-three levels and subsequent accumulation of DNA damage. This finding coupled with observations that activation of the Gas PKA signaling axis can lead to DNA damage via the generation of reactive oxidative species, highlights the complex interrelationship between GPCR, G-protein and beta-arrestin-mediated cellular dynamics controlling DNA damage and integrity.\ni9k5 | The tumor suppressive capacity of GPCRs has also been linked to DNA protective effects. For example, inactivating polymorphisms in the melanocortin one receptor, MCR one, have been found to promote melanoma through an ultraviolet radiation independent mechanism. Indeed, disruptive germline variant alleles in the MCR one gene, collectively referred to as R alleles, are associated with significantly increased somatic mutation burden in melanoma. Aligned with this, activation of MCR one by alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone has an antioxidant effect by promoting the phosphorylation and stabilization of P fifty-three, and an increase in expression of base excision repair enzymes. In another case, ADGR B one, also known as BAI one, has been found to have potent antiangiogenic and antitumorigenic functions, particularly in brain tumors. Strikingly, BAI one has been shown to prevent MDM two-mediated P fifty-three degradation, and BAI one loss leads to a significant decrease in P fifty-three levels. The protective effect of BAI one on P fifty-three degradation is a remarkable illustration of the diverse roles that GPCRs can play in tumorigenesis.\n20z2 | A\n4cgs | GPCRs and Cell Death Resistance\nhtre | Parallel to driving cancer initiation, GPCR and G-protein-driven signaling has been found to contribute to resistance to cell death, particularly driving chemoresistance in a broad range of cancers. One of the most outstanding examples has been in BCC, which are driven by overactive hedgehog signaling through the SMO GPCR. Vismodegib, is an FDA-approved SMO inhibitor that is used in the treatment of advanced BCC; however, acquired resistance is a common challenge. Interestingly, while many cancer types are able to subvert multiple signaling pathways to maintain cancer progression in spite of targeted therapies, BCC have been found to be exclusively dependent on hedgehog signaling for growth. As such, reactivation of hedgehog signaling is a significant driver for BCC drug resistance. Hedgehog pathway inhibitors are under current investigation to combat BCC resistance to vismodegib.\nda3c | GPCR signaling has also been found to drive resistance in melanoma. In an open reading frame screen designed to assess drivers of resistance to MAPK inhibition in a BRAF V six hundred E mutant melanoma cell line, GPCRs emerged as the highest ranked class of resistance-driving proteins. GPCR signaling-related proteins, such as guanine exchange factors, RASGRP two to four and VAV one were also found to be potent effectors of resistance. Similarly, genome-scale approaches to determining drivers of resistance to BRAF inhibition in melanoma revealed that four of the top ten hits were GPCRs: GPR thirty-five, LPAR one, LPAR five, and P two RY eight.\njomo | Interestingly, both RGS proteins and GBy subunits have been implicated as drivers of drug resistance to cancer therapy. Loss of RGS six has been found to significantly impair doxorubicin-mediated cell death in vitro, and in vivo . Similarly, loss of RGS ten and RGS seventeen have been found to contribute to chemoresistance in ovarian cancer. Mutations in G beta proteins have also been found to be broad and potent drivers of drug resistance among several cancer types. In comparative whole exome sequencing of drug-sensitive and drug-resistant ETV six ABL one positive leukemia cells, GNB one was among the most significantly mutated genes. In particular, mutation of GNB one at K eighty-nine was found to drive resistance to tyrosine-kinase inhibitors independent of the targeted kinase by induction of PI three K and MAPK signaling. Outstandingly, in several different in vitro models, ectopic expression of patient-derived G beta mutants but not wild-type G beta, rendered cells resistant to targeted kinase inhibitors, including imatinib, nilotinib, and ruxolitinib, highlighting the potent effect of G beta mutations. The broad induction of resistance to kinase inhibitors mediated by G beta mutations may represent a previously underappreciated mechanism\n06fi | of resistance that has yet to be fully explored clinically and mechanistically and could provide novel strategies for the treatment of drug-resistant cancers.\nhb4s | GPCRs and Deregulation of Cellular Energetics\ncqq2 | Metabolic reprogramming, from the enzyme level to the global proteome, occurs in cancer to meet the metabolic demands underlying unrestrained cell growth. GPCRs are critical regulators of numerous components of normal metabolism, including glucose and glucagon homeostasis, insulin regulation, and lipogenesis, as well as being key players in adaptive metabolic mechanisms. Moreover, many metabolic products and by-products are the cognate ligands for GPCRs. As such, various metabolite-binding GPCRs play a significant role in tumor promotion through both autocrine and paracrine mechanisms that contribute to control tumor energetic dynamics.\n1ews | The lactate-binding GPR eighty-one has been found to be significantly upregulated in numerous cancer types and to be a crucial driver of tumor growth and metastasis with further roles modulating the tumor microenvironment in angiogenesis and immune evasion. Similarly GPR ninety-one, which binds succinate, has significant roles in modulation of the tumor-immune microenvironment, as well as angiogenesis, together with its role in cellular metabolism.\n\n",
