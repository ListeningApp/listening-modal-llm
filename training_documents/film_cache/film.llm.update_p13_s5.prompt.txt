You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

ywxn | There appears to be an unspoken belief in the Hollywood film industry that somehow male-centred narratives are universally entertaining, or inherently more valuable and/or more lucrative than female-centred narratives which are seen as peculiar or of limited interest to the broad majority of viewers. This claim, of course, presupposes that certain types of narrative are inherently 'masculine' while others are 'feminine'. For example, action adventure is thought of as an essentially male genre, while romantic comedies are often described as 'chick flicks'. Tom Digby suggests that romantic comedies arise as social means of reinforcing gender oppositionality, which in turn serves the social function of reinforcing heterosexuality. The same gender oppositionality that ensures we are attracted to the opposite sex, by exaggerating the differences between men and women (and then eroticising them), also produces inter-gender mystification, which, says Digby, 'is sure to result in enough mutual aggravation between females and males to strongly reinforce oppositionality between them' (Digby 1998: 25). In other words, while romantic comedies appear only to comment upon pre-existing gender oppositionality, they in fact help to create it.
uxhs | The question for feminist film studies students is whether categorising films into 'male' and 'female' genres has to do with what real men and women enjoy, or whether different genres themselves represent stereotypes of men and women in ways that are flattering to one sex more than another. In other words, do the films create the gender-specific audiences (by appealing to, and reinforcing, social stereotypes), or are the films a mere reflection of the way nature has made us? Would male audiences still love science fiction films if the majority of them featured a central female heroine who (1) faces a threatening female/alien villain, and (2) has

onum | Would female audiences raised from childhood on strong, active, powerful images of women be different kinds of women? Would they have different expectations and tastes in the kind of 'entertainment' they consume? Would the target audience for Hollywood movies suddenly become 16-24-year-old females, who grow ever more confident in themselves and have ever more spending power? Would women suddenly be the main consumers of films in the science fiction genre? If females controlled Hollywood, is this what most science fiction films would look like? Would females actually have an opportunity to control Hollywood, because they (and their male peers) had been raised watching empowering images of females, and denigrating images of males? These are dangerous questions, because they hint at the social power interests that lie behind our myth-making industries.
3iir | Within the film industry, the 'target audience' for big budget films is generally 16-24 -year-old males. It is as though there is some unwritten rule that says stories of interest to this group are the ones with widest human appeal.
7a0a | The paucity of female directors is such that the title 'director' has become a gendered term, associated with males in the same way that the word 'surgeon' or 'pilot' or 'millionaire' connotes masculinity, although 'male' is not part of the definition of any of these terms. We do not have to specify that a director is male by adding a prefix ('male director') because the director's masculinity has become normalised, or assumed. However, we do not find it unusual to speak of 'female directors'. Here the prefix is needed to set female directors apart from the norm. Feminist theorist Claire Johnston (1980: 34) has pointed out that the female within patriarchy is seen as the irrevocable 'other'. Masculinity is the tacit 'norm' from which all deviations are defined as 'other' or 'less'.
o1qp | The film director works very closely with a whole team of specialists (screenwriters, set designers, production managers, casting agents, actors, stunt men and women, editors, composers, make-up artists, effects specialists, etc.) who together collaborate to produce the final product, but the director is seen as the creator, the mastermind behind the magical process that results in the cinematic event - the final movie. As Sarah Gilligan has pointed out, 'this magical process can be seen to be coded as male' (Gilligan 2003: 16).
jrik | John Berger
xv78 | First published in 1972, John Berger's Ways of Seeing was one of the twentieth century's most influential books on art. Because it appears that Berger's insights provide much of the groundwork for later feminist theorists, including Laura Mulvey, I have decided to include some of his insights in this book. Ways of Seeing was based on the BBC television series of the same name, in which Berger began to start a

y8fb | process of questioning art, and the constructed meanings that images convey.
521q | For the teacher of feminist film studies the most important chapter in Berger's book is Chapter 3, dealing with the female nude. The chapter is made up of both text and images. It would be worthwhile to assign this chapter in its entirety. Alternatively, or to supplement this chapter, teachers could show a video of the BBC programme which treats this chapter as a discrete unit.
yogo | Berger examines the usage and conventions of the European oil painting from about the late fifteenth century, in which women were the principal and ever- recurring subject. What follows is a summary of Berger's essay.
2285 | He begins by noting that the social presence of a woman is different in kind from that of a man. A man's presence depends upon the 'promise of power' which he embodies. This power may be:
ys0g | · Moral.
7zvp | · Physical.
ww6u | · Temperamental.
hpi6 | · Economic.
4uhb | · Social.
epyi | · Sexual.
y51p | The object of man's power is external to himself - a power which he exerts on others. A woman's presence expresses her own attitude to herself and defines what can and cannot be done to her. Presence to a woman is so intrinsic to her person (as an object of men's actions) that men tend to equate it with her body. To be born a woman is to be born into the keeping of men. We can still see vestiges of this in the traditional Christian wedding ceremony, in which the father, having been asked by the groom for permission to marry his daughter, officially 'gives her away' to the keeping of her husband.
x95m | A woman must continually watch herself. She is almost continually accompanied by her own image of herself. From earliest childhood, she has been taught and persuaded to survey herself continually. The surveyor and the surveyed within her are the two constituent elements of her identity as a woman. Her own sense of being in herself is supplanted by a sense of being appreciated as herself by another. Men survey women before treating them. This determines not only most relations between men and women, but also the relation of women to themselves. To recap:
yfum | · Men act and women appear.
ppx4 | . Men look at women.
qf11 | · Women watch themselves being looked at.
