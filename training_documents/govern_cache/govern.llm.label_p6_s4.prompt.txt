You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

y4mj | Process Effectiveness
vpgq | A way of thinking that appeals to many administrators, lawyers, and political scientists treats effectiveness as a matter of the extent to which the provisions of an international regime are implemented in the domestic legal and political systems of the member states as well as the extent to which those subject to a regime's prescriptions actually comply with their requirements.4 This approach has the virtue of suggesting relatively straightforward procedures for measurement. It is easy enough to determine whether individual states have ratified conventions or treaties setting forth the provisions of regimes and

m4ju | Effectiveness
a0mb | passed implementing legislation to put these provisions into practice within their own jurisdictions. An account of the extent to which such actions have led, in turn, to the promulgation of more detailed regu- lations designed to transform the provisions of a regime into a day-to- day routine is ordinarily feasible as well. Though monitoring compli- ance is apt to be a more complex process, there is little ambiguity at the conceptual level about what is at stake in such an approach to the assessment of effectiveness.
ki8m | But what is the relationship between this conception of effective- ness as a political process centering on implementation and compli- ance and effectiveness in any of the previous senses? Although imple- mentation and compliance are undoubtedly necessary to solving problems and attaining goals, the links between these measures and the other conceptions of effectiveness are far from straightforward. Perfect compliance is not sufficient to solve problems when key provi- sions of a regime are either inadequate or inappropriate. During the early years of the whaling regime, for example, compliance was high, but the International Whaling Commission set quotas for the harvest- ing of whales that were not restrictive enough to ensure the recovery of key stocks. Conversely, problem solving can occur even when levels of implementation and compliance are far from perfect. If the move to phase out the use of CFCs convinces the principal producers of these chemicals to close out their production lines and replace them with more benign substitutes, the problem of protecting the ozone layer from further damage may be effectively solved, even if some states participating in the arrangement are somewhat lax in imple- menting the rules of the regime. The potential for divergences be- tween process effectiveness and behavioral effectiveness is even more apparent. Some shifts in behavior (for example, investments in ad- vanced technologies on the part of those holding fishing permits) are clearly intended to soften the impact of a regime's rules without actu- ally violating the rules. Other behavioral changes (for instance, in- creased efforts to harvest alternative species or to market unregulated chemicals) are not captured in statistics relating to implementation and compliance at all, though they may well be consequences of the establishment and operation of a regime.
km8w | Constitutive Effectiveness
wzno | Quite apart from its success in solving problems or facilitating the attainment of goals, a regime may be effective in constitutive terms in
xagm | 147
iwn5 | INTERNATIONAL GOVERNANCE
uooz | the sense that its formation gives rise to a social practice involving the expenditure of time, energy, and resources on the part of its mem- bers.5 The Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings (ATCMs) and the activities they trigger, for example, have become a significant focus of attention for a number of parties even though the Antarctic regime is a rather modest international institution. The International Whaling Commission may or may not succeed in its efforts to protect stocks of certain species of whales, but participation in the political processes centered on the activities of the commission has become a major concern for countries including both the United States, which gener- ally opposes the consumptive use of whales, and Japan and Norway, which have consistently resisted efforts to terminate consumptive use. It may well be that one of the factors that ultimately sank the regime for deep seabed mining articulated in Part XI of the 1982 Convention on the Law of the Sea was a reluctance on the part of some countries to commit themselves to a process that would have required the in- vestment of considerable energy and resources on an ongoing basis.
pxbq | Constitutive effectiveness differs, sometimes dramatically, from the other conceptions of effectiveness under consideration here. A social practice may flourish in the sense that it absorbs a sizable fraction of the attention and resources of those participating in it-it may even play a role in defining their identity-without becoming effective in the sense that its operation either solves the problem that stimulated its creation or attains the goals articulated by its founders.6 This is, in fact, a central theme of the growing literature on government or nonmarket failure treated as a counterpart to market failure.7 As experience with a variety of regimes dealing with the conservation or preservation of renewable resources (for example, stocks of fish or marine mammals) attests, this phenomenon is just as common in in- ternational society as it is in other social settings. Nor does the emer- gence of a social practice consuming significant amounts of time and energy offer any guarantee that parties will act to implement a re-

u15r | Effectiveness
lq35 | gime's key provisions within their domestic jurisdictions or to ensure high levels of compliance with a regime's central rules. It is easy enough to find examples of this phenomenon involving natural re- sources and the environment; one good example is the problems of ensuring compliance with the rules of the CITES regime in a wide variety of domestic settings. But the classic examples of the phenome- non in international society undoubtedly occur in connection with regimes dealing with arms control and the protection of human rights.
3g9w | Evaluative Effectiveness
d09o | For many observers, effectiveness is fundamentally a matter of per- formance rather than a simple measure of the consequences flowing from the operation of governance systems. Those who take this view generally do not ask whether a regime makes a difference in some generic sense. Instead, they want to know whether the regime pro- duces results that are efficient, equitable, sustainable, or robust.8 Spe- cifically, the question is not just whether the whaling regime is suc- ceeding in its effort to conserve whale stocks but whether it is operating in a cost-effective manner in the sense that comparable results could not be achieved at a lower cost or superior results achieved at a comparable cost by substituting some other institutional arrangements. The same is true regarding the extent to which the outcomes generated by international regimes (for example, the al- location of broadcast frequencies or the distribution of benefits flow- ing from the harvest of fish) are just or fair, either in end-state or in procedural terms.9 Rapid changes involving international environ- mental problems (for instance, ozone depletion or climate change) have led many recent observers to place increased emphasis on adaptability to changing conditions as a performance criterion in as- sessing the effectiveness of regimes.10
ylhz | Evaluative effectiveness taps a set of concerns that differ from
a3td | 149
ex5k | INTERNATIONAL GOVERNANCE
9d4o | those underlying the conceptions above. A regime that is generally effective in solving a well-defined problem (for example, avoiding severe depletions of fish or animal stocks) may seem to many to oper- ate in a manner that is inefficient, inequitable, or both. What is more, a regime that seems effective under current conditions may prove brittle in the face of relatively modest changes in the character of the problem (for instance, the emergence of new entrants or new harvest- ing technologies). If anything, the link between goal attainment and these performance criteria is even more tenuous. Although the ozone regime may set in motion a process leading relatively quickly to the phasing out of most uses of CFCs, for instance, there is ample room for questioning both the efficiency and the fairness of a process that relies on a (largely) uniform formula calling for equal percentage cuts in the consumption of CFCs. The distinction between evaluative ef- fectiveness and constitutive effectiveness is even more dramatic. A regime is effective in the constitutive sense when it gives rise to a social practice that becomes a major focus of attention for its mem- bers. There is nothing in this conception that requires a strong per- formance with regard to criteria of efficiency and equity.
cjq2 | So far, I have taken pains not only to differentiate several dimen- sions of effectiveness but also to show that there is no basis for assum- ing that the different dimensions will co-vary in any simple or easily predictable manner. Yet this does not preclude the occurrence of interaction effects among the various dimensions in the sense that developments in some areas have discernible impacts on develop- ments in others. Perhaps the most important of these interaction effects for scholars and practitioners interested in international envi- ronmental regimes are those involving causal links between effective- ness as problem solving on the one hand and effectiveness as goal attainment and process effectiveness on the other. For the most part, actors in international society are motivated to form regimes as a response to the emergence of more or less acute problems such as the progressive depletion of commercially valuable fish stocks, the real- ization that species playing central roles in important ecosystems may go extinct, or the anticipated consequences of a serious thinning of the protective layer of stratospheric ozone. In endeavoring to solve these problems, however, actors ordinarily specify goals (for example, a 30 percent reduction in sulfur dioxide emissions or a phase-out of the production of CFCs) and then devise sets of rules and policy
5esx | Effectiveness
m5ka | instruments intended to bring behavior into line with the attainment of these goals. No doubt, such responses can and sometimes do serve to solve the problems that provoke them. But there is no guarantee that this will be the case. A 30 percent reduction in sulfur dioxide emissions may accompany or even cause a rise in emissions of other substances that are equally disruptive to the natural environment. Irreparable damage to the ozone layer may occur before the con- sumption of CFCs ceases. Though the emphasis that students of ef- fectiveness place on implementation and compliance is perfectly un- derstandable, therefore, the results should not be treated as a substitute for undertaking the more challenging task of investigating such matters as the causal links between process effectiveness and effectiveness as problem solving.
byu8 | Whatever their effectiveness in the realm of intended conse- quences, international regimes-like all other governance systems- also produce side effects, results that their creators neither intend nor foresee at the time of their establishment. Sometimes side effects take the form of unforeseen distributive consequences as in the case of windfall profits accruing to those who receive tradable pollution rights or permits in an initial distribution or to those in possession of stocks of tradable goods following a decision to phase out future production. In other cases, side effects involve the operation of an institutional arrangement itself as in the case of the unforeseen cap- ture of a regulatory system by those it is intended to regulate. Given the recent rise in levels of interdependence in international society, it is to be expected that side effects will become more ubiquitous in connection with the operation of international regimes and that these effects will often initiate chain reactions of considerable magnitude. As in other realms, there is an understandable tendency to focus on negative side effects in thinking about the unintended consequences flowing from the establishment and operation of international re- gimes. Yet these side effects clearly constitute a subset of the broader category of externalities, which suggests that we should be open to the prospect of positive as well as negative side effects. Both those re- sponsible for designing international regimes and those seeking to provide overall assessments of their performance will surely want to be alert to the prospect of significant side effects. In individual cases, the impact of the relevant side effects may equal or even exceed the magnitude of the intended effects attributable to the operation of

zxz6 | international regimes, a fact that should give pause to regime enthusi- asts who advocate the creation of new institutions as a solution to every problem.11
xnth | DETERMINANTS OF EFFECTIVENESS
vafm | No doubt, our conceptions of effectiveness will continue to evolve as we conduct studies of the workings of specific international envi- ronmental regimes. But it is appropriate, at this stage, to turn to the other side of the equation, initiating an inquiry into the factors that operate as determinants of the effectiveness of governance systems in international society. The principal issue here centers on the tension between parsimony and explanatory power. Single-factor accounts are appealing both because they lend themselves to articulation in the form of necessary or sufficient conditions and because they hold the promise of reducing seemingly complex realities to a set of relatively simple and comprehensible propositions. In the social sciences, how- ever, such accounts seldom fare well when they are tested against evidence derived from empirical observations. As a result, analysts typically find themselves fashioning explanatory accounts that include two or more independent variables and seeking to specify the rela- tionships obtaining between or among these variables. There is no reason to expect studies of the determinants of institutional effective- ness to prove exceptional. Even so, differentiation of the types or categories of independent variables will provide a helpful backdrop for the growing body of case studies carried out by scholars working in this field.
2zmw | One approach to this issue that will appeal to practitioners turns on the distinction between decision variables and structural variables. Decision variables are factors subject to conscious control or manipu- lation on the part of those responsible for designing and managing international regimes. The institutional arrangements embedded in governance systems (for example, their membership, decision-making procedures, and compliance mechanisms) belong to this category. Structural variables are features of the larger physical, biological, or
bf9k | Effectiveness
otkr | social environment (for example, the distribution of power in interna- tional society) that are not subject to conscious control within any policy-relevant time frame. The study of decision variables holds an obvious attraction for those interested in the effectiveness of interna- tional regimes because it is easy to see ways to apply the findings of such research both to the management of existing institutions and to the design of new governance systems. Yet a note of caution is in order here. International governance systems are, for the most part, complex social institutions whose operation is not well understood. Nothing is more common than the establishment of regimes that prove ineffective in practice because they are based on premises that are either wrong or not applicable to the situation at hand.12 By the same token, studies of structural determinants of effectiveness are by no means irrelevant from the point of view of those charged with establishing or managing international regimes. Practitioners who understand the key structural factors will surely have an advantage when creating regimes that are well-adapted to the environment in which they are expected to operate.
ibgs | For analytic purposes, however, there is much to be said for a re- lated distinction that separates endogenous variables, exogenous vari- ables, and what I call linkage variables. Those who focus on endoge- nous variables seek to account for variations in the effectiveness of international governance systems by examining the character of the institutional arrangements themselves. The category of exogenous variables, by contrast, encompasses an array of physical, biological, and social conditions that make up the environment in which an international regime operates. Linkage variables have to do with the fit between the institutional character of a governance system and the environment in which it is expected to function.
colo | Endogenous Variables
d6r4 | There is, to begin with, a debate concerning the extent to which international regimes require the services of organizations (in the sense of material entities possessing offices, personnel, equipment, budgets, and legal personality) to function effectively. Those who approach the issue from the perspective of business administration or
9mrz | 153
pk06 | INTERNATIONAL GOVERNANCE
7wn9 | public administration, whose primary concern is the performance of organizations, exhibit a tendency to shift the focus of analysis from the effectiveness of international regimes to the effectiveness of inter- national organizations.13 This is, in my view, a mistake. With all due respect for the roles organizations play, there is great variation among international governance systems in the extent to which their opera- tion requires the services of some administrative apparatus, and there is no obvious correlation between the presence of organizations and the effectiveness of regimes. As numerous observers have pointed out, moreover, both material and intangible costs are associated with the operation of organizations, which suggests the value of a close examination of the factors that determine when and what sort of organizations are required to make international regimes effective.
