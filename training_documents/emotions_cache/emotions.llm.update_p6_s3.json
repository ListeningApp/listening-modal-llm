        "content": "favz | Control Clip\n7szx | Left four one right equals six point six zero, eta naught squared equals point one four, P equals point zero one four. The main effect of clip was qualified by a Clip times Emo interaction, F left one, forty-one right equals sixteen point seven zero, eta P squared equals point two nine, P is less than point zero zero one. Follow-up t tests indicated that the bittersweet clip elicited more sadness than the control clip, t left forty-one right equals four point zero eight, D equals one point two five, P is less than point zero zero one, but no more happiness,\nhx9e | t left forty-one right equals negative zero point one six, D equals zero point zero five, P equals point eight seven. We measured whether each subject simultaneously pressed both buttons at each point in time. We guarded against the possibility that subjects briefly pressed both buttons inadvertently by excluding those episodes that lasted less than one second. As shown in Figure four, subjects rarely reported mixed emotions during either clip; the incidence of mixed emotions never exceeded forty percent in either clip. This is not surprising because even the E S M contends that mixed emotions are rare and because the bittersweet clip contains many unambiguously pleasant or unpleas-\nywn2 | ant scenes that were intended to set the stage for bittersweet scenes. Nevertheless, Figure four suggests that subjects may have reported more mixed emotions during the bittersweet clip than during the control clip.\na63r | MIXED EMOTIONS\ndqvj | To quantify the amount of mixed emotions reported by each subject, we computed how much time each subject pressed both buttons at the same time. These distributions are shown in Figure five. The overall distribution was J-shaped with a mode of zero and could not be transformed into a normal distribution. Thus, we analyzed the data with the Mann-Whitney test, which is a non-parametric equivalent of a t test and compares distributions of ranked values obtained from two independent samples. The Mann-Whitney test revealed that subjects who watched the bittersweet clip reported more mixed emotions (Mdn equals zero point four one minutes, MRank equals twenty-eight point two) than those who watched the control clip (Mdn equals zero point zero zero minutes, MRank equals sixteen point one; U equals one hundred one point zero, z equals three point five two, PSest equals point two two, p is less than point zero zero one). This finding provides evidence from online continuous measures against the vacillation hypothesis and for the contention that people can feel happy and sad at the same time.\nr17u | Study point one b: The Continuous Evaluative Space Grid\n3c47 | The goals of Study point one b were to provide a second test of the vacillation hypothesis and extend Study point one a by measuring happi-\ng345 | ness and sadness with the continuous evaluative space grid (E S G), which provides continuous online measures of positivity and negativity that are graded, as opposed to dichotomous. With the continuous E S G, subjects move the cursor left and right along a computerized grid's x-axis to report changes in their positivity and up and down along its y-axis to report changes in their negativity. The edges of the grid represent the experience of positivity or negativity in isolation; the interior represents coactivation of positivity and negativity.\nsvhz | Duncan, Barrett, and Russell had subjects complete the continuous E S G as they simultaneously viewed emotionally evocative pictures and listened to evocative music. Subjects rarely moved the cursor into the grid's interior when presented with music and pictures of opposite valence, which Duncan et al. interpreted as evidence against the possibility that people can feel mixed emotions of happiness and sadness. If Duncan et al.'s results constitute evidence against mixed emotions, the finding that subjects spend more time in the grid's interior during the bittersweet clip from Life Is Beautiful than during the control clip would constitute evidence for mixed emotions. We examined this possibility in Study point one b.\noaen | Method. Subjects were thirty-nine University of Colorado, Boulder, undergraduates (twenty women; fifty-one percent).\n5u67 | Subjects were seated in separate cubicles and randomly assigned to watch the bittersweet clip left n equals seventeen right or the control clip left n equals twenty-two right. Computerized instructions provided the cover story and informed subjects how to indicate how happy and how sad they felt by moving the mouse along the x- and y-axes of a five by five continuous E S G, respectively. The left (top), middle (middle), and bottom (right) cells on the x-axis (y-axis) were labeled \"not at all,\" \"moderately,\" and \"extremely,\" respectively. Happiness and sadness ratings ranging from zero to four were collected every five hundred milliseconds.\ndvms | Results. To quantify the degree to which each subject experienced mixed emotions, we computed the minimum of each subject's happiness and sadness ratings during each sample of the clip (i.e., MIN Happy, Sad). MIN scores provide a graded index of mixed emotions by taking on values of zero when subjects indicate feeling exclusively happy, exclusively sad, or neutral but higher values when subjects indicate feeling both happy and sad. To guard against the possibility that subjects briefly crossed through the interior in transit between the exclusively happy and exclusively sad portions of the grid, we set MIN values to zero if the excursion into the interior lasted less than one point five seconds. As in Study point one a, a Mann-Whitney test revealed that subjects who watched the bittersweet clip reported more intense mixed emotions left Mdn equals zero point three six, \nM Rank equals twenty-six point six right than those who watched the control clip",
