        "content": "0myz | In actual fact, research in less developed countries has revealed many of these arguments to be fallacious. Far from being excluded and sluggish, the informal land market is quite dynamic, with free exchange (sales) of land and dwelling units. This is because the very informality and poorly serviced nature of the land makes housing affordable in the first place. Moreover, far from being outside the market as some would argue, informal housing is actually firmly commodified within the marketplace, albeit a less regulated one. Nor is it axiomatic that only full legality and secure property titles prime the marketplace: in both formal and informal land markets regulation and restrictions may also severely inhibit property development, as\nxh3i | well as preventing the creation of activities such as renting, the creation of jobs and income-earning opportunities, sometimes referred to by international aid organisations as urban productivity. Indeed, greater regulation in the formal market often severely restricts its operation-hence the somewhat perverse and simultaneous argument by these same authors for the need to deregulate. Nor does it appear that legal title per se raises land prices significantly, although some assert otherwise. As for the poor using the property as collateral to secure credit for home improvements, this would appear to be primarily a middle-class projection, since most low-income households eschew formal credit. Even though NGOs and government departments have moved towards micro-credit support in recent years, they often do not require full legal title as a criterion for a loan.\nsyiw | This research notwithstanding, within the United States and elsewhere many still believe that clean property title is an essential element to effective participation in the marketplace. Only by holding legal title to their land can homesteaders become true players and beneficiaries of the market: the nub of the Mystery of Capital extolled by de Soto and his adherents. They argue that by having full legal title to their land and home, property values will no longer be depressed by illegality, and lots and homes can be freely traded in the marketplace, making people more mobile. In short, regularisation and legalisation enhance bootstraps programmes, foster mobility, help to build wealth and allow people to leverage capital using their property as collateral. However, such broad-brush propositions beg many questions and there is a rising body of research that questions these assertions from both the perspective of theoretical logic, as well as empirical practice. At best such assertions are overdrawn and at worst they are gravely misleading.\nkg3t | This article analyses the intersection between land titling programmes and land market behaviour and performance. However, unlike other research that derives almost exclusively from less developed countries, this research reports on similar low-income land and housing markets that exist in the United States, analysing specifically the phenomenon of peri-urban irregular settlements outside Rio Grande City, located in Starr County, on the Texas-Mexico border. Drawing upon detailed land market research and survey data collected as part of a formal evaluation of a major land title programme in Rio Grande City, we analyse and track land price changes in several low-income self-managed housing neighbourhoods for the period nineteen seventy to two thousand one. This allows us to evaluate the impact of land titling programmes upon a number of possible outcomes for market performance: land and home affordability; and the opportunity and extent of wealth creation among impoverished households. The article further explores the apparent determinants of land price differences and changes over time, and compares conventional explanations that attribute land values to variables such as location, level of servicing and settlement layout, with alternative explanations that give greater credence to what we will call social determinants such as the nature of lot sale and development entrained by individual developers, and their social relations with low-income populations.\nlvae | At this lowest end of the land market, we conclude that land prices are fixed socially more by the idiosyncrasy of the developer, and not by differences in location or level of servicing. And while it may still be too early to be definitive, the evidence and prima facie findings that we present here suggest that there is little positive direct relationship between land title regularisation, rising property values and turnover of lots through the marketplace. For a raft of other reasons, the market is stunted and, while land titling programmes do change the status of the way in which land is perceived and held by low-income residents, by itself title does little either to enhance directly valorisation and\no9sc | wealth creation, or to shape demand and property transfers. The lack of demand and the minimal opportunities for selling one's lot and home in the marketplace, effectively impede any significant opportunities for wealth creation. True, colonia residence offers important use value to the populations, but to date the ability of low-income and now legal property owners to capture any significant increase in the exchange value is severely inhibited. And this bears little or no relation to whether or not the property is titled.\n121u | Colonias in Texas and the Land Titling Programme in Starr County\nzh03 | Before analysing the specifics of land development and land market practices in the study areas, it is important to outline briefly the nature of irregular settlement development and self-help in Texas and elsewhere in the United States, not least since few researchers are aware of the widespread existence of settlements that are so closely akin to their Latin American and Mexican counterparts. In Texas alone, an estimated one-half a million people, almost exclusively of Mexican origin, live in some sixteen hundred plus settlements or colonias as they are more generally known; while significant additional numbers of people also live in colonia-type sub-divisions in other border states such as New Mexico and Arizona. While significantly different in many important respects from their Mexican counterparts (not discussed here), the formation of these settlements responds to a similar logic-namely, rapid urban and population growth, a context of little or no public housing supply and low state support for other low-income housing opportunities. Although illegal, they are effectively the only route that poor households have if they are to embark upon home-ownership, build a home and create a family patrimony, all within a context of poverty and low-wage economies, without access to",
