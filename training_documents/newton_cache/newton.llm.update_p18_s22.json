However, T is bounded above by D. For this reason, in the sequel, bar Varsigma equals left parenthesis D plus one right parenthesis Varsigma for some Varsigma is greater than zero. Indeed, this choice implies that, under the conditions of Lemma B point one, for any\ny2tz | V in calligraphic K sub T left parenthesis H comma G right parenthesis we have left angle bracket V comma H V right angle bracket is greater than or equal to Varsigma norm V norm squared, twenty-five\np769 | We now demonstrate that the line search procedure eleven terminates for a small enough step size.\njhwn | Lemma B point two Step-size Lower Bound. Suppose F satisfies Assumption three point one.

We note that the proof of Lemma C point one utilises no curvature properties of the residual. With this fact in mind, the proof is entirely the same as Lemma C point one in Appendix C with Varsigma taking the place of O.\n7nda | The following lemma gives the amount of decrease obtained from the inactive set step whenever the inactive set is nonempty and the inactive set termination condition seven C is not satisfied.\n4pv9 | Lemma B point three Sufficient Decrease: Inactive Set Case.
